cameras but not in the way that we would
expect Apple is apparently focusing on
their LCD models this year and have
great expectations for it and a one plus
six keeps on breaking sales records
believe it or not I'm Jaime Mehta leave
it up the bad news it's it's Monday the
good news is I'm back from Studio number
two this is pocket house daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for an iPhone 10
AT&amp;amp;T is probably your best bet because
if you get yourself an iPhone 10 at full
price right now with a specific
installment plan you can learn more
about it in the description you actually
get another 64 gigabyte iPhone 10 there
is a ton of catches though again
description you can learn more there now
let's talk about YouTube as a the
company has decided to revamp everything
once again they are changing the whole
concept of YouTube music YouTube red
into something called YouTube premium
that begins today I'm still kind of
confused as to what the differences are
I actually don't notice anything other
than just to change a naming scheme and
the fact that YouTube premium now also
gives you access to YouTube music in
addition to other things
yeah I'm still not a fan of the service
the only reason I have YouTube red is
because of Cobra Kai by the way which is
awesome but anyways now let's talk about
the 1 plus 6 for those of you wondering
exactly how well the company is doing
from what I heard in the briefing their
strategy was going well and it's been
confirmed right now as the company has
sold 1 million units in 22 days just to
give you a little perspective the 5 T
took pretty much three months to sell
that same amount of units and the same
went for the 5 so it seems the strategy
is working and it seems a lot of people
are not caring about their notches now
let's talk about Apple as well we've
heard all the rumors of the iPhone 10
2018 going three variants one of these
being LCD for those of you wondering
when is it gonna go full OLED apparently
that's gonna happen until 2020 but
interesting apparently Apple is making a
lot more orders for the LCD iPhone than
they are for the OLED variants according
to sources the company has a lot more
expectations for this LCD iPhone for
reasons we don't yet
understand obviously we'll have to wait
until rumors continue evolving but yeah
the LCD iPhone apparently the company is
bidding a lot on this phone and that's
gonna be the affordable variant and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with the Google pixel 3 XL for those
of you wondering exactly what is going
to change about this phone to make it in
Excel apparently it's just gonna be the
size yet again mainly because well we
saw the leaked renders and the leaked
photos where the glass pack only had one
single camera now we've got case makers
and once you involve case makers this is
not necessarily set in stone but close
where apparently yes we're getting dual
cameras at the front the reasons we
don't understand we cover those rumors
weeks ago and yes just a single camera
we were hoping that the single camera
was going to be for the regular pixel 3
and then the pixel 3 XL would bring
something different but anyways in
today's question let us know I mean do
you think that it's smart for Google to
stick to the just one camera plan I was
shocked and what the company did last
year with the pixel to Excel but that
was before the Huawei P 20 Pro that's my
opinion it's it's really hard for you to
compete when another company brings so
much hardware to the table but then
again that's my opinion leave us a
comment down below we would love to know
yours friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us I'm talking
