Galaxy Note 7 was the biggest story of
2016 a recall which made us all question
whether Samsung could continue this line
of devices would the note name be
forever linked with catastrophic failure
few tech commentators could have
predicted how well Samsung would weather
this crisis there was very little
migration to competing devices most no
customers opting to stay in the Galaxy
ecosystem there's no mystery now Samsung
will continue to produce a phablet with
a stylus and will still call it a note
the label is alive and one phone failure
proved insufficient to completely tank
the brand not to say that Samsung
doesn't have some rebuilding to do the
big screen phones are no longer a
novelty
since the galaxy s6 we've had numerous
options for folks who want the
multimedia prowess and were less likely
to use features like s-pen there's
market research to suggest that many no
customers only wanted the big screen and
rarely if ever touched the stylus in the
absence of a note 7 those consumers were
well served by the s Evan edge and later
the Galaxy S 8 plus and maybe that's a
good thing the tic-tock feature updates
on the note were out of order on the
note 5 and note 7 the phone released in
the second half of the year used to be
the bolder Vanguard product if there
were exciting improvements the note
would get them first the note 7 didn't
deliver quite the same boundary-pushing
excitement the display was a touch
larger camera and lifestyle features
like water resistance followed the
Galaxy s7 and with a slightly smaller
battery in tow the new additions were
appreciated but further pointed to the
note as a niche productivity device we
got USB see the s-pen was also made
water-resistant and the note 7 was our
first glimpse at enhanced security
features like iris scanning there's no
doubt that the note 7 still would have
been declared the best phone of 2016 the
most complete business grade mobile work
and entertainment device
at that point even without the recall
though we have to wonder if the power of
the note was already waning being the
most complete option means diminishing
returns for people who don't need all
the bells and whistles prices on
flagship phones creeping ever higher
plenty of options for folks who want
bigger displays and tons of competition
at lower price points for people who
want to focus on a key feature like
battery life or camera tech will luxury
and status be enough to carry any
expensive smartphone brand in the future
it's tough not feeling a little deflated
we had a lot planned for the Galaxy Note
7 comparisons camera and audio
examinations using it as a platform to
talk about apps and updates even
revisiting it to shoot and after the
buds we expect to have a relationship
with each phone we review and we were
left in the lurch on this one no other
device rose to the occasion no other
phone filled the void left by this one
handset over the next fiscal quarters
we'll get to see how damaged the note
name might be if consumers come back to
embrace the most expensive phone in
Samsung's lineup but holding a note 7
again it really was a shame we didn't
get to do more with it as always thanks
so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for our full
Galaxy Note 8 coverage we'll be on the
ground in New York for the press
conference and we'll have a lot to talk
about for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag

Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video
