pocket now calm here at CES from Las
Vegas in the Samsung booth where Samsung
has been kind enough to provide us with
a food production versions of their new
mid-range device for verizon their first
windows phone 8 device announced for the
United States Khatib Odyssey let's check
it out
so as we say this is a mid-range device
as you can see the screen size is only
four inches diagonal and it is a wvga
resolution 800 x 480 it is however
running the full version of Windows
Phone 8 no surprises there to be seen
this is not final software and the
device is not activated on verizon
network so you see we don't have LTE but
the device does have us a young board
checking it around the back here you can
see that it is very much more similar to
a galaxy s finish on the back than it is
to be a TV switch I'll bring out in a
second but while we're back here that's
a 5 megapixel primary camera with flash
there's a Windows Phone branding
familiar speakerphone down here very
very reminiscent of the achieve s
alongside micro SD card slot not sure
what the max capacity on that is it's 64
it goes all the way up to 64 thank you
volume rocker there multitasking view
and on the right hand side just the
typical camera button power standby and
up top we have headphone jack and a
noise cancelling mic bringing the
achieve s alongside just for a
comparison you'll remember this from our
from our full review this is the
international operations you really see
the size difference there the attea
odyssey sits very very nicely in the
hand it is a thicker device and
obviously much more rounded and without
that extreme awesome metal finish or Foe
metal finish that we've talked about
before but much much more pebble like
much more reminiscent of a well a
mid-range device as it is but we're
gonna have more impressions of this when
it actually gets its full release in the
united states here but right now this is
a quick look the verizon a team
obviously from a TV odyssey from samsung
