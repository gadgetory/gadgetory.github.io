and greatest updates its mobile
operating system google also takes it
straps off android TV in android auto
platforms and if you want the LG G watch
for samsung gear live today is the day
I'm high netting that I and let's call a
show for what it is the google edition
of the pocket now daily and yes
everything is official no rumors today
so no drama but anyways let's begin with
the things that were announced at Google
i/o today starting with Android one
which is a very interesting approach to
emerging markets OEMs build cheap
hardware hardware that will cost
anything less from a hundred dollars to
make bones affordable and then Google
will focus on providing the operating
system providing the software updates
and taking care of everything in a stock
google experience that will obviously
look quite elegant this is actually a
very interesting way to attack emerging
markets and obviously to kill the dumb
phone through the smartphone android one
it seems like a great idea now the
second hottest thing announce today was
material design which is google's new UI
according to month es daud up to the
whole concept here is that whether
you're in chrome whether you're in your
Chromebook whether you are in any google
service whether you're on an android
phone everything should look the same
and this is a very interesting paper
like you i that either some people would
call it skew morphic but it's extremely
elegant it's a very interesting approach
to android something that we've wanted
for the longest time and that we finally
get on the greatest thing is again that
it is you know uniform all across even
though we wonder how google will handle
number one software updates for previous
phones and number two well the software
skins from other OEMs let's see how that
goes now the hottest news today was
android l and we don't know if it's
android 4.5 or five point no we know
that the next letter after kafir KitKat
was l so there is still no pastry name
for this android l is the new operating
system and it is extremely hot is
probably the best way android could have
ever grown up and the reason why is
because now it works on almost
everything from wearables to tvs two
cars the tablets too smart
bones and the only thing that's left is
Chromebooks even though Android
applications will now work on
Chromebooks as well and you will have
the same you eyes a cross-platform
everywhere it is just hot the design is
beautiful you now have art instead of
dalvik so it's twice as fast we're just
waiting to see how exactly are other
OEMs going to integrate their skins with
Android L in a way that will be
consistent and aside from that how many
smartphones will be able to support this
because even though it is more efficient
we know that it's really hard to force
an oem to support it Android L is hot it
will be available in the fall and you
can bet that we will have a developer
preview video very soon because we're
all excited and again the coolest thing
about android l is that it works
everywhere so we get Android TV
announced an android auto announced and
they're cool the U is are great
especially for Android TV though we
still don't know if there will be set
top boxes that will bring this as this
is not necessarily part of the
chromecast this is actually separate
merrily TVs will have to support it
which is actually a big hurdle as not
all companies are supporting it number
one in the number two in the case of
Android auto it is the same thing again
car makers will have to support it
apparently we'll get some cars by the
end of the year hopefully we will get
some dashboard options for this as it's
going to be hard like for example in my
car I can't just replace the dashboard
and how else am I going to get this i
want to buy a new car this year but
finally for the hottest news today God
Android wear it was demoed on products
and it is gorgeous it is extremely
useful even though some of us at
pocketnow were mixed about this product
it is extremely hot as what's google now
should have always been you can control
pretty much almost everything from your
normal basic phone functions from your
wrist from google now to getting
directions to getting turn-by-turn
navigation to actually using third-party
applications to order a pizza order a
vehicle you can again set alerts set
communication ways reply to messages it
is extremely powerful obviously it will
depend on your phone but the LG G watch
is available today for 229 bucks and
then
Samsung gear live which we weren't
expecting is also available today for
200 bucks which is surprising as a price
tag but that leaves you the question of
the day what Android wear product are
you getting if any or are you waiting
for the Moto 360 in my particular case
you can bet that I'm getting one of
these and it'll be the Moto 360 but

your preference and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the most
