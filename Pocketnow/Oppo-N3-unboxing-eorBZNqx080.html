follow-up to the elbow and one of 2013
do not ask me what happened to the open
end to the 0.3 is here we're gonna unbox
it but not before showing you the box of
defined seven so you can see the
similarities between these two
packaging's and oboe is one of the
manufacturers which not only based close
attention to the materials inside or
making up for the hardware it also pays
close attention to offering you a great
unboxing experience with a premium
cardboard packaging and what not so we
got the box here let's crack it open and
see what's inside taking the top off
putting it to the side you're being
welcomed by the phone itself we're gonna
take that as well put it to the side
just to see what else is inside the box
we've got the usual literature the usual
user manuals which you should always
read but which we do not read at all
we've got also a sim ejector tool we'll
put all of these to the side and we see
the new charger this is still a vo c or
VW C or book charger which is oboes fast
charger it is the same as the previous
models which came with the find seven
with find 7a only that it's smaller and
this time Oppo made it possible for you
to remove the cable in previous versions
the cable was not removable and while
talking about the cable this is the
regular USB cable which plugs into the
charger and also to your computer it is
labeled with green you see that green
plastic here designates the fact that
this is with OPOs fast charging
technology which by the way OBO claims
is able to charge your phone from 0 to
75% in 30 minutes we also have a pair of
headphones which are in ear monitors or
canal headphones we're curious to see
how they sound and of course the Oh
click which is the remote control you
can use to swivel the camera who will
get
back to this soon and also use as a
remote control for your media playback
on your phone but let's put everything
to the side take the phone get rid of
the protection without any fancy screen
feeling camera effects this time just to
tell you about the swiveling camera it's
it's called the smart motorized camera
and it's built with the schneider Crites
now if i'm saying that right opel claims
that this camera motorized swiveling
camera can swivel more than 200 degrees
it's actually 206 degrees so you can use
it as a main camera for the back a front
camera from the for the front and while
using the L click as well as two other
methods which are software methods and
you activate them with touches inside
the camera software so you can swivel
the camera to get better perspectives
new perspectives and whatnot while still
talking about the camera let's jump into
the specs this is a 16 megapixel camera
with with a Omni vision sensor it's got
a dual mode led F aperture F 2 point 2
and there are a lot of modes we'll get
to this when we'll look at the camera by
itself the phone is feeling solid in the
hand like every Oppo phone I've touched
it feels well built
it feels premium and according to up oh
it is made by industrial grade 7075
aluminum alloy its aircraft quality
steel to quote Oppo on this one and the
screen is 5.5 inches with a resolution
of Full HD so that's 1920 by 1080 which
is smaller than the resolution undefined
7 but then again the fine 7 is a
higher-end phone in almost every aspect
it's got a faster processor he's got
more memory as in RAM and it's got quad
HD resolution but the n3 is the flagship
in the swiveling camera category of
opposed
it also had two gigs of ram 32 gives a
storage which are expandable via a
microSD card 2 up to 128 and the process
you're powering everything is a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
processor which is a quad-core processor
the MSM 89 74 double a helped by the
Adreno 330 GPU you've got all the usual
other suspects radios which include lots
of network frequency operation
compatibilities you've got USB on-the-go
bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi 802 m VG and a and
AC and all the other stuff including a
3000 milliamp hour battery with support
for opus vwc fast charging and and
that's pretty much it when it comes to
the essentials and of course the trend
is to have fingerprint scanners Apple
has it Samsung has it HTC had it
everybody who matters had it at one
point we've got a fingerprint scanner on
the Oppo and three as well which can be
used to unlock your phone it can save up
to five fingerprints under different
modes you can customize it control the
camera it even has a button which you
can Matt action and what we loved a lot
about the about previous phones coming
from Oppo including the 5 the 7 I'm
sorry to find 7 undefined 7 hey is that
perfect in our opinion skyline it's
called skyline notifications where the
LED goes all the way on the bottom with
a nice smile now the notifications are
called skyline notifications 2.0 and it
has double sided notifications which
says help oh that leaves no room for
excuses it is true because it is mounted
on the lower edge and it fires light
both upwards and downwards so regardless
if you place your phone upside down or
the regular way you will still see those
neat LED notifications well
insert our SIM card not before telling
you that the oppo n3 is dual SIM
compatible you can insert either a micro
SIM or a nano SIM card but in case using
micro SIM the nano SIM slot doubles as a
micro as the expansion slot so you'll
have to choose one of the two you can't
have a nano SIM and a micro SD card
installed sadly but that's something you
have to live with or maybe get a nano
SIM two micro sim adapter and your
problem is is sold so we're going to
insert our SIM cards SD cards borrowed
on go through the entire setup process
and we'll be back with more coverage on
the Oppo and three everyone thank you
very much for watching I've been Anton
Tina and I'm sorry for my sore throat
and hoarse voice stay tuned to pocket
now we'll have lots more on the opal and
three we are currently reviewing the
Oppo r5 and of course we have lots more
coming as you've gotten used to by now
front pocket now till next time stay
safe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
