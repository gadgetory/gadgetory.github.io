pocketnow.com and this is a look at the
official xda-developers application that
actually lets you plug into the XD
developers forum when you're on the go
you can respond to threads you can
create new threads you can read threads
you can also see your private messages
it's pretty robust right now it's only
available for Android that the word on
the street is that there may be future
versions for other platforms as well you
can get it for free right now in the
Android Market just search for XDA and
you should see it pop right up so let's
take a look at the XDA application so
I'm going to zoom in on the screen a
little bit alright and here it is XDA
it's a very simple application but it
works quite well so it automatically
keeps you logged in if you if you put in
your username and password which is
quite nice there are four tabs along the
top and the first view that you get is
the recent post view so you can scroll
down and see all of the recent posts you
can filter it by things that you haven't
read yet or for most people you go over
to the forum view which will allow you
to drill down by the different
categories so let's say I'm curious as
to what's happening in the HTC dream
category and then I'm going to go into
g1 general forum and Here I am in the g1
general forum I can click on any thread
pull it up and start reading it and this
one only has two posts let's go to one
that has possibly more posts and when
you do have more than one post you have
a nice pagination at the top that allows
you to you know jump to a specific page
and I'll show you that in a minute there
we go up here this one is 27 posts so
you can jump to the previous page or the
next page quite easily or you can
actually respond to this thread so I'm
going to hit menu and reply so I can
actually type a response right from my
phone without being at a computer which
is nice or we can zoom back out to the
forum view and we can make an entirely
new thread so I press Menu new topic and
I start a new thread again right from my
phone very convenient another thing you
can do is you can tap and hold on any
thread and subscribe to it and when you
subscribe to a thread it goes over to
the favorites menu and I've already
subscribed to a couple of threads over
here and let's go into this one so I'm
going to show you a feature here
is poster rhodium screens and it's
people posting what their home screens
look like so I can tap on one of these
images and it will actually blow it up
full screen which is quite nice and then
you get a little carousel on the bottom
that lets you flip through to the other
images that this person has posted so
pretty cool functionality there let's
zoom back out and the final tab over
here the more tab lets you view your
private messages it lets you look at
your profile but I really haven't set
any of this up and that is really the
core of the application again you can
get it at the Android Market just search
for XDA it's free and it works pretty
well it's simple but it works that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
