pocket now calm and this is the hardware
review of the htc inspire 4G on AT&amp;amp;T
let's get to it so what we have here is
an HTC Desire HD basically the same
phone but it's running on AT&amp;amp;T its
chromed up a little bit more so we've
got this kind of chrome earpiece at the
top we've also got an LED indicator
which is quite nice so that you can
glance at your phone and tell if you
have a new from a call or missed email
there are settings for this that we'll
talk about in the software review so you
can determine which which swim system
notification sets off the blinking over
here what looks to be a front-facing
camera is not it is just a proximity
sensor / light sensor here we've got the
large 4.3 inch display the resolution is
800 down by 480 across now we're
thinking with HTC's next generation of
high-end Android phones they're going to
bump this to the next step which is 960
x 540 so it's very likely this is the
end of the line in terms of wvga
resolution for HTC high-end Android
phones they've been on wvga for years
now and it's time to bump it up and
they're probably going to sew down here
we've got capacitive buttons we've got
the home button on the left it seems
that with every new Android device to
change the layout of the buttons down
here which is a little bit annoying for
reviewer but pay if you're getting this
phone you're probably going to keep it
around for a while we've got the back
button in the center it's kind of nice
to have the back button on the left and
the home button on the right but hey
kind of can't change that nice HTC logo
they're flipping over to the side we've
got a chrome volume up/down rocker quite
large I've got a little fingernail group
we'll talk about what that's for in a
minute going to the bottom of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack micro USB here
with a microphone and they're actually
maybe a second microphone I'll show that
too in a sec over here on the on the
right side we have nothing standby
button is placed a little bit strangely
this time its stead of over to the right
it's placed over to the left its kind of
chromed out which is nice now the device
is a little bit thick it's no thicker
than the evo so if you've used an
Android 4.3 inch screen device before
you probably know what you're getting
into it's also quite heavy you
in the pocket it doesn't feel like a
tank it's like the dell venue pro would
for example so it's a reasonable balance
here so got a dual LED flash and there's
that little microphone I'm talking about
not sure if that's for picking up audio
when you're recording video or if it's
for dual microphone noise cancellation
you have to get back to you on that have
an eight megapixel camera which does
shoot video in 720p speaker grill
speaker is a man not terribly loud
unfortunately and here we've got two
panels that we can remove so this one
will reveal the battery and it's easy to
take off but not so easy to put back on
and we show this in the unboxing it is a
1230 830 milliamp hour battery so
reasonably sized we're going to talk all
about battery life in the full review on
pocketnow.com see if we can get this on
with out having to turn off the camera
and come back to you see can feel the
device just turned on because taking off
this panel will turn it off okay sort of
got there it's going to probably take
another minute or two if an egg going
anyhow so taking off the bottom here is
how you access the SIM card and the
micro SD card here you pop that out we
can see that it is gigabytes and a class
2 and that's what you get in the box now
in terms of other stuff inside we've got
the Qualcomm Snapdragon one gigahertz
CPU coupled with a lot of RAM 768
megabytes we may have said 512 in the
unboxing but it is 768 just like the
desire HD so you've got a lot of RAM to
play with and as we're going to see in
the benchmark tests this device flies
beyond that we've got 802 11 BG and n so
if you have a wireless n router you'll
be able to get the faster speeds we've
got Bluetooth of course and we've got
the big story with the inspire 4G is
hspa+ so it's kind of between 3g and 4g
it's a little bit slower than the full
LTE data speeds for 44 g and it's
definitely a lot faster than the 3g
hsdpa speeds and we're going to do a
separate video talking all about how
fast it actually is we're running
benchmarks all around town to see the
fastest speeds you can achieve with the
inspire 4G so far we're pretty impressed
so in terms of the hardware while it is
kind of big and heavy the inspire 4G is
is a commanding device that a lot of
people will appreciate thanks to the
large 4.3 inch display it's got great
build quality it's what you expect from
HTC it would have been nice if there was
a dedicated camera button or even an
HDMI output but you can't have
everything can you so that was the
hardware review of the htc inspire 4G if
you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
