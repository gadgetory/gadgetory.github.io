pakka calm and with summer movie
blockbusters debuting over the next
couple of months it seems logical to
have an application where you can view
and see when and where movies are
playing and Fandango mobile for android
devices allows you to even purchase the
tickets before you arrive at the theater
so let's get started okay so here we are
on fandango mobile for android devices
and the program is free on the android
market and a couple weeks ago Joe showed
us the internet movie database program
for android devices which is very
powerful and I urge you to check that
out because it does give you a lot of
information but if you want to just get
a quick reference on the movies playing
your area or what's coming out or what's
near you you can use this application
and even purchase tickets directly from
your device so we can see what's opening
this week on the device here and if I
want to select a movie let's say I want
to select the sorcerer's apprentice I
can view my show times in my area let's
see here I can either change my zip code
and my date or I can either select the
locate any feature so but of course I
already have it set elected here so I
can view all the theaters and show times
in my area and I can also view which
theater support the Fandango ticket
buying service so as you see we have a
real cinema right here if I wanted to
buy tickets I could just click on here
select tickets for which show time and
if I wanted to say by here it will load
and then I can just continue checkout or
sign in to my Fandango account if I have
one and purchase my tickets ok so then
back on the main screen I can also see
what other movies are opening this week
I can see you top box office all right
clicking here then this shows that
despicable me is at the top and it shows
other movies have followed that I can
see near me
and of course it shows it by
alphabetical list some of these are
pretty old because there are of course
discounted theaters in my area I can
also see what's coming soon and ramona
and beezus salt looks kind of
interesting and all these other movies
if let's say if i want to view what salt
is about we can get movie details and we
can even watch the trailer if you like
movie details so centers on a CIA
officer who is fingered as a Russian
sleeper spy so if I want I can play the
preview here and it will begin playing
the preview see if there's any volume
here and i can either fast-forward i can
pause i can see the entire thing if i
like but i'm just going to pause it and
go back so on the menu I can go down to
my account I can view movies I can also
search and also view theaters in my area
and this is Fandango mobile it helps you
find movies and purchase tickets before
they get sold out the program is free on
the android market and this is another
android market pick and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also leave some comments down below
thanks for watching and if at any time
you want to download this program for
your device just navigate using google
goggles to the image of the QR code on
the screen and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
