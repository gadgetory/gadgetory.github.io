four announced today by LG and just like
the Magna it is also a curved phone so
let's take a closer look
as you can see we got the magna on the
right and the spirit on the left the
Magna is a five-inch shirt the spirit is
a 4.7 inch or and what's interesting is
once we turn into the side you will see
from their profile that both of these
two thrones are again curved it's a 300
millimeter radius curve it's not as
curvy as the LG G flex 2 but LG says
that it helps with ergonomic seeeeee and
the overall aspect and looks since we're
on the back and looking for a button
here's the classic LG back side mounted
buttons just like on every modern LG
smartphone you press the power button to
wake it up but of course you can always
double to have to wake if it works it
does work indeed and a feature coming
from the G flex 2 is the glance view
where you swipe down on the screen while
it's in standby mode to get some
information like the time the date and
your notifications let's hope this is
not blocked with the knock-on code we
got android 5.0 point 1 out of the box
on this phone as well we're going to
double check if we are right and indeed
we are five point Oh point one and
everything else is the same as on the g3
as on the magma and
any other phone it's LG's proprietary UI
on top of it you can go of course and
add some apps some widgets some
wallpaper just your usual stuff quick
rundown of the specs we got a 4.7 inch
screen which is 720p for a 312 PPI
resolution up top a webcam which is one
of a single megapixel webcam if I'm not
mistaking know that is correct on the
back we've got either an 8 or a 5
megapixel shooter this of course will
depend on the markets LG will sell these
phones too and of course your back side
buttons the battery inside is one of
2100 milliamp hours so it should be
enough for a decent day of moderate use
will have a course lots more coming on
the LG spirit and get our phones once we
get some more hands-on times with them
this has been answering the United from
Barcelona Hama behind the camera
shooting some old school video because
we're in a hurry thank you very much for
watching till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
