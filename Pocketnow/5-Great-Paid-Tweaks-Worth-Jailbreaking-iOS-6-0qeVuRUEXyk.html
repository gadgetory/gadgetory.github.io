different three scenarios that you can
solve with a jailbreak again well now
we're back for more I'm hi meri behna
this is now I'll give you five
different things that annoy me about iOS
6 and 5 paid solutions out of the many
out there that you can solve with a
jailbreak my freshman annoyance with iOS
is the fact that the multitasking tray
is simply icons but out so is probably
the coolest thing out there it'll give
you big icons but aside from that you
actually even get a preview of the
service and you'll notice that the music
service has a different sort of UI which
is cool but you also get these previews
of each application you can definitely
just go into each application and yes
I'm waiting horribly for mailbox to come
in but I could just go back to the
multitasking tray and I get previews of
just about everything so if I want to
close an application I just slide down
and if I want to close everything I just
tap and hold on anyone and there go all
my applications I don't have to be
killin each one which is another
annoying thing but also you get targul
so i can control brightness at the
bottom and you can also control
different things like audio rotation and
just about everything it's a really cool
service arc so is one of the things that
I would really recommend you get another
one of my big annoyances and iOS is
trying to make a phone call if you're in
which ever app that you want you have to
leave the application go into the dialer
and figure out what you want to do but
there's this cool service called call
bar where I have it set to slide from
the bottom and what you get is actually
a bar at the top you could actually have
a slide from the top or from wherever
you want from activator but I have to
slide from the bottom because I'm not
actually using it and you can pretty
much find your favorites here you can
find your recents here notice how fast
it is find your contacts as well you can
call on the keypad go to your voicemail
and the coolest thing is that for
example if I want to let's say make a
phone call let's call this number if I
want to end the call all I have to do is
slide and it ends the call and it kills
the call bar I don't have to be doing
anything I could probably be within the
zarya application for example slide from
the bottom
and I get the call bar there and I can
make a call from here without the need
of going into the calling application
this is really cool my third annoyance
is the simplest one if i want to go to
contacts for example sadly we do not get
any thumbnails for icons but there's
this really cool one called sintac which
gives you thumbnails and it's pretty
cheap I mean it's straightforward
nothing really out of the ordinary and
you'd wonder what takes this for iOS to
figure out I mean this is a very simple
app and you notice that it doesn't make
your application any slower and it
doesn't take up any battery life at
least I haven't felt that another one of
my annoyance is Notification Center you
pretty much just slide from the top and
well all you get is notifications but
notice this slide to the right get
Twitter this is intelliscreenx it's a
really cool service which is kind of
pricey but actually worth every penny
it's light to the right you get news
slide to the right you get mail and I
can actually recycle II open the mail
and do everything I want with mail from
here but another one of the cool things
is that for example if I am in
Notification Center let's say here i
have an SMS if I tap on it usually I
would be yanked into the app but here I
could reply to it call it market us
right or do whatever I want from
Notification Center without the need to
leave it if i want to write an SMS
there's this little button here at the
bottom where i could type an SMS it well
and i could actually add more options to
the screens that I get here with
intelliscreenx and I can even have this
active in the lock screen which is
really cool and finally let's talk about
widgets iOS does not support widgets out
of the box and notice this one notice
what i have here at the bottom this is
called dashboard x which is really cheap
all you have to do is tap on any icon
and then just step on it any empty space
and it'll give you the option to select
widgets currently there aren't really
many but you can actually select from
the current widgets that iowa supports
that you can actually get other widgets
as well so for example i want my weather
here let's say i want another widget
here at the bottom I want the social one
and I could pretty much bring the
options that I get a notification center
in my home screen without the need of
having
go to Notification Center to get these
things done so i have my targos here
notice this is really quick i hit
bluetooth it's gone hit bluetooth again
it's up i want the light it'll
automatically give me the flash which is
already working you'll notice it right
there and it's just really cool it's
really straightforward i can lock
rotation and i can do just about any
other thing that's available you can
actually even call sbsettings for
example you could get other targets here
there are other tickers that are
available this is just a really cool
service i mean just think about it your
possibilities are currently limited with
iOS but if you jailbreak you get more
options that are actually really cool
and what my battery life is not really
taking a beating my device you'll notice
it's not sluggish at all so your mileage
may vary depending on the iphone that
you have but currently with the iphone 5
this works great thats it for our quick
walk through of different paid
applications that you could get with a
jailbreak there are obviously a ton more
these it was a comment down below of
