a new head for Android Apple brings on
more hardware with the new imacs and
accessories and the oneplus x or mini
reaches certification I'm hi Melanie
betta and if I had to dress up for
Halloween what do you think it should be
and can't be iron man this is rocking
out daily the official news today start
with Google as the company continues to
make some major changes to its
leadership we know that Sun Darvish I is
the company's new CEO and as of today
Hiroshi lock heimer is the company's new
VP for Android Chrome OS and the
chromecast so yeah bro she's been in the
company for nine years she is definitely
the right person for this job and we
can't wait to see how he plans to
address a ton of things that are coming
to you other sort of official news are
the oneplus X or many which just reached
certification and Tina and we get full
details on its specifications 5-inch
1080p OLED display 16 gigs storage three
gigs of RAM in addition to dual sim
module options and a lot more
information in the mix of the
description this is really no chump
phone it's actually just a smaller
device with a couple of lesser things to
the oneplus 2 which is a great thing we
just don't know in the launch an apple
is clearly on a launching streak the
company has just launched a new update
to its 5k 27-inch iMac which is they're
great but even more interesting we now
get a new 21 inch imac which is a 4k
display imac with very interesting
specifications and in addition to that
we get a refresh to accessories that
have been old like for example the apple
wireless keyboard is now the magic
keyboard and a new design in addition to
a new magic trackpad to and a new magic
mouse to with some improvements here and
there particularly well not improvement
but changes in the price tags these
products are now more expensive when
sealers prefer full details on
specifications and speaking of apple's
computer line up the company has just
panted a way to bring touch ID to the
Mac now the way the patent goes is
strictly for laptops which is ok but the
company also provides an open door for a
way to bring this technology
to the imac in the future through the
keyboard and trackpad or whatever Apple
devices to bring this technology to
obviously Apple is famous for patenting
a lot of things that it doesn't do but
given the fact that fingerprint scanners
have been in computers for a while now
it makes sense for this to happen soon
and finally for the very hot news of the
day just as we learned a few weeks ago
of a modular SmartWatch the block
SmartWatch well this product is now
available on kickstarter you can
actually get it for 275 bucks and the
way it'll work is that the links are
modular meaning you can add a link for
NFC a link for another antenna a link
for this is that it's very interesting
obviously you are giving the links more
functionality though this is optional
you can choose to not buy it with
lengths and will cost you hundred and
seventy-five bucks i believe which is
great or you could just continue adding
links as you go again the product is in
kickstarter but it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about this idea of a modular SmartWatch
are you considering this in my case I
would love this idea particularly
because it makes me choose whatever I
want to add to the watch and remove but
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know what you think friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video
was filmed make sure you follow us on
 out comments crap trying to
channel as well it followed me on
Twitter Jaime underscored any better on
Instagram it high memory better please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high metal better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
