daydream mode I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are the best
daydream applications for your Android
device
one of the most understated features of
jellybean is the daydream mode a screen
saver lurk mode that can be enabled when
your Android device is charging or
docked it's basically a bedside mode
that can be used for displaying all
sorts of different information or
animations it's utility is quite limited
which more or less makes the feature in
novelty no less it's one of our favorite
recent additions to Android as such
we've composed a list of our favorite
daydream apps that you can download from
Google Play first up is one of the most
popular Android widgets of late
- clock widget created by Google's own
Roman Nurik at the surface - clock looks
like your standard clock widget but a
few customizable features but dig
through the settings for just a minute
and you will see there's much more to it
than that
there are hundreds if not thousands of
third-party extensions for - clock they
can be downloaded from Google Play
everything from battery indicators and
moon phase extensions to a constant
display of your Klout score
- clock also comes with a daydream mode
of which you can customize to your
liking you can adjust the text color
animation style and brightness the rest
of the appearance settings such as
extensions extension order clock style
and date style will also be reflected in
the widgets of your homescreen and lock
screen for us this has been the best way
to cram as much information as possible
in the daydream mode if you're not after
a ton of information however there are
daydream applications that are a little
more tailored to a specific purpose such
as weather daydreams screensaver or
beautiful widgets whether daydream
offers the current weather conditions as
well as a three day forecast the current
time battery level unread email account
and missed calls
the only concern we have is the burnin
protection the text is mostly static and
periodically slides off the screen but
it ends up in the same spot rather than
shifting around the display beautiful
widgets also comes with a built-in
daydream mode it displays only the time
date weather and battery percentage but
as you would expect it looks great again
as most of the information at the bottom
of the screen is static it could cause
concern for image burnin if used for
prolonged periods
of time Google's on digital newspaper
service currents also comes bundled with
a rather awesome daydream mode login to
your current account and set it as the
default your subscriptions are displayed
on your screen in a slow pan tapping a
headline or thumbnail will bring a
preview of The Associated article up for
quick viewing and you can open directly
into the article incurrence if you tap
one more time this is very neat and
useful sitting on our desk in the office
and if you're in need of some
inspirational quotes daydream coats
offers just that the setup is extremely
simple
choose the interval for changing quotes
and set the text size famous quotes will
periodically display hopefully giving
you a better outlook on your day we fell
in love with this one even as cliche and
cheesy as the whole idea is and if none
of these daydream modes do it for you
there is one that just might with jelly
dreamed a dream you can select custom
text clock color a personal or preset
background animation style font text
size various combinations of
notifications and a plethora of other
information to display in daydream mode
we must say we quite like this one but
if what you're looking for is something
a little more fun and less serious my
android and circuit board or two awesome
daydream modes and we leave you with a
question do you use daydream mode on
your Android device regularly or is it a
feature you care nothing about
personally I always have daydream mode
enabled and I typically use dashclock
for displaying all my information in one
place but lately I've also been using
the current state ream more and more and
daydream quotes is also finding its way
into my routine that's all we have time
