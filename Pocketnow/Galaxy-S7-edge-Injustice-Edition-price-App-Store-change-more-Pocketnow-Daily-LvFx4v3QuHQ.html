some major changes to the App Store it
seems that the Galaxy s7 edge just this
edition will cost the pretty penny and
the Moto Z rumors hint to some sort of
an optical zoom module I'm hi Mary vera
and raise your hands if you were able to
finish Super Mario Brothers the first
one just one life this is parking out
daily the official news today begins
with deals t-mobile continues to disrupt
with the uncarrier 11 and obviously
deals those of you in the market for the
iphone s ii you can now get it for free
on t-mobile and if you're in the market
for a tablet you also get around one
hundred and thirty dollars off depending
on whatever tablet of this that you
choose you can learn more about the deal
in the link of the description and if
you've recently bought an AT&amp;amp;T
smartphone lately you will notice that
there is a ton of directivity bloat AT&amp;amp;T
is doing as much as it can to make
direct to be a thing up to the point
where if you're in the market for an
iphone success or you have a family that
wants to get iphones right now if you
subscribe to directv in certain zones
you get a free iphone success or iphone
6 x plus and then you get fifty percent
off up to five devices that is crazy and
it's not like of directv as a bad
service on the contrary it's really good
so this is a major deal for those of you
that have been wondering exactly what
those pins at the bottom of the Moto Z
rumors are well there are some very
interesting hints right now on Weibo
where Lenovo is teasing that apparently
optical zoom will have anything to do
with it which is rather interesting
because this apparently means that this
is a module connector and you'll
probably get some sort of optical camera
like we've seen from Sony in the past
only connected in a different way we
cannot wait to see what happens at
lenovo world which starts tomorrow stay
tuned and for those of you that have
been waiting for that galaxy s7 edge in
just this edition you might want to skip
or think twice about the price tag and
just get yourself a debrand skin with
the Batman logo because apparently the
price tag is going to range up to twelve
hundred and fifty seven dollars that is
a lot of money for just the
Galaxy s7 edge with a couple of skins
yes you get the whole gear VR in
addition to a couple of cases here and
there sure fine it's a collectible but
apparently there will only be a field
these models made hence the reason for
the price tag and finally very
interesting news today have to do with a
raise an interview that was conducted to
Phil Schiller he started teasing a
little of what to expect for WWDC and
apparently it'll have a lot to do with
the App Store apparently Apple has been
tinkering with the whole concept of
subscriptions for applications they
still get thirty percent but apparently
if consumers subscribe to specific
services from a nap and they subscribe
for more than a year then there are
discounts and it's just a crazy ordeal
with apparently Apple wants to help
developers figure out a way to monetize
more because if you didn't know the
whole concept of the app store is not
really playing well for developers
lately because consumers buy the app
once and then you know the whole
freemium model hasn't really paid off
really well cuz I don't like to start
playing a game and then get a million
ads and then get forced to pay as I go
as well it's just crazy we even hear
that developers who want the whole idea
of pay for update which Apple apparently
doesn't want to do so there is a lot on
the table for WWDC when it comes to the
app store and it leads me to the
question of the day what sort of model
would you like to see would you prefer
to pay up front for an application
probably not cheap but pay upfront and
not have to worry about it or would you
rather go for subscriptions in my case I
hate the subscription model so I pay for
Spotify then I have you know let's say I
also subscribe to YouTube red I also pay
for Netflix some of us pay for Hulu then
I pay for fubo TV because I do like to
wash FC Barcelona games how many
subscriptions can I have think about it
I feel that it's not a good idea i would
rather they tell me that they're going
to charge me fifteen dollars for an
application which is the equivalent of a
lot of the money that these developers
are making and not have to subscribe for
something because subscriptions aren't a
dollar a year by the way usually they go
for ten dollars and when you do the math
100 bucks 150 bucks and subscriptions is
kind of ridiculous
