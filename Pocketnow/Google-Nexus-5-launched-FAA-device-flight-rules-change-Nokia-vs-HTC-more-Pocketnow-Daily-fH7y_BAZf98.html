along with Android 4.4 KitKat the FAA
gives their go ahead for full flight use
of mobile electronics and no guess
lawsuit against HTC could ban the HTC
One in the UK I'm hi Mary vera and the
reason why I'm not smiling is because I
was not able to pre-order my personal
Nexus 5 on Google Play but this is
pocket now daily let's versus a off with
some great n official news as the FAA
has finally come to their senses about a
ruling that came out 40 years ago
probably more where they would band will
use a portable electronic devices
whenever year were takeoff and landing
and then that was limited whenever you
weren't quite and cruising so a sub
whenever they notify Airlines and
whenever airlines modify their
procedures to allow this you will be
able to use your portable electronic
devices throughout your full flight even
though your phone's gonna have to be in
airplane mode anyways but still it's a
step in the right direction it's cool
that this is happening let's just hope
that Airlines update their stuff very
soon now let's talk about nokia and HTC
as both companies don't seem to be
getting along no he had just father
lawsuit against HTC over certain patent
Frenchman's in the UK as it turns out
the UK court ended up ruling in favor of
nokia so this would ban the HTC One and
the HTC Wildfire and we're still not
sure exactly when this band is gonna
take effect that obviously HTC is gonna
feel against it but while that happens
if you're interested in HTC One and the
year in the UK I would suggest you move
fast and speaking of Nokia the only
product that was missing in action on
their nokia world was the project Glee
aka the Lumia 525 which is definitely a
bunch of phone nothing really big but we
do know that Windows Phone is mostly
powered by budget Lumia phones and in
this case the fire 25 was going to be
the new budget model aka hundred dollars
twenty dollars probably in the price
range which is just crazy but still
really popular and apparently it's been
leaked recently it was leaked in a
contest and so we can probably expect
that Lumia 525 to happen for those of
you that want a budget windows phone
that has some decent specifications so
stay tuned for that and speaking of
budget products we have this new leaked
render of a verizon ellipsis 7 tablet
apparently these are two tablets not
just one and judging by the design and
the fact that we don't really even know
what
if actually come from this could be a
entry-level tablet which looks kind of
decent and it runs stock Android so we
could be looking to a budget-friendly
option and verizon for those of you that
are interested though obviously we still
don't know any more information than
just the leaked render so stay tuned for
that again if you're looking for a
budget-minded tablet this holiday season
and finally for the very very very hot
news of the day we can now stop talking
about the rumors of the Nexus 5 because
it is now official google just silently
announced it and they kind of caught us
off guard they kind of spilled all our
lunch but we had an editorial roundtable
we talked about the phone make sure you
watch the video and links in the
description and yes this is the
powerhouse that we've been waiting for
staff targeting have your processor all
the specification is the great camera
and almost everything of the LG g2 only
in the Nexus package which is great and
even better the three hundred and fifty
dollar price tag for the 16 gig model
400 for the 32 gig it's available in
white and black and we've got a
tutorials comparing it against
everything we get to tell you the
reasons why it really matters for you to
consider this phone even though you now
cannot buy it because it was sold out in
the first couple of minutes even before
we could even start talking about it in
the round table so that leaves these are
the question of the day were you able to
pre-order a nexus fiber you're excited
or are you waiting for the nexus 5 in my
particular case I was sadly too late to
the google play store i could not get
the 32 gig model i am looking forward to
the white model particularly but you
know sadly i'll have to wait are you
waiting as well leave us a comment down
