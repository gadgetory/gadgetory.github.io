oneplus 16 this time coming from oneplus
actually the new iPads have been
registered in China along with a new
possible Apple pencil and Samsung is
pushing hard on their foldable
smartphone so that it doesn't fade away
like a gimmick I'm Jaime Rivera and yes
last day here as a crazy amount of
travel begins as of the next hour this
is part out daily the official news
today begin with deals a project fires
currently having one where you get $150
off if you get an lg phone meaning
devices like the g7 or the B 35 that are
currently the ones being retailed most
important part is that these LG phones
actually have another extra like $200
discount so we're talking that these
phones get extremely cheap and project
files probably one of my favorite
services of all time you can learn more
about it in the description now let's
talk about Samsung as the company's a
CEO of mobile DJ COEs recently on record
talking about their foldable smartphones
and he has been teasing this for a while
he's been saying things like that
they're working hard on the user
interface that they don't want this to
fade away like a gimmick that this
product would really he didn't say
revolutionize but to a certain degree
that's what he's hinting to that they're
working really hard on pretty much
reinventing the tablet I guess let's see
if in the end they pull it off I find it
interesting that he keeps talking about
a product that hasn't been launched this
is funnier than leaks now let's talk
about the huawei mate 20 Pro we're just
a couple of days away from the event and
yes that crazy travel includes the fact
that I have to go to London to that and
we get more leaks it seems that there is
a 4200 milliamp hour battery obviously
the keren 980 and apparently that camera
array that has been teased in a sort of
an L and that box around it looks really
nice in the leaks it seems that it's
actually going to happen that way so
stay tuned we'll be covering it live now
let's talk about new iPads I am one of
the people that's personally waiting for
them particularly because I depend on
them for work and I've said this
continuously for those of you in the
market for iPads I highly recommend that
you wait apparently they just got
certified in China
it seems or something in addition to a
new Apple pencil so we're not exactly
sure how many models were getting but
definitely from all the leaks that we've
seen these iPads are gonna change
completely so that's fantastic let's
just hope it happens and finally the hot
news today come from oneplus as well
there are forums on Weibo discussing
everything - except for the oneplus 60
and now we've got the company chiming in
telling us for example things like that
we should expect that by the 30th things
like that they're working hard on a
completely different gesture-based user
interface which is rather interesting
and the fact that we've got this optical
on display fingerprint scanner that
they've been teasing significantly it is
definitely one of the hottest phones
that we've been waiting for so far and
please don't remember in the first link
in the description if you're interested

York City we're gonna be there you can
