front-facing speakers a vibrant display
and one of the sharpest cameras you can
find in the Android world and it's
capable not just of going for a swim but
of looking good doing it
Sony's premium smartphone for the first
half of 2014 is here and now finally so
is our review I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is the Sony Xperia z2
let's get to it if you've seen our z2 vs
galaxy s5 and HTC One m8 comparisons you
already know where to snag your own
Xperia z2 GSM nation one of the first US
retailers to stock the device we thank
them for the loaner and encourage you to
pay them a visit at the link in the
description below if you're struck by a
sudden case of Sony fever eight point
two millimeters 163 grams 5.2 inch
display and a Snapdragon 801 processor
that's not the most outlandish spec list
of the year in fact it's par for the
course in 2014 but toss in a twenty
point seven megapixel camera 3200
milliamp hour battery three gigs of RAM
and pour it all into a water and dust
resistant glass casing and you've got a
formula for something special that's
clear from the first time you pick up
the Xperia z2 it's a little big for our
average sized hands and a little too
easy to scratch the clumsy will want to
invest in a case but it's glass sandwich
construction makes it one of the more
distinctive Android offerings of the
year we wish Sony would tone it down a
little on the accoutrement this phone
could look even better with cleaner side
rails but on the plus side details like
this port enabled cool accessories like
this stand-up dock an easier way to
charge the device than fiddling with the
port covers on the sides other hidden
gems include the status light built into
the earpiece active noise cancellation
technology behind the headphone jack and
Sony's dedicated camera shutter button
which we always say this but we'll say
it again should be standard on all
smartphones waking up the device is as
simple as a double tap on the face and
you're treated to a 1080p panel with
wider viewing angles than you could have
found on Sony devices even as recently
as last year
we still have a ways to go in terms of
outdoor visibility deeper blacks and
cleaner whites but the company has
seriously stepped up its game and
display technology the software running
beneath that glass is Android 4.4.2 with
a ton of customizations Sony's UI is
heavier than ever here and while that
doesn't measurably affect the speed or
smoothness of the OS it's a little
burdensome in terms of flow Sony's
really pushing its value adds here for
example what's new is basically just a
sony media store and it has no business
sharing the up swipe gesture with Google
now which is a service that's actually
useful in a similar vein the small apps
options are always there when hopping
into the multitasking ribbon but even on
a 5.2 inch screen window to apps like
this aren't terribly useful we can still
find no reason to use the special
experience of Facebook or Twitter over
the native apps and the notification
shades settings toggles were probably
designed to be as simple as possible but
in everyday use they're cumbersome and
Sony's design aesthetic is inconsistent
some apps are finished beautifully while
others seem half-baked on the plus side
those beautifully finished apps like the
album really are fun to use because of
the good looks and downloadable titles
like Sony's lifelog are both novel and
gorgeous even everyday pedestrian
corners like the dialer have some fun
surprises answering the phone just by
putting it to an ear for example or they
admittedly more gimmicky rejecting a
call by shaking the phone in all the
software story here isn't much different
than on most Android smartphones with
heavy-handed third-party you eyes some
of the value ads do contribute to the
phone's usefulness but others aren't
worth the clutter they impose on the
experience and whether you like the look
of the skin is as subjective as ever
it's not as easy to equivocate when we
come to the camera sony impressed us
with the optics on the z1 compact a few
months back and we're even more taken
with the shooter on the z2 again the
hardware camera key brings a utility
that just can't be duplicated from
quickly launching the viewfinder
to the half press to focus functionality
the software allows you to download
additional plugins like windows phones
lenses and while the mode select page is
getting a little bloated as it is it's
still easy to use we're big fans of
Sony's superior Auto mode which does a
nice job of dealing with a wide range of
shooting conditions we could stand to
see a little more color and contrast in
some photos but switching to manual
allows for that and shooting in 15 or 20
megapixel resolutions means zooming in
on faraway subjects is no problem that's
especially true given Sony's excellent
software stabilization which you notice
as soon as you fire up the camera
and which almost makes up for the lack
of OIS low-light performance as we
showed in our Z 2 vs. m8 comparison is
outstanding even an automatic mode
underwater photography is even more fun
the clarity with which the camera is
able to render some of these shots is
just stunning and then there's video 4k
recording is available but we shot in
1080p for the majority of our time with
the device we're happy with most of the
video footage we captured with a z2 but
we wish focus was a little less
temperamental you need to keep a close
eye on the picture to make sure focus is
properly set before recording and that
it doesn't drift during the take
sometimes it's very obvious because one
of the flight paths just go to so it's
just on the other side of that closest
in sum we adore this camera we'd like to
see a little more contrast overall and
we wish the full range of features was
available in resolutions higher than 8
megapixels but from the sensors
available high resolution to the
software's ease of use to the underwater
versatility we think the z2 offers the
best overall camera experience you can
find on an Android smartphone today
we've tested the Xperia z2 on ATT's 3G
and 4G networks for about 6 days in the
Greater Boston area and we're happy to
report that data speeds and reception
are up to snuff where the z2 stumbles is
in voice quality at least on our side
callers say we sound natural on the z2
even in the presence of lots of
background noise but our end is less
enjoyable the earpiece produces a thin
tinny voice reproduction that combined
with the device's sharp upper edge makes
talking uncomfortable for the most part
speaker phone calls are also very quiet
despite their front firing position and
despite some of these best efforts at
software enhancement thankfully in a
quiet room the z2 can still offer
acceptable playback quality for media
but plug in some earphones specifically
the Sony buds that came in the box with
our unit and it's a whole new ballgame
this isn't acting folks this was the
first time I tried out Sony's active
noise-cancelling on the subway and it
blew my mind once you've tried active
noise suppression on these earbuds with
this software you won't want to go
anywhere else combined with the
outstanding media apps and Sony's wide
range of audio boosting customizations
well let's just say there's a reason the
Walkman brand isn't dead yet
Sony knows what it's doing here you
should be able to jam out for quite a
while too the company quotes up to 120
hours of music listening on the embedded
3200 milliamp hour battery we were able
to squeeze two days of light to moderate
use out of the device eking out almost
4.5 hours of screen on time during that
period you'll be able to go longer if
you use Sony's stamina and other power
saving options though and longer still
if you avoid running the CPU hard on
high demand games or videos the z2 keeps
up with its competition fine on
performance but it also heats up faster
and hotter than any other 801 powered
phone we've tested so keep a charger
handy if you're using the z2 as a media
hub if you buy the Xperia z2 in the
United States it's not yet available
from any major wireless carrier so
you're looking at a hefty price tag so
is it worth it absolutely it may only be
a small step forward in design over the
z1 and it's software is definitely in
need of some trimming but for a phone
with these specs to be crammed into a
water-resistant casing this attractive
with a camera and personal media suite
this capable well as the saying goes you
get what you pay for and if you ask us
the Xperia z2 is worth every penny for
our full score benchmark results in much
more see our written review available no
