League parks get detailed more rumors
point to the existence of a google nexus
8 and believe it or not the LG G watch
already has a custom rom I'm hi meri
beta and what is the remaining world cup
team that you're supporting because I
don't want the colors of my shirt to say
anything about me this is pocket out
daily let's begin today with some
official news that are actually not
necessarily good as player shouldn't
devices are no longer gonna be as fast
as they were you remember in the past we
had a lot of devices to choose from even
tablets but now if you look at the
listing all you have is the HTC One I
made which is great the Moto G which is
great the galaxy s4 from last year which
we don't know what to make of but you
know that's pretty much at the list ends
there no galaxy s5 no tablets nothing
left which specs to wonder what exactly
could we expect from the google play
edition devices in the future and
speaking of google devices we still
don't know what to make it the nexus
lineup we've heard rumors of a nexus 9
and nexus 6 and the nexus 8 but now we
have some listings from india that
apparently have the nexus 8 being
imported probably for testing though
there are no details and this probably
the oddest part usually we get details
are most specifications but now all we
have is the import so let's see what we
get it could probably just be a typo now
in other news that are not necessarily
official the LG G watch receives its
first custom rom just a couple of days
after reaching the doorsteps of many
really interesting the roms name is goma
which in my country wouldn't be in
hangover aside from other meanings that
i really won't want to mention on camera
but hey apparently it'll make your
device faster they'll give you better
battery life there are no details but
hey this is pretty much the first custom
rom so stay tuned it could get better
now it's all about apple and the iphone
6 as we get the first leaked parts of
the sim trays of these devices and the
reason why this is hot is number one
because of the curvature of the sim
trays number two because we get the
color options in space grey gold and
silver so for those of you wondering
exactly what colors are we getting on
the next iPhones we already know what
they are and finally for the very
interesting leaks of the day famous
tipster a place has just tweeted what to
expect from the Galaxy Note 4 in a very
odd way number one he confirms that
there is a 64-bit Galaxy Note 4 in the
works and the fact that he doesn't
separate these means that not just the X
and O's processor device will have this
64-bit processor but even more
interesting and this actually leads us
to the question of the day because I
want you to help us out with the puzzle
here according to F leagues the galaxy
note 3 is 2h what the galaxy note 4 is
to tr what could mblox beam with this
and yeah we can ask the guy directly
believe us a comment down below what
exactly do you think he means with this
puzzle and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is Scott machine follow us on
parking our comments a sharp change
channel as well it also follow me on
twitter hi my underscored iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hein that any better
thank you very much for watching we will
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
