pocket now calm we believe in the
transformative power of tablets they
have the ability to entertain you to
help you communicate better to help you
be more productive and get more work
done the tablet form factor is unlike
anything else because it's so intimate
it's in your hands there it is right
there
and so we're really excited about the
Microsoft Surface I use androids when I
want to be as productive as possible on
a tablet I use an iPad what I want to
have the best app selection out there
for tablet devices and what about the
surface well I'm so curious to see if
the surface here in this box can make me
any more productive I think that if the
surface is going to have an edge it's
going to be in making me more productive
and making you more productive by
allowing you to multitask faster
allowing you to have a split screen view
so you can look at your email on one
side and look at web browser in another
side there's a lot of cool stuff about
Windows 8 I've got a lot of questions
and I can't wait to integrate the
surface into my life I also can't wait
to unbox it so I'm gonna stop talking
let's unbox it
now of course this is the surface and
not the surface Pro the surface runs
Windows RT and a lot of people are
questioning sort of the purpose the
reason for being for Windows RT because
it's kind of like Windows but it's kind
of not because it can't run full in
Windows applications it's kind of like a
I guess watered down version of Windows
but it gives you a totally different
experience because there are windows 8
specific abs the full screen apps that
are beautiful and Wow look at this
packaging it is darn nice it's got a
little slit over here we kind of pull it
to the side and I got the one with the
touch cover of course you gotta see what
that's all about let's see if we can
remove this and here it comes hopefully
it doesn't fall out wow this is some
crazy packaging beautiful surface in the
Windows 8 font
very clean very nice let's cut the tape
over here without cutting our fingers
off and wow that is pretty cool how they
display that look at the the blue cover
over here interestingly Microsoft did
not go with a standard charging port
they didn't use micro USB like we see
with a lot of Android tablets we have a
proprietary connector here and the
reason for that is microsoft says it
charges faster ok that's fair but now
you have to remember to bring the charge
around with you so here it is the
surface yes as you can see and I am so
curious to feel the sting of my hand
Microsoft spent a lot of time and energy
on this device because this is like this
is it for them this is the flagship
Windows 8 thing it's pretty it's
definitely pretty it's got that 16 by 9
aspect ratio screen I just want to do
something right away here I wanna flip
out the kickstand huh let's see how do
you do that oh oh yeah that's a cool
sound
if it can focus oh yeah that's that's
good but sitting on a table and see how
it looks it feels really nice in the
hand no doubt that this is a high
quality piece of machinery here this is
made out of a magnesium composite and
it's just got this really interesting
design with these tapered edges all
around the device and something that you
get on the service that you don't get on
an iPad is of course a USB port which
wrote an article on PocketNow about
whether you want a USB port whether you
need a USB port on a tablet but it's
nice to have if you want it and so let's
actually find that touch cover really
curious to see what that is all about
and there it is it's at that it's at the
bottom here okay here's the touch cover
and apparently it does some magic whoa
snap action that is really really cool
you don't have to line that up at all
and now what you've kind of got well you
can hear that's metal
wow that is real metal well you kind of
have in here is like a mini laptop with
a touchpad this is so soft this is
amazing so excited to actually use this
in a day to day capacity so this is
basically felt there is literally no
feel to the keys they kind of feel dead
and again I just don't do that again oh
yeah that's good stuff that's real good
stuff alright let's compare this real
quick to the iPad no we're gonna boot it
up and talk about some first impressions
so of course the iPad is a four by three
aspect ratio and the iPad 3 here in the
iPad 4 has a much higher screen
resolution than the surface one of the
complaints people have about the surface
so it's 13 36 by 768 the iPad is 204 8
by I think it's 1536 or something like
that
and in terms of thickness they're both
on the table they are literally the same
thickness I can't really tell a
difference we're gonna look at that a
little bit more closely let's turn them
over on the back here
got an Apple logo we've got a Windows
logo and the kickstand sounds really
good doesn't it
all right so we're gonna turn this on
for the first time and let's see what
happened this first thing we got to do
is find the power and I guess over here
is where you charge the surface let's
see actually what that is light isn't
magnetic let's see it's kind of magnetic
okay that's nice
and so let's let's power this bad boy on
there she comes
so the power button was right at the top
there up here
nice nice and easy to feel for we've got
the the new Windows eight waiting
animation I've used Windows 8 in stores
and in some demo units but I've never
actually used it personally summer I
don't know what the next step is going
to be the Windows 8 RT startup process
probably is gonna ask for Windows Live
ID Wi-Fi network and so forth ok English
next great touch sensitivity on the
screen so far I accept these terms I'll
read them later all right
personalized Wireless oh that's cool
pick a color you like and give your PC a
name now let's see
I like let's see that looks nice living
room PC let's call this Windows Phone
style clicky sound click next connect to
Wi-Fi ok and we connect them to Wi-Fi
we're gonna use Express settings here
just for the sake of getting into
something so sign into your PC use your
very email as a Microsoft account to
sign it to Windows we won't send you
spam thanks Microsoft can we skip this
let's see
nope alright so we entered our Microsoft
account details previously known as
Windows Live account and now it's doing
some stuff not sure exactly what it's
doing hi
that's very friendly thing to def work
while we're getting things ready
check out the new way to use Windows
alright how many
camron here we'll see we'll see what's
up in case you're getting a surface
after your PC is ready you can read too
but I'll read it to swipe in from any
edge can I do it now no okay that's
where the charms come in you can see me
the reflection very very reflective
coating on the surface here all right
you know you know what this might take a
while I'll be back with some first
impressions okay so some first
impressions first of all this screen
while kind of low resolution looks darn
good especially from a reasonable
distance when you have the touch cover
you're actually going to be sitting a
little further away from the surface of
course if you take the touch cover off
and use it like an actual tablet you're
going to notice the pixel some more
another observation is here that is that
this keyboard is pretty terrible in fact
it feels like I'm typing on a
touchscreen and why would you get a
keyboard if you're gonna be having the
feeling like you're typing on a
touchscreen so it's gonna take a lot of
practice to get used to this although
I'm going to just jump the gun and say I
highly recommend getting the actual
touch type cover with the actual keys
that move around rather than this thing
which doesn't even feel like a keyboard
so this is Internet Explorer 10 and
their performance is amazing I mean this
web browser is probably and most likely
better than anything I've seen on the
Nexus 7 for example or the iPad 3 I mean
it is just fast it feels like Windows
Phone to be honest so let's go back to a
lot of learning to do in terms of
navigating I went to the desktop here
and I became kind of confused because
it's got the Windows desktop but you
can't run anything in it except Internet
Explorer File Explorer and Microsoft
Office so why even have it and look how
fast it is to switch between
applications in fact it's got this
really cool merry talked about the split
screen view so you can put the desktop
there and move this over and sort of
have a have a small little window for
the web browser over here while you're
still working on the desktop that is
super cool and you've got to go back
over here to go to the Start screen so
I'm going to set this up with all of my
stuff I'm going to use it for a full
day's and be back with a more full first
impression
video and then of course we're gonna
have a review of this thing the question
here I'm approaching this review with is
can the surface make me more productive
than say an iPad or a Nexus 7 and how is
the overall experience does it make
sense is this new operating system which
what it is going to have some traction
is there going to be enough apps is
there going to be a reason for existing
I can't wait to use this thing it's new
and fresh and I'm very excited about it
back soon with more on the surface
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
