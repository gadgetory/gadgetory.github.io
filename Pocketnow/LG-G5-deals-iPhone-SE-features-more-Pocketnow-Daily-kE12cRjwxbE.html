be included on the LG g5 a bevy of
details of the iphone se2 listen more
about its design and some new deals may
have just made some experience quite
enticing I'm hi Mary Vanna and after a
crazy week full of work it's great that
it's friday I need a drink this is
 out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you
interested in getting a petite size
Android smartphone with great
specifications at a decent price tag
there are a few but the Sony Xperia z5
compact is probably one of the best ones
and if you want to get it in the United
States right now it's currently costing
you 400 bucks on amazon and best buy so
yeah I'd move on that if I were you over
on the website we've been following the
alcatel Idol pro for for quite some time
mainly because it runs windows 10 mobile
it's gonna parently bring a Snapdragon
820 processor but the RAM is just going
to be a two gigs you're getting a 1080p
display but still this is another
windows 10 mobile option that the did
bring a breather to Lumias apparently
design is going to be just as gorgeous
as the aisle four we just can't wait to
see when it's coming and speaking of
highly anticipated products we get to
learn more of the ipad air 3 which is
being dubbed the ipad pro mini by some
because apparently it is going to gain
pro features like support for the Apple
pencil in addition to the keyboard and
the only problem is it apparently it's
not going to retain its price tag one of
the things that made iPads popular were
the prices but it seems that this one is
going to retail at six hundred dollars
meaning that if Apple can't sell so many
tablets it might as well make more money
out of them I just don't think that
strategy is gonna be smart speaking of
products that could get a better price
tag we get more details on the iphone
mini or iPhone s ii we get to hear that
the design might look a lot like the
iphone 5s but the specs are going to
change dramatically a nine shipping
included meaning hey Siri functionality
works meaning that if the 12 megapixel
camera does make the cut from the iphone
success you will be getting 4k video the
only problem is that apparently it will
start at 16 gigs and the read
price is going to be four hundred
dollars what's wrong with you at all and
finally very hot moose that they have to
do with the LG g5 and t-mobile we get to
hear more details on when you can pick
it up we've got official information
that March 29 our order dates on tmobile
you can pick it up by April first and if
you move quick before april fifth you
could pick it up with a LG 360 cam which
is great i love that 360 camera but in
addition to that some buyers are also
getting a spare battery which makes it a
very enticing deal but hey it leads me
to the question of the day what all
these freebies make you want to buy the
LG g5 or after our reviews of the galaxy
s7 are you luring over to the galaxy s7
of the gear VR in my case I would love
it if they gave me that LG VR headset uh
but man I can't wait for that g5 I
really want to test it it was a comment
