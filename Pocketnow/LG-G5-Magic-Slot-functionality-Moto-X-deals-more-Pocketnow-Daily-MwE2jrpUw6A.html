expansion was considered for more than
just storage some Moto X deals might
make it compelling for you to consider
one today an apple has just decided to
challenge a court when it comes to how
it handles encryption I'm hi Mary vera
and you know i was expecting jokes
yesterday and all I got were responses
to the question which is fine let's try
it again today this is parking out daily
official news today begin with Motorola
as the company has begun challenging
competitors with deals because that's
what you do before mwc right now if you
pick up the 64 gig Moto X you will be
getting a first generation moto 360
which is actually still a good
SmartWatch just not as good as the newer
one but not as different either i
actually prefer the older design you can
hit the links down below for more
details because apparently that deal
will only last until tomorrow and since
we've been talking about market share
figures we learn about tablets today and
the numbers are just terrible again
follow the links down below for more
details but just to give you an idea
Apple has lost thirty-nine percent of
that tablet market it still reigns
supreme at twenty one percent of the
market share but Samsung is getting
closer and closer at fourteen percent
even though both companies aren't really
selling that well and after the recent
San Bernardino shootings the hottest
news today have to do with how Apple was
being requested by a court to decrypt an
iphone 5c that was used by one of the
people responsible sadly to that Tim
Cook responded that the company will not
be decrypting the phone because
apparently it exceeds their possibility
and even though it's hard to believe
that it could be possible and to that we
say hey sometimes privacy is good but
then again there are some cases where it
is really necessary for decryption to
happen and even though the last thing
we'd recommend any existing Windows
Phone users they at windows 10 mobile
because the reviews were just terrible
it seems that we're finally getting it
it was supposed to happen in December
than January now it's pretty much going
to be March as the Mexico office for
Microsoft has shown that it could happen
on februari 29 set your calendars but
again word of warning it's terrible and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the LG g5
there is this very interesting leaked
photo of the magic slot apparently it's
going to be for more than just storage
we thought it would be for expandable
storage and for a replaceable battery
but it seems he'll be able to add a lot
more things to that it reminds us of the
old compaq ipaq days where you could
just add expansion sleeps with different
functionality back then it was GPS or
making your PDA a phone or stuff like
that but we wonder exactly what the
usage scenarios would be here which
leaves us to the question of today what
would you want that expansion slot to be
for because in my case I just I don't
know I don't know exactly what I could
use it for us a lot of the things that
we did use it for before already
available on smartphones leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your idea and friends you know the way
it goes if you want to get these news
