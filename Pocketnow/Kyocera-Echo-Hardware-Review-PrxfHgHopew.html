pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
review of the Kyocera echo dual screened
Android phone let's get to it so it's
very exciting not only for you guys but
for us to be able to look at and see a
dual screen Android phone come out for a
while it has seemed like most phones
have been the same they're slate devices
with similar specs similar fields and
and an aesthetics and it's finally great
to see a phone come out that is just
entirely different that represents a
true first for the industry the first
dual screened Android phone whether it
makes sense we're gonna help you decide
that for yourself but in this video
we're going to talk about the hardware
what's inside how to operate the phone
in terms of whether you can flip open
the second screen with one hand if you
need to and talk about the ergonomics of
the phone in your head okay so first
let's talk about some accessories that
come with the echo you might remember
that we got this thing in the box which
contained a screen cleaner inside and we
thought that maybe this was some sort of
case but as you can tell there's no way
this could possibly be a case it seems
to be just an extra it's almost like a
business card holder kind of just an
extra thing they include and they
include a screen cleaner because you've
got two times the number of screens to
keep clean so you're gonna want to keep
that handy or at least you know polish
the screen a little bit with a soft
t-shirt because the screen gets really
dirty really easily as you're gonna see
in the in the course of this video now
something else you get is a second
charger you know it's interesting at the
Kyocera events back in February 2011 the
guys from Kyocera were talking about
this phone they were talking about how
this phone with two screens is going to
eat up a lot of battery power and we
were thinking well are they gonna tell
us about some new battery technology
that they that they're releasing with
this phone and no they were just going
to talk about how they're adding a
second battery to the box of the Kyocera
echo which is kind of cheating but
naturally with two displays you're going
to eat up a lot of juice a display is
what uses the most amount of battery
in any phone so with two screens you're
really gonna run low quickly so they
include this charger just pop this in
its 1370 milliamp hours just like the
battery that comes in the echo obviously
you've got a couple of charging options
here and this way you can reduce the
chances that you're going to be running
out of juice in the middle of the day
now how is battery life well it's
actually not that bad
if you leave on automatic screen
brightness but you may not want to do
that because the automatic screen
brightness setting on this device makes
the screen very very dim if you turn off
automatic screen brightness and just get
a little bit of extra brightness so you
can actually see what you're doing
battery life goes down fast I'm talking
2% every minute it's really ridiculous
so most people are going to keep this on
the the automatic screen brightness
settings so that they don't have to swap
the batteries okay so let's talk about
this device I don't think that anyone
would say that this is a good looking
device it looks kind of rugged it looks
kind of asymmetrical we've got a thin
bezel on the left side and a thick bezel
on the right side the reason there's the
thin bezel on the left side you're gonna
see when we pop out the second screen is
to reduce the little bezel between the
two screens so that they kind of flow
together and appear kind of like a
tablet display and it kind of works out
that way although there's always that
black bar there that seems kind of weird
but you get used to it
we've got a set of Android buttons here
and another set of Android buttons on
the other display the way that you know
which ones are active is that the active
buttons will illuminate so it's pretty
easy in that respect we've got a sprint
logo up here with two chrome accents
over on the back we've got a Kyocera
logo we've got a 5 megapixel camera LED
flash and a self-portrait mirror haven't
seen one of those in a while a really
loud speaker which provides a lot of
volume we can pop off the back if we put
a little pressure here and we get the
battery back here the 13 70 milliamp
hour battery now let's talk about what's
inside we've got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 1
gigahertz processor one of the newest
ones it's not dual-core but this device
is actually pretty fast it's also about
512 megabytes of RAM
it has about 500 megabytes of ROM
storage built on on the actual device
but then you get the 8 gigabyte chip
that comes in the box that's a class 4
card so you get a little bit extra
storage there let's turn over to the
side of the device we've got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and kind of an
awkwardly placed power switch then
here's the volume rocker the micro USB
charger and sync port really nothing
else around the device if you look at
this from the profile the sort of
ugliness continues again I don't think
anyone would call this a smell sleek
sexy device it's just it's not it's
thick
it looks squarish it's a box but that's
okay what's really important about this
device are the two screens now both
screens have the same resolution 800
down by 480 across 3.5 inch diagonal now
because each of these displays have WVGA
resolution in a 3.5 inch screen size the
pixels are very very small a lot smaller
than say an Evo or a Desire HD which
packs the same amount of pixels in a 4.3
inch display which means that text on
the screen is very very crisp if you put
these two displays together you get 960
by 800 resolution which is higher than
the iPhone you're getting a lot of
pixels there you're even starting to
rival the amount of pixels you get on a
tablet most tablets have 1024 by 768
resolution again on this you're getting
960 by 800 so you're getting close so
this idea that the Kyocera echo is kind
of a tablet kind of a phone sort of
makes sense in that respect okay so
let's talk about how you actually use
this thing unfortunately it's very
difficult to open up the second screen
with one hand I can try but you want to
make sure that you're over carpet when
you do this because you might drop it
okay so there we go it just popped open
and I'm going to turn off the screen
here to reduce the glare so there are
two positions that you can put the echo
into this is the first position which is
really great when you're typing an email
or something because as you're gonna see
if we go into the Android Market or
something and we pull up the keyboard we
get a keyboard a full very large
keyboard on the bottom there so you
have an HTC Touch pro2 like tilting
screen here but the biggest problem with
that is that now if you tap on the
screen because it's not locked in place
it's kind of move and wiggle all the
time so most people are going to revert
to the second position and by the way
you just saw me try to touch these
Android buttons here but it is the it
are these it are these I should have at
that part out it is these that are
illuminated I'm not gonna edit that out
actually so that's how you know which
buttons to press
so the second position is you put the
screen flat and then you push them
together and then you get the kind of
thin bezel as you can see both of these
have a thin bezel where they touch but
it's not that thin when you put it
together alright let's go to a website
like pocket now and you'll notice that
it does get kind of weird seeing a thick
black line but it's definitely something
you get used to now when you're done in
this view and you want to put the phone
back together so you can actually fit it
into your pocket again it's a little bit
awkward you can't do it with one hand or
at least I haven't been able to after a
day or two of practice what you have to
do is pop it out use a little bit of a
little bit of elbow grease to push it
back over now this hinge so far is
proving to be pretty strong obviously
Kyocera made sure that this hinge could
withstand a lot of abuse because people
were going to be flipping it around many
many times per day and so far so good it
looks to be a really robust hinge that
locks into place although again it would
be nice if it locked in this tilting
position it just kind of hangs there but
most people will put it into the sort of
tablet mode to be able to access it with
both screens sort of facing you in the
same direction so let's put it back and
of course when you put it back on top
it's going to go back into just the
standard Android configuration and now
you're looking at one screen and finally
a note on build quality how does this
feel on the head it actually feels quite
good it is boxy it does feel a little
bit awkward in a day when you've got
devices with rounded edges and you've
got devices with the soft touch plastic
on the back but it's not too bad
actually it's got a lot of weight to it
which might be one of the reasons why
feels high-quality
we give Kyocera high marks in terms of
build quality there's not really much
metal to speak of except if you look at
the hinge I'm sure there's some metal
involved there you have plastic here
plastic up here the screen seems to be
glass pretty sure it's glass there so
pretty good build quality the only thing
we really wish about this device in
terms of hardware's that Kyocera spent
more time to make this a good looking
device we wish that they made a thinner
and we wish that they had made it easier
to slide out the second display because
right now it's it's just awkward and it
takes a lot of practice to get used to
so that was the hardware review of the
Kyocera echo we've got another video
coming up which will explain exactly how
the dual screen configuration works how
you get one app on one screen and one
app on the other what happens when when
a program stretches the app across both
displays and a lot more if you like this
video please give this a thumbs up and
if there's something specific you want
to see in our coverage of the Kyocera
echo drop us a comment and let us know
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
