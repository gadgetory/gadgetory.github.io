about it I'm high as a Houston of the
pocket now and these are my initial
impressions of the Galaxy Note 5 after
24 hours to call it controversial would
be an understatement the Galaxy Note 5
is gorgeous taking from the design of
the galaxy s6 and expanding upon it with
a curved back for improved ergonomics
and of course Samsung's S Pen Stylus the
5.7 inch qHD AMOLED display is among the
best we've ever seen and then bump up to
4 gigabytes of RAM on top of already
unprecedented specs make the note 5 one
of the most powerful and attractive
handsets currently on the market but
this time around there's no longer
support for microSD expansion or a
removable battery two things that until
now have been hallmark features of the
Galaxy Note series whether or not that's
important to you will depend on your
usage but many users are understandably
upset by this change if you manage to
look past that the Galaxy Note 5 has
some of the most comfortable hardware
we've ever seen from Samsung the rounded
back makes the phone feel smaller in the
hand than its 5.7 inch display would
suggest and it almost looks like a
reverse galaxy s6 edge+ that curved
glass is fragile though and it's
slippery as all hell so you might want
to pick out a case before buying this
phone I've got a feeling there's gonna
be a lot more damage devices this year
than with previous notes on the bright
side the display recalls everything we
loved about the galaxy s6
it's tack sharp it has fantastic viewing
angles and it gets plenty bright enough
to see even in harsh daylight underneath
that display of course is an active
digitizer a waiting input from the s-pen
we've all grown familiar with and while
Samsung didn't improve the pressure
sensitivity this time around as it
usually does it did improve how you use
the s-pen you can still access all the
stylus as best features through air
command by pulling it out of its
receptacle when the phone is in use but
take it out while the screen is still
off to reveal a new feature you can out
jot quick notes without having to unlock
the phone and the AMOLED display
conserves battery life in the process
it's a little too early to comment on
battery life as a whole but so far
performance seems solid and reports from
others seems to air on the impressive
side even despite a reduced milliamp
power rating from the note 4
I'm also very impressed by the camera so
far which retains the Galaxy s6 is super
fast access through double pressing the
home button photos are vibrant and full
of color and the F 1.9 lens pulls in
light where other cameras struggle the
front-facing camera is also impressive
and the extra wide-angle almost gives
the effect of having a selfie stick
without the social stigma that goes with
it seriously you can take full body
shots with this thing responsibly of
course if the galaxy s6 is to be
indicative here we're likely looking at
one of the best cameras you'll find on a
smartphone at the moment speaking of the
galaxy s6 the note 5 retains some of the
flagships other features as well like
the excellent keyboard powered by Swift
key and the fast and reliable
fingerprint scanner in my experience
it's not quite up to par with apples
touch ID but it's definitely a close
second that fingerprint scanner will
come in handy when you set up Samsung
pay which I was excited to try out
except that it's not yet available in
the States Google Wallet still seems to
work fine for now for all of your tap
and pay purchases but you'll have to
wait a little bit longer for Samsung's
alternative as a whole the galaxy note 5
seems to be an extremely promising
device for both longtime fans of the
Galaxy Note series and for new users
looking for their first big phone
experience the exclusion of microSD
support and a removable battery may be a
deal-breaker for some and many of the
accused Samsung of losing its way by
essentially making a blown-up Galaxy s6
with an S Pen but like it or not the
Galaxy Note 5 is here to stay and it's
ready to take on whatever the fall of
2015 throws its way these are just our
first impressions but Michael Fisher
will be taking a look at the note 5 for
