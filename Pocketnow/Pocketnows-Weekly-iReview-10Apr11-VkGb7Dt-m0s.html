passage of buttons hybrid eating screens
and more iOS 4.3 point one finally gets
a full jailbreak untethered and a
college student teaches just how to make
50 grand a year by jailbreaking all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi Mary veteran welcome to
the pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week school and it's
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with a cool that's right the iphone 5
rumor mill is coming on strong this time
we have images a Nepali fig next
generation ipod touch sporting a
capacitive home but instead of the
clicking button we're used to now
remember things make it to the next
generation iphone before they make it to
the ipod site so it's a probability
we'll see it on the iphone 5 aside from
that will that does fit the description
of the probable larger screen inside the
current iphone 4 casing and yeah there
were talks of an 8 megapixel camera also
making the device so again rumors well
on the pen side we have apple playing
with their old ipod 30-pin connector to
bring Thunderbolt speeds of 10 gigabits
per second and USB 3 pointers five
gigabits per second though we're still
not sure if that's going to be enabled
through a software update the current
generation iphones or if we can only
expect it on the next generation iphone
5 now judging by the max story where the
current devices then get the same
Thunderbolt that the new ones did don't
expect it aside from that will apples
also playing with a hybrid eat ink
display LCD that will allow you'd have
en con sometimes when you're reading
books and also the same current LCD that
we currently know that way amazon's not
going to be playing with those ads
saying you can't really read books on an
iPad an iPhone aside from that whoa we
also have Apple playing with a probable
vessel that has colors and that also
allows capacitive buttons for you to
play games with controls really cool for
all of us waiting iOS 4.3 point 1
finally got it unto their jailbreak
you'll need the pottage tool on the mac
or snowbreeze on windows or redsnow
what's the difference well the punch
tool and snowbreeze are for those guys
that are out there needing to keep their
base bands for the carrier unlock on
ultrasnow and rhett snow is for anybody
that just wants to jailbreak their
device
now remember and keep in mind that the
dev team has been alerting that iOS 4.3
point one and ultrasnow are not really
working together well so wait before you
make the jailbreak update because it
seems that they need to update something
first aside from that well really cool
that we finally get it according to a
storage newsletter Apple just purchased
12 petabytes of storage for no
particular reason those 12,000 terabytes
would probably serve Apple according to
us to probably bring iTunes streaming
services to the iOS platform since
amazon already beat them to the game
with android but still these are rumors
nothing confirmed but the 12 petabytes
are there let's see what Apple does with
them given their already leaked and well
kevin lee a college student from George
Mason University just landed an
interview on The Washington Post because
the guy makes 50 grand a year by
jailbreaking and unlocking iphones kind
of a cool way to make a living this guy
unlocks and jailbreaks as many as 30 to
40 devices per day from people from
college who don't know how to do it just
gave me an idea you know probably should
consider that as a career move and while
rumors have iOS 4.3 point2 being
released next week but the only cool
news there is that Apple will probably
bring the verizon iphone up to speed
with the GSM iPhone and release number
updates that's pretty much it aside from
that well a lot of bug fixes are
mentioned but we really know that Apple
is trying to close the gap on all the
exploits that allow jailbreak so if
jailbreaks your game might as well be
where and yeah we're getting close to
the not-so-cool section that's pretty
much a mix there
that is our for the coolest continue on
with the not so cool Apple is just
released an application called I ads for
you to watch I ads all day on your
iPhone some I ads are cool really worth
watching but the sad news is having
apple reject an application that was
submitted a year ago from a developer
for no particular reason and then seeing
apple releasing an application that does
exactly the same call that a copycat a
recent survey to more than 4,000 people
show that AT&amp;amp;T customers get fifty
percent more dropped calls than verizon
customers over the same iphone four now
we're not going to blame this on antenna
gate we're going to blame this on a
terrible carrier in certain areas you
know I didn't really complain about AT&amp;amp;T
service in my area but then I went to
Florida a couple of weeks ago and people
would complain about drop calls but I
wouldn't believe him until I would get
as many as six to seven drop calls a day
you know it's kind of disrespectful for
you to be talking AT&amp;amp;T in your left
hanging there alone nobody talking to
you because your calls dropped you
should really work on it and while
everybody heard about that Zion theme
the Toyota released in cydia for
jailbroken iPhones a couple of days ago
but let no more if you were interested
because Toyota got a letter from Apple
asking them to pull it from their
marketing campaign really lame Apple i
mean i would understand for you to be
mad about this if you would offer us a
way to skin our devices but it's not
possible currently you know that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm hi melody I don't remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
