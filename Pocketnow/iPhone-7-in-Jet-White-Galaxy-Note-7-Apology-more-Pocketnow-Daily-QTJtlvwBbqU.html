being a possibility Samsung's apologies
for the galaxy note 7 continue now on
print and qualcomm teases something new
to come from one plus I'm high Meadow
iveta number one do not forget to
exercise your right to vote number two
well I'm gonna be on a mission so the
pocket out daily will return on November
14 this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with LG surely
the LG g5 may not have been the most
popular smartphone of the year but one
thing we do commend LG forest software
updates nugen has just reached their g5
in Korea it should reach unlock variants
very soon and US carrier variant should
reach it soon as well keep you posted
other very interesting news come from
Qualcomm as the company has begun
teasing something cool coming from the
one plus three so we've got the
Snapdragon 801 processor and we're
assuming that that one plus 3t
smartphone would probably be running the
latest and greatest from Qualcomm stay
tuned we cannot wait to hear from that
now as will the spotlight over to
blackberry the company has done a very
admirable job with its dtech lineup in
conjunction with alcatel TCL and it
seems that that will be the case with a
new dtext 70 that is probably coming
soon and what makes this phone popular
is that apparently it will be the
successor to the blackberry primp so we
will have a slide-out keyboard we will
be reporting on that as we learn more as
well now let's talk about Samsung
believe it or not the drama continues
for the company obviously the galaxy
note 7 brought it a lot of bad fanfare
and I do love how the administration of
this company has handled apologies there
was a public apology but the company has
continued with publications in the
United States we see now that the Wall
Street Journal has a full page from
Samsung with its apology its
investigations everything that's going
on hopefully it'll help the company gain
more of a limelight and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
some sketchy reports that apparently
Apple is working on more iphone color
variants why because well the jet black
iphone may not be so popular with it
scratches but doesn't mean that the
company can't make more jet something
devices and the white color was married
to Apple for the longest time so trusted
or should we say sketchy sources in this
case or climbing but
only there is an iphone 7 plus an iphone
7 and jet black but the question of the
day really has to do with your
preferences would you like a jet white
iphone in my case I would why not we got
jet grey in the process as well leave us
