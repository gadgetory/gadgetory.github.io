pacu now calm and today amateur you blue
center and what this is going to allow
you to do is to send up files over a
Bluetooth connection to many different
devices so let's say that you have a
business and you want to advertise a
sale going on or something well all you
have to do is attach a text file so if
you wanted to say that you wanted to
send a file to someone that's walking
into your store you can just add a file
so I've got one right here called sale
and open this up and what I need to do
is I just need to push play and what it
will do is will automatically send that
file to any Bluetooth device within the
proximity so it's about you know 10 to
30 feet whichever however powerful your
bluetooth adapter is in your your pc so
we'll just hit play and at the bottom
will start searching for devices and
it's found two devices within proximity
and right here on the Pocket PC it says
do you want to save sale text and sure
i'll save that and now i have it all
right I've already saved it before so
I'll just open it again it's right here
it says take advantage of our super sale
so that's pretty nice so this program
would be great at a museum or a zoo or
something like that because you can send
pictures and other files so you could
give some sort of like informational
blog to your patrons so I'm just going
to send a picture here and say I've got
this one right here of a giraffe and
it's one point seven five megabytes but
that's okay and I'll just hit it'll
automatically start who's already
playing up here so when it started
sending the picture to the windows
mobile device it says you are receiving
data to stop receiving press cancel so
it will take a little bit of time
because it is a one point set 57
megabyte file so it is a large picture
but if you're walking through the sewer
whatnot you won't even need to snap
photos because you'd have the perfect
shot sent right to your device so that
would be kind of useful so just wait for
this to load we'll just save it to our
device and now we can just go down to
where our documents are and open up the
file and see that it's a picture of a
giraffe you can send any file over it it
does take a little bit for like mp3s or
pictures or whatnot but it works really
well the program is rather expensive so
like I said it's only for like business
owners it does cost around one hundred
and fifty dollars but it does give you a
trial for 15 days and you can send 700
Bluetooth connections and i will post a
link of pocketnow.com is how to get this
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
