and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview next up we're going to
look at the pictures hub there's a lot
of new things here so first off here's
our primary menu you got the camera roll
albums I can sort by date and here's a
new one called people and this is going
to show pictures of people some of them
are just recent context I might have
looked at and these are groups usually
some pictures from those groups are
going to show up there sometimes it
doesn't but you can see that and these
are people that I recently looked at so
let's try this one so now this is
loading pictures from the cloud from
facebook from Windows Live all that are
in albums for the people in this group
and I can look at any of them and even
load some comments so that's really cool
right there in the picture sub and of
course we can swipe to albums and this
is going to load all my photo albums on
the phone on windows live on the cloud
well on facebook when does Live SkyDrive
is the cloud and here's a bug it also
shows videos what's good but they don't
play hopefully that's a bug that'll be
fixed later because that would be really
cool these are videos that were uploaded
uploaded using windows live movie maker
or through windows live messenger video
messaging and so those are just windows
media files so you think they would work
so there's all my photos those are same
as usually Connexus any of them you see
comments
and there's some different things here
no longer does it just load random
thumbnails here and actually loads
favorites so I can see all my favorites
and there's a little menu down here
which makes it a lot easier to choose a
background before we had to tap it hold
on a blank area is pretty hard to find
so now we have that and of course the
what's new feed is here and you can
choose to show updates from only certain
social networks so that's really nice to
have now let's take a picture we still
have the pocket picture feature those
streets the camera I'm going to take a
picture here
and now when I share to Facebook kill a
rope sit down
check out what happens who is this it's
me and now i can set caption
and over here is our menu i can cancel i
can add more tags manually or i can
upload think I don't want this one
uploaded and I still can scroll right to
my camera and we still have this awesome
feature and what about the camera here's
our settings and look at this save
settings that's right you're waiting for
that feature so these settings are all
extensible so Samson added some leaves
themselves you know wide a minute
dynamic range you can choose the
resolution and then I can save that and
so it'll always be like that and here's
the camcorder and same with this by
default it goes to vga resolution and if
remember on original windows phone it
would always go to vga resolution every
time you go to the camcorder which was
annoying if you wanted to take HD video
now I just choose HD and hit save
settings and we're done
and watch this
that just took picture so that's the
touch to focus and take a picture
feature all I have to do is touch the
screen it'll do its focus thing and take
a picture because usually when you're
focusing on something you're probably
going to want to take a picture so when
it's phone just decides to do it for you
that's pretty nice let's look at those
picture settings real quick you got
automatic upload SkyDrive so if you want
and turn that on include location that's
an option and here's a good option keep
location info on uploaded pictures so
when you send it do you really want
everybody on the internet to be able to
see where this picture was taken maybe
not so you can shut that off prevent
accidental camera launched when phone is
locked this is that feature where if the
proximity sensor is covered holding down
the button will not launch the camera
now the reason this is there is because
some people would hold the camera like
this and try to press the button to open
the camera and I want to work because
their hands is covering the proximity
sensor and the phone thinks it's in your
pocket so it doesn't want to be taking
pictures while it's in your pocket but
if you're holding your phone like this
you're going to be confused so we can
shut that off and here is the tap screen
to take pictures feature and you can
choose quick share of course
and here's a video I recorded and you
can just play it this is a picture so
again and previously i want to spend
seven that's really all you could do
play it now here's a menu look at this
share share on facebook you can email it
or i can post to Facebook or SkyDrive so
that is pretty awesome doesn't
automatically go to SkyDrive like you
can do it with the pictures but this is
a really awesome that we can now share
videos so those are some pretty good
additions really nice additions to the
pictures hub and camera features thats
it for our pictures/video be sure to
check out pocket now calm for a full
preview of windows phone mango as well
as Mark pictures and videos that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
