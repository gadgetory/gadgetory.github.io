digital media motorola comes clear as to
why the Moto 360 how software update
delays and it seems that the first nest
products under google supervision are
very close I'm high in very meta and
when it comes to tomorrow's game I both
white Barcelona and Juventus oh let the
best team win this is parking out daily
official news today are extremely
positive sony is not making much money
when it comes to its Xperia lineup but
the company has done an amazing job with
software updates up to the point where
devices that are three years old or
getting lollipop like the Xperia Z and
ZL and if you still hold on to these
phones you can still get android 5.1 as
of july links in the description the
whole xperia z lineup is getting it but
there are also other experience getting
it as well one company that isn't doing
too well when it comes to software
updates is motorola particularly with
the Moto 360 as the company has not
pushed Android 511 to the watch because
apparently they're having performance
issues and they don't claim that it has
anything to do with that TI omap
processor but get that performance
issues they're trying to iron them out
so yeah you will have to wait to get
your new version of lollipop and the
whole new version of Android wear by the
way the motorolas old parent company
Google is working hard on the new
Internet of Things with a nest and
everything that it's acquired we've
heard of project brillo we've heard of a
weave all these different protocols that
Google is building in order to make your
home smarter and we have a July
seventeenth event where we expect more
nests products this time under google
supervision but i know exactly what
we're getting here but reports claim
that we are getting updates which is
both good and bad believe it or not
we've got more official news apple is
not having too much of a good time with
its a beats pill XL as it seems that
even though it provides the quality
sound that we're not going to dub is I
you do get that crazy battery life at a
cost it is over heating up to the point
where Apple is completely willing to
give you a full refund if you want to
send it back they're not confirming of
any batch of units or having these
issues but again linked to lose
scription the source link will lead you
to where you can make your recall with
apple and get your money back and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day even though apple doesn't want
to call the apple TV its longest living
flop it's calling it its hobby it seems
that it's finally making headlines with
this product the company has doubled its
market share over the last quarter and a
lot of it has to do with two things
number one is HBO Go in addition to
other streaming services that are
available but it's also doubling when it
comes to free services so it could also
be the fact that they drop the price to
69 bucks but into the fact that the
google chromecast costs half of that and
there are other options like Roku which
are more affordable in some cases it's
really interesting that Apple TV
overtook Roku when it came to page
streaming services so it doesn't lead me
to the question of the day which is your
streaming box right now what do you use
and that could include your tablet or
computer which is your preferred one in
my case I have them all I like the Apple
TV for certain things but for me and my
favorite is the chromecast leave us a
