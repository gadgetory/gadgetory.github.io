everyone's in a mad rush to review it
then a couple weeks later we're all off
covering the next hot new gadget how a
phone ages is as important as that
initial first impression so let's do
something about that this sophomore
follow up for the v-series was a
multimedia monster a - a major
big-screen player last year LG had an
excellent opportunity to shake this
market up but an oddly times launch and
soft marketing threw a little cold water
on building up some momentum now seven
months later is this phone still a
multimedia monster or is this
performance simply monstrous like in a
bad way how has this phone held up
here's our LG v20 after the buzz the v20
arrived to find LG a company in
transition licking its wounds from the
g4 and v10 boot looping issues stumbling
with the g5 s modular design flop even
if this phone wasn't destined to be a
top seller LG needed at least a critical
victory the ability to show consumers
that this company could course-correct
and deliver and that's exactly what we
got few phones in my review lineup have
been revisited as often as the v20 as a
creative professional there's a feature
set here which really appeals we've
produced several videos on this
multimedia hardware real camera and real
audio reviews comparisons there's
nothing about this phone which hasn't
been examined in detail and even
revisiting it for this video might feel
like something of a rehash the headphone
jack for example remains the absolute
best audio hardware we've ever tested
it's a sublime experience plugging in
nice headphones hearing your favorite
tunes properly driven by great hardware
and we've had a lot of fun revealing
what this hardware is really capable of
like using the microphones to record
narration for a comparison video but
when it comes to reviewing cameras a lot
of testing is often hypothetical a
collection of test shots mixing in some
real-world photos review
take with friends we can point to
features like manual controls in a phone
review and claim they'll benefit folks
who appreciate those kinds of options
it's rare that we actually need to rely
on those features or really put them to
the test for the editorial work we do on
this channel the admission for this
after the buzz no other phone has
delivered anywhere near the amount of
footage used in our actual reviews then
video from the v20 when my samsung
camera sensor cracked entire reviews
were shot on this phone and the proudest
accolade I can deliver is that no one
really noticed I made the transition to
4k video reviews based on how well v20
footage blended in with my mirrorless
cameras nothing hypothetical here this
phone really got the job done a company
in transition the V 20 will likely stand
out as a unique design unto itself it's
a practical look maybe charmingly ugly
like a classic ThinkPad had a baby with
a blackberry we've seen the direction LG
is heading with the g6 and we'd be
surprised if the next V didn't adopt at
least some of this design language but
talking about practicality the overall
durability has been appreciated we lack
the popular option of enhanced water
resistance but milspec 810g drop
resistance is on point for a phone which
is just begging to be used aggressively
out in the field that does bring me to
my first criticism though this hardware
is durable but a flat wide metal surface
can be a bit slick with sweaty hands my
v20 has spent most of its life in a case
not because it really needed one against
general lifestyle abuse but more to add
some grip so I could hold on to it
better the V 20 is also not a battery
champ
if you really use what it has to offer
crank up the screen brightness shoot
some 64 megabit per second video and
then plug into that quad DAC it's not
difficult to drain this puppy by
lunchtime this is a noticeable
improvement over its predecessor black
pro features requires some pro power
back
it is sad to think that this might
represent the last premium option with a
removable battery along with the IR
blaster a feature not widely appreciated
by general consumers but one
passionately used by fans however my
main concern using this phone over these
last several months has been software
support sure LG advertised this is the
first phone to ship with Android 7.0 but
since then we've been waiting on updates
my review unit on Verizon not only still
on 7.0 but also months behind on
security updates this moves us beyond
the philosophical concerns of an
expensive handset not getting software
patches now instead the v20 really could
use a little extra polish cleaning up
some of those hitches stutters and app
loading times we know this hardware is
capable and we're not overly concerned
with how this chipset will age over the
next year but what will keep this phone
running well running longer is better
software refinement so let's wrap this
up seven months later where's that leave
us with the LGV 20 I can't stress this
enough I've leaned on the v20 harder
than any gadget I've ever reviewed in
the past it's the standard by which I
judge every other phone I review for
content creation and multimedia
performance the brute force raw hardware
here is phenomenal
for folks really looking to get
everything they can out of it but this
makes the conversation a bit frustrating
that this Hardware potential hasn't been
fully realized just quite yet yeah
you've heard me say this before the V 20
is a beast it's an absolute monster but
even a monster could use more attention
and just a bit more love as always
