enough to those of us from American
press outlets the concept of a high-end
Samsung smartphone that actually feels
high-end i'm michael fisher with pocket
now and this is a quick hands-on of the
samsung galaxy alpha
okay so the galaxy alpha doesn't go
crazy on specs it's got a 720p display
less than 2,000 milliamp hour battery
and 32 gigs of storage with no micro SD
card but unlike most of the company's
other premium smartphones this one isn't
made to set the spec sheet on fire it's
made to feel great in the hand and it
really does like a lot it's not just the
metal frame that helps the office stand
out though it certainly helps with those
sharp beveled edges and the cool to the
touch material is much more satisfying
than the typical chrome plated plastic
just as important it's the size that
makes the phone so compelling the Super
AMOLED display is only 4.7 inches and as
a result the whole thing is much easier
to manage with one hand with the new
color palette and fine finish even that
dimpled texturing on the back looks good
there at least better than it does on
the s5 elsewhere the specs fall in line
with Samsung's 2014 high-end errs
fingerprint scanner 12 megapixel camera
Exynos octa-core trade scanner and so on
you know the rest and the software is
the typical TouchWiz with all the ups
and downs that carries to be honest the
software isn't attractive enough to live
up to the hardware which is something we
don't often find ourselves saying about
Samsung devices so while it seems like a
backhanded compliment it's the truth
Samsung has crafted something beautiful
with the Galaxy alpha and if this is a
sign of things to come there's lots to
be excited about presuming the software
catches up this much more to come from
Samsung and everyone else it for 2014 in
Berlin so stay tuned for much more as
our coverage continues until next time
this is Ben michael fisher with pocket
now with taylor martin behind the camera
see on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
