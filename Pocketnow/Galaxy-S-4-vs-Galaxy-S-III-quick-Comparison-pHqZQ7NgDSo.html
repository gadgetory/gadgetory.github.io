s3 I'm Tom that we brought along with us
the foreign peek out from behind this is
the new Galaxy s4 which we just saw in
the Brandon tanga hands on and just take
a look at the physical characteristics
you can see right away here look at
those bezel sizes we can maybe get a
close-up in the space between those
phones and galaxy s3 bearing a much much
wider bezel than than the new one and
while we're in the vicinity of the bezel
also check out the kind of gel foam
brush one lasted a full brush metal with
classic in the s3 been replaced by this
very Glen teen thing this is not a
chamfered edge or beveled edge isn't see
on the iphone 5 minus you see one of
these but it looks like it because it is
much much shinier and also you can see
this kind of texture that we might not
be able to take us on camera the s3 here
is just completely smooth glossy well no
no pattern at all underneath the hyper
glaze whereas on the s3 podium around
back you can see maybe in this white one
here society no pattern it is not
textured how this feels this feels
exactly the same peaks it may be the eye
bruh glaze on the new esco feeling a
little bit less than you actually look
at the size camera
lens lens cover is few to that 13
megapixel sensor and unless my eyes are
deceiving WM that lens is larger verizon
version of the LTS three year but the
processor inside the s4 is substantially
more powerful version you're talking
about we don't have official
confirmation on site here but definitely
at least one version of the s4 pack in
the dock to court and if I we can hear
exclaims obviously was on the same
wallpaper here unlock the display this
is a full 1080p Super AMOLED display at
four point nine nine inches on the left
on the galaxy s4 smart stay activated
here one of the signatures carried over
from the s3 about a detention elias
board obviously this lower back and only
to 720p display you can really see that
difference it's best you'd fire up a
video here I'll show you not only has
the color saturation been retained a
little bit about the resolution the
increased resolution is for people the
errant to be sensor
before we get too far away from the
physical dimensions we should mention
that the s4 is only five grams lighter
than the s3 but it feels substantially
likely feels much lighter than that in
the hand I don't know what what kind of
magic physics apply here the Radio City
Music Hall but the s4 definitely has a
much different feel in the hand it looks
at well it looks a bit more like the
note too that is certainly nowhere near
the size of the note to you see the
speaker has been moved from the upper
right down to the lower left on the s4
he's in the / has been moved around a
little bit you know these are kind of
minor minor minor changes but speak in
the note to some features have been
adapted from that device the new
enhanced airplay like functionality or
air view like functional Rican I'm not
sure you can get an angle here you can
kind of hover your finger over the lock
screen I'm not touching the lock screen
but it is responding to my proximity I
can use this display with gloved hands
if I want to and if we happen to
something like the gallery by the way
while we're doing that you'll notice the
TouchWiz is almost completely unchanged
between these two devices I mean that
TouchWiz almost could not have been
given a more subtle revamp if we can
even call it a revamp its basically the
same nature UX but in the gallery
instead of just instead of touching it
if your hand row full catch up or
something like that maybe you're a big
fan of fast food you can swipe your hand
right over the display to scroll between
images to scroll between video
and so on which is pretty cool and also
we can't demo it on camera right now so
can't get a good angle but there's also
the enhanced smarts a function at ur we
can look at the bottom of say a browser
window the device will scroll for you
we're going to check and see how how
well that responds but compared to the
smart stay only functionality on the s3
that's a significant improvement on that
shows some innovation in the skin that
has otherwise substantially the same so
once again just a quick look at the
galaxy s3 vs. the galaxy s4 here at the
samsung hwajae bed at Radio City Music
Hall Michael with pocket now Brandon
behind a camera stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
