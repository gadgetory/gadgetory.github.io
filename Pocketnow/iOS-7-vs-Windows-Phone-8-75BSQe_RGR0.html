more mature than ever and Apple's got a
new look but how do they compare I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is I Oh s7 versus Windows Phone 8 in
general Android and iOS are considered
the two most competitive smartphone
operating systems after all a third
platform Windows Phone has only recently
proven itself a viable contender slowly
gaining traction worldwide it's easy to
forget how dominant Android truly is but
we'll put it this way as of q2 2013
Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows
Phone are much closer in global market
share than Android and iOS our Android
has captured nearly 80 percent of the
global smartphone market share
iOS holds 13.2% and Windows Phone holds
3.7 156 point 2 million units shipped
separated Android and iOS for the
quarter only twenty two point five
million units separated iOS from Windows
Phone let that marinate for a minute and
while you do we're going to put these
two platforms head-to-head unlike
yesterday's comparison between iOS 7 and
Android 4.3 Windows Phone 8 and iOS 7
have very little in common both
interfaces utilize beautiful typography
and minimalist design in very different
ways the iOS 7 interface is extremely
colorful and bright fresh and vibrant we
suppose it uses a whitewash design
pastels and neons this promotes a very
youthful feeling platform it's composed
of layers and dimensions twist the phone
in your hand and a parallax effect
creates the illusion that your home
screen icons are floating above your
wallpaper the notification shade is like
a slightly transparent glass pane you
pull down over your home screen and this
dimensional appearance can be viewed
throughout the system the home screen
although it looks quite different is the
same home screen from before on 4-inch
models the icons are laid out in a 5 by
4 grid creating space for 20 slots which
can be filled with either icons or
folders the bottom dock is static and is
composed of four slots folders are
paginated without a hard limit
additionally you can change the
wallpaper and that's virtually the
extent of the iOS homescreen it's
concise and well functional the Windows
Phone home screen allows for slightly
more custom as they
although the homescreen is also a grid
instead of horizontal pages of icons it
uses a vertical scrolling grid of
various tile sizes small medium and
large depending on the size of the tiles
they display varying amounts of live
updated information battery status info
the unread email count in your inbox etc
the major difference between these two
is that not every application has to be
displayed on the home screen in Windows
Phone pull the home screen to the left
and an alphabetical list of all apps
installed is shown which can be quickly
navigated by the letter dividers both
offer the same short-lived excitement
not long after the initial setup process
the appeal and the mystique of the home
screens wear off so if you're after
extreme customization neither of these
platforms will appeal to you but that's
not to say they're terribly boring or
inefficient they look great
each in its own way and they get the job
done exceptionally well our least
favorite part of both operating systems
at least visually and conceptually are
their respective settings apps both are
garbled messes and are in need of some
organizing settings for individual apps
can still be found in the stock Settings
app on iOS and Windows Phone setting app
has no rhyme or rhythm to its order or
disorder the two platforms are on a
fairly level playing field in terms of
functionality while incoming
notifications are handled almost
identically with a temporary banner at
the top of the display iOS has unified
area for notifications called
Notification Center which is accessed by
pulling down from the top of the display
when this phone does not dragging down
from the top of the display only reveals
the status bar signal ringer status
battery etc the only indicator of missed
notifications are the live tiles on
Windows Phone which work and there are
small previews at the bottom of the lock
screen but this could certainly be
better Windows Phone also has no native
way to quickly toggle settings iOS
didn't either until last week now it has
control center which is accessed by
pulling the shade up from the bottom of
the display you can toggle Wi-Fi
Bluetooth do not disturb torch airplane
mode music controls adjust the
brightness and much more but less we
forget iOS has its own hurdles Apple
doesn't allow third-party sharing
natively developers must code support
for individual services in their apps
else they're left with only a few
presets sharing
Chen's email SMS Facebook Twitter etc in
that regard Windows Phone is much more
like Android to share a picture to the
unofficial Instagram client six tag
simply locate the image in the Photos
app at the share charm and select six
tag on iOS you must leave the gallery
open Instagram tap compose tap the
Gallery icon then find the image within
your albums it's several more steps and
when you complicate the process like
copying and pasting back and forth
between apps this can be a problem
on that note multitasking is roughly the
same on both the task switching menus
look a lot alike but iOS has an
advantage in closing apps simply flip
the card view upward to dismiss Windows
Phone simply doesn't have this feature
period Windows Phone looks and feels
much more rudimentary part of which can
be blamed on how utterly minimal UI is
but when you consider that iOS is over 7
years old and Windows Phone is not yet 3
the fact that these two are comparable
in many ways particularly in utility and
functionality it is quite impressive on
Microsoft's part i OS does have one
major leg up on Windows Phone ecosystem
its App Store is filled with over 950
thousand applications and games its
digital content library is expansive and
filled with the highest quality content
available on iTunes and iCloud help keep
the phone seamlessly synced with other
AI devices or your Mac Microsoft has
started building out its ecosystem but
SkyDrive Office Live and the Windows
Phone store still need plenty of work it
has tons of potential however with the
Xbox brand on its side room for game
development is endless
the shared interface across all
Microsoft products is great for user
friendliness and it's AB catalog Windows
Phone store has experienced fairly
substantial growth in its first few
years
achieving 170,000 apps in August while
that may sound like a ton of apps to
choose from a fair helping of those are
second rate knockoffs or third-party
clients for unsupported services we have
a ton of hope for the store but in its
current state which is improving don't
get us wrong it can't quite compete with
the likes of iOS and the utterly massive
App Store it too has its own share of
terrible apps though but the sheer
number of incredible applications and
services available
i OS many of which start on iOS before
branching out to other platforms far
outweighs the bad
the big feature of iOS is Siri in iOS 7
it too got a facelift and some new
features to boot not only can you ask it
questions about the weather movie times
actors and practically anything else you
can toggle hardware and connectivity
through voice commands unfortunately
Windows Phone doesn't have a virtual
assistant the dedicated search button
brings up the Bing search from anywhere
within the OS and you can use that to
voice search but the experience just
doesn't compare it's no different than
simply typing to search it doesn't speak
answers to you it doesn't intelligently
aggregate information and it doesn't try
to be human
fortunately Windows Phone 8.1 will
reportedly bring Cortana Microsoft's own
entry into the digital assistant realm
both Windows Phone 8 and iOS 7 offer the
most impressive speed and polish in use
that said opening applications does
generally seem to take a little longer
on Windows Phone but it's difficult to
do a direct comparison it's easiest to
put it this way both platforms perform
well and rarely have any hiccups
stutters lag etc but Windows Phone has
to resume applications even after short
pauses its miniscule but worth noting if
you open virtually any app bump the
power button hit it again and unlock the
application will take a second or two to
resume on iOS this is not an issue
fortunately it's only a second or two
these days the resume times used to be
upwards of 10 seconds so what can we
learn from all of this one
Windows Phone is finally blossoming into
a viable operating system it's got more
polish than many give it credit for but
it still has plenty of room to grow
and although iOS is older more mature
and has more to offer with its ecosystem
such as nearly full support for Google's
ecosystem while Windows Phone has
virtually no official Google support for
anything it too could stand some
improvements both look great perform
well and are reliable so we're asking
you of these two which would you choose
Windows Phone 8 or iOS 7 for us honestly
it's a tough call we rely heavily on
Google services so if they had to choose
just one we'd almost have to go with iOS
but that's not to say Windows Phone
isn't great it uses a refreshing take on
mobile UI
uses beautiful typography and it's
growing more impressive with each and
every update that's going to do it for
