calm and today we're gonna take a look
at Nokia music I know what you're
thinking to really need another music
store but what if it had free unlimited
offline downloads for music playing
let's check that alright here we are in
the Nokia Music app and it's got your
usual panoramic design so we have the
play we have mix radio we have to store
we have gigs which is pretty cool and
this your main menu so with play you can
choose music on your device as well as
mixes let's go back here and there's a
couple mixes here's a mix radio so let's
do more right here so we can choose all
sorts of different genres and one thing
that's pretty cool if you just tap it
it's gonna start streaming but what I
really want to show you is the offline
capabilities so if I tap and hold I get
make available offline
so that'll download the whole mix to my
device so I can listen to it without
having an internet connection
now if we go back here you see there's
an offline tab so this will list all
your mixes that you've made available
offline and if we tap and hold you can
also refresh it so that'll download all
new songs and we can have new music
there you also notice the pin to start
that's pretty nice feature so let's do a
plain offline
now you'll notice an issue here there is
no back button so if you like a song and
you want to play it again sorry not
possible you do however have a download
button which will let you buy it so even
though I have it available offline
you can only play it really once and
then it goes to the next one unless I
buy it there's a menu down here you can
share it pretty cool there is no
integration with the Zune Marketplace
and the Windows Phone store so if you
already have a subscription you can't
really access the song however there's a
little cool little feature while I'm
playing if I hit the search I can do
being music search and then I can
actually download the song with a Zune
and you see the music still plays in the
background
and of course it integrates was the
normal Flair so we have positive they're
pretty nice
now the create tab this is something
special since you can't really search
for specific songs they want download
you can really only download mixes for
offline uh usage you can create a mix
based on an artist that you like so let
me type something and it'll search for
that and we can actually add more than
one artist if you want to make a really
good mix yeah and then we can play mix
right there and it'll stream it and then
down here we can make the whole mix
available offline now the personalized
tab is pretty cool too you can sync your
music profile from your desktop computer
and it'll get kind of an idea of what
your taste in music is it's how it works
now of course there is a store where you
can buy music and there's the search
field and there's more
so you can see all the normal content
and fine songs this way gigs is pretty
cool it shows concerts in your area kind
of 20 miles away and we'll take a quick
look at the settings
so there you go no cue music with free
download for offline listening of
special mixes and mixes that you can
create so I hope you enjoyed this feel
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
