that is something that our coast seems
to recognize here we are going to check
out very quickly the Archos chef pad the
archives 8 0 Z nan and the Archos 10.1
XS 2 let's see what these three very
different tablets have to offer
so this is the ARCA chef head it is the
lowest end in the in the lineup and it
is not differentiating based on
traditional specs here we'll talk about
that screen in a second but you notice
this kind of silicon cover over the
tablet the tablet ends far before it but
this cover comes in the box because as
you might have guessed by its chef pad
name this is meant to be used in the in
the kitchen
that's a 8 excuse me that's a 2
megapixel back-cam it's also a 2
megapixel front camera get some swipe
marks on the screen they're all good and
powered on this display looks a lot like
the display on the HP TouchPad the
resolution is 1024 by 768 it is not
trying to blow you away as far as pixel
density goes and probably that holds
true for performance stamina so we're
pretty zippy here to to a degree oh we
got notifications down here sorry about
that anyway
this is meant to get dirty and nasty and
mean in the kitchen and to get flour all
over it and there are some apps you can
download to take advantage of that front
facing camera for some Samsung like
gesture screen moving anyway then
there's a special little zone of the
Play Store this chef HAP's
which we're not finding anyway that's
the chef pad let's move up to the mid
range if we can and a smaller tablet
than you might expect when we're moving
up in in terms this is the Archos 8 0
xenon or the 80 xenon
this is an 8 inch display which might
seem hard to believe because these
vessels are really really big this
reminds us a little bit of a Galaxy Note
8.0 actually with these bezels that lets
you grip the tablet without worrying
about touching the screen and also
you'll notice the earpiece up top
Anton really wanted to do this video but
you know it's it's his favorite type
design but you can actually hold this to
your head the court is not is not long
enough for me to demo it but you can do
this if you want to because it has a 3G
radio inside the cellular connectivity
and so on if you're interested in the
specs on this one this is a 1024 by 768
as well
IPS GPS onboard Aaron Android 4.1 jelly
bean by the way if you're wondering
about that build it is a very close to
stock build of Android jelly bean except
we've still got the notification area
down below where we tend to like it
finally ending up with what we think is
probably the most interesting thing on
the table at least to us Darko's 10-1 XS
- this is powered by a quad-core
processor at 1.6 gigahertz quite GPU as
well 2 gigs of ram the IPS display is
1280 by 800 these are not competing
crazy on resolution but you pop the
tablet out of its doc here there's a
magnetic action going on you go ahead
and I'll show you the dock arrangement
go ahead and flip this back knock it
down there and then these devices come
right together to protect the display a
lot like a netbook or an ultrabook or
something like that you go ahead and
separate them again and popping them
together is a little bit more convoluted
thanks to this origami like doc Stan
once you get the hang of it and just pop
it right in there this was announced I
believe our coach tells us just a couple
days ago once again very stock like
Android the stereo speakers here
keyboard with somewhat minimal travel
but that's to be expected given the
thickness of the device or really the
lack thereof so just a quick look at the
latest line of interesting somewhat nish
somewhat unique tablets from Arcos we're
still at Aoife that's still N Tom do you
know J I'm still Michael Fisher we're
still Pocket now keep watching and stay
tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
