second quarter of 2012 we go hands on
the much expected Motorola Droid 4 and
according to NVIDIA quad-core phone
should ship this quarter all this and
more coming up right now hello everyone
I'm Hine that'll be better with
packing.com and welcome to Android
revolution the show we go through what's
hot and what's not inside the world of
Google's Android project let's start
this week off with what's hot now call
this a rumor or report whatever you want
but it seems that Google is already
working on Android 5.0 jelly bean to be
released somewhere around June or July
of this year now you'd wonder I mean Ice
Cream Sandwich is barely a couple of
months old there's pretty much only one
device out there in the market which is
the Galaxy Nexus that has it so you
wonder what Google's thinking about and
well the rumor has it that apparently
they're planning on bringing another
tablet centric operating system to the
market and apparently you'll also be
able to run Windows 8 on that same
tablet whenever Windows 8 is capable of
running on ARM chips
whenever Windows 8 launches but not
really sure what's going on here not
really sure if Google wants to follow
that path because apparently well
honeycomb was all a mistake and they
were working on getting ice cream
sandwich to the market to get rid of all
that complexity with two operating
systems so not sure what to make of that
again this is just the rumor okay let's
continue on and let's move the spotlight
over to HTC because apparently well we
finally got notice of other HTC devices
that are getting Ice Cream Sandwich we
already know that the sensation the
radar and also the reason we're getting
Ice Cream Sandwich but now we get word
that The Rime the Thunderbolt and also
the Droid Incredible S are getting the
OS upgrade now interesting enough is the
fact that while the Thunderbolt is part
of the HTC ace line of devices and we
haven't heard anything about the Desire
HD or the Evo 4G so let's see where that
leads and well what's this about this
weird one line of devices that HTC is
planning on bringing out first of all
remember that endeavor edge leaked that
we had recently well apparently HTC is
going to have a 1x device being released
at MWC and that's gonna be pretty much
the same variant to the edge and the
and then aside from that we're gonna
have the 1s which is gonna be the Vil
not sure what they're working on and
finally it seems that HCC is also
working on bringing a Playstation
license device and trust me with the
terrible hardware that we saw with the
PlayStation wait a second it was the
Xperia Play which I even forgot the name
because it was a terrible device it's a
little hardware but if HTC could come up
with something even better hey I'm open
to get that all right let's set the
spotlight over to motorola because there
are good things and bad things to talk
about first of all on the good side well
the DOJ and the European Union have just
approved that google buys Motorola
Mobility now when is that going to
happen well we're gonna have to wait for
the rest of Asia to approve that but at
least things are working and well on
another good note we recently cut really
good lease on the first Intel powered
Motorola smartphone to be released then
well looks really good with Ice Cream
Sandwich and they finally drop all that
black looks really good so far on that
device now when are we gonna get it
hopefully at MWC but we never know out
of this week's coverage make sure you
catch Joe Levi's Android guy weekly show
where he rants and gives you just about
everything he thinks about from Android
and where it's going aside from that
we'll Joe also has his hands on the much
expected Motorola Droid 4 we never
thought would get released but it's
finally here so far well looks pretty
good and interesting but watch the
videos because there are things that are
not common at all Joe also later gives
us a full video of how the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus extended battery works on
the device so far looks really
interesting
and he then provides us a full video of
swipe for Ice Cream Sandwich which also
seems really good finally dan Webster
brings us a full review of the Pantech
Burst for AT&amp;amp;T which somehow is not
gonna make you burst in tears it seems
that pantech came out with something
really good so read the review for that
now NVIDIA recently came on record to
state that well we're gonna get
quad-core processors on Android really
soon as soon as this quarter this
quarter is about to be over so not
really sure if that's gonna be real I
mean we've been waiting for kal-el to be
released for the longest time it's still
they promised it let's hope they keep
that promise and hopefully we'll see
something at MWC and we probably could
see a couple of devices running it we
already know that HTC the
of raining quad-core processors as of
their new batch coming up so hopefully
that's going to be the case okay so that
does it for what's hot let's continue on
with what's not and well it seems the
Motorola can't stop disappointing Google
just bought the company or so it will
soon and you think that the parent
company would are either do something
for their new son company and at least
get them to release updates for their
phones quickly but if you recently saw
the post about when devices are getting
Ice Cream Sandwich it's pretty much
gonna be q3 2012 now I know a lot of you
are disappointed because well you bought
the Droid Razr expecting yes it will get
ice cream sandwich whatever Ice Cream
Sandwich got announced and you were
probably expecting that to happen in the
next couple of months but now it's
pretty much gonna happen almost a year
after the device gets released so it's
really sad to see that moto can't really
get up there mojo or whatever that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Jaime every veteran to give
us a thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
