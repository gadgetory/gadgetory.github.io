10-plus have emerged because why not at
this point it looks like the Galaxy Note
X will have you feeling like James Bond
with an S Pen alternative and Apple's
head of retail is leaving the company
maybe because of the decline in sales
I'm Jaime Rivera and isn't it sad the
tide gained today in the classical it
was so good this is Mario daily the
official news today begin with
interesting twists we've seen Netflix
make a move into their own content same
as Amazon Prime video and well now
Spotify joins the crowd by acquiring
gimlet and anchor these both are
podcasting companies they are fantastic
I'm a big fan of reply all by the way
and well now it seems that Spotify is
going to start creating its own content
when that's a good question now let's
talk about LG as the company has just
unveiled a very interesting new twist in
televisions as they just released their
new transparent o LEDs they allow up to
38 percent transparency meaning you can
definitely be able to see what's behind
the TV with it at the front which most
probably will be very practical for
glasses and I don't know it's just
interesting that we're looking into a
solution for the selfie camera and the
notch and all this and yeah transparent
OLED why not the spotlight over to Apple
is we've got an interesting corporate
shake-up we wonder if it's intentional
or not obviously sales haven't been good
but the head of retail is stepping down
over the next couple of weeks there's a
new replacement already named you can
see everything in the description we
wonder if it's because of the low sales
or what but definitely Apple retail is
probably will the coolest parts of this
company so I hope that that continues
now let's move the spotlight over to the
samsung galaxy note as well there is
this patent that allows for a camera to
be fit even with optical zooming in the
s-pen of some galaxies and the patent
even mentions the name samsung galaxy x
so yeah in the past role right now with
a galaxy note 9 you can take photos with
your S Pen by using it as a trigger now
you'll actually be able to take photos
with the
than fully and finally the hottest news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 of course let us know in the
comments if you guys want to watch a
room around that we actually posted one
today
Jules Wang did an amazing job compiling
all the rumors and the leaks of the
galaxy s 10 s 10 e and s 10 plus and
we've got more leaks we've got the S 10
EBU ting up we also see more color
variants out of which one seems to be a
ceramic back let us know in the comments
down below what do you think of all this
batch of rumors it's just been crazy all
the leaks that we've seen for the SN and
I really like what we're getting here
that's just me we'd love to know what
you think in the comments down below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm backing out
on comments scratched about our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one you follow me on twitter how
many underscore get on instagram at any
metadata please give this video a thumbs
