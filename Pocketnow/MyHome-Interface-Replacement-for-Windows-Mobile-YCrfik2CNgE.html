pocketnow.com one of the biggest changes
to windows mobile 6.1 was the addition
of this sliding panel interface that
they added to non touch screen devices
like the blackjack the blackjack to the
motorola q 9h it was really great
because it kind of brought out all of
the the programs and the functions that
you would do on your device and have to
dig through the start menu and put it
right on your main screen so from here
you can check if you have new voicemail
new messages you can see your next
appointment you can set up email work
with songs and messaging look at photos
and change your profile right from one
screen and it was fantastic and one of
the biggest complaints was that
Microsoft didn't bring this to touch
screen devices well there's a company
called s hbt out of Hungary that has
created an interface for touchscreen
devices that is very similar to the
sliding panel interface that is on
windows mobile 6.1 standard and I'm
going to show it to you now okay so let
me take you through this and I should
mention that this will work on any
windows mobile touchscreen device as
long as you have a cue vga or VGA screen
so it won't work on the xperia x1 or a
device like the LG insider samsung omnia
so anyway we've basically two elements
here we have the windows mobile 6.1
sliding panel interface and then we have
the kind of windows mobile seven leaked
screenshot look down here this is what
it looked like in the leaked screenshots
of 7 and let me take you through this so
we start at the top here and we have it
says home panel it has my name the date
and the time if I go to the right I get
the weather panel and if I click in word
on the weather panel I'll get kind of an
extended forecast kind of thing and this
weather panel is actually an extra that
you have to pay for so it's it's about
five euros which comes out to about
eight or nine dollar so it may not be
worth it to you to have that we go over
to the right and we have the media
player so we can kind of watch the
tracks that we're playing if we go down
one level we have the same notification
area that we had in windows mobile 6.1
standard but unfortunately I can't just
tap right on to outlook it just goes
right to that panel or that the sliding
panel so I can go to the right and I can
see any voice messages I have or text
messages or outlook email of course I
have none of that I can go down and we
have the same exact appointment a panel
that we do
on the standard devices so we've next
appointment here tapping on this will
take me to the calendar if I close out
of that I'll go back into there and if
we go to the right we can make a new
appointment I'm going down here we can
change the profile and you actually get
into a different interface that's custom
to this program we can turn on vibrate
or normal we can actually turn the
backlight on or off to save power we can
soft reset right from here so a nice
little addition and if we filter this to
the right we see wireless manager
bluetooth is off Wi-Fi is on ringtone we
can change the ringtone theme settings
and this is actually a little bit unique
because this is kind of the the settings
for the program so we can determine
whether there is a left softkey or right
softkey if we actually go back to the
today screen so let me go back to the
day screen I left it blank here just so
it wouldn't hog up memory and here are
the two soft keys that I've set for the
program and here we are back in there if
I go to options I can change the theme
to a variety of colors or are they
actually have different skins that you
can get from the website and there are
some other things here like click events
and and some some more advanced things
that you can play with so I'm going to
go to close here and I don't want to
save the changes and i'll go back into
the interface ok so let's continue
downward if we go to the bottom most
section we get kind of a program
launcher and we can click on photo it'll
take a store camera settings will go
right into settings and so on and so
forth if we get all the way to the
bottom if we press on this center button
we actually open the start menu which is
pretty convenient if we press exit we're
back into the standard windows mobile
interface and if we press on my home we
get back into that and one final thing
to note what happens when we slide open
the keyboard on the touch pro well it
doesn't really work too well it doesn't
scale to landscape unfortunately but I
really think that this is made to be
used with of course it's all messed up
right now it's made to be used with one
hand if you're walking down the street
and you want to quickly access your
messaging you kind of use the d-pad with
one hand they don't expect you to use
both hands and open it up like so I
think that's kind of the premise behind
my home so what do I think of this well
it doesn't have the
bust NIST of spb mobile shell so it
doesn't give you access to internet
favorites and multiple programs it's not
as customizable nearly as customizable
as spb mobile shell but again as I've
been emphasizing through this video I
think this is a really good solution for
those who want someone handed usability
back in windows mobile touch screen you
can do everything pretty much from the
d-pad and you can see your missed calls
and your missed messages and and your
next appointment really quite easily
from this pretty intuitive interface but
again it's twenty-six dollars and that
may not be worth it too so that's it for
now on my home from sh BTW i'll post
links on pocketnow.com on how to get it
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
