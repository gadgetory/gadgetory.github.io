packing.com and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which we review five applications in 30
seconds each and these are the great
applications from the Android Market so
let's get started so the first
application is called audio manager
console and you can either have it set
up as a widget or you can select it from
your application list right here so I'm
just going to go back and if this
application allows me to control all the
different audio settings for my device
so if I want to have my alarm at a
certain volume I can change that I can
change my alert volume I can set
vibrates to those certain items I can
change system volume voice call volumes
and it can also go down into settings
this application is free on the android
market this application is called speed
view and it is a free speedometer that
uses the gps chip inside of your android
device so it's a pretty simple
application of course we're not moving
right now so you won't see any speed
come up on the display here but it will
show you the exact mileage and also give
you the direction that you're traveling
can change some of the settings down
here so if you want to have just a
dashboard look you can change it to
compass heads-up display or advanced so
the heads-up display looks just like the
speedometer so if i was traveling at
let's say 30 miles an hour it would show
30 miles an hour so if you like to eat
out then this application is for you and
it's called urbanspoon into this free on
the android market it's pretty simple
you can either shake your device to use
the accelerometer or you can hit the
shake button right here to select
different cities categories and of
course prices and you can also set a
lock so let's say i wanted to have a
moderately priced food item i can select
the lock there and click shake or shake
my device and it will now select what
kind of food i would like and give me a
suggestion down below it shows that
seventy-nine percent like this this
application is called qi mode and it is
free on the android market it's a pretty
cool application because you can use it
over your Wi-Fi connection as a remote
control for your computer so right here
i have it set up as gmail touch so you
can see on the screen i'm using it as a
a trackpad I can just select this image
here and it loads of course I can also
browse files view the on-screen keyboard
I can go to the remote settings and
browse files I can play them either on
my phone or my computer from my computer
drive yelp has been around for a while
but now it's available on the android
devices and this is free on the android
market and it's a pretty cool
application because you can view nearby
items so let's say you wanted to find a
restaurant that was close by you can do
that by clicking on the restaurants and
it will use the GPS or the cell phone
tower proximity to find the location of
where you are and here's a few
restaurants cool thing about this
application that gives actual user
reviews if you had used the monocle you
can take a picture of a business
restaurant or whatnot and get the
information right to your device so this
has been another episode of the android
application weekly where we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so make
