cellphone market some companies are
looking at undercutting pricing some
companies are trying to refine their
style
there's always room to experiment though
focusing on a specific feature and
building a phone around that feature hey
soos is looking to impress with a proper
hardware zoom on this camera I'm Juan
Carlos Pagnell for PocketNow and here
are my first impressions of the Asus
zenfone zoom
I've always happy to see simple stylish
packaging and the phone greets you upon
opening the lid this review unit sent
from Asus PR had no plastic to pull off
the screen but was pretty well stocked
we've got a lanyard strap pair of
headphones a micro USB cable the charger
and all your warranty and quick set-up
papers that none of us ever read but
probably should immediately this phone
is bigger than I thought it would be
looking at the press photos we're into
v10 territory here and the rounded back
makes the phone feel a bit chunkier than
it really is it's a great practical
build though reminding me of phones like
the Moto X metal edges with a textured
leather backplate the combination
materials it feels good in the hand and
should be easy to hold onto this Ridge
right here for example is a nice touch
for bracing a finger all of our controls
are on the right hand side volume rocker
power button video recording button and
a two-stage camera shutter for so many
people that rely on their phones is
their main cameras I'm always happy to
see phones that still have dedicated
camera buttons I wish more phones had
these the 1080p screen looks like it'll
be bright enough to use as a viewfinder
for shooting outside and a soos is
really touting the audio capabilities on
his hardware so I'll be curious to give
the speaker and headphone to listen for
the full review the back is removable
which provides access to the SIM card
and microSD card slot but the battery is
built into the phone hardware and is not
user replaceable we'll have to see how
the 3000 milliamp hour cell holds up
when we tear into the camera what we're
really interested in is this disc on the
back which houses a 13 megapixel image
sensor with optical image stabilization
and proper Hardware zoom now most phones
zoom by cropping the image this hardware
by a soos provides a 3x optical zoom
which maintains the full resolution of
the sensor overall the phone really does
look like a point-and-shoot camera and
this is my first review of a phone using
an Intel processor the atom
three five eight zero to be specific
firing it up for the first time we got
through the first boot quickly enough
though asus has quite a bit of setup
software to guide you through signing
into all of your accounts and the phone
ships with quite a bit of cough cough
value-added software you know this is
also my first experience with the Zen UI
launcher it's a bright colorful skin
which brings a ton of customizations to
Android but the jury is still out if
I'll be able to handle this app drawer
it's a fascinating experiment we've seen
a few manufacturers attempt a proper
camera phone in the past as a camera
snob I'm always excited to see another
manufacturer walk into this space and in
poking around the camera app it looks
like there's a lot of potential here now
people know about a sous branded phones
it's likely because of lower cost
offerings does the zoom have the right
stuff to get customers to part with five
hundred and thirty dollars here in the
States for an unlocked phone you know
we'll be putting this camera through its
paces and taking a look at how it stacks
up against other top-tier smartphone
shooters oh and we'll probably get
around to reviewing the smartphone side
of the equation too so what's the first
photo I should share from this camera
how should I go about testing the video
drop us a comment below with your ideas
we'll see if we can produce some fun
content from this phone to share with
you fine folks make sure you subscribe
to this channel to catch our future
coverage of the Asus zenfone zoom and
hit that thumbs up button to help us out
with a little positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm one Carlos back now you
can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
has some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
