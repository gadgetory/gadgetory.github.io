geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the iOS app picks in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it data usage is a
paid for application that costs 99 cents
on the App Store what this app allows
you to do is keep track of all of your
data that's coming through and out based
on your cellular and Wi-Fi connection so
here i have my current billing cycle and
it just started so i've used quite a bit
of data in just this a little amount of
time so here you can view exactly how
much data i have and if you do not have
unlimited data plan you can see how much
data you have remaining in the settings
we can change various i can either go to
megabytes gigabytes or kilobytes and I
have other settings that i can change
the Incredible Machine is a paid for
game across 99 cents on the App Store
the object of the game is to position
various tools and other objects onto the
screen so that you're able to get the
bowling ball here on this level into
this basket so I'm going to play and the
cats going to chase the mouse the mouse
is going to go after the cheese and we
continue we got one start here and we'll
hit the bowling ball hopefully goes in
and we've got all three stars and now we
can move on to the next level and they
become more and more challenging
photosynth is a free application to
build on the App Store with this a
pleasure to do is to stitch various
photos using your iPhone or iOS device
with the built-in camera in the
accelerometer what it does it
automatically takes photos depending on
where you aim your camera and it will
create an entire sphere of photos and
stitch them all together so here we can
view the sky and we can I see my front
porch and go over here and view other
houses in my neighborhood and I can
either share this or I can just click
done and it will save it into my full
albums on my iOS device dragon dictation
is a free application to vote on the App
Store it allows you to record your voice
and it will dictate it into a text form
so here let me record something hey how
are you doing and we'll just click done
and it will probably record what I just
said after that so now that it's process
I can go here and click on one of these
words let's say that it didn't get it
exactly correct I can just click on one
of these and will give me a drop-down
menu of various words very accurate
reading this time and
can go down to the bottom and I can send
as an SMS and email I can copy it I can
post it to Facebook or Twitter trapster
it's a free application available to a
store that allows you to find speed
traps and red light cameras and other
pertinent traffic information in your
area so here I have a couple of speed
traps in my area so I'll just click on
one of these and view when it was posted
and it says that it was will this trap
will not expire so it's a very accurate
post that many people have posted and I
said it was reported 20 hours ago so
that's probably pretty accurate one we
can go down here to report one require
our own we can report live police and
all these other hazards and information
to other drivers that are using the
traps trap so this has been another
