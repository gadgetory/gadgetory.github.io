pocketnow.com if you haven't noticed
AT&amp;amp;T has really turned up the heat and
advertising for its two newest
non-iphone smartphone heavyweights the
HTC One X and the Nokia Lumia 900 now
some of my friends are on AT&amp;amp;T and some
of them are first-time smartphone
purchasers and they want to know what is
offered by each one of these which one
should they pick now they both offer a
really excellent user experience but
they each take a very different road to
get there so let's dive in or check them
out now the first thing people are going
to notice the handle will get a feel for
is the phone's exterior so let's check
those out these phones offer unique
designs for their respective platforms
the HTC One X is available in white or
dark grey with a polycarbonate shell
that really really feels amazing in the
hand it's quite light at 135 grams it's
got a big 4.7 inch LCD display super LCD
display at 720p and the design
especially on the white one here
suggests something retro futuristic
almost like a 1950s sci-fi concept of
what a portable television would be like
the Nokia Lumia 900 also features a
polycarbonate shell which also comes in
several available colors as you can see
the design here is very different with
bold Square angles contrasting
interestingly with rounded curves
depending on what angle you look at the
device from it weighs in at 159 grams
and when I first took it out of the box
that added weight over the One X was
apparent that said it's not a heavy
feeling phone just substantial the
display is a smaller 4.3 inch AMOLED
panel with Nokia's clear black
technology now it's not HD but it does
offer enhanced readability outdoors now
it's not until you power on these
devices that you really get a feel for
just how different these two phones are
now the HTC One X on AT&amp;amp;T is running
Android Ice Cream Sandwich with Sense
4.0 and the Lumia 900
is running Windows Phone 7.5 the
differences between these two platforms
have been well covered but even a
beginner can easily see the huge
aesthetic difference right off the bat
Android offers a huge amount of
customizability I've got widgets here
for time and weather various
applications power management custom
apps like Evernote Twitter a stock
ticker calendar over here etc I have
seven different home screens to
customize however I want moving into an
Android phone is a lot like setting up a
computer you can do pretty much anything
you want but it takes a long time to get
it all configured just right by contrast
Windows Phone is pretty Elementary
looking at first you have these big
tiles that seemed almost toy like in
their simplicity but don't make the
mistake of conflating simplicity with
stupidity this is a very smart OS it's
just smart in a very Spartan way Windows
Phones debut marketing message was get
in get out and get back to life or get
on with life and you can see here in
Windows Phones notifications scheme that
they're trying to do that two new items
big blocky number two there another two
and my other email account tell you how
many emails tweets missed calls etc now
a smart phone is something that you're
actively using all the time so
performance is really really important
now I'm not going to talk about chipsets
and clock cycles and RAM because in
ordinary people don't care about that
they just care how it performs how it
feels
aside from physical appearance this is
possibly the most subjective of all
categories because everyone values
slightly different parts of the user
experience for example I prefer fluidity
and responsiveness to raw ability and in
this respect windows phone is my
preferred device even though the
hardware under the hood is less capable
on paper my day to day user experience
is more fluid than it is on the One X
which has to contend with the Sense UI
running on top of Android weighing it
down a bit don't get me wrong this is
one of the most usable Android devices
I've ever cared
and the Lumia isn't immune to the
occasional slowdown or system lag but on
the whole I do find Windows Phone more
responsive as far as browsing both
devices performed well of course the
Lumia doesn't support flash because it's
a Windows Phone but as I use Chrome on
the One X that's not an issue for me
because it doesn't either load times
were comparable on each in more mundane
news phone calls on each device were
plenty clear and callers said I sounded
great reception seemed excellent on each
device in my well covered area of Boston
and both phones feature LTE for a very
fast data connection as well battery
life was about the same for each in my
testing with a slight edge given to the
One X which has excellent battery life
especially for an Android phone so if
you're the type of person who values
simplicity and responsiveness over raw
power then the Lumia is probably gonna
be the phone for you but what about apps
most people know that Windows Phone lags
well behind Android when it comes to
apps at least as far as raw numbers go
but the Lumia 900 isn't just any Windows
Phone it's a Nokia Windows Phone that
means it carries some special apps
designed to fill a few gaps in the
market place inside the Nokia collection
here there's no Kia Drive to compete
with Google navigation on the One X
Nokia Maps to augment the Lumias Bing
Maps application and Nokia transit which
is for those of you who live in cities
served by public transportation also and
this is not unique to the Lumia instead
of hundreds of Twitter and Facebook
clients that you jump into individually
the Lumia 900 uses Windows Phones me and
people hubs to aggregate all your social
content so instead of separately hopping
into a bunch of separate apps it's all
presented in one feed you can get the
same experience by downloading any of
hundreds of social feed apps on your One
X but it's not built right into the OS
like it is on Windows Phone and it's
rarely presented quite as beautifully as
Microsoft does here now these apps are
all great on Windows Phone especially at
the asking price
the Nokia collection which is free for
most of these applications but whether
they can replace the sheer number of
options available on Android is up to
you if you're a power user who wants the
newest apps right away even though
Microsoft is catching up you're
definitely still going to want to choose
Android but if you're a more typical
user with a Facebook account maybe one
Twitter account a few emails LinkedIn
Foursquare Angry Birds and other common
stuff
Windows Phone will serve you wonderfully
and simply finally our talk about the
cameras on each of these devices will be
very short briefly the camera on the One
X isn't the best but it's pretty good
the one on the Lumia is really really
not especially when it comes to low
light the Lumias 8 megapixel camera is
unimpressive colors are washed out with
a lot of blue in them a lot of the time
there's a lot of noise and the shots
especially in low-light once again and
considering the carl zeiss lens there's
not much to get excited about here while
the One X is 8 megapixel shooter might
deliver some more saturation than is
called for its photos are much better
with a warm tone that might put some off
but looks a lot better than the Lumias
dead blue wash and the camera software
with its unified viewfinder and burst
mode ability to take stills from video
and the 1080p video recording is heads
and shoulders above the Lumia which is
still a nice viewfinder it's just not
really anything new again simple most of
that holds true for video as well so
they're the top non-iphone smartphones
available on AT&amp;amp;T and they're available
right now the One X is one $99.99 the
Lumia is $99.99 that's both of those
obviously on a two-year contract which
should you get well obviously if you're
a crazy power user gamer tech head
junkie you're definitely going to want
to go for the One X you already know
that
more than that though something for you
to consider if you're just a normal
person is how deeply integrated you are
with Google's features their search
Gmail Google Calendar Google Voice
anything Google related if you're
heavily woven into the Google ecosystem
you're gonna want to give serious
consideration to drop in the extra hundo
on the one X on the other hand if you're
not all that tied in to Google so you've
got hotmail or MSN or Yahoo for your
email provider maybe work calendars
through exchange you're a Microsoft
Office user you've got maybe one Twitter
account one Facebook account
Windows Phone is a really really viable
option and you should consider it the OS
is beautiful thanks to Nokia the
hardware is now beautiful it's a
contender folks especially if you're a
first-time smartphone buyer now before
you get all up in arms I'm not saying
that it should be seated at the kids
table I'm not saying it's a toy
Windows Phone is a very powerful OS but
the starkness of its software and the
simplicity it implies is very attractive
to all users but especially to
first-time smartphone buyers this has
been michael fisher with PocketNow drop
us a line in the comments let us know
which phone you bought or what you
thought overall give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw and we'll see you
next time thanks for watching
