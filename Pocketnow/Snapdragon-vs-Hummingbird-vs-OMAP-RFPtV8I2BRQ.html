pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to do some real world speed tests
against three Android devices that run
completely different processors we have
the google nexus one which runs the
snapdragon processor from Qualcomm
running it one gigahertz the Droid X
from Motorola is running a 1 gigahertz
texas instruments omap processor and
samsung captivate is running samsung
hummingbird processor also clocking in
at one gigahertz this is the same
processor that's being used on all
galaxy s smartphones that are being
released now and into the fall so let's
get to it okay so in this particular
video like I said we're going to focus
on real world testing so number one
we're going to see which starts up
faster number two we're going to see
which does better browsing the internet
rendering pages number three we're going
to compare the performance of Google
Earth the Android application because
it's very CPU and GPU intense and then
we're going to do streaming video over
YouTube to see which performs the best
so starting off let's turn on all three
devices at the same time if possible and
see which one starts up first so they
all have power buttons in different
places so this may be a little bit
difficult to coordinate but I'm going to
kind of move them around so that I can
do that okay so there they were pressed
at the same time or within at least a
second of each other let's see which one
starts up first i'm a fast forward in
the video so that you don't have to wait
for the buddha all right and they're all
going through their startup animations
and we should be into the android
operating system in a moment okay
somebody wait up nexus one is first
followed by the captivate and it looks
like the droid x is going to come in
last and it announces its presence okay
so let's start off with the test and i
should mention that i've got froyo
installed here on the google nexus one
it provides a little bit of an advantage
but of course these two devices are
going to be upgraded to froyo later this
year so everyone can expect to have that
so let's unlock all the devices and
we're going to start
on the internet we should be connected
to Wi-Fi I'm going to give them a minute
to settle down because usually they
download some emails and it slows down
the device so I'm going to wait about a
minute before jumping into the test
alrighty great and we're ready they're
all connected on the same Wi-Fi network
so I'm going to launch the browsers and
we're going to try to go to the same
website at the same time to get a feel
for which device pools in the website
fastest renders it then we're going to
flick around on the page to see which
does the best job that's scrolling
around okay so we've got pocket now here
I'm going to try to get them at the same
time and they're all for the exact same
time let's see which one is fastest
they're all very fast devices ok so the
captivate actually just crashed the
browser so we're going to have to open
that back up but the droid x beat out
the google nexus one let's get back into
the captivate browser that is very
strange that that actually happened so
we'll jump right back in a pocket now
hopefully we won't crash this time ok
we're back with the captivate loaded
pocket now this time without crashing so
let's just flick down the page gently
and get a feel for performance in terms
of scrolling and it looks like the
captivates actually the smoothest the
droid x is also very smooth nexus one is
a little bit choppy here so let's zoom
in and we're going to click on one of
these permalinks so you can get a sense
for how smoothly they zoom all pretty
darn good I will try to get the headline
at the same time here and we'll load
these ready set go okay that went at the
same time let's see which loads the page
first so the droid x one before
alright and so the captivate in the
droid x finished at the exact same time
the nexus one is struggling a little bit
with the final elements of the page okay
and the nexus one finish let's go to
another website and stumble go to
engadget.com on all three of the devices
to see which loads first okay and
they're off to go to engadget let's see
which which loads first
and okay droidx finish first followed by
the nexus one followed by the captivate
so far the droid x has come ahead two
times the captivate one time and the
nexus one has hasn't won yet so let's
flip flip down the page these are longer
pages than what we saw previously device
went to sleep here and see how smoothly
the scrolling is and you can see that
the captivate definitely has a little
bit of an advantage over definitely the
nexus one the droid x is extremely
smooth as well which is nice to see so
in terms of web browsers and performance
they're all very good it looks like the
captivate and the droid are faster than
the nexus one running froyo and
especially the captivate has extremely
smooth scrolling but the droid x isn't
far behind in terms of that so let's
bounce into another application this
time we're going to go to Google Earth
which as mentioned is a very GPU and CPU
intensive application so we're going to
see how these different processors
handle the graphic intensive pneus of
Google Earth so let's find it and we're
going to try to launch it at the same
time so we have it here here and here
let's try to get it at the same time
okay so here we go and it looks like the
nexus one is going to go to somewhere in
Africa okay well what I want to do here
is search for a particular location and
just kind of fly to the area so let's go
to Paris try to do it the same time or
as close to the same time as possible
you can kind of get a sense for the
animation and the graphical prowess by
how smooth that this flies around very
smooth on the captivate a little bit
choppy on the nexus one very smooth on
the droid x let's fly to another
location and then we will jump in to the
next test here testing the speed of
these different devices so this time
let's go to Australia ok so they're all
typed in let's search for Australia try
to do it as evenly as possible and we're
going to fly away a little bit choppy on
the droid x very very smooth on the
captivate and we have stopped here in
australia overall all these devices
perform quite well on
in the Google Earth application but
particularly the the droid x and the
captivate do a particularly good job
let's do one more just for good measure
we're going to fly all the way across
the world to New York okay we're and hit
the Go button and you be the judge this
time of how fast these these go
so very nice indeed so that's the end of
this test google or test it looks like
again with the droid x on the captivate
are a little bit faster than the nexus
one in being able to render the graphics
on this google earth program now we're
going to jump into the YouTube
application try to play back some video
and see if there's any difference in how
smoothly they play back at how fast they
buffer okay and here they are youtube
applications okay we're to search for
videos from pocket now just so that we
can play back the same video across all
devices and let's see what we have here
now it's very interesting to note here's
the difference in screen resolution
these two devices have the same screen
resolution 800 down at 480 across so
we're seeing the exact same amount of
screen data on the bottom we see fanuc
alpha 2 or 3 fennec alpha 2 or 3 but
because the droid x has an additional
fifty four pixels down i know it's not
that big of a deal you can see a little
bit more of the one below okay so what
we're going to do is click on this video
here we'll try to start it at the same
time and see which buffers the first
first second third and in terms of which
video is playing back the smoothest they
all look pretty much the same as they're
playing in the highest quality possible
through these applications what is
different is sort of the playback
quality the captivate looks the best the
best blacks you it also looks quite good
on the AMOLED display and then the
droidx looks a little bit washed out so
I'm gonna let you look at the videos for
just another second to see if you can
notice any difference in the video
playback you ponies
so overall there is really no clear
winner here we have the nexus one which
started up the fastest we had the
captivate and the droid x which were
fastest in web browsing and smoothness
of scrolling let me have the captivate
which was slightly ahead in buffering a
video on youtube so it's really
inconclusive these are all very well
performing devices that feel quick on a
day to day operation if you want us to
test something in particular between
these three devices which all have
different processors please leave a
comment below the video and we will try
to oblige thanks for watching and please
thumbs up the video if you liked it
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
