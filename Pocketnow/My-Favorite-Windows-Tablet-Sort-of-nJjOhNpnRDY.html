iteration to Samsung's predecessor but
instead the company's first attempt at a
new breed of always connected pcs and by
new I don't just mean the category of
snapdragon powered computers but the
fact that this one runs on a more
powerful version than the one that I
tested on the HP Envy x2 months ago I'm
hey meta we got on with pocket now and
let's dive into our full review
our own atom laned in our text review
for this computer a few months ago and
given his artistic background I highly
recommend you give it a read fun fact I
really wanted to test this computer so
much so that we're doing a second review
for it I am looking for iPad
replacements all the time and I do
believe that they always connected to PC
is probably the most powerful
alternative you get full Windows but my
first experience wasn't necessarily that
good so let me begin this video by
telling you what I like about this
tablet and it actually begins with the
fact that if you're looking for a good
looking and a good feeling surface pro
alternative this is it
it doesn't matter where I go I get
compliments over this gunmetal aluminium
finish that also feels expensive when
you hold it we have a hinge that works
pretty much in any angle you want and
with advantages like two USB C ports and
a headphone jack and the cherry topper
for me you don't have to pay extra for
the detachable keyboard or the stylus
like you do on the surface iPad pro and
even the pixel slate everything is
included in the box the keyboard is
backlit with plenty of tactility on the
keys and I feel that the plastic palm
rest will aged better than the Alcantara
all the while including a very cool
stipple back that adds comfort when
you're carrying the computer around the
s-pen is just like the one we already
love on the Galaxy Note it doesn't
require battery power thanks to the
Wacom digitizer on the display and the
tip feels like if you're writing on a
sharpie I do find that crazy convenient
when using it to write notes and Adam
did praise its accuracy for some
artistic work added bonuses are that you
can now use the other tip as an eraser
that the button can be used to mimic a
double-click on the screen and that a
single press will call on air gestures
like on the Galaxy Note and let's talk
about that display we have a 12 inch
Super AMOLED panel at 2160 by 1440
resolution that I highly recommend you
use in the new windows dark mode colors
are vibrant and blacks are just surreal
all tablets must have a great display
and this one is one of my favorites
hands-down
and then under the hood we have the new
pokken snapdragon 850 hence the mention
of the newer generation of the mobile
processor made specifically for the
always connected PC we also have four
gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage that's
expandable through microSD a 47 watt
hour battery fast charging capabilities
and its biggest selling point
always on LTE connectivity with up to 20
hours of battery life to spare which is
actually quite accurate I never really
had to worry about charging this
computer during my test period all
throughout my workday powering the show
we have Windows 10s out of the box
though I actually made the switch to
Windows 10 home pretty much just five
minutes later I rely heavily on Chrome
and that's the only way to be able to
install it now as opposed to my
experience with the previous generation
chip windows on this computer feels
great the minor lag that I noticed
interacting with it in the past is now
gone even while using Chrome and other
more hefty applications but right about
now it's that time where I tell you why
I'm mixed about this computer and it
starts with Microsoft's approach to
Windows lately I think I uninstalled
like 10 trashy games like bloat alone on
this computer was just epic second well
I didn't mention content consumption
when I talked about the screen because
the speakers aren't great like Samsung
claims that they're tuned by AKG and we
do have dual firing drivers here but
they lack depth and are just average at
most third I know that for some of you
the size of this tablet is fine but
given the screen size and the weight
distribution this is not really an easy
tablet to hold with one hand and then
you have the problem that if you hold it
with your right hand you'll cover the
ambient light sensor and that'll dim the
display and make the experience
cumbersome but then as always there's no
such thing as a perfect product let me
tell you what I don't like about this
tablet and it actually begins with the S
Pen not because of its functionality but
because of its design because it's round
and it's glossy the magnets don't really
do a good job at sticking with the
computer second the placement of the
fingerprint scanner talked about playing
a guessing game and trying to find it in
the back of the tablet or its
not at all visible last but not least
let's talk about the price and what
you're getting for that price sure I
know that Windows 10 is definitely more
powerful in iOS on an iPad or Chrome OS
on a pixel slate the problem is that for
9.99 4 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage is a lot to ask for
and sure you're saving up to two hundred
and fifty dollars on the keyboard and on
the stylus that's all fine but seriously
Windows is RAM hungry four gigs of RAM
is not a lot I wish that we at least had
an option to upgrade it and sadly you
don't get it
to conclude even with its shortcomings I
do believe that there are more pros than
cons with the Samsung Galaxy book 2 it
is definitely a very convenient product
you just have to remember that this
tablet is not for everyone
honestly the main irony is that you'd
think that this is an artistic computer
for Photoshop or other drawing tools
I mean hey we have the form factor and
the s-pen powered by Wacom technology
right well sadly that's not the case
make sure you read Adams review for more
details on his experience as a designer
and pro photographer there doesn't seem
to be enough power for some very
important tasks nope this computer is
more for a road warrior like me people
who need the power of Windows match with
LTE connectivity and the battery
performance that'll provide peace of
mind all throughout the day you know
that I rely on tablets for highlighting
my work so this tablet for me is perfect
if your use of scenario is more like
mine than I do highly recommend this
product if your usage is more like Adams
than I would definitely recommend the
Microsoft Surface pro even for a little
more money but how about you let us know
what you think about the Samsung Galaxy
book 2 in the comments down below
