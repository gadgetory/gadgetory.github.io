pocket not calm today we're going to
take a look at an application called
look and type it's made by LG and it's
available in the marketplace on the lg
application store given you have an LG
made windows phone 7 now if you don't
don't worry just follow our contest
because you can win one brand new LG
optimus 7 and on that Optimus 7 you can
run this look and type application which
is very similar to the iteration we saw
on Android and Windows stone 6.5 so
let's take a look so look in type it's a
simple application we saw iterations of
this application on Android we saw it on
windows phone 6.5 and below and the
principle is very simple look and type
application will access your camera and
whatever your camera sees will be
overlaid on your screen so that you can
you know text while walking even though
I don't recommend you doing that but
it's fun and if you must text while you
are walking you can use this one so as
you can see here it's the image overlaid
onto the screen whatever is behind it
will appear on your screen while you are
sending the SMS here's my camera remote
and you can of course start typing now
there's also a nice addition to this
application and settings you are allowed
to not only change the font which you
can choose from a list here you have
comic you have to go you have Georgia
you have to houma you have the basic
windows phone 7 pounds and you can also
select some funds which are present on
the pc version of Windows getting back
here you can have the settings from
small medium and large as far as the
font size is concerned and this slider
here changes the text color now there
are some times when your camera will see
some images and the text which is
overlaid on the camera image might be
to read you can adjust the heel of the
color for the font you can see it's
changing right there let me get the
slider straight yeah it's changing right
there and let's choose we have a light
background let's choose a darker red
color and yeah here we are and we can
start typing and you see it's perfectly
visible so for our contest the third
part of our puzzle question is Windows
Phone 7 thank you very much for watching
this was Anton denied from pocketnow.com
with a short video review of the Lucan
type application made by LG available on
LG application store on Windows Phone 7
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
