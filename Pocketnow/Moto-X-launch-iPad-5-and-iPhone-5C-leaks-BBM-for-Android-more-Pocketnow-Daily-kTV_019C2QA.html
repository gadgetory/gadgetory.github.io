their Moto X War League show us photos
of an iPad 5 and iphone 5c the cross
platform BBM reaches beta finally I'm hi
Marietta and if you don't know what
BBM's mean I don't blame you i don't
have any friends there anymore this is
PocketNow daily let's say she's a off
with the land that time forgot his
blackberry had promised us to bring us
blackberry messenger or bbm to the iOS
and Android as of the month of July
which just passed they're offering a
closed beta to certain specific people
right now and that means that we're just
gonna have to wait if you're actually
even waiting I don't even have any
friends on blackberry messenger anymore
do you even know what bbm is now let's
move the spotlight over to HTC you know
it took the company a while to be able
to launch their red variant of the HTC
One even though I've never actually seen
one in public but it's out there and as
it turns out the company is apparently
already working on their blue variant
this is nothing new we heard about it
weeks ago but now we have a product
number and the question is when are they
gonna sell this blue variant of well the
red ones not even available everywhere
just yet so stay tuned for that now
let's talk about the ipad 5 and the
iphone 5c links down below in the
description for full images of what the
ipad 5 might look like which is pretty
much an ipad mini with a bigger chassis
it's the same thing and then on the
other hand we have the iphone 5c links
down below for the photos where we see
that this is pretty much a thicker ipod
touch some of us even debate if that's
even and ipod touch with phone
capabilities but still you know let's
see how those rumors play out in the end
now interesting apparently both these
devices will have the same camera module
as the iphone 5 meaning that a megapixel
camera that takes some really good
photos is even the iphone 5c practice
that would be cool so let's see how it
goes and yes we're going to talk about
the Moto X but first let's talk about
something that Motorola's launched today
is this Chrome extension that allows you
to sync your information from your phone
to your google chrome browser meaning to
get a call on your phone that will
notify your browser even they are going
to be listening to the phone as well and
it's cool to see that there are some
more integration features between
motorola and google it's just odd that
this is only available for
moto X or any of the droid ultra lineups
which have not launched yet so anyways
and finally for the hot and cold news of
the day Google and Motorola have finally
done wrapped the Moto X the phone that
everybody has not necessarily been
waiting for it's just been teased so
much that we had so much hype for this
phone we didn't know what to expect so
far this is a mid-tier phone with a high
price range and yeah I'm sure you get a
wooden back plates in q4 which is most
likely when all the other hot phones are
going to be launched not sure how well
that's gonna play out for motorola but
yes you get a highly customizable phone
there are tons of different ways to do
it online which is really cool its
unique but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day are you excited
about the Moto X is this a phone that
you want so far in my case I'll be
honest with you this phone looks cool it
may not be the most high-end phone ever
but it looks cool you get a lot of these
options which are obviously cool my
problem is that price point I thought it
would be cheaper but leave us a comment
down below what do you think and of
course it's always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablets you follow what
I'm talking outcome and script our
YouTube channel as well it also follow
me on Twitter and hind underscore iveta
