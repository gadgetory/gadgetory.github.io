now and after a full week of testing the
Sony Xperia S as my daily driver we know
you're all curious to see how the device
performs houses software how's the user
experience so let's talk about it you
know even though I was a big fan of the
sony ericsson xperia x1 back in the
windows mobile day it's kind of
disappointment with their Android
implementation I felt that it needed
more it wasn't as refined as the Windows
Mobile operating system was even though
it was Windows Mobile but still I feel
that Sony has changed things with the
Xperia S there's their new flagship
device for their NXT series after this
you get the P in the you end that the
Vice really really has changed the
experience I feel that Sony has refined
a lot of things and my experience so far
has been quite pleasing one of the
things that I like the most about this
device is the display I'll film a
separate video just to show you how it
compares between the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus and other flagship smartphones
that also have great resolution screens
so far the Bravia Engine has really
impressed me it does a really good job
with colors but you know Sony has
refined their UI in order for it to take
advantage of all the pixels on the
display text the smaller and even though
it is smaller it's readable it's really
really good so watch the separate video
to see the difference because honestly
it's probably one of the biggest selling
points for this device going through the
software experience I'll be honest with
you in the past I was only a fan of HTC
Sense because I felt that that was the
company that thought out their UI the
most in comparison to others but sony
has changed the ball this time they've
really worked and thought out there you
want for this implementation of their
NXT line and I really do recommend that
it's very refined it's very responsive
it's quite elegant you can select from
various themes and a lot of animated
wallpapers for each of these themes
which are really good I'm just not a
really big fan of Timescape which has
been with the Xperia line forever I'm
not really a fan of how it works because
it's kind of cumbersome the tiles are
too small you can't really read the text
you have to go into every tile every
time it's not really something that I
feel is good other than that well they
bring some really good widgets to the
table bring
ample weather it's a really cool
animation widget out there available
friends is good and you already saw our
video on the smart tags feature which is
really really cool other than that well
if you pinch out from the home screen
you see this really cool animated UI
that allows you to select any other
widgets that you have in your home
screen I like the fact that even though
you don't have Ice Cream Sandwich on
this device Sony has figured out a way
to provide folders at least in the home
screen it can't do that within the
application tray but it's there it's at
least available you'll notice that the
keyboard is also kind of looking like
iOS but forget about iOS here what's
really cool is they bring swipe
functionality to the keyboard it was
probably available before but I like the
implementation of it on this NXT line
and the Xperia S there's a really good
job at predicting text now even though
the device is playstation certified
sadly out of the box it's not going to
work apparently the store will be
available until the end of March or
early April sony also includes a healthy
suite of applications that you won't
find on competitor devices not the
typical stock Android for example you
get wise pilot navigation services which
kind of competes with Google Maps the
difference here is that you get it you
know for free initially and then if you
want to buy maps to navigate offline
it's also available kind of cool if
you're roaming out of the United States
and you don't have data roaming wherever
you go really cool feature included
aside from that well you also get Sony's
video service and Sony's music service
in case you want to buy music or videos
and continuing on with their suite of
music they have track ID in case you
want to discover music and then buy it
from their store compete with Shazam and
SoundHound and it's kind of cool you
also get this really neat world quoc
which stands it apart from everybody
else it's a very nice implementation
very elegant it actually even gives you
differences and daylight and nighttime
and everything you also get this meal
reader for QR codes etc just to give you
an idea sony goes and raise the bar and
includes other applications that you
won't find on other competitor devices
your business user well sony also
includes a service called marked your
pro in case your business wants a more
secure way for you to connect to
exchange servers even though android
already supports it it also includes the
office suite pro
in case you want to add the documents
and everything another option for
business users and it's available there
for free another cool thing about the
Sony Xperia line in general is the fact
that box Totten that gives you 50 free
gigabytes of storage for life doesn't
matter if you create a new box that in
that account or you have an existing one
all you have to do is log in to box.net
from the application on your Xperia and
somehow it detects that you're on Xperia
and it'll give you the free service
trust me I already got the goods now one
of my biggest gripes with the Android
operating system is their excessive use
of blacks because obviously if you're
reading text you want a white background
with white text line just like you do in
a book but somehow sony has included
this grainy UI that doesn't look that
bad at all it looks quite elegant
during email obviously you do get a
white background in black text but still
you can rotate your email client and
you'll notice that you get a preview of
whatever email you're selecting and well
you also get the grainy UI within
messaging and just about everywhere the
only place where I really like Sony's UI
in general for personal information
management is in the calendar
application it's kind of intuitive very
good I really like it so far even though
it has black now let's go through the
camera I mean the front-facing 1.3
megapixel camera and the sony xperia s--
is not the best camera in the world but
you saw our video test yesterday and you
notice that it wasn't that bad now the
12 megapixel camera at the back is
probably not the best for a 1080p video
recording because of the software you
are implementation but the camera for
taking images is awesome to be honest
with you it's probably one of the best
cameras that I've seen on Android so far
you can hold the camera and one of the
cool features is that the device could
be on standby right now and all you have
to do is select the button leave it
press for a second and it'll take the
image immediately and even though it's
not as fast as the Sony Xperia ion that
we saw at CES it still does a really
good job at taking one picture after
another it's cool features included in
Sony I feel that they take a really good
advantage of the Exmor R processor
whenever you're taking pictures sadly
not the case yet with video recording
sony also talks about their inclusion of
their ex loud enhancement
engine for Sam within the phone and well
speakerphone wise the phone is quite
good it sounds very good on speakerphone
but my advice to you is once you pull
these headphones out of the box throw
them away I've always been a big fan of
Sony headphones but sadly these are the
trashiest implementation I've ever seen
now what and probably a really good tip
for everybody is for some reason it
seems that not every headset works on
this phone I tried the iPhone headphones
they don't work some HCC headphones work
for some reason I don't know why Sony's
proprietary headset jack only accepts
there's probably it could be that I just
need to find better quality headphones
out there that's my case but for some
reason these are the only ones that work
so far so look out for that as I
mentioned in the unboxing Sony also
includes HDMI out and even though it
also includes DLNA support one of the
really cool features about HDMI out is
the fact that you can mirror your device
to any TV screen there's a really good
job not only in mirroring the device at
full resolution but also in scaling
within the TV and even though scaling is
great you can even control your device
with the remote control from the TV no
matter if it's a Sony device or not kind
of a really cool feature not a gimmick
for me because you could actually leave
the phone on the table and control it
from the TV and not having to get up and
get down whenever you want to change
something from your phone you can even
catch Netflix like this probably one of
my biggest disappointment with the
Xperia S is the battery life because
even though it has a 1750 milliamp power
battery it barely reaches 9 to 10 hours
of typical usage and I'm talking about
typical phone calls typical usage as a
daily driver little email I wouldn't
complain if the battery was removed but
sadly it is intent well I think Sony
probably could fix that with their Ice
Cream Sandwich update and speaking of
Ice Cream Sandwich my other
disappointment with this phone is the
fact that it doesn't include Ice Cream
Sandwich out of the box sadly I feel
that these are not times for Gingerbread
anymore and even though their
implementation and Gingerbread is good
it's about time we got Ice Cream
Sandwich out of the box so hopefully
Sony will work on this apparently we
will get the update by the end of March
but that's not the
right now and for all of those that were
complaining about my lack of enthusiasm
over screen protectors the reason why I
don't like them is first of all because
they're dust magnets and also because
they get scratched easily and this is a
glass screen you don't really need a
screen protector now and interesting
note here is the fact that even though
there's a screen protector in the box
the phone also brings a screen protector
from factory already placed on the phone
so you're a fan of screen protectors
they at least they do the favor not a
big fan of this but the only reason why
I haven't taken it off is because I'm
the Xperia Play it was the same case it
included a screen protector that was on
it got all scratched up but the problem
was when I removed it this the proximity
sensor wasn't working as well anymore so
sadly that's the feature that you'll
probably have to be stuck with screen
protectors and proudly with good quality
so far if it wasn't for the limited
battery life on the Xperia S and the
fact that it doesn't include Ice Cream
Sandwich out of the box I'd probably
recommend this as one of the best
Android smartphones in the market it's
very refined it's very good not a big
fan of the matte black because for some
reason it catches these dirt smudges I'd
recommend you go for the black model
instead of the white but so far my
experience with the Xperia S has been
very very positive you know if I have to
compare them with the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus I tell you if you know it's it's
kind of a tough call Samsung Galaxy
Nexus is really good but this device is
honestly great sony has done a really
good job with their new NXT line
hopefully the Panda you will be just as
good so stay tuned for a full review of
the Sony Xperia S so far very satisfied
that's it for our review walkthrough of
the software and user experience within
the Sony Xperia S if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching
