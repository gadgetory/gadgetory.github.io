apologizes for the Galaxy Note seven
nightmare rumors of a Google made
Android we're offering emerge in that
possible Nokia Android phone we
discussed might be something else
entirely I'm Jaime Rivera and I do
believe that apologies are great but I
would also love it if there was a galaxy
note 6 or a 7 s or something I don't
know this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a really
great Android flagship smartphone the
Moto Z droid lineup was good but now
that they're currently on Best Buy for a
$250 gift card for the Z Droid and then
150 for the Z droid force and god I hate
these names but anyways these are great
deals Best Buy I highly suggest you
consider it and for those of you that
remember the rumors that we covered a
couple of weeks ago over that no kid d1c
being the company's possible first
smartphone you're probably gonna have to
hold that under wrap as there are more
rumors and benchmarks now showing that
apparently this is a tablet not just any
tablet we're talking about a thirteen
point one inch tablet that's larger than
the iPad pro if that was even possible
and I kind of annamund or whelmed but
hopefully this is just part of a lineup
we'll see how those of you that have
been waiting for Android wear to toe it
seems that we know why it's not
launching yet famous tipster Evan
blasters came on record to show us that
apparently we are waiting for to Android
wear offerings from Google to launch in
q1 and these are going to run Android
wear 2.0 so because of the whole thing
that's happening with Android 7.1 it
seems that that's going to be the case
with two dot oh that's sad but let's
wait and for those of you that are
sitting on a galaxy note 7 noticing all
the recalls and being like wow I bought
it secondhand or I bought it on eBay or
I got it from this or that source the
CVS see in the United States is
extending the galaxy note 7 recall to
pretty much anyone meaning it doesn't
really matter how you got your phone you
can get a replacement unit so if your
cases the fact that you got your phone
from buddy or gift
whatever you don't have a receipt or
whatever I would highly suggest you
follow look in the description and learn
more about what you can do
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with Samsung the company's mobile
president Don Janko and the fact that he
publicly apologized to everyone for
what's happened to the Galaxy Note seven
he bowed in front of Korean press and
claimed his frustration over everything
that's going on with the Galaxy Note
seven how disappointed customers are the
fact that they're all so frustrated
because they haven't been able to figure
out exactly what has caused this problem
with the second batch of replacement
units I do admire Samsung's approach to
everything that's happening with the no
7 mistakes happen and the fact that the
company is being humble and proving that
they're trying to fix this is I feel
great ever since he began his
administration we'd noticed the very
different Samsung I commend and I
applaud Samsung for what the company is
doing and I guess it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about the apology are you okay with it
one - what phone are you replacing the
Galaxy Note 7 for in my case I already
have every other galaxy so I guess I
will see what else I can replace it for
but I wish there was some sort of a note
something beginning of the year I don't
care it doesn't really matter I have
been a Galaxy no customer since version
2 that's been my daily driver since then
so it's a really sad day for me but hey
