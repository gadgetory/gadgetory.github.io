of travel that I do I rely heavily on
prepaid plans because it just makes
everything easier I pay for what I want
where I want and for the amount of time
that I'm there but one thing that I
learned in the United States is that
it's extremely expensive to go prepaid
and find unlimited data options on major
US carriers so when Cricket Wireless
reached out to sponsor a video for us to
try their service and after I noticed
that there were a few options that were
really compelling with unlimited data
for a very affordable price tag I really
wanted to give it a try so let's cut to
the chase I'm hanging that ID that on
with pocket now and let's unbox the ZTE
Blade X on Cricket Wireless
so for those of you complaining that we
only review flagships fine here is a
little bit of a palate cleanser that
comes in a very interesting package
crooked Wireless is actually full of
flexions like the iPhone 10 iPhone 8 or
samsung galaxy s 8 but I decided that I
wanted to test the service from an
affordable standpoint I'm actually a big
fan of ZT products because I feel they
give you a lot of bang for your buck and
the ZTE Blade X is no exception
opening the package we're greeted by a
standard Cricut box and the usual bells
and whistles inside we have the ZTE
Blade X front and center and below that
we are greeted by the usual literature
that most people don't really read but I
highly suggest that those of you that
are new to Android have a look at the
clear and simple QuickStart guide that
also holds the sim ejector tool it's
literally got everything you need to
know about the phone at a glance then
below that we have the fast charger and
USB C cable and this is what I mean
about ZTE products this phone is
extremely affordable and you don't need
to cough extra money for something as
essential as a fast charger but how
about if we focus on what we're here for
the new ZTE Blade X and give me a second
while I peel off the plastic oh yeah
this device is actually lighter than it
looks and with a stipple pattern at the
back that makes it feel very grippy
we've got a 5.5 inch IPS LCD at 720p a
Snapdragon 42:5 processor for power
efficiency 2 gigabytes of RAM 16
gigabytes of expandable storage and a
large 3000 milliamp hour battery I'm not
gonna lie I am really excited to test
out Cricket Wireless and their unlimited
data plans in addition to testing out
the ZTE Blade X see how life is on the
premium mid-range while we're at that I
even hear that we're able to test
DirecTV now services on this phone so
this is going to be really cool stay
tuned for more coverage coming very soon
