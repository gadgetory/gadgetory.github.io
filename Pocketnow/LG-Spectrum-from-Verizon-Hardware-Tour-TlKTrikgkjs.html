pocketnow.com today we're going to take
a closer look at the hardware on the LG
spectrum from verizon so sit back relax
enjoy the show so the LG spectrum has a
4.5 inch IPS HD display it's running at
a 720 x 1280 resolution which you can
see here is looks really fantastic and
looks very very solid color wise screen
wise and we'll cover one of the kind of
the small caveat it's about the screen
in just a minute but just from the first
glance it looks really really good down
here at the bottom we've got the three
capacitive buttons got a menu button
which also serves as a search button if
you tap and hold on it you've got the
home button and then you get your back
button which is all everything you would
expect at the top we've got a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera and a
couple of the other sensors noticeably
missing up here is a notification light
there's no sort of notification system
on here which has been a item that I've
been sorely missing especially for text
messages or emails I'm used to having
some sort of blinking indication now
there are the ways to make your screen
act as the notification but again right
out of the box this has no notification
capabilities so that's a little
disappointing but what you say outside
edge here is a beveled and the kind of a
chrome effect I haven't actually dropped
this yet to know to find out if it's
chrome all the way through ever gets
scratched that it's going to show
plastic underneath it is a really
plasticky device all together it's got a
large bezel around the outside which
compared to say the samsung here the
bezel is much much thinner in comparison
we'll come back to the comparisons in
just a minute looking at the top of the
device here we have the headphone jack
and the microphone and the pain in the
keister USB door here that gets in the
way of the power button if you have
din and it also doesn't fit very well a
bit here is a little funny so when
you're reaching up for the power button
tendency to slide my finger over this
section to try to find out where the
power button really sits because it's
really very very small here up in this
upper corner up here moving to the
bottom of the device we've got just a
finger spot for you stick your finger on
there and pop the back door off on this
side here we have our volume indicator
of volume rocker it's strangely sits
right in the middle of our practically
in the middle of the device rather than
at the upper limits here so expecting to
be able to hold the device in one hand
normally and then being able to grab the
volume rocker here won't happen you have
to kind of bring your hand further down
or push the device up further in your
hand or get that to work back of the
phone has the 8 megapixel with a flash
there on the back and then we've got
kind of a plastic cover which you can
see here which has that kind of a carbon
fiber look and although it doesn't have
a carbon fire texture it's very slick on
the back here and picks up fingerprints
and makes it extremely difficult to hold
on to you really have to get a good grip
on the sides in order for this to stay
stable down at the bottom here we've got
a speaker hole and really the speaker
quality for both the back speaker the
rear speaker and the front speaker are
kind of terrible hey shouldn't say kind
of terrible they are terrible it's
really hard to listen to for an extended
period of time if I use bluetooth that
the sound volume quality is fine and the
rear speaker and the front speaker both
have a noun mazing amount of volume that
they can put out but the sound quality
is really tinny and terrible all
together so that's a bit of a
disappointment there for the amount of
volume that it pumps out let's go ahead
and pop the back of the device hop here
again as we mentioned in the unboxing we
have an eighteen thirty mil a power
battery
we've got the preinstalled 16 gig micro
SD card it also has some internal ram or
rather flash for storage as I believe it
has four gigs of internal flash for
purposes of the device plus your than
everything else is stored on the microSD
card it's got a gig of ram in here as
well and the micro SD card is expandable
up to 32 gigs you've got your verizon
LTE sim chip and it is a global capable
device as far as the data is concerned
underneath this battery is nothing more
than the you know information like the
msid etc this black back cover here is
you know the little creaky and claw key
and you can kind of see the fingerprints
appearing there but it snaps on nice and
tight and there doesn't seem to be a
whole lot of creaking or cracking it's
very lightweight in the hand it just
feels really plasticky because of the
back there's nothing there to hold on to
so even setting it down you can kind of
hear how plastic it sounds the other
thing that I found is that this with
this lifted camera placement right here
when it's laying flat like this and may
notice on the software view it have its
tendency to wobble back and forth
compared to other devices on the market
like the samsung galaxy s2 from sprint
really no noticeable thickness
difference here the screen resolution is
higher on this device than it is on the
samsung and it's a little taller as far
as devices are concerned compared to say
the AT&amp;amp;T HTC Vivid again there's the HTC
Vivid is just a tiny bit thicker it's
noticeably heavier than the LG spectrum
and size-wise again the LG spectrum is
it just a tiny bit longer here at the
top the camera does a decent job of both
video and photos but not anything that's
really spectacular
especially compared to what we were
seeing coming right out of the HTC Vivid
from AT&amp;amp;T and our last review that said
in low light situations there is some
loss of detail and it doesn't hold on to
focus very low in fact it doesn't have a
it doesn't seem to focus on with using
the flash if it's in a darkly lit
situation or as having troubles getting
the the focus setup normally a phone
will this style or a camera of this
style will use the flash to help figure
out where the focus point is and it
doesn't do that even if even if the
flash is forced on it doesn't help you
know use a flash focus our flash
assisted focus for photos I found that
the overall the quality is again pretty
decent but if you start looking here
it's it doesn't have any anti-shake
capabilities at all and then the other
thing that I've noticed that well I
really like the high resolution display
when you really start looking at some of
the reference images that I've got four
color checking you can see right here on
this JPEG image this cloud is not
supposed to look that way it's not
supposed to have those kind of clear
light blue on the outside and then a
really dark obvious difference in the
interior and I can show you the
difference here on the galaxy s2 and you
can see there's while that darkness is
there it's not as pronounced and obvious
as it is over here and really color wise
the color differences there's a little
more contrast on the Samsung which is
not unexpected and the color
differentiation this is the Samsung does
suffer from a little bit of a blue tint
whereas this device does seem to have a
little more of a yellow tinting as you
can see kind of here in this this green
area here it's a little more yellow than
the Greens that I'm got here on the
Samsung device I you can get the normal
3g speeds which are expected here but
more importantly
point out some of the 4G speeds that I
was getting up in the Portland metro
area we got 24 333 here down and 12 778
up and then down here at the bottom it's
you know like a 1351 there sorry 13 5 14
down and 5 7 11 up so really excellent
data speeds up and down not quite as
good as a TNT's service as far as LG is
concerned but AT&amp;amp;T service is not as
widespread as verizon's is as well so
really excellent data speeds here if
only it made the device faster overall
and unfortunately does not that wraps is
a closer look at the hardware on the LG
spectrum from verizon if you have any
comments or questions please leave them
