but ever since our guided tour of the
camera on the Samsung Galaxy s4 viewers
like you have been clamoring for us to
whip up a similar video for HTC's
Android flagship ok I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is your
guided tour of the camera on the HTC one
much breath has been expended on whether
the ones four megapixel primary camera
with its oversized or ultra pixels is
worth all the hoopla HTC claims but
we're not going to get into that
conversation again here for more on
whether the ultra pixel camera on the
one is right for you check out our
multiple device reviews and camera
comparisons at pocketnow.com and while
you're at it follow us on social media
so you don't miss future content for now
it's enough to say that if you use your
smart phone camera principally for
casual shots and social media sharing
the one will probably offer more than
enough functionality for you
understanding how to use the ones camera
starts with knowing how to open it
because it's important a camera app
opens quickly when you're trying to get
a time-sensitive shot in the most
straightforward way is to tap the camera
icon in the dock when the phone is in
standby and unlike on other devices that
also works from the lock screen there's
no drag or fancy gesture here just tap
it to open it's not quite as handy as a
dedicated camera key which we wish every
phone had but it works the shortcut is
present in most lockscreen modes
including photo album which scrolls
images from a selected gallery on your
lockscreen jumping into the camera
you'll notice the first thing the
software does is show you how much
memory is remaining in terms of minutes
of video and number of stills you can
capture it that's handy but it does
vanish after a second to get out of the
way we'll mention here that we are
running an older software version on our
HTC One due to an update problem the
updates haven't changed much in the
viewfinder though so this should look
similar if not identical to those
running updated builds starting on the
lower right we see HTC's filters folder
some preset overlays you can apply to
photos before shooting them these are
nothing new if you've played with
previous HTC smartphone cameras and
other manufacturers have gotten into the
filter game too but HTC really has the
most useful and fun range of filters for
our
tastes including some with adjustable
intensity depending on how subtle you're
feeling we'll also note here that the
one offers the standard touch to focus
support allowing you to decide where you
want the camera to focus in a long shot
you'll notice that the camera will also
take its exposure level from the area
you tap on as well that's typical for
HTC and also typical is that this effect
is a little exaggerated with Wilder
swings compared to other devices on the
upper right is a thumbnail of the last
photo or video taken which also doubles
as a shortcut to the gallery between
that and the filter toggle are the two
most important buttons on the camera the
shutter release for still photos and the
record button for video now these are
always displayed with no need to switch
modes between Stills and video an
outstanding time-saver that HTC
pioneered in modern Android smartphones
the last item on the right hand side is
the zoom slider of course there's no
optical zoom here even though there is
optical image stabilization so digital
will have to do but it's a handy slider
to have around considering the volume
keys don't work as zoom toggles as they
do on other devices at least not by
default the pinch to zoom is supported
as well if you're used to that in the
upper left is the flash selector which
lets you manually control whether the
flash is set to on/off or automatic
based on light level in the left-center
is the dedicated toggle for Zowie
probably one of the most talked about
features of the HTC one at first glance
zoe's just look like short videos and
you wonder what the point is well aside
from brightening up the gallery zoe's
offer a lot more utility because they're
hybrid captures 3.6 seconds of HD video
alongside about 20 still frame captures
at 6 frames per second a photos that you
can scrub after the fact to find the
best one you want to keep it's a much
more elegant solution than burst shot
but that feature is still here found
just by holding down the shutter release
you can capture up to 20 shots in just a
couple seconds and the software can even
choose what it thinks is the best shot
while discarding the rest sometimes it
works well and other times not so much
but you always have the option to save
or delete all photos you won't notice a
front camera selector in the ones camera
viewfinder because HTC has made it
invisible to shoot a self-portrait you
just swipe the screen up from the bottom
or down from the
to switch to the 2 megapixel wide-angle
front-facing shooter it's happening
anywhere on the screen then starts a 2
second countdown to a still shot
hopefully minimizing jiggle that would
otherwise result from a button press
jumping into the menu on the bottom left
corner we can see the deeper level
customizations HTC offers up top is a
toggle to switch between main and
secondary cameras in case you don't like
or don't know about the swipe action the
next one down is the scene selector
which allows you to optimize the camera
for the usual portrait and landscape
shooting modes as well as more exotic
alternatives like text mode this appears
to increase contrast and sharpness to
call out letters while backlight does
its best to compensate for those
occasions when the Sun is behind your
subject macro is of course for close-up
shots and while we generally find
performance to be just fine an automatic
mode for close-ups macro is useful in
extreme situations below the scene
submenu are a couple modes HTC thinks
you might use more often night mode
improves on the ones already excellent
low-light performance not by
illuminating more of the scene but by
reducing noise levels on what is
captured it seems and of course there's
our old favorite HDR for high dynamic
range photos taking multiple photos at
multiple exposures stitched together to
create one nicely balanced image usually
and the last option in the photo capture
mode submenu is sweep panorama which
offers the nice inclusion of an
artificial horizon to keep you steady
while you take your shot we've talked
about the ones video performance in
other contexts and we're focused mainly
on photos in this tour but the ones
camcorder does offer several modes for
high and low speed filming in addition
to video HD are further down our simple
settings like the self-timer duration
just in case you've got a smartphone
tripod with you and you want a
self-portrait as well as a cropping
selector for square or rectangular shots
the default setting is wide on our unit
then for some reason there's a video
quality selector not really sure why
this isn't paired with video capture
settings above and routing out the
simple stuff is review duration which
lets you choose how long after you snap
a shot you want to see the photo you
just took diving a little deeper we
opened the image adjustments category to
find
well sliders for exposure contrast
saturation and sharpness we're used to
seeing exposure control and viewfinders
but seeing individual adjustments for
the other three it's pretty rare it's
also rare that most folks will use these
as these tweaks can be made with photo
editing software after the fact even
right on the device as we explained in
our galaxy s4 camera tour ISO refers to
the sensitivity of the image sensor the
lower the number the less sensitive the
sensor and the finer the grain you can
force the ISO manually higher to capture
more light in darker situations about
the picture will be much noisier and the
ones low-light performance is so good
anyway that most folks will probably
want to leave ISO in automatic white
balance refers to the desire to keep
objects that are white looking white and
it allows you to compensate for lighting
that might affect that like incandescent
or fluorescent bulbs and even direct or
cloudy sunlight continuous shooting
governs settings for the burst mode we
Illustrated before including the option
to disable the 20 photo limit face
detection will set focus to prefer faces
the camera detects and auto smile
capture allows the one to withhold
shooting until it detects that a subject
is smiling a fun if gimmicky feature
there's also support here for geo
tagging as well
shutter options contain a feature that
to some is the Holy Grail the ability to
disable the shutter sound when snapping
a photo there's also an option here to
replicate a feature from Windows Phone
enabling it allows you not just to tap
in focus but tap focus and shoot all
with one action at this point in the
menu we start to wonder why HTC decided
against a tabbed approach but not to
worry we're near the bottom another way
word video option here allows us to lock
focus when shooting disabling the
autofocus mode we prefer below that is
the toggle for the photographers grid
assisting with rule of third type
composition and below that the ability
to auto upload photos but sadly the sole
option offered is flicker which we don't
use but if you do pray thankfully other
apps like Google+ offer similar
functionality
lastly of course just in case you've
messed everything up and want the
nuclear option is the option to reset
the camera software back to its defaults
this is your Hall Pass to experiment
with settings as much as you like so do
it
once you get the hang of which ones to
fiddle with and which ones to leave
alone
these settings all lead to photos which
hopefully come out balanced and looking
just the way you intended if not you can
use the ones powerful on device editing
suite to apply filters add frames and
even retouch photos by removing redeye
and face shine adjusting lighting and
cropping flipping and rotating to your
heart's content it's a very in-depth
editor and it will eliminate the need
for most folks to look to third-party
apps to tweak their photos it's a very
nice piece of software to have onboard
the finished shots end up in a gallery
that thanks to an innovative but
intuitive layout and features like Zowie
is much more alive and much more fun
than other manufacturers gallery apps
we've covered this gallery along with
HTC's video highlights and HTC share in
an earlier video go check that out in
the interim we hope we've shown you that
as on the galaxy s4 the real story isn't
in what the raw camera hardware can do
but the fun the camera software lets you
have and on the HTC one that's a lot of
fun plenty for the mythical average
consumer that's going to do it for your
