competition for the manufacturer of the
next pixel alphabet sources claim that
Andy Rubin is making something new that
the company is backing and hold on to
your horses the whole Dex crave has a
price tag that's kind of crazy I am hi
Mary that and now that we've seen the
new galaxy how about if we move on and
give everybody else some well this is
 out daily the official news
today begin with Android wear not
because we're getting new smartwatches
but because old smartwatches are
actually getting Android wear to auto
this has taken forever but as of now the
polar m600 tech horrors offerings in
addition to the Casio WSB f10 are the
ones you can currently get the latest
version of Android that's just funny I
mean none of these companies were really
the primary players of Android wear I'm
talking to you Motorola Huawei watch and
just about everybody else where's the
update and speaking of early arrivals
that were unexpected for those of you
that are in the market for the LG G 6
there are people that are claiming to
already be receiving their G 6s and
we're talking about all four major US
carriers up yeah if we are expecting
this phone to not launch until April 7th
this is probably one of our favorite
phones this year so far obviously we
have to review a ton more it's very
early
but yeah the G 6 is one product that
we're definitely recommending how about
if we move the spotlight over the
Samsung Galaxy s8 I was extremely
impressed by that whole deck stockin the
whole concept of being able to use your
smartphone as a computer the interesting
part is that we just learned the price
tag you are paying a hundred and fifty
dollars for that and for those of you
that are wondering exactly how Microsoft
takes this with whole continuum thing
well the company is actually playing it
nicely up to the point where we know
that Windows 10 mobile is simply a flop
and the company is actually offering a
Samsung Galaxy S 8 Microsoft position
which is pretty much the same phone the
only thing is you get Microsoft software
bundled in the phone which is actually
already bundled in the phone so anyways
you get the idea it's
just the whole branding thing and hey
whatever works for the companies that's
great for those of you that we're
concerned that Andy Rubin is creating
yet another operating system to compete
with its own baby Android well actually
it's not happening that way we've got
sources from within alphabet Google's
parent company that are claiming that
Andy is actually working on a new
experience for Android and it has
everything to do with no bezels could it
be something new for the me makes could
it be that Andy is working with Xiaomi
on this I don't know but it would make a
lot of sense and we cannot wait I mean
Andy you created Android your version of
Android was probably not the prettiest
but I can't wait to see what you bring
up and finally the very hot nurses they
actually have to do with the next
version of the Google pixel not
expecting this product until later this
year but we hear there are already two
competitors for this smartphone we hear
that HTC and LG are both going at it
this rather interesting has HTC built
the Google pixel but we didn't like the
design and well the design came from
Google's so we can't really blame HTC
for this and we commend the company for
a ton of great smartphone designs but
after our recent comparison between the
HTC u ultra MBL gd6 it was clear that LG
is pushing the bar of design far further
than HTC is currently doing so it leads
me to the question of today if you had
to pick which company would you like for
the next Google pixel to be made from in
my case oh my god give me another
variant of the LG G 6 a la pixel that
would be awesome a pretty much Google
edition of the LG G 6 Google we don't
need your design let's just believe LG
doing this and leave in a comment down
below any ways we'd love to know your
opinion I love mine friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get to move
