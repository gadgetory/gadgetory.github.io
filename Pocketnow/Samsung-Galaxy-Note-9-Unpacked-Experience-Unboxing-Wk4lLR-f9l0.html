ain't the only one he's not the only one
it is about that time it is Thursday
August 9 2018
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
unpacked and we can't wait to share
everything that we are about to see so
let's begin we are about to do unpacked
how do you feel man I can't believe it
well like what was the last time we did
an event together five six seven oh my
god CES 2012
you ready for this you see what happens
what ladies and gentlemen it is my great
pleasure oh oh
all right so the presentation is done
the hands-on area is open our video is
already live but the company just
surprised us with a couple of new
products the Galaxy home and the Galaxy
watch interesting we weren't we didn't
we have no information on that so
definitely the branding I know I love it
I love it soon so we're definitely gonna
work on getting some hands image but
that looks oh my god that looks scary it
is snack for people so we're gonna have
to try to figure this out
Samsung unpacked is over and we have a
unit so it is unboxing time but he ain't
the only one he's not the only one what
color did you get I got that I got let's
do this
and here we are at the hotel back home
base so that we can unbox a samsung
galaxy note 9 mr. Vacarro
what's going on everybody I'm here with
Brandon minimun alright alright I have
no idea it looks like we're about to
have a competition of some sort yes so
what I should what is the prize I'm not
the prize is what's right in front of
you I feel like let's do it
still at Cheers Oh Cheers
like a kid in a candy store over there
so I'm being all like I I know a cameras
running which is the reason why I'm
being all like proper old my black front
nice yeah I guess they all the black the
black friend on every phone so like this
is um not quite coral blue they they
change their blue every year yeah I
remember when coral blue it's like a
light blue and then it got dark now it's
like kind of medium oh you're going for
it oh you go first cuz I got a remark
about this piece of plastic yeah not bad
it was it was a decent pole there's a
decent okay fine but there's one thing
that I noticed here that the cutout here
is in this weird almost triangular shape
because it has to accommodate where the
finger per meter is so I just thought it
was it's nothing wrong with that I just
think it's interesting it's the first
time I've seen this shade out because
like last year would have been just like
that yeah just this just the rec tab so
let's do this pole
oh there is no it's fine we already had
just gonna take that over there don't
look at a certain something yes I'm here
by the way
oh yeah something feels different about
these sides mobile side rails the side
rails yeah people different you it's
still framed up the same way that the
note 8 was for the most part and then we
needed the extra metal metal bevel you
think so yeah we got it
there's an extra bevel or maybe that's
the piece of plastic you haven't taken
off yet
we'll get there okay we can do the front
now yes this is a problem on three one
two and three that's that's potential
that's a good point
Wow you know I have to say the note
eight is just about the limits to the
size of a phone that I can handle but
because a little bigger I don't know is
it a little bit it feels very similar it
feels very similar yeah it feels more
squared off and maybe then you try to be
it does seem a little bit better to me
it does seem a little fatter well the
battery's matchmaker 4000 true it's like
a significantly bigger and of course
there's that there's that little cooling
system inside for here I'm sure if that
would actually add any weight to it or
any girth to your phone but we do have
these little bits of plastic on the side
so I just want to make sure we get our
sure recovered here it wasn't the
battery in the note 8 like 3000 milliamp
hours so this is like that 35
how many do you remember this is the
battery capacity of annuity 33 33 35
Absa 35 actually know what before we
turn it on there's one thing I wanted to
do take that pin out oh yeah that's a
yellow looks so much better
it's two-tone - you got gold here and
bright I would say borderline gaudy
yellow here but the gold is cool and the
blue was beautiful sir I wear yellow
shoes there's nothing gaudy there under
the table so you want to swap best fence
but I'm okay I'm gonna stick with this
just for review purposes what if I ever
get my hands on the black version I'm
going straight for the yellow pad that's
all you're right you gotta do that yeah
alright let's go ahead and turn these
bad boys on alright fine
there you go I thought where we might go
through the setup but this isn't
unboxing we should see what else is and
see what else is up in here okay
seen this before so more 20 about this
is like it's a it's also a converter
that you can make a USB aid to a USB see
so there's kind of an auxilary used to
it yeah it's good to have alright so we
got that and samsung for decades now has
been providing fast chargers what that's
a little bit disheartening but not the
worst oh here we go this is always my
favorite part well you went for the
cable I went to the headphones the
headphones I've reviewed a lot of
Samsung devices in my day once Samsung
started putting AKG headphones inside I
think good
I really haven't given there's a good
bass response they are reliable they're
nice it's a grated cable so overall
they're very good highly decent as I
guess the term I'll use that these are a
great backup headphones so if you ever
put these into like just a bag and it's
just there all the time you're always
gonna have at least a good pair of
headphones on well that's good yeah this
is what I use I have like five different
bags that have these very headphones in
it you got your extra tips have you ever
actually changed your tips in the note
device no okay what I thought but it's
good to have the option okay as always
when you use a note device you
predominantly use the s-pen to navigate
like a mouse or
your finger fingers fingers okay the
only time I use the s-pen for navigation
is why that is my use case scenario for
yes it's really comfortable yeah
all right well as I'm getting this phone
set up and that will conclude our
unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
pocket I was able to get one I was able
to get one so we decided to unbox them
together oh you know what I'm actually
not mad about this color because I
wanted this one for the galaxy s 9 plus
and now I got it with the no 9 so I
really shouldn't complain pretty it is
pretty so make sure you stay tuned to
rocket now for all of the coverage on
the Samsung Galaxy Note line there's
gonna be a lot of it and also let's so
what'd you think about the unboxing
about what contents were in it about the
phone itself in the comments down below
so yeah we're gonna catch them in the
next one and enjoy all of the content
from Samsung unpacked here in New York</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
