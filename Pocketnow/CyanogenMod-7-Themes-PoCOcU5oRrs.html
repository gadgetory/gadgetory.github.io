you know theming or skinning your
Android powered phone hasn't really been
that easy outside maybe changing your
wallpaper
now that's something that a lot of OMS
have tried to accomplish by pushing out
customizations to the Android operating
system which in turn has really delayed
their updates to newer versions of the
Android OS recently Google came out with
Android Gingerbread version 2.3 and with
that they promised to make that theming
and skinning process a lot easier
let's see exactly what they meant all we
have to do is look at an app called
theme chooser originally by t-mobile
but released into the open source so
let's go look at a couple of themes and
generally how theme chooser works okay
so what I've got here is a t-mobile g2
now this is running CyanogenMod seven
nightly eight now that's important you
need to have something that's the
release candidate of CM 7 or above to be
able to get this little guy and that's
the theme chooser app that I was talking
about it's not available in the market
it comes with the CyanogenMod roms and
it's actually something that was
developed by t-mobile and released into
the open source now what this lets you
do is change a whole bunch of stuff you
can see my icons down here have kind of
a orange appeal to them if you will an
orange theme and my power menu has
orange buttons my battery and my network
status indicators of course are orange
as well if we come over in to settings
we'll come in and look at display really
quick you can see my check mark is
orange when I tap on brightness my
brightness horizontal divider line here
is orange and I've got a nice orange
glow you notice I don't have theming on
my status bars just yet that is actually
a drawback to not to that app itself but
it's just something they haven't been
able to tie into yet the theme is
actually built so that this
that's opened up it'll go ahead and
theme those as well but really kind of
cool stuff that you can do with it now
let me show you how this works really
quick first and foremost I have a
separate app in here for a wallpaper
chooser so if we long press on the
desktop go into wallpapers you'll see I
have a new wallpaper entry called orange
octane wallpapers go ahead and select
that and here are all of the wallpapers
that this theme developer has put
together specific for this theme but of
course one theme isn't all that
impressive so let's go ahead and take a
look first and foremost is Android and
this is one of my favorite themes it's
green based but up here in the bars
including the bars in your in Gmail and
your menu bars and whatnot you have this
cool little background image on the bar
it's not just a flat color so that's
really kind of neat skipping over blue
Bionic we have a cyan bread which I
showed you in a previous video skipping
over these two we have the system and
that's just what comes default now these
themes you can either install with an
apk or you can download and install from
the market and I've installed these from
the market so let's go ahead and take a
look at red remix because we've just
looked at orange so we'll look at red we
tap apply it applies the settings and
there we have it now of course we need
to go in and change our wallpaper and
we're going to change this to one of
these let's choose on this one right
here and sometimes the wallpaper doesn't
take the first time so if you come back
in and try it again
you should then have it kind of a little
inconvenience and I really didn't see
that until I started shooting the video
for you but some things here you'll need
to reboot your phone to be able to make
apply for example you'll see my market
icon is still the orange theme if I
reboot that's going to be back and it's
going to be a red theme another thing is
if you notice when I tap and hold on my
icons I've got a green glow around them
now that's a setting that I can do in
the CyanogenMod settings right over here
CyanogenMod settings I can come in here
and change the color
of my highlight to be whatever I want
and this theme developer has gone the
extra mile and provided hexadecimal
codes to set that glow so you can make
the glow match as well so let me go
ahead and show you one more and that is
the blue Bionic go ahead and set that
and then we'll set the wallpaper to
match wallpapers you'll notice down here
that I don't want to have the red or
orange I only have blue Bionic
wallpapers so that menu matches the
theme and again I ran into my didn't
apply the first time bug so we'll go
ahead and set that and it looks great
now one thing that I do want to mention
is I'm running a launcher pearl premium
and that lets me set the wallpaper
assuming that the doc background image
down here and I just have that set as
grass which i think is kind of neat but
you can also grab a whole bunch of
background image packs and I have an
article on that over at pocketnow.com as
well to change that and you can make it
match your theme as you will so really
kind of cool this started out as a
t-mobile venture was released into the
open source and then of course picked up
by some of my favorite developers out
there it's really kind of cool all of
the themes that you've seen here
including the theme chooser and the
wallpaper picker are free they're
available in the market the and of
course will have links to those over at
pocketnow.com so head on over to the
website to to download those the themes
I do want to mention that they come free
but there is a donate version as well if
you think that these themes are great
and you want to support the developer to
hopefully make some more of these really
cool themes and really cool wallpapers
go ahead and download and install the
donate version they're only a couple
bucks and that's just a signal to him
that says hey I like the way that these
look and I want you to make more it's a
really good way to give back to that
developer all kinds of cool stuff so
this is what Google was talking about
when they said gingerbread would be able
to have theming capabilities built in
and really move away from having to have
custom launchers to change the look and
feel of the Android experience itself I
think they've done a really good job and
I'm eager to see what else that can be
done with this and I'm sure we'll see
that progress in the near future if
you'd like to see what can be done in
the future of course the future isn't
here yet so you need to make sure
you subscribe to our video channel so
that you can stay up to date on all this
cool stuff as it happens and if you'd
like seeing this stuff give us a thumbs
up so that we know that you want to see
more of this stuff for pocket now I'm
