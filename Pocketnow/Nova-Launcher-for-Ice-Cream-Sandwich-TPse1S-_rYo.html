of the things we really like about
Android is the ability to replace the
default launcher you know your home
screens the thing you have your widgets
and your icons and and launch all your
apps from it's really cool that you can
swap that out with another one that does
really all kinds of cool things so that
having been said let's go check out Nova
Launcher for Ice Cream Sandwich ok so
this is my Galaxy Nexus the GSM variety
I have OEM unlocked it and rooted the
phone but if you want to use the Nova
Launcher you don't have to do that there
are actually two install methods one you
install just like any normal apk and one
that you can install as a system app so
you can get a few more system level
bells and whistles so let's go ahead and
look at what you can do here with just
the regular app so the first thing
you're going to notice is I have four
icons across and five icons up the way I
can do that is I no longer have that
ubiquitous Google search bar across the
top and using this launcher I'm freed up
to use that extra row four icons which
is really kind of nice let's say however
I do want a Google search bar on one of
my screens so we'll go ahead and open up
a new screen now normally to add a
widget we would go into our app drawer
and come over here to widgets and we
would see a grid kind of a paged view of
the widgets and what they look like on
or what they will look like on your
launcher instead now we have the old
fashioned Google widget chooser here
which is just a list and hopefully your
widgets have been named very well by
whoever developed them so you can add
them quickly but I don't necessarily
like that in this view but you'll see
why I like it in just a minute so let's
go ahead and to Google search and there
we go it's right there up at the top if
we want to move it we can tap and drag
to any one of the five positions so just
as easy as that
now if you want to you can turn on the
ability to resize widgets so we're just
going to tap and hold choose resize and
look at that we took a four by or one by
four widget and we turned it into a one
by two so really easy we can do all
kinds of cool stuff just like that let's
go ahead and resize that back out just
so we can see it now if I want to add
another widget instead of going through
the app door now I can long press and
I've got my add to homescreen dialog
just like I had on previous versions of
Android or I can add an app a shortcut
of widget or get into wallpapers right
here from the home screen so to show you
that let's go into widgets and let's say
I want the beautiful text clock to buy
one widget there we go just like that
so a little bit of the older way of
doing things on the newer technology I
really like that in this context going
over into the the app drawer context not
so much but let's talk a little bit more
about the app drawer first thing you're
gonna notice up here is we've got this
little triangle here in the corner so if
I tap on apps I can now sort by or
filter by it all new or downloaded which
helps me be able to refine what I'm
looking at without having to page
through a whole bunch of these panels
just like that
I can't scroll over to widgets anymore
but we saw why next you'll notice I
don't have a market icon up at the top
instead I have a menu icon so let's go
ahead and open that and you can see I
still have quick access to the market
but I can also manage my apps very
quickly from here without having to open
up the settings control panel for lack
of a better word there and I can also
get into my Nova settings now again this
is the noble launcher so let's open that
and see what we can do wallpapers
scrolling we can turn off for better
performance we can turn on if you want
it to look nice and you know wallpaper
scroll II you can set it to be static
only so if you have a just a regular
picture that you're using is your
wallpaper which a lot of people are you
can set that so that that will scroll
but live wallpapers won't and that's the
setting that I have and then delayed
wallpaper scrolling is delayed which may
improve health the route may improve
performance with something that we don't
know if it's the developer didn't put
that all in there
kind of funny to scroll effect now I
don't know if you noticed or not when I
was changing home screens I had kind of
a cube animation I like that kind of
stuff it does take a little bit of time
so if you want speed you'll want to turn
it off
you can do that here you can set the
scroll effect to none or cube to options
right now we're probably going to get
more in the future
I'll show you cube here in just a minute
when you get back there screen
orientation you can set this to default
which is normally locked but it can
rotate if you're docked we can auto
rotate if that's set in your system
settings we can neither force it into
portrait or force it into landscape so
kind of cool what you can do you can now
have a you know landscape view if you
like operating your fill in that way on
your home screen without flipping your
phone around quite as much we'll leave
that at the default their label icons we
can display or not display a label
underneath the app shortcuts which is
kind of nice if you know Gmail looks
like the gmail icon you don't
necessarily have to have the word
underneath it we'll leave that at the
default but you could turn that off if
you wanted to just to kind of clean up
some clutter desktop grid we can set the
grid size for the apps and widgets on
the desktop right now it's set to five
rows four columns we can adjust that
this is really the best way to do it
without overcrowding and getting
overlapping stuff in my opinion but you
can make that more dense if you know you
favor density over over brevity next
let's get into widgets you can put
widgets in your drawer that was what we
were showing you before notice there
weren't widgets in the drawer there was
just the widget list you can put them
back in there but you have to install it
as a system app which this is not now
installing as a system app does require
that you have root so we're not going to
show you that right now but know that
all those complaints that I had you can
do it you just have to jump through a
few more hoops to be able to get it
being able to resize all widgets is not
set up by default you have to manually
tick that checkbox but as soon as you've
done that you can resize your widgets
very simple very easy very
self-explanatory it's great you can get
updates check for updates just like that
now this is not available in the market
yet it's only available through
xda-developers we'll give you a link to
that over in the article
pocketnow.com so make sure you head over
and read that article so you can see how
to get that but there is an update
mechanism built right into the app so
you don't have to keep going back to XDA
to see if there are are new things that
you can install you just have to check
that and it'll go from there of course
we have error and usage reporting that
you can send back to it tell the
developer how you're using the app and
if you're running into any problems so
he can make some some changes and
probably the best feature of all from a
guy who goes through a lot of launchers
from the settings you can actually
change what launcher you want to use so
I haven't set any launcher as default
right now I have launcher which is the
one that comes with the Galaxy Nexus and
I have nova launcher nova launcher is
this one so i can go ahead and select
that but this feature lets me have quick
access to be able to go in and change
that and you'll notice that it says it's
not set as my default home because i
didn't put a check in that checkbox but
really kind of cool alright so let's go
back I'm gonna hit home because I
haven't set a default it's gonna ask me
which launcher I want to complete the
action with will stick with nova
launcher now this is what i was saying
about the animation or the screen
transition will go ahead and change you
see how that has a nice 3d cube effect
right there it's really still kind of
quick so not bad at all and gives you a
nice kind of look and feel that we're
used to with stuff like the the launcher
pro and atw lunch or e^x apps so really
really neat stuff there are a few other
bells and whistles that you can do with
this app but for the most part that's
what most people are going to want to
get it for it's really cool it's really
fast and well essentially it's a
worthwhile replacement for your stock
app for your Ice Cream Sandwich device
that's a kicker you do have to have Ice
Cream Sandwich because it is extending
the the pre-existing Ice Cream Sandwich
launcher with its own special code and
capabilities so keep that in mind
you don't need root unless you want to
be able to
widgets in your app drawer over there
which I don't think is a big deal but
very neat cool we're interested to see
what your opinions are do you like this
kind of stuff if you do let us know why
is it missing features let us know in
the comments down below showing off all
kinds of cool new stuff you can do with
your Android powered phones in this case
the Nova Launcher for Ice Cream Sandwich
