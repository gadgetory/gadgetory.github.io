pocketnow.com
and this is the first of two videos of a
software tour of the samsung omnia 2 in
this video we're going to go through the
home screen layout which is similar in
concept to the original omnia but they
take it another step further so let's
start off by turning on the device and
we can do so with the unlock button to
the right now we get this beautiful
unlock screen and I wish you could be
here to see how crisp these oranges are
in the background and how great these
blacks look so from this screen you can
see your missed calls and you are new
messages although I wish you could see
your next appointment that would be
perfect but you can't get everything so
to unlock the device you tap and hold
this little icon and you are taken into
your first home screen now the new
interface on the omnia 2 operates much
like the Android interface on the g1 and
the early Android devices where there
are multiple home screens that you can
go to and if you look up here we can
kind of see that we're on one of three
if we swipe to the right it moves to the
next one and you can have widgets
different widgets on each of the
different home screens and for some
reason there is a lot of GI Joe
wallpaper built into the omnia I think
the studio of that that makes GI Joe the
movie has paint Samsung for some product
placement which kind of annoys me to be
honest especially since I can't figure
out how to change the wallpaper on
screens 2 &amp;amp; 3
I've even consulted the manual so that's
going to take further investigation but
let's go back to the the first home
screen where I have changed the
wallpaper to something a little bit
nicer than the GI Joe wallpaper so
before with the samsung omnia you are
really limited in the amount of widgets
that you could put on your device but
since then Samsung has opened up
development of the widget interface to
developers so there's a whole universe
of widgets now they use these widgets on
their smart devices like the omnia 2 and
they also use the widgets on their not
their dumb phones their feature phones
that you may have seen selling out there
so let's go through some of these
widgets and I'll show you how the
selection of widgets has changed because
now there are a lot of useful widgets so
you know this one right here is not
new it is the media player so if you
have an SD card installed or you know
since this has 8 gigabytes of memory you
may have some music right on your device
and you can play it right from your home
screen if we slide this one over we have
the kind of slideshow so if you have
pictures of you know your family or
friends and you want to kind of carousel
through on your home screen you can have
that happen and of course with any
widget you can tap and hold to move it
around anywhere on the screen but you
can't fit that many widgets on one
screen which is which is why it's good
that there are multiple screens and we
just bring it back to the tray when
we're done with it sliding this widget
to the right it's kind of a profile
switcher so you can quickly choose if
you want to vibrate or volume on or
volume off going down the list we have
stocks which is good
this was actually present in a rom
update to the the original omnia if we
tap on the widget we will get in an
expanded screen that shows us all of our
stocks and we can actually tap on our
stocks to get a chart kind of like HTC
devices or even the iPhone it shows you
a chart you can tap on five-day it
downloads the data you can see how the
stock is trending and we're gonna get
out of that you know that okay so let's
let's put that one back next up we have
an FM radio widget so this device does
an FM radio you need to connect to your
headset in order to do that and uses
three point five millimeters so that's
good we have a great AccuWeather widget
which shows you the current temperature
and the conditions in whatever city
you're in and we can tap on the widget
to kind of get a more extended forecast
and let me try that again here comes a
really nice display of the weather
conditions and the forecast that's
coming up see what else we have here we
have this one which just shows you the
name of your provider right now I'm on
AT&amp;amp;T and I'm getting 3G as you can see
up there sometimes I get 3G Plus which
implies HSDPA this one here will turn on
and off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth I wouldn't
want to waste the screen real estate by
having this widget up there and
we have the F for Facebook although it's
not actually a Facebook application it's
simply a link to the Facebook website so
if I tap on that I'm taken to opera
mobile nine point five I wish this was
an application but unfortunately it's
not it's actually a pretty cool concept
to be able to have these these shortcuts
to websites on your home screen I
haven't found a way to do that yet for
example I'd like to have a little p for
pocket now or at W for Wikipedia or any
website that I visit on a regular basis
that would be super cool we have MySpace
in YouTube and those two are the same as
the Facebook widget they just link to
the website just kind of kind of blocked
so here we have CNN mobile and slide
that over to the right this is actually
a widget which shows you some news
headlines and if you find a story that
you want to read you tap on the story
and you are taken to the full version
you can get it just right
here it goes so you have a CNN
application and it actually doesn't take
you to Opera Mobile it takes you to the
CNN application which is quite nice and
you can go between World News and top
stories and that sort of thing so a
useful application for keeping up with
what's going on in the news now over
here here's another widget slide it over
to the right this is the calendar widget
but it doesn't give us much information
it simply links us to the touch calendar
which is samsung skinned calendar which
is actually quite nice it works kind of
like it does on touchflo 3d on the newer
devices or even like the iPhones
calendar where you tap on a day and it
shows you the appointment that you have
there but there's no widget for next
appointment which is a really big
omission on the part of Samsung going
down we have some streaming TV widgets
here's an analogue clock that I added
which really doesn't do very much except
show you the time we're going to come
back to this one that says widgets we
have a Google widget which is always
handy it'll allow you to open up Google
Maps link to Gmail or search Google
right from your screen so here's the
on-screen keyboard we're going to talk
more about the on-screen keyboard later
but you can search for you know you know
Samsung
and you click on the search button and
opera mobile opens and does a google
search for you but you get the point
exit and then we have a standard clock
which is always good to know what time
it is so you're not late and here's the
here's the place you go if you want to
add new widgets I'm gonna close this so
that we get a full screen view so there
are a lot of widgets that have been
added
I haven't found many that are too useful
most of them are tip calculators or
simple things like that I'd like to have
a Twitter widget perhaps or maybe a full
Facebook widget where I could update my
facebook status there's a lot of
possibilities here but let's go through
some of the widgets that you can have so
if we go to top recommended it's a
little bit slow right now I'm over 3G
actually 3G plus so it should be fast
but it's not let me move this over a
little bit okay so here we are and we've
accuweather.com I already have that dig
I don't have that quit smoking unit
converter if we tap over to the right
we'll get the next list of widgets
calculator tech tile calculator so a lot
of calculators as you can see these are
the top recommended and they're all
calculators I'm surprised there aren't
some better quality things here tip
calculator word world clock baby
countdown if you're expecting so let me
go back to an actual good widget and
I'll show you what it's like to download
one so we'll go to most downloaded and
it's refreshing
again this widget interface is kind of
slow kind of clunky I wish it was a
dedicated program so let's find
something that's actually somewhat
useful in here okay we'll just choose
the unit converter just for the sake of
demonstrating so you tap on unit
converter then you're taking an opera
mobile which is a step that I think they
should eliminate so you download the
widget directly but from here it's
pretty easy actually you just double tap
zoom in shows you that 77 people have
downloaded this so it must not be too
popular and then you click download and
it actually downloads pretty fast and
installs pretty much instantly so
there's not much waiting after this
point and here it says success install
widget which really doesn't make sense
but that sentence but it means that if
we go back to our widgets over here we
will see the converter here at the
bottom so here's the widget that we've
added added within a few moments
although the the whole process of
finding the widget is kind of cumbersome
so we can you know type in a certain
length and get a conversion from
centimeters to you know inches so
overall the widget interface on the
samsung omnia 2 is much improved from
where it was on the original omnia
especially in terms of widget selection
the whole process of getting widgets is
a little bit cumbersome I wish it was
easier and I also wish that they could
have a widget for next appointment
that's really critically important if
you're a business user and you want to
be able to see at a quick glance what
your next appointment will be also it
would be cool to have the ability to
take a website URL and just place a
screen full of Quick Links that would be
quite cool one more suggestion I'd like
to have a widget where I could put a
picture of somebody and be able to click
on their name and have it dial them
directly or link to text message so
that's pretty much it we'll be back soon
with a more full tour of the whole
software situation on the samsung omnia
2 samsung has done so much to change the
interface on the on the omnia 2 you're
going to forget that it's Windows Mobile
for a lot of the time so we'll be back
soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
