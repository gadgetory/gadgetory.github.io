pocket now calm I've spent the weekend
with the new iPad and I wanted to tell
you what I love and what I hate about it
let's get to it now all right so let's
start with the hate list there are three
or four things that I really dislike
about the new iPad number one the
display the display seems to have lower
brightness than the ipad 2 in fact if
you adjust both iPads to around the same
level of brightness it seems that the
ipad 2 actually has more brightness or
at least you need to turn up the ipad 2
3's brightness to a higher degree to get
the same level of brightness than you
would need on the ipad 2 on a lower
degree another thing that's a little bit
annoying something i don't really like
is the warmth that's been increased on
the new ipad meaning it's more yellow
rather than more blue as found on the
ipad 2 and it's just a matter of
personal preference but i actually like
it a little bit cooler they did the same
thing between generations of the iphone
they made it from cool to warm and now
iphone screens are actually pretty warm
another thing that has gotten worse
between the ipad 2 and the ipad 3 is the
viewing angle the ipad 2 had an
incredible viewing angle from really
every direction it's slightly worse on
the new ipad it's not a deal breaker
because you're probably not going to be
looking at your ipad from a dramatic
degree but it's just something to think
about another thing i really dislike
about the new ipad i'd probably call
this the number one thing i dislike
about it is its size and weight yes it's
only a millimeter thicker than the ipad
2 and it's just slightly heavier but
when you're holding a tablet for a while
reading a newspaper or a magazine it
really makes a difference one day in the
future we're going to have tablets that
are really just a piece of glass it's
it's probably many years away because
battery technology is so far from it but
one day holding a tablet computer to
your face to read a magazine or
newspaper is going to feel as light
weight and easy and thin as a current
magazine that you would get off the
store shelves right now it still feels
like you're holding a hunk of metal and
the ipad 3 is is worse than the ipad
in this department another thing that's
super annoying about the ipad 3 is how
long it takes to get a full charge the
ipad 2 would take about three hours to
get from zero all the way up to 100
which was fantastic the ipad 3 takes
about seven hours to charge which is not
that big of a deal if you don't mind
charging overnight but if you wake up in
the morning and you're at two percent
and you want to use the ipad during the
day well you got to keep it on the
charger for seven hours and by the time
it's done charging you're already home
from work and who cares so charging time
is a big pain on the new ipad but that's
because they had to use a lot more
battery to be able to power the
quad-core GPU and to be able to power
the 3.1 million pixels on the screen now
let's talk about the things that i love
about the new ipad certainly there is a
lot to love starting with the screen the
screen is so crisp and clear i mentioned
this neon boxing that it's starting to
look or it's gotten to the point where
it looks like a printed magazine or
printed newspaper if you go to a
magazine on your on your local newsstand
and look at the text you can't see
pixels because it's printed at such a
high DPI it looks painted on the page it
looks beautiful the ipad the new ipad is
able to recreate this sensation
unfortunately apps are still getting
updated so there's a lot of apps out
there that cannot take advantage of the
higher resolution on the screen like the
wall street journal app obviously over
time this will change another thing i
really like about the new ipad is the
LTE it's great to be able to take the
new ipad to a coffee house or anywhere
where there's LTE and get faster than
Wi-Fi data speeds which just means you
tap on a link boom the page opens faster
you tap on another link boom you're
watching a youtube video it streams
instantly it just means a little bit
less waiting time but it also means a
hit to battery life you're going to get
worse battery life when you're running
on LTE but that's certainly expected
keep it on Wi-Fi as much as you possibly
can so it might sound like I hate more
about the new iPad than I love and that
might actually be the case the new iPad
is exactly what you would expect it's a
thicker heavier
ipad 2 with a better display in LTE
period there are no surprises here the
screen yes it's absolutely beautiful
it's great to have LTE but it's not as
revolutionary and breakthrough as you
would expect for a product to come from
apple now of course they can't always
release a revolutionary product but to
be honest this makes me really want to
wait for the ipad 4 because the ipad 4
it's probably going to have the gruesome
great features as the ipad 3 but they're
finally going to figure out a way to
make it thinner and lighter which is
very much needed and a device that you
spend hours reading with if you liked
this video please give us a thumbs up
and we're going to have even more
coverage of the new ipad i keep calling
it the ipad 3 coming up soon thanks for
watching
