cameras and pixel books and talking
speakers and of course a pair of new
phones for her software and services
company there was a lot of hardware
discussed from Google this week we've
got a lot to talk about so make sure
you're charged and ready for episode two
seven three of the PocketNow weekly
recorded October 6th at noon pacific
time this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wish did you wished existed when you
were a kid and on the schoolyard the
only number that beat a googolplex was
infinity plus one that's true story
you get into that I don't know was that
just me you would have fights to billion
and then it'd be like a googolplex and
then you'd say infinity plus one and
that was like the triple dog dare I'm
point Carlos back now senior editor
pocketnow.com blasting the signal from
sunny Southern California in the gadget
lab joined virtually as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong out on
the east coast has a going buddy boy
I mean cops and robbers was my thing as
a kid and that was pretty much the
extent of it maybe a little bit of
kickball but nothing to that really
extreme there was a terrible ad show
called masks or masks where it was like
this ripoff of transformers so you would
have a car and then the doors would open
DeLorean style and it would turn into a
plane there was like a semi that would
turn into like this command center and
like shoot things I have no idea and
like we would actually I remember I was
it I think I was in the first grader in
kindergarten we would actually reenact
the vehicles so like I would write I
would pretend I was a car and then I
would just throw my arms up and then I
was the airplane and we'd fly around and
shoot each other because we were all too
broke to afford transformers like the
real ones I thought that was a whole
minute before you've actually introduced
people watching right now like why is he
being so silent on the second I'm just
trying to be respectful I mean somebody
else's place right so in the gadget lab
I am
I'm proud to introduce the man the myth
the legend mr. Joshua Vergara hey what's
going on going buddy handshake here we
were thinking about trying to do our
fusion thing here yeah I think I'm
cropped a little tight no it's all
Google mm-hmm it's I mean this is all
we're talking about this podcast and I'm
super happy to be like number one on the
west side of LA for the first time in
like forever because I never I never
come out here but also because the the
if there was any reason for me to come
out here be you thank you sir thank you
for having me in your lovely place oh
what a lovely bromance going on around
here yeah I mean you know it's the sort
of quintessential Southern California
thing where it took us like two years to
realize that we actually lived within
driving distance yeah and it took us
maybe like another year before we
actually hung out which is funny because
driving distance means 90 minutes or
less I mean like my box has been getting
bigger but if you live outside of a
certain box then you just you might as
well be living in like Siberia yeah I
mean some people have it boxes eight
miles or seven miles of you like you you
can't you can't describe distance that's
that's not the hook in Southern
California it's how long will it take me
to get there yeah and if you live more
than two hours away then you're you're
off the map that's that's just not a
thing
exactly San Diego from Elias just about
as far as I would go to see any one
person I liked exactly I mean I have to
really like that person but um you know
to avoid this becoming just like an
episode of California reports I'm John
have you get off the 101 and take the
110 we actually have some real tech news
for you guys this week especially with
the the Google announcements set so I
mean that what you just did right there
for people listening was he kind of had
this hand rubbing head down the gesture
which I kind of feel I'm getting ready
there's been a little of that posture
for a lot of people with some of these
in
and it feels like this was a bit more of
a mixed reaction what Google talked
about this I agree with that but mine is
more like I'm getting ready because what
I expected out of the event turned out
to be so much more you know because you
go there expecting the funds exactly and
then there was just so much else to look
at yeah and I don't I don't prescribe
too late to leaks right I don't like
looking at them before any events and I
actually just don't have the habit of
doing that I don't even enjoy watching
movie trailers yeah I just I didn't look
at any of the leaks or any of the any of
the stuff that came out I was aware of
them right I just don't have the habit
of looking at them leading up to an
event so on I'm at the event I was like
many of the people in the audience who
audibly did you watch the live stream
yeah I was I was just like people were
audibly gasping yeah yes so I mean there
was this one really crappy actually
before we do that Jules would you be so
kind as to explain to viewers how they
can join this conversation I kind of
feel like Josh and I might steamroller
over part of the normal structure of our
pop really I'm just here to watch you
guys I'm not even supposed to be talking
at this point but in all actuality we do
want you to participate as a viewer as a
listener as whoever that you happen ap
today with the hashtag PN weekly on
Twitter also you might want to hashtag
made by Google so that we know that
you're actually tuning in and
participating in our fun here with the
Google event this week also if you are
well you can't be here live sometimes
that happens we understand that talk to
us via email at podcast at pocketnow.com
we'll get to that question eventually
but for those of you live right now it's
hashtag P and weekly on Twitter that is
the best place that we'll be able to see
your comments and questions so let's
let's jump in immediately I mean I
almost feel like we need to just get
these out of the way with the most
expected part of the presentation the
pixel two and the pixel two XL going
again with a big little phone
distribution that I was going I was
actually complaining during the event
because they weren't the first thing
they talked about yeah yeah I'm so you
said every other launch or they're all
like oh and also we have ups
well and there was me because you were
saying there was there was probably a
different sense of the people being in
the room actually there was this one
really crappy Twitter comment that I was
reading through while watching the
livestream like oh and the people that
are actually there laying it on so thick
like they're so excited and you're like
but you're there I mean like I might
have criticisms of the note 8 but when
I'm actually at the event there is
there's a buzz there's an excitement
there's an energy to being a part of
that that that that display as small as
it might be you're still being a part of
history
exactly yeah so we might not be we might
not it might not be the Gettysburg
Address but it's something that we are
happy to be a exactly and and for the
people who are at the Gettysburg Address
oMG they were just laying it on so that
PFT I so pixel pixel pixel to pixel to
and pixel to excel um the original pixel
I feel set a very high bar from a
company that still hasn't quite proven
itself as a consumer just distributor or
manufacturer of smartphones we have this
great relationship in the techie space
the Nexus phones we kind of have an
understanding of what Google can bring
to the table my hypothesis is always
consumers won't take a brand seriously
until it's been around for about three
years
okay the second year kind of building on
the success of the last phone what was
your reaction being there seeing what
they had the display for the phones the
little pixels the big pics okay yeah I
it was everything that I was expecting
it to be based upon how the pixel was
handled last year like you said big
little and I was laughing of some of
those comments because I thought they
were a bit obtuse to say on stage and
then you finally get the phones in your
hands and you're like now that wasn't
true you you don't want to have features
or specs that are different between one
or the other right except if it's quad
HD screen a big battery or anything like
that
um the phone's turned out kind of I
don't know there's so many mixed
reactions like lawn over at Andrew
Authority he doesn't like how they look
right I adore how they look I think they
look wonderful
there they looked
compared to every other phone and that's
the number one thing that we need right
now yeah so our specifications go that's
exactly everything that we were that we
would want them to be Snapdragon 835
four gigabytes of RAM a good store good
not great storage options right without
an SD card slot and I know that the main
thing people are gonna be talking about
they already are is that lack of a
headphone check totally yeah but as as
far as how they presented it it kind of
falls in line with how a lot of
companies have been doing it recently or
they don't focus on the specifications
as much totally seeing the experience
exactly and a few people were
complaining I remember they said that
what are going to be those features on
the pixel this year that end up making
it onto every other phone so that the
pixel is no longer special right because
Google assistant I remember being really
mad when Google assistant made it onto
the first non pixel phone and I was like
so what's the point the pixel that and
as they were presenting yeah as they
were presenting the phones I realized
there were a couple of things
Google photos still included yeah yeah
then there was another they always on
display always always checking to see if
there's music playing and it will tell
you what a nice and a nice low perk and
aside from that having the portrait mode
done by the computational data in the in
the camp yeah also I have a lot of
thoughts on that but I'm just gonna I'm
just kind of over viewing what will ease
in yeah overall I'm really happy with
what I saw okay and I would very much
I'm actually a big proponent of the
pixel line because every now and then
like s phone reviewers and I have to
have to preface that I don't look at
these things all the time as just a
general consumer right because it's hard
to yeah it's it's really easy to lose
perspective you've seen the bookshelf
yeah exactly I have a drawer where's
every phone there's no way to be a
consumer when this stuff is so
accessible it's not getting as a
consumer I will say that as long as you
actually get eyeballs on this phone yeah
then yeah it'll look pretty enticing
it's made by Google and I'm sure all of
the all of the different ads and ad
campaigns are going to be all over the
place in places like New York in San
Francisco it's a genius hashtag yeah
exactly but as a phone reviewer the
reason why I love the pixel is because
it's a breath of fresh air
from all of the other phones that try
way too hard while Google is there
saying hey we know that our experience
is good you're going to have a good time
with it so here's what we made I mean I
I think you know it's been put out there
or something
maybe not derogative but you know
there's always kind of a snide wink to
it but the Google iPhone you know again
it's focused on a certain streamlined
consumer accessibility yeah and what I'm
really hoping because again I haven't
spent any time actually handling one is
that Google can do what Apple has
succeeded with up until the iPhone 10
yeah in not making users have to relearn
parts of the UI that's true so even even
like one of my biggest criticisms of a
company like Samsung has changed for
change sake where if I pick up a galaxy
s7 and I liked how that was laid out
there's no guarantee that my menus won't
be completely different when I pick up a
galaxy yes yeah
like the next phone I like the curve
suddenly went up again exactly or just
you know where things move around in the
camera app yeah so between the s8 and
the note 8 they have prioritized
different things in the camera app
there's no way to get a feel for what
Samsung is whereas like the iPhone
camera app hasn't changed ever right
like I could give someone on a 3GS and
iPhone 8 plus and there would be almost
no learning curve yeah exactly so that
to me so we're talking about the change
of interface are we talking about the
Google button on top I'm gonna talk
about the home button of the home screen
and the Google Waze is that was new and
for the pixel launcher I was on the top
left now it's moved down to the bottom
we see it's changes like that I think
are concerning but but it's more does
Google think that they can achieve a
consistency of UI you know you have so
many different apps that like something
will never exist when you have all of
these other companies who have their own
versions oh is it isn't that the point
if a nexus or a pixel is gonna say like
this is our vision for it so when you
have all like you know encouraging more
people to actually you know they it's a
bar it means that you can type text on
it as opposed to a button where it's
just like oh that doesn't
signal enemy's the things so I'm not
sure if that had to do and then that's a
big problem with say like 3d touch on an
iPhone there's no conveyance I mean when
you're talking about something like
conveyance we understand a bar but do
people do people who are using the new
pixels no to hold the home button
exactly you know which is what I think
the squeeze is actually kind of a good
idea just because I guess I'm a button
you're like I want a shouter button that
could then be a root program I don't
know yeah I'm totally I mean come on my
favorite phone is the key one for God
but having the having the squeeze
function there as long as the
documentation in the box
yeah makes it clear that squeeze the
phone and all of a sudden Google's there
at your beck and call
I'm sure a lot of people are gonna have
that workflow where they take the phone
out squeeze in there eating it before
they're even looking at the screen and
that's that's been like my big problem
with things like iris or face scanning
it's like there's an extra action that
has to happen before I can actually get
into the phone however I want to circle
back to something that you were talking
about not to get too into the specs
because Google didn't care about this
back yeah they didn't but I did find it
kind of it made me a little apprehensive
because I'll be reviewing the smaller
pixel Jaime is gonna be getting the
pixel excel could actually really happy
about this because I'm not the biggest
fan of super large phones but the color
the color of the excel the Panda oh I
definitely want the two-tone I would
love to have that phone on the smaller
yeah I was a big old root boy in high
school you know when you have the blue
old pixel here mmm the blue of the new
pixel I don't I don't like it I don't
like it at all it's like it's like a bad
sherbert you know what I mean no I mean
it's kind of loose the baby establish
you have to say it with a shrug yeah
this is this is a declarative statement
this is really blue yeah even yeah even
Google knows that's kind of what a bold
statement but but the thing that's
concerning me about the smaller pixel
are those differences on things like the
screen I think Samsung and LG have made
excellent arguments for why even a
smaller phone should be moving to a two
by one aspect ratio and Google is being
tasked with trying to be the Vanguard
for Android
not for galaxies not for LG V's not for
skins not for anything else
this is this is Android their take on
Android and part of that is gonna be
what does your phone do with a taller
aspect ratio which you'll have on the XL
but you're not gonna have on the smaller
pixel I somehow feel like the smaller
the smaller I was at the smaller XL the
M I've almost feel like the regular
pixel is going to be used or rather and
again it all comes down to how Google
presents these phones in their ads and
everything like that
the smaller pixel is definitely made for
people who just want to have that
experience mmm simple experience while
the xle is for the experimenters the
cutting-edge people which is kind of
like what the iPhone 8 in the A+ are
because you want to have those dual
cameras you want to have a little bit
extra but in Google's sense like they're
kind of eking towards that you know
they're not they're not gonna put dual
cameras or they're not going to put
different features on one over the other
but if you get the excel you're gonna
get a little bit of pillar box saying
you're gonna get elements that are
different now I mean because we always
get these questions even though I find
the question of worth it 'no skeins of
toxic to a lot of discussions but we're
talking a $200 price difference between
the two phones and is that really is
that it sort of really absorbed by just
the taller screen and the larger but not
at all i was recently asked are there
any phones out there that are not worth
your money and i pretty much said the
noting if i was going if i was going to
pay for a phone outright without any
like sleuthing of trading my phone right
paying total price for that doesn't make
sense to me no and i'm very inclined to
say maybe the excel is also there but
it's creeping up it's creeping up is
creeping up but i still want it that's
the difference like you know III don't
get me wrong the note is a great device
right but i want actually want the pics
like so yeah you know so paying that
price it's not quite as bad in my
opinion because there's also just
nothing else in Google's line up I mean
it's silly to think that a galaxy s 8
plus is something of a consolation prize
if you were really shopping the note but
the trade-off is do you need the s-pen
and a lot of people will say you know
I'm probably not gonna use that you have
an option yeah you have an option to
save yourself some cash
even like again if you were saying you
just wanted to buy it outright where
else the pixel XL doesn't and the the
consolation prize would be buying the
first-generation pixel or something like
which is cheaper now yeah it's not it's
not a bet as someone asked me like
should I get the original pixel now that
it's like was it $100 less now yeah like
I was like yeah that's not a bad idea
let me like the 820 is gonna age I think
a lot better but you know it's the
discussion I just really wish they'd
kept really blue yeah um it's the
discussion on I get the other names of
their colors also like I'm not okay not
gonna get weird on this podcast but you
know so little weird it's just black and
clearly white are not what you want in
today's political climate anyway and for
the two-tone being like a Michael
Jackson song yeah okay alright but but
it seems to me like one of the arguments
and it's not a decisive argument but one
of the arguments against buying in the
older pixel would be how on the pulse do
you want to be with new software and
services and and that does seem to be
the deciding factor for we're looking at
machine learning algorithms AI for your
camera the original pixels no slouch
that's phenomenal image processing but
they're talking about taking depth
mapping to an entirely new level
you know portrait mode without dual
cameras and I'm really curious to see if
they can pull off that kind of image
processing on the fly yeah well we were
talking this is slightly off tangent but
we were talking about taking shots every
time of the term AI or machine learning
came up if you would have died we would
have died you would have basically would
have died and it was during the camera
that I feel like I heard that more than
any other part of the of the
presentation mm-hm and I'm curious what
you would say being you know a resident
camera expert so she spoke on camera
advocate I should say right now how
computational photography could change
the game because I had a lot of I will
say negative um you know one of our one
of our friends from from across the pond
or across the Pacific I should say he
said was a she and I
actually arguing that computation I was
arguing that computational photography
takes away from this craft that I've
learned over the last okay decade
because now we're putting it into a
smartphone that oh we're using everyone
else's photos in perpetuity yeah in
order to make it so that your photo is
the best hello screw the fact that I'm
like oh I know my settings I know the
triangle I have light you know so and I
can't I I there's also this phenomenon
that I realized I did after the event
where the same Apple bias that I was
advocating against we're saying that I
kind of hated yeah I was having for
google okay so for a while did I was
like oh that's cool like portrait mode
on the front-facing camera using
computational data that's a lot like
what the iPhone is doing but I'm more
I'm more supportive of the way Google is
using it okay you know but I'm still I
still hate that this is where
photography is going so I'll write or
what you think so I I agree to a point
that there is something that feels feels
like sort of a bad shortcut yeah you
know for making our photos more
photographic and and I'm in the same
boat I mean I've got multiple just
interchangeable lenses by the way my
little it's a great micro four-thirds
your this podcast not sponsored by Kodak
but but should be sponsored by Lucroy
number whom on the table a little
mini-fridge in here but um so I feel one
of the things that's really difficult to
rein in with computational processing of
imagery is right now and this won't be
true forever at some point it won't
matter what sensor you capture an image
from it's going to be run through a
software processing chain but the user
might create or that another company
might create for the user to make the
photos what look pretty with the good
colors but right now there's still an
unpredictability to it um there's still
a lack of finesse I mean if you've ever
shot on razor sharp ridiculously shallow
depth-of-field glass
you know III rented a 50 millimeter f1
point Oh from my old Canon
I was just regular I mean that that it's
a coffee can on the front of your front
your camera and the way that you're
you're sort of tightrope walking with
your photography absolutely to get what
you want in focus you know the
difference between this and this means
your eyes are just out of focus it's
like you know that you can't get to that
yet with computational photography with
computational image processing
but even then like the the fake bouquet
effects and all that you know to to the
trained eye
it's egregiously bad like yeah and well
and and it's it's acceptable but it's
but it's the same thing that we've
constantly run into where if I take an
amazing portrait of you and you share it
on Instagram it's still not gonna look
great um but there is something that you
can point to very readily and very
easily um very readily and very easily
when you take a portrait from these zoom
sensors on the iPhone and Samsung on the
note where it's a lower quality sensor
it doesn't look as good especially when
you compare it to like the dual sensor
effect from Huawei because it's using
just normal sensors there's an image
degradation there's an image blurriness
it's softer it doesn't look great yeah
and then I think the the user because
we're sharing so many images if you're
just flipping through Instagram no one's
gonna care yeah the people that are
actually looking can tell the difference
between an amazingly crafted portrait
and something that you took from your
phone so I think we're still a
generation away and there's still some
things we can't get away from when it
comes to hardware and a true
photographers workflow mm-hm
but at some point we're just all gonna
have to make that switch I mean it's the
same thing um we've got a couple tweets
here that I want to get to okay from
Russell Santos this is another thing
that I think kind of fits into that
there I feel like we're analog kindred
spirits to a degree and Russell's reason
why I use the v30 and I love using the
manual mode on the v.34 both video and
photo and one of the other benefits of
the v30
is an audiophile grade headphone jack
which muscles asking about pixel users
will be rocking the dongle do you feel
that older USBC 2 3.5 millimeter dongles
from lekha
and Motorola will work who let go whoa I
mean like I can't see how they could I
they should work just as a pass-through
I don't think they will you don't think
they want I don't think they will
because part of the problem is there is
no USB audio SPAC there is no spec on
Android fine just kind of like on an
iPhone I can plug in my focus right
audio interface and the iPhone knows
what to do with it because it's just USB
audio but aren't they just passed
through though like that like the phone
doesn't have to have in their
proprietary really yeah that I didn't
know yeah so if you take an HTC adapter
it's a USB C plug mm-hm and you plug it
into anything else USB nothing happens
the pins are just crazy for that and I
think that's why doing this is what with
me but made for Google so it's like made
for iPhone may for a pad Apple has its
own program where it shares resources
tools whatnot and in return the
manufacturers than the accessory
manufacturers get licensing like there's
been talk that Google they've been
really up in the ante on USB C in their
Android compatibility requirements and
with this they have more leeway they
have more power in order to push that
through now whether or not this will
extend to further Android o Am's or like
there's talk we can discuss that later
point but I think just as a Google for
Google
pitch this should really help us out
here yeah I'm hoping it seems like yeah
I was gonna say do you think Google is
just trying to get ahead of what will
become the standard for such proprietor
for such accessories and you know what's
frustrating is that we didn't need to be
in this place of course not yeah I mean
there's a if we're utilizing a Linux
kernel we should be able to use just a
regular USB audio i/o yeah driver but I
will say that Google has been at the
forefront of making USB see more than
just another way of plugging something
oh that's true and and when it comes to
something like Mass Storage they've been
doing great yeah what I enjoy so and
charging yeah absolutely because the if
you notice the pixel
and the pixel to no talk of quick charge
no talk at all
why because and I'm a huge proponent of
this now how our delivery yeah use power
delivery people because in order to make
us be a charge something fast
yeah I'm Qualcomm has had to do some you
know some experimentation some sleuthing
and that is when you have battery
problems yeah yeah problems and
dangerous meanwhile the USBC standard
itself was made for high currents 27
watts whatever the whatever the case may
be right and the reason why I know about
this is because I have a Nintendo switch
once I learned like what charger what
power bank I needed yeah
whole world opened up I was like power
delivery is awaited yeah no that's like
that's the point when we're talking
about you know the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is a standard yes because
of its life you know the phone Oh Jack
was invented in the early 1900s maybe
the late 1800s USBC has a spec for power
delivery yes that should be a standard
that we can all utilize and every
Android phone this year has had it yes
and so my problem with USB see audio is
let's say Google has the muscle in the
cloud to create they're made by Google
audio licensing platform it's not a
standard yeah and I don't know does that
mean that if I invest in an adapter
that's made by HTC I I will not trust a
cabled audio connector until I can
seamlessly unplug my phone plug it into
my laptop and transfer to that as an
audio source I should be I should be
more I should be angrier about this I
really should be because I was when
Apple did well in the convenience I mean
the argument is a lot of people are
gonna move over to bluetooth I have an
insane collection of bluetooth
headphones I get that saying but there
are still times and I'm so happy you
pulled up the V 30 I had to send my
prototype back so I'm waiting to get my
next oh yeah 30 so that we can actually
finish our V 30 coverage exactly a
production unit should be coming in soon
but when I plug in my super expensive
Senate Sennheiser's that phone properly
drives them to a degree that bests even
and standalone high-quality audio even
these EKGs that I have in my head yeah
right now that came with the essays oh
they're actually Samsung earbuds with
AKG labels on them fair but this is
Samsung Samsung PR rep was very upset oh
really hold them AKG buds okay and so I
have to correct that every single time
so correct this is just a branding
exercise apparently I can let it go I
can let it go so well correctly I am
using the earphones right now that came
with the Samsung Galaxy s8 but they are
driven beautifully by the visa oh yeah
they're so good the amp on it that is
actually really punching what the
drivers in those earbuds so like I was
saying a second ago I I should be
angrier about this especially
considering I was so upset I called it
the audacity of the audacity of Silicon
Valley you just basically say Oh a
century of audio history yeah gone we
don't care about it anymore because
we're courageous yeah exactly only in
San Francisco Bay could anything be
called courageous but anyway so I am
upset about it and you know like I said
just as people have the Apple bias I
apparently have the pixel bias and
that's very yeah and but I I'm going to
go on record right now on this podcast
and say that I am upset about it
even though it wasn't quite as visceral
as it was so because I I totally accept
that at some point the 3.5 millimeter
jack is gonna go away hmm that's not
really I mean because if you if you
check out my pixel reactions video there
ton of comments who a good just get over
it get over it man just the future like
the future can't arrive until something
replaces it yeah and what we have right
now is horrific ly insufficient like to
replace what is an amazing accepted
standard yes for transferring audio that
not that much bigger than a USB see and
still has not been best in equality yes
because anyone who's investing in
building a DAC into a pair of headphones
stops at 24-bit 96k audio which this
phone I mean it's it's overkill yeah but
the V 30 will produce frequencies of
sound that dogs cannot hear it's so far
ahead of the curve and if you and when
you experience it you
cuz like it's easy to say oh I don't
really care about that when you haven't
experienced a total it's really easy
it's really hard to go back when you get
used to what it can do that's why yeah I
cleaned clung I clung to the HTC ten for
as long as I possibly could it was
fantastic yeah so that's also like you
know I've got my v10 and B 20s like in
reserve also cuz like they make
phenomenal portable music players even
though I don't have my sim card in them
so let's say Google and ostensibly Apple
if it came down to it worked with
reputable historical audio companies to
not want to to to make it so that the
USB USBC standard actually has the same
technology in it and it was
cross-platform and it worked I mean
because this is also the ire for iPhone
users is what MacBook has a lightning
port on it for your ear pods
I hate ear pods but if you invested in
this phone part of the benefit with of
that was that you got a pair of earbuds
you could move back and forth and now
that's gone and so for me because at
that point what you bring up there is
exactly what I hoped would happen with
USB C is it shouldn't be up to the phone
manufacturer exactly an HTC are shining
examples of treating audio with the
respect it deserves yes
for how the insane amount of time that
we live in this world with things
covering or plugged into our ears but
you know who would do that even better
is Sennheiser you know who would do that
even better is audio technica sure Sony
yeah those companies should be at the
forefront of this digital interface but
they can't work with a system where
we're gonna pour all of our resources
into building a pair of HD headphones
like you know Sennheiser's we're gonna
give you an HD 600 and it's gonna have a
DAC built into it a Sennheiser or Apogee
DAC yep awesome what phone does it work
with well right now it works with two
phones and then next year it's not going
to work with any and then we're gonna
come out with an HD 650 which will then
be compatible with this phone but then
not Sennheiser's never gonna go for that
yeah Audio Technica is never gonna go
for that a kg might go for that because
they're owned by Samsung now but we
can't get to that point where the true
audiophile
can supply those kinds of solutions
until we have a standard and accepted
compatibility and once we get there I
will be so happy to buy a thousand
dollar pair of sanitizer headphones that
will just work with anything that I plug
them in but for now what they're stuck
with is making bluetooth headphones but
speaking of those headphones do you want
to hit on the pixel buds for a second it
might have been a lot it might have been
a while since I've had a podcast but I
still have my Segway game so so pixel
buds not not as I you know sort of I I
think not as an exciting delivery or
presentation it for Google fans I gettin
some crackling from you Jules sorry you
just have to stand perfectly still don't
move in front of your age too
so so not it is not as exciting I think
for for what they are I mean there are
cables pair of earbuds wireless
Bluetooth earbuds I thought of it truly
again I mean what is exciting though
Google for every announcement that they
had yes they are introducing hardware
but they were making sure that software
and services were front and center for
everything that I've talked about so
assistant is such a huge like it is the
umbrella now yeah and I'm actually okay
with that and exciting there I think for
me especially only having I've been able
to visit China once hearing that there
was gonna be real time for China that
was my first time to transition um but
but hearing and not hearing excitement I
haven't plugged them into my head yet
but seeing that Google working on
real-time language translation through
the pixel buds you know the dream of
every science fiction kid the universal
translator the battle fish you know just
that as a feature seems so simple I'm
mad I didn't like try and patent
something like first but it's about only
Google having the resources to actually
do
or something like that in a hardware
fair but I will say this as exciting as
it sounds it actually is not any
different from opening Translate on your
phone and putting it in between you and
the person so you're completely right
but ok so this is the thing sorry I'm
repeating myself for people who have
listened to this podcast before my big
argument has been for the last two years
we have been rapidly approaching the
post smartphone world we're not there
yet but just like your desktop or your
laptop is a commodity product a lot of
consumers don't get excited about it so
we're in that we're in the post PC era
we're in the smartphone era we're
rapidly approaching the end of the
smartphone era yeah and I think Google
had a lot of points to support that
theory talking about what can we peel
off of the phone in an organic fashion
smartwatches were a terrible step yeah
in that direction but what's a problem
on your phone is this CrackBerry
notification dopamine hit where you have
to pick up your phone
just to see what arrived what's an
organic action for that is looking at a
watch it doesn't really do anything
better than what your phone can do
except it's just in a different place
which in a certain scenario for a
certain person is just a little bit more
organic to reference there and so I'm
walking around Shenzhen I'm screaming at
cab drivers I'm trying to hold a phone
in between us and maybe it's just a
little bit easier in the height of an
emotional moment to go and touch my
earbud and get some kind of translation
happening where it's not obvious that
I'm shoving a phone and I agree with you
there if the phone still didn't have to
be between you and that person because
when you hold the button and you have
somebody talk to you then you can hear
it in your ear but right but the other
way around still requires a loudspeaker
so that the other person can hear what
you want to say so there's still it's
just I think complete isn't complete no
totally I totally agree with that
but to me it's also like it's never
gonna be complete until we take the
steps to actually start getting people
to consider the
of maybe thinking about taking a few
things off of there oh yeah no no and so
I would hope that just like what we saw
Google assistant you were frustrated
like it went to other platforms for me
it's at some point there's gonna be a
Bose headset that comes out I mean
they're already working with
manufacturers to include smarter AI
assistants and stuff in Bose wireless
headphones it's so easy to think the
next step would be another Bose headset
that just has this kind of thing built
into it you know a Sony headset that can
you know use utilize this kind of
service organically and again maybe even
take it offline like you can take
translate offline on your phone this is
like okay so it's it's like years out
but once more of these things start
filtering through we want to talk about
some augmented reality - all of those
things start coming together where the
phone becomes less and less and less
important for every interaction that you
have between individuals sure I agree
with that and I think this is a bit
obtuse with me to say but like they look
maybe like pixel buds - could be truly
Wireless and if you give one to somebody
absolutely yeah well in the second I saw
that I the first thing I thought of was
shehram well not not to share him but
like what is Apple's reply to this gonna
be because they already have a product
that splits yeah you know work with
Jabra you know Jabra has this there I
don't know if it's their parent company
or just a sister company that they're
tied into together but their audio
technology is based on hearing aid
yeah tech that's true so if you had
Wireless Jabra earbuds I mean it's kind
of grows on her a little waxy and sweaty
but in a situation where you really
needed to communicate with someone for
me it was the traumatic cab drive back
to the airport and Shenzhen I could and
go like just listen yeah don't like you
know so what did you think so going away
from the translator stuff what did you
think of the actual hardware so the
thing that bothers me is that there your
pod style so they're not inner aural
yeah thank you
yeah that was the thing that I wasn't a
there's about that when I put them in
and I cranked them up
mm-hmm collide they did some pretty see
the problem isn't the audio quality um
there I mean you'll see I've got a
table full of like bone conduction
earbuds I've got laid off yeah but in
different usage scenarios there are
times I want my ears covered and there
are times I want my ears open okay and
the ear pod style design does neither
horrific ly poorly so when I'm listening
on ear pods or any other thing that
doesn't have a good seal in the ear I
have to turn the volume up higher
because I can still kind of hear the
world around me yeah that's true but not
well enough for situational awareness if
I'm outside so I bone conduction is
terrible quality hmm but man I'm gonna
hear that bus it's about to turn me into
Street pizza if I'm jogging outside yeah
like I am aware loving everything that's
happening around yeah so you you put up
with AM radio quality audio because
you're sound tracking you're not the
this experience for me at that moment is
I'm working out are used to walk the dog
but I need to know every day and it's
not escapism and now I feel
claustrophobic if I'm outside and my
ears are sealed that's true I have a
pair of I have a pair of truly wireless
here but it's in my bag right now and
the seal on those is so good but the
thing is Gary it's a little scary and I
can only have it in on one ear because
I'm worried about not being able to hear
the world or hearing someone talking to
it and even when I leave one in my ear
and it's not playing anything I noticed
that I talk louder look no lower oh that
you go quieter yeah okay I go quieter
because I feel like I can hear myself so
well this is the scene I feel like I'm
talking louder than I need to to you
sitting right in front of me because I
have one year blocked by my monitor yeah
but now that I just said it I'm being a
lot more conscious about maybe I'm
talking a lot should I get closer with
my exact it will do the ASMR version
like this and it's really nice pixel so
you'll hear the bubbles from my from my
soda
I liked the word where the fabric on the
cord is kind of nice kind of an
ingenious as I love that that's a
consistent yes
design accent now for Google and that
little loop at the top so that it can
stay in like I thought that was pretty
ingenious to be honest and yeah there's
something so I hate to use this term but
there's something so googly about them
and I'm okay with that
yeah and I'll tell you what like that
little
that little touch sensitive Ariane them
right here for turning up turning down
the volume for going to the next track
tapping it to get some sort of reaction
from Google assistant yeah I tapped it
just on accident and then it told me
that the time is this it's gonna take
this long ago there it's perfect again
like I want I want Google cards yeah
served up in little snippets of audio
exact that to me makes so much sense I
mana I'm reviewing a very inexpensive
pair of wireless truly wireless earbuds
and they have buttons and it's
uncomfortable to click the because
there's no frame there's no support
there's no cable there's nothing you
push into your ear to click this button
I have the same thing that's that's a
little uncomfortable is a little bit I
don't know that I like that I don't even
then like right now all these
third-party wireless earbuds truly or
not when you press the button like you
press it to activate Google assistant
I'm on the pixel buds you tap it to make
it already have pre-programmed or
smashes so that's what I would really
like and hopefully that API gets opened
up so that maybe the other ways that
I've been using tap it once and it
becomes a thing so what are you paying
for here are you paying for ease of
access to these services we're talking
about 159 bucks this is air pods
territory here before we move on to the
Google home like why are we paying for
you are paying for you are essentially
paying for access at all times
supposedly supposed to Google assistance
and I made this argument with the
squeeze function on the phones it's a
lot like the big speed button where you
can't program it to do anything else
right well what I what the thing is I
want to use yeah so that's a big
difference
yeah so if you have that need when it
comes to these earbuds yes the quality
is actually it's actually above what I
thought they would be considering
they're not IMS right but you know maybe
that I don't know it's almost secondary
to the fact that Google assistant has
become a tool yeah I mean my concern
what I would love to see and I would be
nice to much though I was I will again
any first generation I kind of
have an expectation that it's gonna come
with a premium price tag if only because
Google means to convey that they're not
cheap yeah I mean for all of the people
who are fans of the thousand dollars
that's why were fun to a thousand
dollars yeah for all the people who are
fans of Nexus is consumers were never
going to look at a four or five hundred
dollar phone and think it's just as good
as the iPhones we are having a
completely different conversation in the
market right now with Google services so
I don't think they could have launched
cheaper with the pixel buds and have
people take them serious it's a
mentality I despise but I understand it
and I understand why they're doing it
and it's a in some ways it's a bummer
but it's also mean like if the
consumerism of this doesn't work then we
don't get cool gear and we don't get
competitors that are gonna be able to
undercut Google your and stuff like that
so there's an ecosystem that that does
benefit from it tangentially that's not
a virtually I guess the Russian citation
given yeah but if we don't if we don't
take those steps and we don't get
coolness yeah and it's the same thing
whenever like an essential phone comes
out like I'm very onboard that
experiment even though it's a big risk
to take your daily driver phone with a
company that hasn't proven itself but
where where are we gonna get new stuff
if we're not willing to give these
avenues a chance we'd be stuck in a
mobius strip or or donut maybe
and speaking of donuts I want to get a
bun - I know I'm sorry
yeah death man you were supposed to
bring remember you Yuri totally had that
conversation that never happened friend
so actually I just so google announces
are all these new features coming to
their Google home speaker and in
addition to that they're introducing a
smaller version I again there's there's
gonna be an event I'm gonna try and get
down there in Venice tomorrow what
they're sending us they're set up but
they're setting up a little donut shop
because the new Google home mini is the
size of a dome and so haha I would love
to be there too if I didn't have to go
to
yeah I love that I'm actually writing
[Laughter]
literally before we went live I told him
like hey what are you doing tomorrow do
you want to try and go together and he
was like I've got this wedding wait a
minute what is it for and I said they're
doing the pop-up doughnut shop he
literally starts checking his phone to
see the time of the wedding like there's
any way that he can like just get around
it that's how deep in we are for you
people well I'll tell you this was a
calf icing family and friendships
I actually think well wedding is on the
west side so I might be in the area
anyway you could just might look real
spiffy I'm all for doing some
periscoping with you looking dressed to
the nines let's do that yeah a good
minute would be on the registry you
could put that in yes I love it so what
color did they give you
oh they actually gave us a choice oh so
we got to corals and a gray - great okay
I'm really curious to see what the coral
looks like in real life a little bit
like your hatch Oh seriously that's
perfect okay or two off but it's it's a
little match yeah nice
okay uh two things one I hate it the
reason why example it's not water
resistant the reason why is because I
never expected it to sound good but I
wasn't expecting it to sound that bad oh
I actually think it sounds pretty bad
okay yeah so it's perfect for Google
assistant telling you what you need to
know yeah but don't use it for music do
not use it for music that's kind of a
bummer it is a bar yeah I mean that's
what that's what the max is for they
supposedly say yeah a regular Google
home sounds pretty good the regular
Google home sounds pretty good and
especially what's the UM the new little
urban ears UE boom speaker my wife just
got one from work like they're gonna be
apparently oh I probably shouldn't say
never mind
um sorry it's not it's not anything huge
but she got one she got one from work um
and it's this tiny little you know
nugget of a speaker and it sounds really
good
Oh considering it's a tiny little nugget
okay the speaker so that's what kind of
what I was expecting it gets loud
spoil its you tie into the Google home
ecosystem and I love the idea of like
you know if I ask it to play music and
it can follow me throughout the house I
don't want to have to buy a bunch of
maxes especially because they take up
their big take up space and they expect
you to have left and right that's not a
$800 no no we totally had this EDM
producer he was like I'll jam in on it
okay and I was like speaking of that I'm
not even a huge proponent of EDM but
when I recognize who that was I was like
oh like the whole people goodie
commercial vibe that they had on he's
like yo bro you should totally crank
those tunes yo and you're like okay just
wellhere's you just demonstrate how you
plug them into your turntable I don't
need you to read commentary for me well
here's number two oh I hate it what this
product should have been okay there's a
way of adding google assistant to any
existing audio apparatus you might have
okay there's no audio out jack oh that
sucked so I mean like cuz I think I'm
gonna be getting one for ordering pixel
yeah exactly the first thing I wanted to
do was plug it into my TV sound bar and
that's nice thing you can do as I've
heard I haven't tested this yet but this
is what I've heard is that you can
Bluetooth your Bluetooth speaker ya know
such a bad compromise no that's not a
thing cuz I have a Marshall Stanmore
which I adore ya and I wanted to just
and then all of a sudden I'm are shil
stand more has Google assistant right
why the Frick is that not a thing yeah
I'm so upset about that so once I once I
picked up the one at the demo area and
I've turned it around and I'm like
there's no hole it's just a microUSB
port and I was just like screw you see
you know go home
not even you see ya wall cuz cuz
ubiquity pick what he didn't need that
they need it to be the same as the
original Google home because that was
use people people sent us a number of
tweets about you know the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we've got chamfered edges
do you think headphone manufacturers
should just make the shift to USB see
there's a huge problem of infrastructure
where I've got ox cables phono jacks and
the 3.5 millimeter inputs that still
exists also yes where this entire
ecosystem of products like I should if I
have a phone that can properly deliver a
lineout LGV 30 um I can plug that into
some really nice speakers yep and have
it properly drive that signal for that
audio ecosystem to me I took it for
granted that any google home or any
Bluetooth speaker should have some kind
of connection method yes to another
audio source and that makes me very sad
that Google if you want to make Google
assistant ubiquitous that that $50 mini
all I had to have was a line now that's
all it needs little Alexa has one right
exactly yeah yeah at the echo dock and
while they're playing different games
with the echo connect but it's like
these little tiny things they're hearing
small and smaller and because you
because god forbid that users already
have stuff yeah oh like I did again the
audacity of Silicon Valley well you can
just totally outfit your entire living
room right you'll want to with this G
logo especially for audio yeah this is
why I mean cuz I'm a recording guy I
mean like I have nice mics as props in
in my studio I know for real I I almost
want to buy some it's like a flea market
in a bazaar yeah um but no audio doesn't
change video changes right we get better
processing capabilities we get different
screen panels we get HDR we I mean
there's an excitement to improvements
for for that technology visual yeah but
we figured out audio if you want stereo
2.1 if you want 5.1 7.1 surround sound
the same general mechanics have worked
and I've worked for a really long time
yeah this kind of change upsets
something that isn't broken and it does
it for no great benefit eyes and
determine when we could be plugging into
this the the established systems very
easily very Kimiko phone and arrived
berry pie that's all you need your in
and you have augmented 1970s technology
you know you could go that 60s 50s you
could go that far back if you wanted the
giant mahogany TV stands that had those
fabric covered subs in front of you so
that you could listen to the Jack Benny
show I mean like that could be Google
home right exactly and you know it to
your point we need to have the first
maybe in some cases terrible example of
how to you pick what is all of these
services so maybe there's gonna be a
company out there that makes something
like a Google home micro because okay
there are companies out there making
their own versions of speakers that have
Google home in it I mean Google
assistant in it yeah so maybe we might
have something but that's like a 3.5
millimeter Jack thing that's just this
big mm-hmm and on the other side there's
a USB port to keep it powered but on it
is like an array of microphones and you
plug that into your evening your even
your low Phi system you just plug it
into that or or or or rather I should
say and and we've seen Google flirt with
that you like it was the Nexus Q yeah
spear then where's I have a chromecast
Audio that's dessert
yeah everything we we do need to take a
minute though interrupt this amazing
conversation to thank a sponsor sure if
you'll if you'll pardon me I'm just
going to turn slightly this way away
from but this week the pocket meant
weekly is brought to you by hello fresh
hello fresh is a farm to box and couch
to kitchen meal delivery service which
aims to make cooking more fun so you can
focus on the whole experience not just
the finished plate that you're going to
shoot in Instagram story of each week
hello fresh delivers delicious new
recipes was step by step cooking
instructions broken down into six
easy-to-follow pieces and each meal
design is designed to take around 30
minutes to prepare even for kitchen
novices or for experienced cooks who
might be short on time recipes designed
to make you feel unstoppable in the
kitchen and your taste buds will thank
you it's actually one of the biggest
deals for Marie she is not kitchen savvy
she's not she doesn't enjoy cooking and
when I showed her that each meal was
partitioned it wasn't like other meal
delivery services it's just a big bag of
stuff yeah this one like each meal was
organized and then these cards popped
out and she was in the kitchen like okay
this doesn't suck she actually enjoyed
it it was pretty great hello fresh
sources the freshest ingredients
measured to the exact quantities needed
instead of a big clumsy bag of food all
the ingredients are partitioned out
there so that it really helps streamline
meal prep time less than $10 per serving
you can select between a classic plan
vegetarian options and a family box if
you need to feed more people hello fresh
is constantly experimenting with
different tastes and cuisines this week
on the menu a Carolina barbecue chicken
with mac and cheese thai spiced pork
meatballs and their Hall of Fame adobo
loco steak with crispy potato hash we
have not had lunch yet we're actually
talking about what we're gonna do he's
talking he has a Filipino in front of
them he used the word adobo so funny how
well like Filipino and Hispanic
has-beens play together yeah really good
times you were telling me about a fusion
place after my hellofresh spot we might
have to hellofresh
employees to full-time dietitians to
ensure each meal is nutritionally
balanced now offering light a tunnel
fare and they've just introduced new
breakfast options to get you started
right for the most important meal of the
day delicious ingredients you'll love to
eat simple recipes you'll love to cook
hello fresh has a special offer for Pete
and weekly listeners get $30 off your
first week of deliveries when you use
the promo code pocket now 30 again $30
off your first week sign up at hella
fresh calm hit that promo code pocket
now 30 and we thank hellofresh for
supporting the pocket net weekly and
it's funny because Spanish and toy Gulag
have pretty pretty similar aspects to
them as well but there's the history
behind that is a little bit and I mean
like we're having another conversation
to like because I come from a very
Spanish Hispanic family and then you
also have the shame of like walking
around New Mexico and seeing landmarks
were people have thrown shoes oh yeah
these two doors they're like oh
I am a quarter Native American I should
probably be upset about this - mm-hmm
super racist but you know you get
together and you have lunch afterwards
and then you know that every little
thing society heard is the great
equalizer yeah it is I don't want to get
too into politics but when people
complain about culture appropriation the
thing like I always want to put the road
block on is don't get pissed off about
food yeah especially for for Mexicans
and Hispanics like I want you to eat my
food like you you come and you visit and
I will cook and we will prepare and yeah
this is how I'm going to share an
experience with you like if a bunch of
Gringo's are gonna go do a Taco Tuesday
I'm like yes make the tacos good by the
way a national taco day I know I've been
on a Tuesday it should have been you
should always make it like like the the
first Tuesday of October knightly not
like a specific day yeah yeah that's
like how we use a throat TBT throwback
Tuesday because sometimes you just don't
feel like doing it on Thursday and
you're here I have a picture now that's
it and you can't even you can't make it
like tossed back Tuesday that doesn't
work flashback Friday flashback Friday
works yeah I do want to that act I like
that it's different kinds RW okay yeah
we don't I think we should flip over we
should flip over to definitely flip over
in a flippy computery
oh yes look II kind of way which by the
way it's really like seeing this in the
flesh is always nice I like this yoga
book I'm just mad that they changed like
a parent I can't find how to get back to
split screen view so I'm constantly
toggling back and forth between apps but
it's been a great little tablet what's
not a great little tablet but is aiming
to be a phenomenal laptop replacement I
was wondering if you had any thoughts on
pixel book a premium Chromebook offering
support for Android apps I think that's
kind of a big deal especially is I've
started I've started being able to
achieve um
most main work production on Android
apps so like when I covered the r11 I
didn't want to have to travel with a ton
of like really expensive gear to China
and I was able to cut videos that didn't
seem to distract from our main channel
on what map did you use Howard director
I had overlays I had multiple audio
tracks
I had text tools I had transitions using
what format a video um it perfectly
worked between h.264 and h-e-b see on a
p10 + 1080 4k 4k okay
I would i rescind what I was about to
say because I was about to say that it's
the coolest laptop that I've seen
recently that I'll never use to be fair
I think there is a sentiment for
Chromebook it's the same problem
Microsoft had way back in the day I
would have family member saying like oh
I can't use Windows I had a Dell and it
was terrible and then I went out and got
a Mac and it was amazing and then you'd
say how much was your Mac and they'd say
$3,000 and how much was your Dell 400
you know like there's there's a
disconnect there he's not Windows versus
Mac it's you spent a lot on one and you
spent not a lot on another and
Chromebook has that reputation in there
if you want to spend $200 on an amazing
netbook web browsing experience great
can Google start to change his
perception like Microsoft did when they
introduced the surface mm-hm it wasn't
about here's something super cheap that
runs Windows 8 it's we can make a
premium product - that does things that
competitors can't yeah and that's where
I'm a little concerned I think Google
can make an amazing premium product what
is it doing that competitors can yeah
and there's very little yeah that
provides other than the Android
ecosystem but yeah I mean okay
I remember looking at it I thought it
was beautiful it's a great piece of kit
even that glass panel on the on the lid
you gotta give Google some credit they
try to they tried they're trying to
create a design language exactly they're
trying to be consistent across but yeah
I kept akin to myself I I would love to
take this on a trip
Figg for writing and for some photo
editing yeah but it would not be good
for video I didn't until you tell me
what you just told me well and it's
still it like so I worked in power
director and I got three videos I've put
three videos up on our PocketNow channel
through an app and it's not nearly as
streamlined it's not nearly as efficient
as when you're working in a proper video
editing professional piece of software
but it's doable like it's it's doable in
a way that even on on Apple with iMovie
I can't quite finish off of video I
guess do over a enough for me yeah so
that that's that's the thing is like
this was really the compromise it was
partly the experiment like I wasn't too
concerned if our Oppo our eleven video
was delayed a little bit um but it
wasn't a significant roadblock to
creating what I felt was a high enough
quality on the road okay the media okay
now what I want to work like that here
in the states with access to all of my
gear my amazing laptop which is
downstairs right now I mean like
absolutely not yeah then I'm gonna fire
up Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas and like
really cut the way that I usually cut
but run-and-gun
it made a lot of sense I don't know that
I need to spend a thousand dollars on
that because I'm in between things right
now because I'm actually at this point I
do this maybe like once every year why
I'm like I'm not gonna write everything
in my phone anymore my own skin
yeah and a part of me is thinking like
maybe the pixel book could be for those
times when I know I don't need but then
it's just another thing in my bag yeah
so that's the reason why I'm never like
that's the that's the the plight of
being a creative especially on YouTube
is that we never get to enjoy these
products no we really don't and and and
that bothers me yeah because it's one of
the coolest looking things I've seen in
a while
Oh totally there's literally a button
from Google is literally I press that
thing so many times I just cast so I
mean I was I was looking at that like I
am so programmed by Google's ecosystem
that I would consider that way before I
would ever give Cortana a chance on my
laptop like I don't know what it is
especially because I was such a huge
Windows Phone fan like I want Cortana
and speaking English successful Google
where
the where's the Google assistant app
Yeah right like why don't we why don't
we have that you know just but I put a
little keyboard shortcut and all of a
sudden oh yeah so that would be nice
I love I I love the design of it's the
pixel pen mm-hm
you know I I do think it's a pretty good
implementation I asked him if it would
work across all devices and they said no
they said that it will work as a
digitizer or as a pointing device okay
but the whole like drawing on the
screens I'm thinking it yeah yeah I
thought that it was a pretty good
implementation but again it's just
another periphery that I probably will
not be using yeah so that's my biggest
issue with it I really want to cuz for
me because I know I know I'm not gonna
have the relationship with an individual
product to the way that someone who is
actually spending their hard-earned
money is gonna have a very different
relationship with that product but one
of the things that I think I'm pretty
good at is trying to determine who might
this be for you know like I can look at
a phone like the LGV 30 there's a very
specific mindset that I can say this
phone is gonna kill it for you you're
going to love this phone and then there
are some general consumers right it's
got some fun stuff to offer that you're
probably never gonna use yeah same thing
with the note you know like I can very
quickly determine you're gonna like the
stylus everyone around you is gonna
think that looks silly I had a really
hard time looking at pixel book in the
same way that I looked at what was the
Chromebook pixel yeah back in the day um
I'm stuck I can't quite grasp who would
if I were shopping like family and
friends and there I have like my
Aubrey's a school teacher she loves her
Chromebook she's got a nice oohs no way
no way she'd ever pick up because Google
music so who thinks even not even two
things one of two things number one make
use Chrome OS to target the ThinkPads of
the of the world so that you can provide
the same level of not only productivity
for somebody who's in that corporate
mindset but also the same level of
security
totally which is something Android
already kind of does because it's a very
lockdown system right generally and just
not as high profile for attackers right
now exactly yeah or make a
version of this law laptop that can
dual-boot that's all they need to do and
if they made a version of the pixel book
that had a dedicated video card in it
that I could dual boot Windows to you
know what I think the danger and and why
cuz I I agree with you the reason why I
don't think Google will is if you dual
boot there's the potential that someone
will realize I only work in one
environment and if I work in Microsoft
I don't need Chrome OS I guess that's
true
so what I really thought Google was
gonna do back in the day there was a
there was a beta build of Chrome for
Windows 8 which when you opened it in
the app and you remember when does I had
that stupid split between app style and
traditional desktop yeah
so you open here to the traditional
desktop that was just regular Chrome um
if you check the Developer Preview you
installed this beta and then you I think
you had to toggle a setting when you
open it in the app preview it was Chrome
OS the full experience of Chrome OS and
I thought Google was really gonna work
this is more of like a Trojan horse okay
you're already on Windows 10 gear you
don't even need to reboot you can just
flip this switch and look it's Chrome OS
totally safe totally secure look at
would be amazing to have right now with
Android app support it totally yeah and
so they were working on all these little
core pieces that like you could you
could run I mean again it was more
developer focused but you could run an
Android app in that environment
sometimes most of the time they would
crash because developers weren't really
building the support into them um but
then they just sort of walked away from
all of that I felt like that that would
have been what you're talking about just
the end run yeah yeah utilize all of
Microsoft's stuff yeah virtualized
Chrome OS and yeah you have something
really special because then it works on
literally anything
yeah that's already out in the ecosystem
and so many people are already running
chrome into mash and then if you make it
and then if you make think okay the fact
that google has is so into their own
operating systems at this point is
probably the Achilles heel here because
if they were able to make the pixel book
that has nothing in it and they're all
like oh
take your pick put Windows on there put
Linux on there then I would scoop it up
right away
cuz then I would put Windows on there I
mean granted it needs a dedicate
videocard but now we're playing that
game that I see so many people in the
Commons music I would totally buy that
if it were like a different shape into
different colors it had all of my
favorite samsung apps on there and then
it also like was waterproof instead of
white things like like I said like it's
and it wears the most to apologies if
kit I would love to like I would
actually have pride taking that out of
my bag and a Starbucks yeah to see of
Apple logos man yeah exactly I just I
just cut together a YouTube video that's
what I want out of these but again we're
the people who do creative are always
like not really typecasted we're just
stuck needing to use certain types of
hardware i have an msi who uses em aside
I do know my laptop is a Toshiba and I'm
looking to upgrade oh look hey look I'm
here there's like you almost just ended
the show by closing your yeah you know
my pain like you have to use this
because it gives you everything you need
not the coolest looking thing it's not
even the coolest company really like my
razor but I do wish it were it was silly
as I wish it were the same way but a
little bit bigger so the fans didn't
blast like furnace you know like jet
engines
whenever I render of it because I can't
finish a video at a Starbucks I'm that
jerk who's disrupting everyone in my
immediate vicinity when I try and finish
that off um the other thing that I
wanted to talked about I think the last
major announcement that Google had again
supporting my hypothesis that Google is
looking to encourage people not to use
the phone for everything that they want
Google products and Google services
baked into anything that someone might
use the clips camera okay go pre quality
my stance I wanted I wanted the audible
heavy it's got a really heavy bass to it
but I wanted that audible I'm not wrong
in an era of amazing options from you
know like drone manufacturers GoPros I
mean I've got an amazing Kodak 360
camera Samsung's putting out great
action gear the Onyx is 0 the rx0 is
another phenomenal option and a ton of
support for these things to wear if I
want a gimbal if I want a housing if I
want you know windshield mount like I'm
covered I don't need to reinvent the
wheel here this kind of felt a little
silly it did feel silly it was just it
just okay Google clips again not to get
weird on the podcast but Google
basically made a body cam Michael Fisher
was walking around with one at Aoife and
I don't think I ever saw footage from it
I don't know if only in his review I
mean but I mean like he didn't put
together he reviewed the product I have
to give him some credit to he you know
we're talking about some pretty heavy
stuff and then he was like oh I remember
that dinner there was some heavy
conversation and we were all walking
around cameras and microphones like I
was just totally proprietary please
don't tell you but but I think it's a
pretty awesome idea that is really just
like it's almost as if they had some
hardware lying around and they're like
let's make something and use it as a way
of marketing Google photos that's pretty
much all I I felt like because it's a
quirky to because you can't take the
idiot instead you have these like you
know competition uh-oh its algorithmic
you can sense action going on and we
have 15 frames per second capture for
these like two seconds and fans like and
then there's also yeah copy
computational photography as well and
then you have the Google photos but I
mean to be fair yeah your point about
this being a big ad for Google photos is
correct when you've considered shared
albums and face detection and all that
stuff it's just basically an instant
album and that's also great again
like the Google photos apparatus being
used inside of a cameras like baby
record it's a baby it's a little weird
because my wife and I had a lot of
conversations about like how do we
expose our daughter to the world and
then how do we expose our daughter to
new technology and so you know do you
have do you have that mentality of what
is your what is your stance on privacy
for so I think we're now at she's almost
two and I think eight photos have been
shared publicly of there we go and I
think only five of them have had some of
her face yes this is my favorite photo
of her is my wife and her walking in the
rain oh and it's just you you know it's
from behind yeah you know like that that
to me is all I needed to do to convey a
moment that I felt was appropriate to
share publicly yeah and when she gets a
little bit older and she can start
deciding for herself as we start
introducing concepts like social media
she's working from the same blank slate
that I was when I was a kid you know my
parents would show everyone in our
family photo albums but that's control
stop there yeah yeah it's there wasn't
this public broadcasting of every waking
moment of my life in some of the most
embarrassing times of my development and
I want to give her the ability to make
her own mistakes and not look back at
all the mistakes we made on her behalf
yeah see I would I would be so I would
be I would be more a proponent of the
Google clips if it didn't strike me as
just the the laziest iteration of the
vlogger Instagram generation right
because I mean cutting back to your
point about computational photography
and photo processing and editing now you
don't even need to bother pointing your
camera or pressing the button or doing
anything yeah now and also I know other
products that are perfect for me with
the same philosophy in mind right
there's a camera that I'm waiting to
I'll just name the product that's the
Pogo cam oh yeah yeah I can't wait for
that to come out because it'll be right
here I can take it off if I want to so I
don't look like a tool everywhere with
the camera thank you if you do want to
be a d-bag then you have the front row
oh this podcast is definitely not
sponsored my friend around
I mean he looked like Flavor Flav yeah
well I mean he really he really did use
it I mean like if you catch Michaels
review of that I think he does an
amazing job of examining the product but
also do I see someone like Michael
Fisher ever utilizing that as a product
or service for his own social media his
own life his own broadcasting and like
one of the things like because we have
our own platforms and we can talk to
fairly large audiences is like you know
for when I go when I go personal I go
quiet I mean like if I share something
like there's a there's a photo album of
my daughter that is only accessible to
family and friends through a password
it's cloud but like it's protected and
there are only a lot of Google photos so
actual actually because we because my
wife has to use office for so much it's
one drive okay
yeah I mean it's not anything spooky the
same same concept same idea and I think
if they were on Google Docs we would
have been using Google Drive it's just
we had a ton of storage on onedrive and
why not use it yeah I completely lost
what I was the point I was gonna wrap up
with oh but but for something like
front-row you know like what is it that
we're trying to accomplish with so much
of us already broadcasting so much of
our personal lives where now I need
another product that's gonna do nothing
but create more digital noise for me I
take so many photos in so many videos
that I already have to weed through now
having an automaton do that for me seems
like I'm the baby
exactly you're not gonna get what I want
you're not gonna get what I see
you're not gonna capture what that
moment was really like not in 15 frames
per second two to three second video
clips yeah so what is it that I'm really
trying to accomplish with something like
this that isn't just gonna be more stuff
that I have to throw away later in my
Google Drive bucket my Google Photos
bucket which is already full of useless
photos from all my camera reviews and oh
so many photos of the creepy tunnel
I have so many photos of the creepy
tunnel how porn out please delete the
photos of the creepy to say like after
I'm tampered this photo in three months
just get rid of it
baron you know this landmark you see I
shoot this landmark on a different phone
every single time comes out please just
eliminate don't make me have to go
through but you know that's that's
hopefully coming in a future update yeah
it's a part of its also the fact that in
the act of participating in photography
in the pushing of the shadow and making
sure that you know how it feels when you
hit that button exactly what I was
saying earlier about the fact that we've
we've honed a craft yeah and now no one
needs to hone the craft I mean when
you're hanging your own with other
photons I mean don't you have some
amazing conversations you're like hey
you know I was taking some candidates at
a party you're like oh well don't people
get self-conscious around cameras oh
what I do is this or you can do this or
you can introduce this or you yeah you
can work with people because you're also
crafting a moment as much as you're
capturing it and you learn and you learn
and there's there's this amazing
community of people that you interact
with once you start having those
conversations because it's a technical
art but it's still an art hmm you know
so it doesn't matter like all the specs
and stuff like after a point the tools
don't matter as much as what is it that
I'm trying to accomplish and what is it
that I see and so for the pixel and one
of the reasons why I was very critical
of the pixel
there's no complaints over h-dr
processing yeah that's fine but when you
give me a tool that's so streamlined
that I find the output is unpredictable
and that the only thing I can count on
is the colors what look good then I'm
not really a part of the discussion
anymore you or you've minimized yeah I
point the camera but it's not really
capturing what I wanted to achieve with
that and it's fighting me in some ways
like Sony cameras are the worst at this
where the auto mode Auto the auto modes
are great unless you have
a specific goal in mind for the output
of that photo and then all bets are off
and I remember on the X performance like
I was even even down to focus um ours
had issues where I would tap on the
screen and would be like no no no no you
want to look at this thing over here Oh
God
it would actually pull like the focus
away from what I was trying to capture I
was just wrong all the time and you're a
hundred percent right like thank you for
putting in those words because that
actually kind of that kind of puts a
ribbon on my point it is the hole you're
gonna have two groups of people now
where you have one side that's like oh
yeah I put the light here and I got this
my stylized look and the photos great
and everyone loves it total and then you
have the other person that's like
portrait lighting yeah so there's no
learning there's no like that I have
family members who will not even take
the time to tap the screen to focus on a
subject it's literally just shutter
button that's all they interact with
yeah and their phone cameras and I can't
fault them for that they don't have any
desire to be it's it to be crafting they
don't have any desire to try and capture
something specific but just as much as
the audio industry is being minimalized
minimized rather by USBC we as the
people who are the as the creatives are
being minimized by computational yeah
photography and that's my biggest
problem with it is that people used to
look to us as people who are able to
make great-looking content right and now
when everyone is able to make a
great-looking content or rather not even
that maybe it's not even great-looking
content but it's the kind of content
that the masses are depressed by or
impressed by so that's all they want so
if we were to give somebody a great
black and white portrait photo they
would be like yeah but doesn't look like
what my iPhone did I don't even watch
money anymore I'm like there was
recently a spread
I forget what museum I was in a physical
location just walking through hallway
after hallway of any Leibovitz portrait
work and be like this is something I
can't even I you know I felt like such a
Salieri you know in like I know exactly
what she's doing I know what camera she
used like I understand all of it and yet
I know for a fact I would never have
been able to duplicate yes this type of
work were i given the hardware in the
studio or
the context of what it is that she
captured in that moment and that's a
part of the discussion that now gets
increasingly lost at the consumer space
yeah where for a while it was really
just like you know I have my Canon 7d
under the table right there
um I would show up to parties in like I
would take photos and there's a part of
it where you feel like you're being left
out of moments because you're capturing
the moment but then people would look at
the photos and go oh you have a really
nice camera you know and like I could
give you the camera and you would never
be able to now there's a part of it
where it's like there's an abbreviated
discussion on what their phone could do
yeah and that's now accepted as the
standard for what looks for what looks
good yeah what's accepted and you like
oh that that thought is kind of noisy
and you're it yeah because I caught you
at dinner lit by one candle from a nice
camera and it it's grainy it's low light
yeah yeah but when I take out my iPhone
the flash goes and then does thing and
it looks better like no it doesn't look
better
[Laughter]
yeah thank you you're you're the first
person so like really really capture
this this incredulity that I have I can
never say that word right
well how incredulous I am at this at
this shift that we're having well and it
just it makes certain parts of the
conversation more difficult like the
hate we get from whenever I do a real
camera review and I'm not willing to
just say like oh the DxO score was a
hundred so it's the best and you're like
there is no such thing yeah I want to
tell people like one of the reasons why
I am excited about the pixel to camera
is because I know there are people who
only ever want to hit the shutter button
yeah and this is gonna be great for you
but at the same time don't try and
minimize the work that Leica has done on
huawei's camera AB if I want to be able
to change a shutter speed you know like
they're completely different audience at
the v30
perfect example yeah like the video I
can get out of V 30 will shame most
people on their iPhone or pixels the
pixel video is so great Google could
have Google and a sense
well could have skirted all of this
hatred from people like us yeah if they
did one thing give us a manual mode give
us a plug into your app mm-hmm that I
will manually download myself so it
doesn't clutter up your streamlined
interface on your auto modes but just so
that I have a first-party solution why
the v30 is better than just installing
another app is because it's baked in and
it works with the phone really well and
I have an expectation that it's going to
deliver where a lot of these manual ABS
can sometimes have compatibility issues
yes it just what is there okay we've
definitely gone on a few different
tangents here is there is that a bad
sign that Jules has disappeared no
actually the reason and thank you for
for pointing that out Josh if you've
been watching the live broadcast of the
show you'll notice that Jules has
disappeared and that we now are looking
at a pocket now logo yes one of the
things that um was also sort of
newsworthy in a really interesting way
was a very intricate hoax prior to the
pixel launch I'm sure you guys saw some
headlines on a the ultra pixel and Jules
actually had an opportunity to speak
with a ricardo Kambo would you great on
you by the way yeah I mean he and he
took the time to reach out this was a
pre-recorded segment so we're going to
shift over to that so you guys can take
a listen to that and we'll come we'll
see you on the other side but
unfortunately because of the setup Jules
can't exist and play audio at the same
time so he's going to cease to exist and
you're gonna hear this pipe in there is
no Jules for the next was eight minutes
it's about six six to eight minutes and
I are you good I'm good okay so then
we're gonna we're gonna shift over to
that I'm gonna take a listen then we'll
wrap this whole pop up you up all right
I'm gonna get straight
to this yesterday night I received a bit
of an oddity email from an anonymous
source he claims to have seen Google's
upcoming smarter feature of Android this
guy youtuber mr. who's the boss got a
hold of these images from an internal
show-and-tell at Google that's showing
that the devices that we've seen weak
you're not real but apparently there is
another Google pixel that someone
appears to have crap shot from like
underneath the desk or something and it
on this computer there are slides
showing the upcoming quote-unquote ultra
pixel ultra pixel ultra pixel ultra
pixel I have to tell you this I did I
did
it's testing this strategy and one is
the name because it wasn't it should be
ultra pixel shouldn't be just wanna it
just had to be a big solution because
and we have chrome and Chrome ultra okay
chromecast chromecast and chromecast so
that's all I said okay let's do a big
peak shall be sued then when I was
typing
super hurry and I didn't turn out to be
what a pizza when I was super young I
just started to feature to draw we are
you know guys with superpowers that kind
of stuff
vehicles and enemy on something more
realistic more you know more Maria it
were phones
I think the first it starts everything
was there I don't know if you remember
the Sony Ericsson K cell MTV was the
first
cyber-shot the care of material the
surface is where something else so from
there I started oh wow say okay I'm
super tired of University because
they're like they're not teaching me the
right stuff I want to walk I feel like I
can do something right now for companies
so I left University and I tried to send
you know portfolios and the resume a to
the companies and Sony was my favorite
so he was on the top of the mountain so
yeah so I did this strategy when I heard
the first rumor about the ps4 Am I
I decided to start this thing then I
just put it out close to gia e3 are
these pictures even legit Lauren what do
you think I think they are first of all
as we previously mentioned the design of
the system it looks like a ps4 it looks
like the same design hauswirth on the
system that's notable because a lot of
the times when we see mock-ups are fakes
they don't even bother making it look
stylistically similar the other products
in the same line that's true this does
look like it might have been developed
by Sony it's got the same work it's got
the same ideas it looks like it came
from the same people this all this was
just into a goal that you wanted Sony to
hire you this message that said higher V
hidden across all the pictures did you
talk with Sony after that actually I
don't even know if they saw it some some
people asked me why did you didn't you
do like concept I think this strategy
like putting fake legs let's let's say
show you more then I say I'm a concept
to show you a strategy show your
creativity show you vision show you many
things take care of details and this is
even more powerful than a concept
because to find a job in Apple Google
whatever and that kind of companies
because of my goal is to find a job in
America yes yes difficult because they
complete those are a lot and mostly I
don't have a visa because for us for
frame there is even more difficult it's
almost impossible so I had to find a way
to I can do it yeah powerful try
powerful way to together function glance
we can easily see the latest updates on
your day we're starting with calendar
events today with traffic flight status
and more coming soon in this case I can
see that I've got a mysterious meeting
coming up not sure what that's about
pixel ultra meeting in four minutes we
place the goal quick search I was
shocked man completely shocked I was I
was shaking I was that I knew that was
my real body there not as much I mean I
didn't explain me they saw it ok being
at any public I mean that even with bad
publicity someone will still reach out
to you and offer you job like that I
think so yeah I think so yeah because
they're still very nice in my opinion
right I don't know about the companies
good background on the only strategy of
good skills I think I think everyone

the concept so I think you can you can
split the thing and understand that

insight on something that again it was
