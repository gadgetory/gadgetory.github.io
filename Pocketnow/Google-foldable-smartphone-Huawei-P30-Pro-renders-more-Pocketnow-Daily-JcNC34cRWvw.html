is also working on their own foldable
smartphone more renders of the huawei
p30 pro have emerged and we are
basically ready for Paris at this point
and the Google pixel 3a XL was just
spotted in Android Cuse code and well
that's gonna be the budget phone I'm
Jaime Rivera and this is the face of
somebody that had to pre-record because
I'm flying to San Diego right now this
is probably out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for a smartphone that's a good
gaming phone and gets a lot of things
right really the razor phone too is
currently for five hundred bucks that's
actually a really good discount
considering how powerful this phone is
surely it's not the perfect device but
again 500 bucks man you can learn more
in the description now let's talk about
Samsung and the company's future roadmap
when it comes to display technology and
what they're working on as the company's
VP of R&amp;amp;D pretty much just spilled the
beans that the company is working hard
on getting cameras under the displays
and pretty much every other sensor under
the display in a way that will not
affect the user and apparently according
to him they're very advanced in this
project the only problem is uh we
probably won't be able to see this until
the next two years but still it's good
to see where we're going here and
speaking of feature developments
xda-developers pretty much was able to
pull enough source code from android cue
to let us know that we are getting the
light pixels but apparently they're not
gonna be called lights they're gonna be
called the pixel 3a XL and whoever that
gives us a good idea of what this could
mean let us do with the comments I have
no idea
3x3 axl and 3a what exactly would that
stand for
we'll see and speaking of bleak so let's
start about the Huawei P 30 P 30 Pro I
mean we've been covering absolutely
every single leak we're very close to
the event in Paris we're gonna be
covering it there I can't wait to get
there and tell you more about it but if
you want to see what the phone looks
like I mean we've been covering leaks
but these leaks weren't official
according to sources
now it seems that somebody's got
official renders already and pretty much
everything that we've seen is confirmed
I like the way the phone looks but I
would love to know what you think about
it in the comments
and finally the hottest nurse said I
have to do with Google and the fact that
they're also working on foldable
products we've got some patent
information showing that they're working
on two different folding products one
which would pretty much be a clamshell
like a moto razor rumors that we've been
talking about which is fine but the
second one is the most interesting one
where you could pretty much fold this
thing into like a Z like you can fold it
in two different ways
I'm not exactly sure what kind of a user
scenario that has but if this follows on
the teaser from Xiaomi over a product
that folds two ways it could probably
make sense let us know in the comments
down below I mean what do you think do
you think that this is a good idea for
Google to get into this one and two what
do you think the purpose would be of
that device that folds in two different
ways cuz I still and trying to scratch
my head trying to figure it out but
leave us a comment down below we looked
in on your opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
our parking our common scrub - both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one and follow me
on twitter hi managers quarter get on
instagram at hey Matt we gotta please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hey medically the
things are much for watching we'll see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
