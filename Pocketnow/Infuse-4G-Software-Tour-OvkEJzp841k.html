calm we're going to take a look at the
software on the infuse 4g by samson
let's check it out first off here we are
at the lock screen and see it says phone
locked but this is a little different
from a previous galaxy s 4g version
where we said swipe screen to unlock so
we no longer have any q as to how you're
supposed to unlock this you just have to
you know play with it and then see that
you can do it like this but this is a
little bit different than this one the
galaxy s 4g you had to go all the way
all the way across before it unlocked
where's this one you'll really only have
to do like about three-quarters of the
way so there's that now here's our
default home screen you got seven home
screens here and we can of course do
this to see them all and you can move
them around same as usual but this is a
new thing when you get to a blank one it
says press and hold this page to add
content so that's a really nice way for
new users to figure out that they can
add widgets to this page now by pressing
and holding so there's all your choices
widgets blah blah blah now this is a
slightly newer version of Samsung's
TouchWiz on android 2.2 slightly newer
than this recent galaxy s 4g but not as
new as the galaxy s2 so i'll show you
some other things that are a little bit
new let's go back here we got the same
little buttons up there they look a
little bit different
so little new look and the older version
of TouchWiz we had kind of goofy looking
tabs up here rounded blue they changed a
bit over here in the newer version so
they're more square and less goofy
looking you'll see that in most of the
other programs like as well as email so
there's no more tabs up there so here
you can see the old TouchWiz have these
weird tabs for the different folders or
is up here we have just the little
pop-up menu so this is much nicer here
now by default the application tray is
all sorted alphabetically so you can see
those are the programs and they scroll
horizontally you can tap the little
circles to go to a different page real
quick but if we do the menu button
there's a view type so that's your only
option there but if we do that then we
can choose a customizable grid that
doesn't change anything but it's what
there's another menu item now edit now
they have a little corner here and I can
tap and hold and rearrange you can also
tap and hold down here on these little
bottom tray icons and move those around
so that's cool next up I want to get
into what is included on the infuse 4g
for bundled applications so here's our
application tray and we see all share
for DLNA compatible stuff you know
streaming we have Angry Birds included
this is a special version of angry birds
that has more golden eggs and whatnot
and it comes free this full version no
ads so that's pretty cool inclusion
we also have your normal ATT stuff code
scanner ett family map I've got ATT
navigator of course and we can find
things nearby this comes with a trial
version but after that you have to pay
ten dollars per month extra next up you
got your regular calculator calendar
stuff camera contact level does come
with Facebook included so you can update
that to newer version you got the
gallery we got gmail included I also
have live TV from 18th this is u verse
it's really mobitv but just kind of
rebranded for 18 d so we can stream
movies well not just movies TV shows all
sorts of channels down here let's try
this
I believe this also comes with a trial
that's pretty cool we can swipe through
here see different shows and channels
pretty much the same as t mobile's t
mobile TV which is also based on mobitv
pretty nice and we also have of course
the usual Android stuff this is the
media hub from Samsung you've seen this
before we get movies that we can buy or
rent it's got a load and you can get the
prices there you need to set up an
account for this course without the
music player is kind of nice let's check
it out
a little better looking than some of the
other Android music players and it does
screen rotation
and you have your controllers in the
notifications tray pretty good there you
got mine 18t using weather places talk
of course there's quick office for
opening office documents there it is in
landscape the basic
and there's your video player voice
recorder voice search youtube as yellow
pages that's a handy app to have that
comes with the device let's check out
the video player here it comes with a
lot of these trailers let's check this
one out that pretty good video quality
there see how quickly it seeks to New
poignant camera very smooth video
playback it looks great on the sport
half inch screen wise one thing that's
annoying as the back button doesn't work
when you're watching a video you have to
push back and then you have to press
this button in order to actually go back
so that's kind of annoying and we also
have a task manager so this will show
you how much memory each of these apps
are taking up they've launched recently
and has it been closed by itself by
Android you also have packages so that's
something that I installed we can see
the RAM that's how much memory you have
and how much is being used there's a
storage data comes on the device by
default now one more thing that's
interesting is what apps are missing
we've got a front-facing camera but I
didn't see anything to use video chat
and there isn't anything included no it
over here we get quick kick sorry for a
video chat calling but there's nothing
nothing to use video chat here you just
have to go to the market and install
your favorite one
probably want to look at the wallpapers
and we don't have anything special
included here there's only six live
wallpapers let's look at the beach
nothing really new or fantastic as for
widgets nothing terribly terribly
special here either got the program
monitor so that goes straight to the
task manager that's pretty good to have
it will turn red if you're really using
a lot and I have like the battery
warning there so that's good for people
who don't know how to close applications
it's not there by default so you're
you're you'll have to download enough to
figure out what that widget does and add
it and wait that's it for the infuse 4g
from samson on 18t hope you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up you did that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
