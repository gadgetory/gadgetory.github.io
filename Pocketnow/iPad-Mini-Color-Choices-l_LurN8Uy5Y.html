pocket now calm the problem with apples
was popular products is that they're
only available in black or white the
iPhone 5 the iPad Mini and the iPad are
only available in those two colors but
what if you want a red iPad Mini or a
blue iPhone 5 or just some color that's
different than all of the other iPhones
out there the other iPads out there well
you have options I just got my iPad Mini
back from the folks at an O style that
have done an anodization process to my
iPad Mini to make it bronze which will
be awesome cuz bronze is a really cool
color they also offer a wide variety of
colors and we're going to talk about
that in a second but let's unbox the
iPad Mini I haven't seen it yet so I'm
really curious to see what they did with
it let's check it out so the way that
this works is that you send your iPad or
your iPhone to a no-style it'll take
them about a week or two to get it done
then they'll send it back overnight to
you so I've just got mine back after
about two weeks and Adam style likes to
remind people that it's not a painting
process
it's an anodized ation process and I
don't really know the technicalities of
it but it involves positive and negative
charging of ions or something and the
way paint sticks to metal the point is
that anodization is a lot more durable
than just painting so they didn't get
some krylon from the Home Depot and and
spray spray your device they actually
did something a lot more advanced than
that so I've got the black iPad Mini
here and I went with the copper color
because I thought it would be a nice
contrast to the black so they don't do
anything to the front it's just the
metal part so let's dig this out and see
oh yeah that is sweet well look at that
really nice nice uniformity of the of
the anodization process here it looks
really nice it feels smooth it feels
truly like a stock product as if Apple
made this on their own and yeah check
this out the beveled edge is still in
place now with a beautiful bronze color
this color reminds me of kind of some of
the the BMW's that have that
around leather interior same color here
so if you had one of those cars this
will match it but now my iPad Mini looks
different than yours which is really why
you would do this in the first place
really nice when you're using it from
the front you can't really tell except
along that edge you just see a slight
little border of course if you go with
some more of their brighter colors
you'll be able to see it even more
around the edge they can do blue and
green and pink and red and yellow and
gold and copper I mean they have so many
colors it's kind of crazy and again this
is the bronze color now the downside to
doing this is that one at Voyager
warranty and two it's expensive and you
probably guessed that by now this is a
hand done process it takes a long time
they make sure that it looks perfect
before they send it back to you to get
it done all your iPad Mini is 299 bucks
so you're nearly doubling the price of
your iPad Mini the iPhone 5 process a
little less expensive at 249 bucks and
those prices include shipping back to
you so again that's expensive but it is
a really premium service here from the
guys at Nano style if you want to check
out their gallery and see how other
colors look check out a nose style comm
and put a link in the description
that's ano st yl e super quote now I've
got a bronze iPad Mini if you liked this
