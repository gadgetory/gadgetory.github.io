just emerged and it looks a lot hotter
than expected the Google pixel for Excel
was just spotted in the wild for the
first time and that camera is really
something else
and it's primed a so we do have a couple
of deals you should definitely consider
I'm Jaime Rivera and who'd have thought
I mean who would have cared about a
Monday but it's prank day so there's a
lot to cover this is parking out daily
the official dish today begin with deals
we've been covering deals from Amazon
and like forever think about it is it's
interesting how the company has created
hype over their prime date there are a
ton of deals these are the three that we
think you should consider first up we've
got 2018 I've had pros where you could
score up to $250 off both the 11 inch
and the 12 point 9 inch model depending
on the configuration you get next we've
kind of moved to Google with the pixel 3
now available for $250 off at pretty
much rather than $39 shipped and then
the 3 Excel is also discounted to 639 in
various colors now if you want the pixel
3a Excel Amazon is giving you a free
$100 gift card as well finally Amazon is
also discounting the whole unlock Alex
yes 10 line up to $200 off across the
board however you can get up to $300 off
in some devices like the case of Lee on
an 29 gigabyte Samsung Galaxy S 10 which
usually goes for $900 is now available
for $5.99 so again this is just
scratching the surface we've got a
couple more days for prime days so stay
tuned for more now let's move the
spotlight over to an interesting
surprise as a quark I've just announced
that Snapdragon 855 plus the last time
that we had a mid-year update to its
processor was for the 820 and the 821
and if you remember the device that they
beat with the 821 was the Google pixel
so yeah we've got a couple of changes
starting with the fact that this chip is
designed to raise the bar for gamers by
increasing the CPU clock speed to 2.9
gigahertz and the GPU performance now
also gets a 16% boost and a I and XR
which is what they call VR and a ton of
things in
one and also elevating the 5g experience
which they claim is what OMS are looking
for now we can't expect the 855 plus to
power the flagships of the second half
of 2019 so I guess we already know what
phones are bringing it because yes the
other interesting teaser that we just
got from a soos is the new ROG phone 2
or ROG 2 or whatever they're gonna call
this film though think about it is I
mean could this be one of the devices
that's coming with the 855 plus the last
one had the 845 but that phone they beat
a ton of things like the first 90 Hertz
display when it came to Oh LEDs now we
are hearing in a hundred and twenty
Hertz display and we're not exactly sure
if we're getting an ola that's gonna do
that but well we've got people
speculating if this is going to be an
IPS LCD that is capable or what the
thing about it is we also here in
addition six acres of RAM obviously this
is going to be the gaming phone for a su
so we'll keep you posted on that
and of course it is testing time for
devices like the Google pixel 4 and for
those of you wondering exactly how that
phone looks I mean we've covered so many
leaked renders but it's starting to pop
up in the wild as people are testing it
and my god so right now it appears in
cases and usually this is the way phones
get tested but I hope that this phone
looks better than in those leaks because
it does not look like a pretty phone
obviously we see the square design at
the camera hump pretty much everything
the Google teased on their own and I
don't know man is it just me or do I
find the design of the pixel forgettable
I hope that it's not the case we would
love to know what you think in the
comments and how about if we move the
spotlight over to Huawei and bear with
me here we've got two separate news that
we're gonna cover and actually the
question of the day is going to be
focused on these two starting with Hong
mango s I mean it's really interesting
to hear a company executive
come on record and claim that pong mang
is actually not an alternative to
Android or at least we assume that this
is not the way it was intended according
to his statement
it seems that hongmen was decide to
designed to reduce latency between IOT
devices and that's really what it was
for was never intended to be an Android
alternative so this is rather weird as
we've
even got the CEO on record stating that
this is their alternative to Android and
now we've got executives that are
claiming the other so it's confusing
everything around we'll keep you posted
as more news emerge for Huawei and as
for the second topic the hottest dish
that I have to do with the huawei mate
30 Pro obviously if hong mang is not
intended to be the final operating
system this means that the company's
sticking to Android which means we do
care about the main 30 Pro and we've
been covering the devices back and how
it's going to look but we hadn't seen
the front now I've got two leaked images
and I'm actually gonna assume that this
actually comes from Huawei as well I
actually see the mafic X Pro at the
bottom so it could just be some
executive leaking the information but we
see the front and we've got the sexy
curves from the p30 Pro but we see a
huge notch at the top so we're assuming
that the facial-recognition a technology
that we saw with the made xx pros coming
here it looks really nice I mean we see
all the curse from the inside we see
very insignificant bezels so let us know
in the comments down below
obviously one what do you think about
what we just covered about Hong mang is
it's confusing to you or not because it
is for me and second I mean let's assume
that the you know thing is going to end
up being that we're gonna get a make 30
Pro with Android are you interested
or are you worried that you would invest
so much money on it made 30 Pro and you
don't know what the features going to be
because in my case I think that by the
time that made 30 Pro launches things
are going to be solved I guess I believe
I don't know we'll see leave us a
comment down below we look I know what
you think Renne again if you want to get
