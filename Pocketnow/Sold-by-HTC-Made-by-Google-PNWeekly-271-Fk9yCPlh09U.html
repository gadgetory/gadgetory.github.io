joins a show this week to help us unpack
the Google and HTC partnership
announcement we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 2 7 1 of the pocket
noun weekly recorded September 21st at
noon pacific time this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets and make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables
I'm Quan Carlos back now senior editor
pocket male comm joined as always by
plucky podcast producer mr. Jules Wong
how's it going out there on the East
Coast buddy boy you've been mentioning
November for the past couple of weeks
well it's a good thing you got that name
someone had said something because it
was like someone on the show not like a
comment all guys yeah we'll both
apologize me for being wrong and you for
not telling me what's wrong of course
joining us live via hangouts
it's la-based Agrotech reviewer mr. TK
Bay welcome to the show my good friend
thank you thank you very much and very
happy to be back on the show misty guys
you guys have having too much fun
without me man got to be back that's
true we needed you to come back and help
reduce the amount of fun that we pleased
I'm gonna try not to choke i'm still
working off that stupid cough i'm still
from pre Aoife that that congestion that
I've been fighting is still going I also
want you you know talk about how much I
love this polar seltzer over here also
social medias we got good discussion
going on and on on today's topics so why
don't you head on over to Twitter as we
are alive and do that hashtag P and
weekly and just ask a few questions well
we are able to answer them live and if
you can't make it if you aren't
listening to this
they're the post then you can just head
on over to your email client and type in
podcast at pocketnow.com along with your
questions and thoughts and whatever you
might have flotsam jetsam and all that
hashtag pee and weekly podcast at
pocketnow.com many ways to connect we're
really good with the flotsam in the
jetsam if you haven't noticed both
literally and figuratively as I am about
to clear my throat
once again I'm so so glad that we
actually have a bye week on having a
sponsor this podcasting for audio strong
stood well I want to kick right off I
want to jump right in this is the
biggest news story of the week the the
teases have been coming like crazy a
number of rumors speculation about the
status of HTC one of our favorite but
beleaguered brands and news finally
dropped that HTC is partnering with
Google we're not looking at an outright
acquisition the details of the plan 1.1
billion dollars about half about half of
HTC smartphone talent is just going to
live over at Google now and this is also
going to be a non-exclusive partnership
for all of HTC's patent IP and licensing
deals so you can still partner with
other manufacturers Google can still
work with other manufacturers but Google
has got a pretty good stake in HTC's
talent and IP @ek I just wanted to jump
in immediately just your your first
reactions when you heard this news like
I we were all really confident this was
going to be an outright acquisition but
HTC is a brand lives on to fight another
day they're flush with an extra billion
in cash how did you feel what was your
reaction when the news actually finally
delivered last night I it was a little
bit of a mix back for me but that the
general feeling it overall was I think
this is a natural transition I think
they've been working with
for a long time and we as a consumer or
even reviewer we've seen how HCC's brand
been doing and the way they've been
performing for the last few years with
you know since tea I mean even the
ambien at the m10 last year they've they
progressed as far as been making better
hardware but they're having a hard time
getting people to identify them and but
their biggest performer has been the
pixel from last year the pixel XL I
still use it and you know as we know
rumored to be the next manufacturer for
the next one down the road I think it
was a natural you know think of it flaky
they've been playing with each other for
a while it's finally you know official
now they're dating well I mean they're I
always want to say they're engaged
you know it's like they've been a bit
more official you're right they did
present the ring that one billion dollar
ring 1.1 billion dollar 1.1 billion
carats no that's not that's not right no
they they made a big they made a big
spectacle in their press release out of
talking about their continued
partnership I you know this is a
relationship that has been delivering
products since the original t-mobile
what was it the the g1 it was the first
one with the query sliding keyboard
everybody was on board it was an amazing
device yeah I remember I had that with
the first Nexus device and then
obviously I think most recently people
are pointing to the pixel as HTC's
engineering talent digging into the to
the details of this I have to say I was
a little concerned when we finally got
the numbers on how many people were
actually going to be making this
transition there's a workforce of what
roughly 4,000 engineers and and half of
them half of this team is just going to
live over at Google now what do you
think I mean cuz obviously I think this
is a boon for Google I don't think any
part of this deal looks bad from
Google's perspective no I'm but what do
you think this means for the next
generation of HTC products like they're
losing that team that also would have
been communicating about what Google was
doing with the pixel I think you lose
some insight there don't you they're
losing a big part of their the group
well so the team that I've put together
the pixel XL
and if you've used a pixel Excel you'll
notice some a lot of resemblance to some
other devices that they released during
the same year so we can definitely see
that the core people that are making
this high-end level of hardware is
leaving
so it's a very concerning position for
HCC's mobile division in as you know we
got a look at them in different
divisions they're different parts of
this company
HTC as a whole is not just one company
that produces you know mobile devices or
you know and if you still have the HTC
vive section that still has to thrive
and move forward so it's concerning to
the from that aspect how are they going
to be able to basically now make it
stand in the US market even in Europe
outside of the mid Rangers which is what
they've been running off for a while
like the desire line which devices all
the other ones that people may not be
well aware of but you know the U 11
those are flagship devices but HTC makes
a lot of other you know MIDI Rangers
that may end up being their bread and
butter for for some time especially
since they're losing the those key
people that are pitching all those
high-end devices they don't like the
pixel XL and we'll see how the new
version of the hardware comes out of how
it handles comparing at the last year
everybody's excited about that but it is
concerning that HTC may be where the
mobile division may be on a maybe they
need to you know invent something new
maybe they need to try to really think
outside of the box now and try to get
back that confidence in the US so I mean
you were very diplomatic in in how you
were putting that and in obviously yeah
I don't mind engaging in a little a
little tiny bit of wild speculation um
we do know that there that there are
plans for obviously a next year of
devices and anything that HTC is talking
about today we know that they probably
have a pipeline you know two to three
years worth of course of hardware that's
sort of being planned for the next
generations of HTC products so on pocket
now we did post a story talking about
the ocean master the ocean like the
ocean harmony but outside of what they
might be able to do over the next year
after I had a little time to kind of sit
and chew through all of the information
that Google and HTC delivered in their
press releases this to me really started
to feel like like this could be a good
long acquisition move yeah yeah
eventually HTC is carved up into like
you were saying the various divisions
that make other products you know
entry-level and mid-range ER phones
flash' premium devices and then vive is
another part of their hardware strategy
as well but it's a completely different
operating you know a team that's
developing for that and so I kind of
feel like if HTC and Google had just
pulled the trigger
day one HTC is gone these letters don't
exist anymore
we're scrambling to try and find a home
for the vy for a buyout deal for the
Vives technology and next year it's all
gonna be the pixel I think there would
have been a lot of negative sentiment or
a lot of negative reaction to that deal
but you start over with the flagship
tier of engineers and developers you
move them over to Google you sort out
who might be redundant
what divisions might not necessarily be
needed anymore you keep a couple
thousand people back at HTC just to see
will they rise to the occasion without
their premium flagship counterparts
maybe the company struggles to execute
at the high end after about three years
and then you can kind of just fold that
over while you've got plenty of time to
figure out what you want to do with the
vibe and how that's gonna exist on its
own and that to me kind of felt like
like at first the my reactions were
overwhelmingly positive I love that HTC
sticking around this is a company that I
have I have a very long relationship
with and I want to see them more
competitive in the market they've got a
billion dollars in cash they can
definitely do something with that but
the more I started to think about it the
more I felt like this this feels like a
lobster pot move to get people slowly
acclimated to this change without
rocking the boat and without Google
taking on too much baggage
they don't acquire any debt they don't
have to instantly layoff a thousand
people if they're redundant they've got
a lot of time to kind of sort these
things out as the next two generations
of phone are are produced well and they
also keep in mind this isn't Google's
first attempt to working with an OEM so
they've learned the LAT from Motorola
/ you know where do you know the
Motorola is now and I I for one was sad
when they let Motorola go and I really
thought it was a as if it was a very
good thing for the product for the brand
but I think what they've learned from
that is keep it under you know Google's
name brand a pixel device no longer
calling it an HTC and you know letting
HTC still function at this this and this
point in time makes it easier to yeah
like you said accept it down the road if
suddenly this entire team you know
becomes they're all Google's staff at
some point and HTC is like look we're
just focusing on other devices or you
know low range mid-range devices for you
know other companies or other channels
to be able to you know brand and get
those out there it's something that we
have to wait and see honestly at this
point I think it's exciting because if
anything it's gonna they're gonna
definitely get their stocks should
reflect the game they just got you know
a bump a lot of years I have to be
excited yeah so financially I think it's
a win-win the reality is they've been
working together for such a long time
that it's a natural progression
I'm just hoping at the end of the day
that we don't get into that where Google
controls both sides of the hardware and
the software where we don't get that
much innovation on the hardware the
reason why the H the pixel XL was so
great last year is because HTC developed
the hardware and put it put that sensor
in there and set up everything in Google
built on that Google then control
everything into that that sensor was
there and other devices during that year
so you got it you have to have some you
know you have to have a talent that
comes in a little bit from the outside
bringing fresh ideas so we'll have to
see next year's lineup you're right it's
a little early to see where we are now
you know III I mostly sorry I had three
different sentences that I tried to get
out all at the same time that happens to
me a lot these days um no I agree with
you that we don't want Google to start
feeling too stagnant but I think this is
also one of those things that Google is
addressing in a way where they've had
something of a branding problem where if
you taught if you say Android most
people are gonna think galaxy and that's
not really Android it's this Android you
know under the skin yeah yeah exactly
says your
version of Android and so you you have
more opportunities to kind of peel
consumers away from Google services and
have them using Samsung services right
so one thing I do want to circle back to
is for all of the concerns that we've
had people that have been shooting as
comments and people that have been
joining this conversation it really this
really does to me seem like if
eventually there is more of an
acquisition you know we're of HTC folds
that they're going about this in
completely the anti motorola way you
know that that whatever whatever
mistakes were made almost beat for be
this is the opposite way of how they
handhold
Motorola is exactly exactly they didn't
take on the whole company they didn't
decide to say hello everything comes in
they're keeping it very strategic as you
said they can still work with other
companies HTC is not tied to Google but
I think it's it's a win-win I think
Google's definitely making the right
move the smart move this year and I
think as a consumer we we only have to
basically get the best hardware and
hopefully we'll be really pleased with
the you know the hardware coming up in a
couple of weeks I'm looking forward to
it I mean I I know I'll be super sad if
it's totally true I I think it's very
likely to be true at this point
especially if HTC's division has been
more of a guiding force on the hardware
that we'll be losing that headphone jack
but otherwise it looks like yeah a
pretty sweet device yes 2017 it'll be
basically the last year we see headphone
jacks sad I bet they're there they're
probably gonna be some holdovers in 2018
I'm willing to bet that the first phone
Huawei releases in 2018 will still have
a headphone jack and maybe even Samsung
and then by the end of 2018 the
beginning of 2019 they'll all just be
gone and we'll all be sad and everyone
will grumble about it and complain but
no one will really do anything to buy
phones that still have headphone jacks
there well yeah no it's it's it's a sad
truth i I see them disappear you're not
a daily basis but we'll have to species
it truly is it's sad but you do get it
on let's say no date right now it's
refreshing they'd see that you know you
get a high-end device note capabilities
all those you know all those things they
get and you still get the we got
waterproofing with the three and half
million we have the headphone jack and
the s-pen you can take that thing and go
in the water I went with my kid a couple
weeks ago just to play in the pool I was
using the s-pen underwater that's
amazing
there's space for all of this we got a
stop I think there's a video I don't
know if you've ever seen this there's a
guy that installed a headphone jack we
didn't iPhone said like apparently
everything's still there is that Apple
really saved any space no no I when I
saw that I was like oh my god why this
does not have more views and people need
to know so yeah the need for it I think
it's truly driven by Apple I think at
this point in just more they think we
don't need it and they're trying to sell
us dongles yes I think I think that's
actually kind of one of the most
important aspects of of the mobile
technology market is looking at can you
also convince the consumer that they
need to value add-on accessory purchase
you know you know when you buy the phone
it's not just enough to buy the phone
can you also get that consumer to leave
with a case it used to be can you leave
with a case and a memory card and a
screen protector and now it's also a
nice pair of headphones but not just a
nice pair of headphones but a pair of
bluetooth headphones because those are
more expensive and those also come with
value add-ons like maybe you need an
additional cable or a charger or
something like that and so I think it's
pretty clear why this has been such a
because you know it's not necessarily
about improving the consumer experience
the the v-series of LG phones pretty
much wrecks that hypothesis it's more
you you get to create behavior that uh
that benefits the bottom line when
you're going in to buy that phone it's
well so the the last thing I want to
touch on that headphone and it's really
the missing part I haven't seen really
even manufacturers pick up on it
it's decent headphones that are USB
type-c compatible and the lack of
standardization total oh you you don't
get that anymore you're not getting you
know you're you get HTC putting in their
own little adapter proprietary or
whatever all are doing the same thing
and you
get that one adapter you're stuck
without headphones and you are gonna
have to rely like you know on hopefully
what Android Oreo is gonna be bringing
in to the table better audio processing
built into Android and having true aptX
support natively support have you played
with Android over there because I've
tried a two different USB mics and a USB
DAC and I had varying results on what
worked and what didn't
so my experience at play as far as just
using the the actual built-in DAC and
using the audio processing on it it's
been very nice I have heard some people
having some issues using the USB type-c
connector to be able to play audio now
it hasn't it hasn't been a hundred
percent I remember Oreo just officially
became an actual release a few weeks ago
maybe a couple about a month or so ago
but I enjoy using my pixel Excel it's a
it's a secondary device I carry two
phones and it's I'm very happy to see
that Oreos addressing it finally
addressing audio quality you go into
developer option you can set a PTX
support you can set the quality the
audio the output levels you just didn't
have these things before so we just need
to see how the adoption of Oreo comes
around and hopefully the v30 gets it
first I don't know I'm crossing my
fingers there I really want to see v30
with though with you know that kind of
hard coded audio yeah built into it um
it was one of the things I was I was
having a conversation
if the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack has
to die the biggest stumbling block that
we faced who you were mentioning is this
terrible support for a true USB audio
input output standard I mean baked into
Linux sort of the kernel that drives
Android and yet we've seen very little
movement for people who care about a
cabled connection to arrive at that kind
of solution and one of the companies I
was talking to uh Eva I had a
conversation with one of the engineers
that Sennheiser and I'm a I'm
obscenities or or I love their gear if
they're if you're going to remove audio
a traditional audio hardware from a
smartphone I'm actually not too angsty
about that if I can invest in something
that I know is gonna play universally
across my various gadgets
so you know I've got a us USB ports in a
USBC port on my laptop be able to unplug
from my phone and plug into my laptop
and if Sennheiser is responsible for the
DAC and the amp powering those
headphones I'm gonna be a really happy
camper cuz then it won't matter if I
have like some $200
you know entry-level smartphone some you
know thousand-dollar premium smartphone
I know my headphone quality remains
consistent across any device exactly -
but I don't think we can get there until
we know that these products have proper
USB audio support and that to me seems
like it's still a couple years away at
the bare minimum yeah at the bare
minimum from from a tipping point of
Android manufacturers getting there you
know Android Oh is out but I mean what's
the market share on on nougat it's still
crazy low it's extremely little up a1
percentage in that range and I think the
ultimate solution would be to have a
licensing program like made for iPhone
instead of made for Android you know and
have that as part of a you know licensed
accessory bin so that's the only way
that you can do it I think Android and
HTC or Google and HTC working together
in order to bring that about because HTC
has been a clear offender on this with
those bonus I think the danger of having
that licensing though is is it probably
stands just to create yet another
division you know like this is
compatible with HTC Google stuff doesn't
necessarily mean that it's built on just
the basic USB audio protocol which all
phones should have access to but the way
that Android layers on top of that audio
stack creates additional latency so no
one really bothers to try and implement
it um if we could address that then it
really wouldn't matter I mean you could
you should be able to plug just like on
the iPhone you should be able to plug
any USB mic any USB audio interface I've
got a portable recorder that plays great
with my iPhone I've got a hike
quality professional recording interface
that plays great with my iPhone this
shouldn't be a problem it should just
work um we probably should wrap this up
on the HTC I do want to chew through a
couple of the tweets that we've been
getting this is from right s he actually
tweeted us 11 hours before we started
broadcasting using the pn weekly hashtag
with google acquiring HTC now we know
that wasn't an actual acquisition do you
think if the red HTC u 11 have been a
pixel phone it would have been a super
success he thinks so do you think having
a pretty red option would have made the
pixel a bigger deal TK or do you think
that it still would have been just as
constrained in terms of manufacturing
and shipping I think you know actually I
have to say yeah I mean if DSD you love
them that tiny red phone and having just
you know Google on the back of that I
think that would be an amazing device
getting it yeah and I think the design
and we all love our Google devices or a
pixel devices not necessary for the way
they look it's because of what they can
do to this day the camera on the pixel
Excel or the pixel devices is I think in
my opinion the number one of 2017 still
and it came out last year so when you
look at it in that sense it's hard to
tell you know is it making sexier
woodwork but I think it couldn't hurt I
think Google would definitely would have
been all over that horizon would have
loved it can you try to say is Verizon
you walk into a verizon carrier and
you've got the big red checkmark with
this so was it solar red was that the
name of the the right exact solar flare
going off there we've got a couple of
their tweets here from renato Laporte PN
weekly I think that in one year we won't
be seeing relevant HTC devices anymore
unless they partner with somebody else
someone also kind of piggybacking on my
hypothesis that that flagship grade
stuff is probably gonna be living more
and more at Google and then what's left
is probably going to be servicing but
you were saying the desire market in the
mid ranger market do you think this is
from Peter hatin do you think HTC will
still try to make phones themselves or
will they focus their efforts on their
more profitable areas like vive and TK I
mean if they just carve everything up
then HTC is gone and it's just the vive
company essentially yeah going on to
live on after the the Phoenix out of the
ashes of HTC exactly and then I mean
there's been even rumors that the five
division may be up for grabs at some
point so it's it truly is looking like
HTC is looking to divide and conquer
basically we're not trying to be the
Masters of all tricks we know we do
really well on the vibe the pixel to
pixel division at at Google works great
let's just do what works for them and I
think it's a good way to keep it but
unfortunately could mean the end of the
HTC brand as we we all remember it yeah
from Juan Salazar are we going to see
faster updates for HTC devices my
feeling is probably no yeah not with
more talent living at Google I wouldn't
count on that
being such an open line of communication
you'll have to move over to a pixel yeah
if you want to see its exactly you're
getting HTC and you're getting and
lastly and this is for both of you guys
for both you jewels and for utk this is
from the jieb I've got the pixel what's
your recommendation on going with pixel
two or should he wait for the pixel
three I mean if we're talking about this
didn't we have the pixel 2x now I
believe was the leaked name of it which
is gonna be LG and it's gonna have the
screen that 2x1 to screen display hey I
think that's worthy of looking at and
we've also talked about pricing which
has stayed the same relative to last
generations pixels so if anything there
is no guarantee that the pixel 3 will
you know not cost 750 or 850 dollars
that's what I take so from my from my
approach to it I'm looking at it from a
spec point of view the reality is I
think year after year what we see from
our from pixel devices or even update we
see a small speck bump for one we had
from last year on the pixel
in the pixel I think realistically if
you're happy with what you have with the
pixel XL you're still gonna get those
updates you're still going to be on the
cutting edge getting those new versions
of Android when they come out the betas
and so on you know I would probably say
stay with the pixel excel as you have
and wait till the pixel three because
that's probably where you're gonna start
seeing some of the new things coming out
is when you know HTC and Google have had
about a year to sit together and work
under the same umbrella and produced
because that'll be the you know Gen 1 of
this merger or not merger but this
borrowing of staff partnership yeah yeah
partnership I think that's what that
would be my opinion I I agree and
especially because I think last year's
phones have aged far better than phones
of previous generations exactly if you
can hold it out I mean we're pretty
confident we're gonna be getting the
narrower aspect ratio the the Qualcomm
835 or some variants close enough in
terms of Qualcomm 835 performance and
you're losing the headphone jack I feel
like you could probably look at the next
year the pixel 3 as being you know more
of like the Apple tick-tock you know
that's where we'll probably see a more
substantial improvement to the guts of
the phone and from there moving forward
exactly like you were saying TK I think
well we'll see more the fruits of this
team working with Google the first pixel
it definitely shows it was very much a
rushed product you know trying to fit a
certain market demographic in under nine
months I mean you know babies take
longer to make then the person was
created so pixel to I think is a better
representation of what these teams can
do working together but the true test
will be generation three and that also
goes back to my overall hypothesis that
that's when I think consumers are really
going to be taking Google seriously as a
first party manufacturer so I think
that's where we're apt to see something
even more exciting coming out of this
partnership for sure indeed indeed I
cannot wait for that but in the meantime
we have plenty of other and used to talk
about so if you don't mind I'm just
gonna jump right in here for the week
September 18th 2017 this is all the news
that's fit to podcast according to an
analyst at Raymond James Apple has yet
to begin true mass production on the
iPhone 10 that's set the ship in
November it's not clear how his claims
are built but it goes against the high
street grain that right around now mid
September the huawei mate 10 is
supposedly going to come in four flavors
a main model a pro version a very
capable light model and perhaps a
Porsche Design Edition much like how
we've seen the mate nine come out
pricing for the main model and the pro
is set to stretch between iPhone 8 and
iphone 10 territory so between those two
we're talking about 650 tailed $1,150
which is kind of an uncharted or rarely
charted territory for this kind of
caliber of phone in China at least
t-mobile has raised its deprived de
prioritization 32 gigabytes to 50
gigabytes that's the amount of data used
in a month before the carrier decides to
throttle customers speed in high-traffic
situations it has gone up four times
since the introduction of its t-mobile 1
and limited data offer and this most
recent raising happened after it
introduced its free Netflix on us deal
and finally the Moto X 4 has been
introduced the US as the us's first
Android 1 phone and with it project
fives first as well the Google + VN O's
is taking a pre-orders for than $400
device through up to October 5th
meantime the minimalist Android 1
program is set to expand in this country
in the very new future so I've already
placed my pre-order for one of those
babies I feel like I'm gonna get a good
workout it's gonna replace the Nexus 5x
I've had that on a on a other account
that I don't use that often now at all
and I feel like it's just gonna be just
much more of a fit I'm sad to see the
moto assist
sweet and all the other moto features go
away but I mean it's it is what it is is
I feel yeah this is actually one of the
most exciting moves I think for project
Phi is just getting another phone in the
lineup and I really liked our first
hands-on so if you if you catch our
video of the Moto X for here on the
pocket now YouTube channel it's terrible
it's maybe one of the worst looking
videos we've ever shot and it was
because the the product revealed that we
had in Berlin was like this like dark
dance forever yeah it was I mean it was
fun but it was terrible because in in
the arena that we're in it was difficult
to see the phone let alone to try and
also shoot video of it and so that was a
big bummer but actually having the phone
in my hands I was very impressed with
what moto moto was doing for the x4 so
this is an excellent way to introduce a
mid-range ur4 project by not just having
people like well if you want a less
expensive device you can maybe try and
find a used Nexus and that's what you
can use for project 5 this is so much
better to have a legit first party
offering a new product which will begin
a lifecycle of support and updates
current internals current chipset
current cameras and now it's also more
viable strategy for project 5 for those
of us who are looking at an inexpensive
way to provide service for a phone no
definitely and in joules too even though
it's sad to see some of these features
go away it would make the ability to
update that device a much easier process
for Google or even for Motorola because
there's less less work for them to do
it's it's a kind of like a hey you have
something new here you go
it should be a much better experience
all the features should be in the USP
and that will be easier and you know I
mean it's these should be its like stock
these stock plus situations should just
be an on stock and that could be said
the same for oneplus in some situations
personally I don't feel like my taste
but hey I think it's a fair addition you
know what be really exciting is
motorola goes through all of this google
licensing stuff to deliver this android
one handset for North America and then
like the next day on Google Play there's
a Motorola accessory pack that you can
not not crazy intrusive they should do
that that I'm not sure why you haven't
been you you're not applying for a job
well but I mean it was a part of what
HTC did I mean not not as directly or
not as boldly but I mean like every
individual component of HTC's Sense
really was just a separate it was broken
up and it was you you download directly
through Google Play I don't see where
Motorola couldn't do it couldn't replace
this functionality just by leaving a
couple software holes open that then
just plug right in through stuff that
you can download there are obvious
advantages to kernel level stuff that's
why I think that that could be a smart
that could be a fun play I doubt they're
gonna do it because they don't want to
rock the boat Google but the additions
that Motorola brings I mean what are the
great things about having used the the
z2 was there was just this one Motorola
app where all of that stuff lived now it
wasn't like you had a bunch of disparate
separate services and apps that needed
to be updated across the kernel it was
just this one here's everything you can
find it right here and I know the app
doesn't really work that way I mean
they're a bunch of individual components
and need to be updated but if you could
get to a point where it was just one
accessory pack apk that would be super
nice for people that wanted to replace
that functionality no no I think it's
Samsung's done it in the past to I don't
know if you guys have heard it would be
a seven and es6 they used to have a
Productivity pack in an audio music
playback pack they used to sell extra
packages they used to download off of
their Play Store or after the Samsung
store apps
yeah or specific made for Galaxy or so
the reality is a lot of these
modifications
like Jules explains it's not that hard
you're right there are some of them that
do require criminal levels kernel level
modification for it to even work
specifically with the always-on display
the tab will tap - wait there's gestures
and so on those things are not as as
simple as a simple apk but we've seen
development done from from other
companies that have introduced it to
even low-end devices so it's not
uncalled for and you mentioned one plus
one plus is a perfect example they keep
it very lean it's in there and it's
baked in and there's also a big
development support behind it and
hopefully Motorola can can capitalize on
that provide a vanilla device and you
can add your toppings later now I wanna
I wanna circle back to huawei just
because I'm getting crazy anxious about
the the may 10 reveal but this is making
me a little nervous seeing so many
different leaks about so many different
product lines and so many different
pieces and one of the things that was
really nice about the may 9 was that it
launched pretty simply I mean was the
May 9 the main tonight Porsche design
which eventually became the mate 9 Pro
but at launch it was two major phones
and then just two different flavors of
phone per the launch do we think that
Huawei
might be biting off more than they can
really chew or at least biting off more
than they can properly communicate to
consumers with their mouths full from
biting off too much and especially at
this threshold where they're
transitioning to two by one and also
they're adding on water resistance for
the first time I think in yeah series
history yeah that's that's a pretty
crazy from what these leaks are telling
us and they're all six inch devices and
I mean suppose it is mate 10 light or
the what was the mine on six so G 10 or
whatever they vary you know they're all
supposed to support the top-end
970 and these big batteries and like
that there is a baseline experience and
then there's like the rate rest of it
which just adds on and adds on and adds
on in terms of hardware and I don't know
how much we're gonna get for that much
more money is what I'm saying
storage and if the trim the drab market
is to be believed it is still definitely
a hard time out there
no and TK isn't there some some merit to
the conversation about having like ten
different SKUs as opposed to shipping
one or two really well refined products
instead like dividing up your
manufacturing lines into all of these
separate products some of them selling
better than others some of them
dedicated to certain regions most of
them never coming here to the United
States about to jump on that and and the
reality is that the flavors that we're
looking at could potentially be for
different markets we're not looking for
you know let's say there's four
different versions of it you know the
your of them regular the high-end and
then the two mid rangers the reality is
those probably in the bean in different
markets you know there's the European
market there's the Asian market they're
going to be getting in there I think
Huawei's approach in the US has changed
slightly from last year what we've seen
this year is very big approach into
Europe
we've had the mate nine in the US and
we've had nothing else there you know
and if we want to talk huawei we can
talk about honor a little bit maybe an
honor didn't bring you know the ad honor
nine didn't come to the US the way they
honor eight came last year well that I
think that waited breath that for AT&amp;amp;T
to do something early next year because
we've been talking about those rumors as
well yeah yeah and that's the the the
approach I think they're focusing
headstrong I think they have the the
less participate they have the R&amp;amp;D
department to be able to fit all of us
into a handheld device that could
perform well they need to market it at
the right level and price it correctly I
think we're going into this beginning of
2018 or end of seventeen of the $1,000
close to $1,000 phone and it's it's
becoming when do we want to basically go
over and I gotta turn off Google now
behind me because she's answering the
answer looking at and we're looking at
some of these rumors though that the
starting price for a May 10 you know
we're talking about a 4 gigabyte 4
gigabytes of RAM and a 64 gigabyte
storage Varian starting under $700 u.s.
could be a compelling way to say yeah he
do have the thousand-dollar option if
want this May 10 Pro / Porsche design
experiment thing if you want to show
that off you can but I like this idea of
a big bold powerful device that starts
at what a flagship phone uses the cost
and with an amazing amazing chipset
we're talking at the SOC on this - 970
we've seen a lot of good stuff on it and
the made nine I still love it I've had
it since the beginning of January it's
it's amazing audio playback amazing
camera on the back there you have two
dual sensor setup with like a branding
okay you win and I don't mean to party
poop here but you know we're talking
about kwame and it's native country and
you know we're going to expect a little
bit more to go on in terms of oh bring
it over us this this you know we're just
doing the exchange rate so the rumor is
that it would be what 4300 yeah and that
you high for you know I mean if you're
talking about a market that's saturated
with show me and rain zoo and all that
that's a you know that's still very big
and you know the direct exchange rate is
just six hundred and fifty dollars I
wholly expect that let's say they
managed to pull a worldwide launch that
it would easily be what 749 device you
could easily add a hundred dollars to
that price tag and still have a device
more than capable of competing against
the flagship products that have been
released this year let alone
undercutting other large screen options
like the galaxy s 8 plus the note 8 and
easily undercutting those products I
really hope that they take it you know
it's gonna be a soft launch and before
the whole AT&amp;amp;T thing I I hope that
that's gonna be like when they really
you mean by you hope it's a soft launch
you mean ramping up like launching in
just a couple countries and then
bringing it to the US when they have a
carrier strategy or yeah dude just China
and or just like even giving out just a
simple press release like the
conversations we've been having with LG
like hey brah LGBTQ when's it really
gonna go yeah that's true
but I mean you get you get my point and
it's gonna happen I really believe it's
gonna happen and if they can
communicates all that to the proper
audience I think I'm a good awesome big
IFS because those are definitely
criticisms we've had for a number of
manufacturers and not the least of which
LG and HTC and Motorola and how they
communicate with their customers um real
quick just want to wrap up sort of the
news block with the iPhone 10 story how
much how much faith do we want to put
into this report it seems a little
sketchy that Apple would have put such a
hard deadline for the phone's release at
their keynote and then someone else you
know maybe with good credibility maybe
not we don't know
speaking to this point as you know the
thing that bothers me is that is the
line that they haven't started mass
production
that's imagine is worrying but shouldn't
there be evidence of that like shouldn't
we be able to look that up somehow in
all we've had are just little paper
trails from component manufacturers back
and I think mid August or so that
signaled that there's a big rise in
activity and presumably I mean they're
all Apple suppliers so that's gonna be
the case here that you can attribute
that to that but in terms of actual like
Foxconn because it still all has to be
assembled you can have all the parts but
have to actually go through with the
mixing of the ingredients if you will
yeah I'm puzzled on that front
especially if we're talking about making
sure that everything fits together I
mean it is challenging with the new like
curved glass and the display part
especially yeah I mean especially for
fitting it all together I heard Tim Cook
took the iPhone and threw it into a
glass of water and when you saw air
bubbles he was like there's more room in
there you have more room
I don't well I mean oh he could just go
into you know Good Morning America and
say is a value price or the right for
the most forward-thinking just phone
ever created TK do you think that this
would harm Apple if there was a delay do
you know no it's sadly I think if
anything he would be feeding the beast
it's only gonna make the demand even
higher I mean we all live wooden house
it once but until the supply actually
catches them and that's the that's the
inference here is that we should be
taking out is that yeah just where it's
all it's still gonna be weeks and weeks
and months people are gonna be waiting
for yet for orders and then try to buy
it and it's it's just it's been this way
the only thing I can say for sure is
we're probably going to all be able to
get iPhone eights by December if we want
them and the reality is everybody's
waiting for the X and that demands gonna
be so high that even if this was not
true and they did start ramping up they
cannot stay ahead of the demand and
there's always gonna end up being a
shortage so it doesn't hurt them it just
keeps people talking about them and I
think it's a good thing I'm looking
forward to seeing the iPhone 10 iPhone X
the reality is probably won't probably
won't be able to see it for quite some
time you know because it is gonna sell
out you know I think Apple has a way of
approaching things it's supply and
demand right they already knew that the
iPhone eight was not gonna be the
performer so you know we didn't hear one
big issue from them saying oh my god the
sales of the iPhone eight is not working
because I think they realized this is
where it's coming so I think there could
they're ramping up
they are gonna run out before the
holiday and use before we know it we're
all gonna be like where's my iPhone time
and why is it in terms when you're
comparing halves of business you know
the first half for Apple start in the
holidays goes into the Sprint and that's
when they sell the most iPhones so they
have that routine drilled into these
customers you know every two years
there's a game I phone it's that this
time boom you have it
and yet when you're stretching that
efforts to more of the spring quarter
instead of like the actual holidays when
everyone has the bug
set aside for gifts and all that I don't
know I really don't know if it's you
know it's a mission credit of coltan
face of course but you're still when you
need it you need it now when you're when
you're broken on that one Jules is I
think we've been in a holding a lot of I
should say a lot of iPhone fans have
been in a holding pattern
so whatever funds they might have been
dedicating towards you know an iPhone 7
or creeper a good actor and and that
they're just sort of sitting on that I
can tell you I have so many family
members that are still rocking like
iPhone 5s is kind of waiting to see what
might come and the iPhone 6 to iPhone 7
transition didn't really seem to do it
for them that's you know two years of
not paying off a phone on a contract
that they haven't had to spend on a
device so this notion that they're gonna
be spending 40 bucks a month when they
finally do get it isn't quite so
devastating once these these iPhone 10
start shipping exactly we're gonna see a
lot of subsidy that's gonna bring down
that thousand dollar price and I think
that's what they're banking on a lot of
Apple's processes look yeah we said it's
a thousand dollars but the reality is a
lot of people gonna be financing it
either releasing it if you do a let's
say t-mobile jump on demand its Apple
directly yeah yeah or even yeah yeah so
are you
sorry with the iPhone 5s and I've even
like the iPhone 4s as kind of the big
fringe audience that we're trying to get
with the supercycle that analysts have
been talking about and training programs
have only extended either towards the
iPhone 6 or iPhone 5s so at this point
why is it two people that's you're
getting five or $10 a month off when
you're your 5-year old iPhone doesn't
even is not even worth anything anymore
and unless there is like an actual
upfront
subsidy no strings attached I don't
think it's it makes sense but that's why
I think these leasing programs because
instead of it being an upfront subsidy
it's just you
don't pay anything it's like literally
zero and then it just shows up on your
bill we've got a couple tweets here from
Renato Laporte PN weekly remember the
first global iPhone months of waiting
well here we go again
and and immediately after from David
Baptista Silva Apple always does that by
producing short supplies they assure
that the market does not lower the price
of the iPhone it prevents the iPhone
from be immediately becoming a commodity
like Android manufacturers can sometimes
run into exactly maybe I design LS
eBay's like never MSRP starting you know
a well we um we had some Motorola news
like I said I was really excited about
project five there was another Motorola
story that we want to unpack a little
bit too and actually another reason why
I'm really glad you're on this week's
podcast tks because we're talking about
software support Jules can you talk us
just through the basics real quick on
this renewed promise from Motorola on
the g4 plus hold on I have to I have to
simulate the whole button for right but
it it it and that that would be our top
spot sounder if I had the soundboard I'm
really glad you don't have the
soundboard more jewels like bebop sky
okay know what we're talking about here
is the Moto G for plus now originally
there was marketing material for it on
its website
Motorola's website that said that it
would be updated to both Android N and O
and it goes against what Motorola has
previously said or as previously put
down as its policy moto G Series phones
these mid Rangers will only get one year
of OS updates which you know kind of
surprises us but you know in the whole
scheme of things when you're dealing
with a portfolio of twelve phones and a
lot more already top end devices you
have these
other mid-range and lower end devices
that you have to deal with all right
fine you can triage it's like that
that's fine at least to me it is but so
now that they've been caught like
they've been caught with this material
and they changed it postmortem
mmm people are saying or have been
complaining hey you should probably fix
this or do this and Motorola came out
and said you know what you're right
we're gonna back up our promise and just
even though it's gonna be on a
indefinite basis on an untimed basis
there's no strict guideline as to when
we'll do it we'll do it so now that
makes the Moto G 4 plus as the 13th
phone that they'll have to update to
Android Oreo in the near future everyone
else is gonna be first I suppose because
it'll be it'll take the least amount of
time to do but I guess the first
question and we'll go up and down with
this one should the Moto G series get
2-year OS update supports and what I was
gonna what I was gonna jump in with
Jules is because I don't know that it's
ever I don't know that I've ever paid
attention enough to see where it was
disclosed that the G was only supposed
to get one major OS update yeah is that
been something in your experience where
like he disclosed that like this it
hasn't checked yet yeah no no the DES
general rule has always been two years
of so s update that's the the unwritten
rule by most providers and I think it
was set by Google because Google is the
one who started saying look we'll
support these devices for a certain
number of updates probably two revisions
of I of Android and supporting mid
Ranger's it's it shows dedication from
the company if they want to be able to
do it but as you said Jules the the
requirements for so many as such a big
portfolio of devices to get updated
every year is going to be very taxing on
the company and specially since I mean
hello we have yeah A's
eze and other letters that I don't even
think exist anymore there's yeah then
again they have so many flavors of their
devices and so very few of those get
updates and even when they do receive
the updates you know is so so long you
may have already gotten written the
device you don't even have it anymore is
it good PR yes is it should it be done
definitely I think people would
appreciate it they would feel like they
have value in their device and it's
gonna get the next Android version I
mean because Apple still supports it
even though it's an older device they
have a set timeline and they support it
is it functional from the manufacturing
as far as from a company's point of view
it's a little hard to justify it I think
as you said they got caught with that
statement it's something they have to
stick to the g4 plus for me was a great
device for what it did and the price
point it did overheat for me I'm hoping
software can fix that issue for us but
you know at some point you have to kind
of from a company Center we have to move
on and people that have the g4 are not
really looking for updates for Android
they look for a budget device that had a
big screen 1080p display a decent camera
on it a Dyson off battery because it was
the high end of the g4 series right you
had to play the g4 and the g4 plus and
it's nice to see that one moving on and
we could get people to you know think of
maybe the next series of G 0 G devices
will get it so I mean I've got a
personal stake in this because I've got
a couple family members who are on g4 s
so g4 pluses specifically and so yeah
motorola needs to give them like 10
years of software support is probably
concern um but one of the things that I
think III kind of wanna I kind of wanna
fight you on TK o come someone who might
be buying a budget device you're
probably right that they're not looking
for bells and whistles and you know
they're trying to achieve something and
they're trying to achieve it at a
certain price point but one of the
things increasingly as we come to depend
on our portable electronics more so much
of our lives personal data being lived
out of these devices um more than any
other tier I feel budget and mid rangers
need to have multiple years of proper
software support not just for bug fixes
and patches but also for the operating
system
when I started doing this podcast it was
almost two years ago we were talking
about an army of Samsung Galaxy s3 that
were still being used around the world
and were these huge security a these
huge security exploits because they were
just off the reservation for any kind of
of support from the manufacturer and
from Google and if if a company is going
to quietly disclose that oh no this is
the line of phones that only gets one
major operating system update I think
that needs to be a bigger deal yeah that
that erodes a lot of confidence in a
brand that I trust for this sort of
entry to mid-range product the Moto G
series is something that I've always
pointed family and friends to because
it's a reputable brand it's a brand
recognition everyone remembers Motorola
they make great products and they should
be well supported if I can take should
be well supported off the list there's
no incentive for me to recommend a
Motorola over a flaw way over a budget
LG over a desire over any other solution
that might come at the same price tier
and will probably also deliver more
compelling hardware at that price here
at the same time it's something that
they they should have it like as you
said they should be more forthcoming
with the information you should see the
ads basically at the same level as does
they have a great camera does it get
support does it have great audio does it
have a good display it's something that
you need to basically factor into when
you're buying a device because you know
when we say mid-range mid-range is such
a big gap from very budget-friendly to
you know a feature phone sorry over to a
device that you know is capable like you
said like the G Series and you should
make a decision based on that and then
think as we move forward in time support
for devices doesn't end with the
manufacturer and there is other options
down on the market but from a standard
as far as what you're saying if you say
you're buying it for a family friend you
know your mom your friend your brother
your cousin you want to make sure that
they're too well taken care of and
you're not losing it on that because
nine times out of ten we're a tech
support for all of those people so we
got to know what we're doing right
because they're gonna come back to you
and say hey one so you know what's up
the security flaw is all over the news
so my hope would be is that they're able
to provide patches more periodically and
more consistently to be able to teach
the security patches but maybe Android
OS updates I don't think it's a that bad
to say look will allow will definitely
upgrade you to the next version because
within a year there's usually at least a
version of Android but outside of that
it's hard to justify because like I said
it's a mid-range err you didn't you
didn't buy into the the continued
support the continuous update and so on
and then you have to factor well and
there is probably also some concern that
that second year of updates if you're on
a Qualcomm 615 you're exactly adding the
best performance I totally appreciate
that I think maybe that you nailed it
for me is where's the disclosure yeah
cuz a part of this press release too is
you know we made a mistake with our
marketing materials and really yeah I
guess maybe sure but you there's a
responsibility to the consumer that they
know what information is at stake here
what information possibly could have
been a mistake because so many other
players in the market you buy a phone
and consumers aren't looking at this
like I bought a mid-range err they
they're looking at this like I bought a
phone yeah Brendon look at their friends
with an Apple phone and it gets four or
five operating system updates by the end
of the that chain of updates the iPhone
is barely usable but it still got the OS
update yeah and then they look at their
own product and they hear you know
there's that sort of osmosis like oh
there was a security exploit there was a
the broad broad pond there was another
operating system exploit and then to
know that oh well because I somehow buy
a cheap phone for $300 now I have to
take care of it all on my own is not
really an acceptable solution for anyone
these days
no I think it's as long as they as long
as they know what they're getting into
you're right at least you know you know
what you're doing and what your
expectations should be I did want to
turn this question rant to the future
because as we're going along hopefully
Android and its OAM partners and even
though the carriers are going to start
implementing project treble and they're
gonna be able to make simpler lengths to
code
from mold ooh and you know you would
hope that people start taking up this
this whole scheme does this give them
less enough excuse from that point to
just start updating all of their devices
at you know in the timely fashion what
do you think so I'll start by saying it
it's not gonna give him more it's not
gonna be less of an excuse I think if
anything they're they're probably going
to stick to their own mechanism of
saying look we're gonna support certain
things to a certain way we're gonna keep
producing it I think till we have
full-on support for the way updates can
be pushed out more incrementally as
opposed to being this big overdo of the
entire system because what we forget
that I mean I know with Motorola and
with the GG devices these are unlocked
devices so you're not getting that much
carrier stuff you know because Google
can push an update Motorola can push an
update but if Verizon doesn't update the
z-force on Verizon with their version of
Android which takes all more more time
you're gonna get these little slowdowns
and whatever hiccups they have t-mobile
is the same thing so we always only keep
in mind as yes it could help I think
it's gonna definitely improve the
experience they can definitely promise
more if they are if they're willing to
you know put the support behind it but
we also need telcos we need you know oh
yeah not OEM is what providers to start
you know simplifying their codes
simplifying their atoms so that it
doesn't become this overhaul of an
update that looks so different from one
carrier to another to the same device
essentially yeah when we were going
through all of the project fuchsia
rumors for example and what future
operating system Google might be looking
at for mobile devices and what that
might resemble I hate to say it but I
think this is this is a consumer
argument in favor of maybe making the
wide open nature of Android a little bit
more restrictive and put in more of the
onus and control under Google in a way
that maybe Microsoft is responsible for
updating their products more than the
manufacturers of Microsoft products that
means we lose a little flexibility and
it upsets some of Google's manufacturing
partners that their skins can't be quite
so invasive so be it you know I think
we're seeing a few steps in that
direction with Android
google mandating that partners have to
use the power management settings of
andhra to restrict background processes
i think some of those a few more of
those moves might actually empower
google to take some of the heavy lifting
off of manufacturers and carriers and
support more directly with the consumers
using their software and i think that
would probably be the best i mean this
is a long-term solution and it will
probably mean a future operating system
not necessarily android for it to be
executed this way but i kind of think
that's the best way to go about
maintaining security actually delivering
updates and again for all of our
excitement over features in Android Oh
who's gonna be using it in six months
how many people will really have access
to all of this cool new stuff and it's a
shockingly tiny fraction exact enjoyed
market as a whole this is not a good
position for Google to be in if they're
gonna keep pushing products and services
no it definitely it's we're we're far
away where we have years before we can
see a true adoption of all these things
that we're looking at right now pixel
devices have that benefit but the
reality is yeah Google needs to put more
a better structure for updates and the
fact that 90% of the skins that we see
as you said at least from an enthusiast
standpoint I replace the the the
front-end launcher I'm not a big fan of
most launchers Nova guess on my device
and over time I have my setup correctly
and I appreciate what they try to do but
I do want to say one thing in Google's
at defense at least or even as a as a
nice little bonus they've been learning
year after year all these nice features
that we've seen the split-screen they
better audio processing or even you know
the the display just to be able to hold
up your device and be able to see your
notifications those things have been
adopted and actually built into the OS
now that we can truly appreciate it so
it's taking some of these things back
unfortunately manufacturers disable
these you have to go in there and you
know you lose some of these things that
you you want this let's create the LG
that it really nicely they stopped
developing their split-screen
functionality I think on the V 20 and
it's
look Google did it we don't need to do
it let's just hate theirs move forward
yeah it was actually rolled out as
exactly yes yes I mean there was there
was a weird little package and it was I
think with the g5 they stopped
implementing their own version of split
screens didn't know the phone didn't
have the update yet and and I and I
looked for that I didn't understand it
at the time but it makes perfect sense
so I think it will help a lot of other
manufacturers I don't know Samsung will
be will be taking any pages from that
book but at least for LG you know could
be HTC down the road and also maybe with
Huawei as well there is there's gonna be
a much easier way of path for them to
update and provide better support for
their devices also I just feel like in
terms of this whole climate of
cybersecurity there's there's a morality
argument at play that I think has
largely been overlooked where the people
who are most economically disadvantaged
are also the people who are going to be
the easiest targets it's argued yeah
continuously moving forward and if a
major company doesn't come out ahead of
this it means huge swathes of the
population of this planet are going to
be increasingly left out in the cold
when it comes to things like security
and support but on that note on that
happy happy note and whenever talking
about phones and things are exciting I
do want to move around the piano a
hashtag here on Twitter Jules you got
some good tweets for me yeah I got
Renata report who mentions morality more
of the day don't make software support
promises as a selling point I think I've
we've talked against that point I guess
or or do but just live up to your
promises I guess the moral of the story
is if you're gonna sell something
actually deliver what you're selling the
David Baptista Silva leasing subsidies
etc those only exist in the US around
the world nobody else really does that
hence Apple's low market share and I
would argue that Apple has started to
drive deals with regional banks in those
countries to start providing those
options those financing options anyways
and even if they're not being taken up I
mean they they've always sold so much
definitely definitely gaining ground on
that definitely indeed
and Peter hatin I guess if anything
mid-range is often more important for
software support as many of these people
benefit most from important updates and
I think that we can all agree with that
Android should be built in a way where
security patches are pushed widely
directly by googly yeah and then also
from Peter hatin this is I think this is
an interesting point too because I don't
know if it works in the positive but I
know it works in the negative his
opinion that good software support for a
mid-range shows real care and can help
sell a flagship but I don't you know
it's like one of those things when
things go right people don't seem to
notice or to care I mean it's just sort
of a foregone conclusion if you have an
iPhone that you're gonna be getting
support and so it's NBD when these
updates finally do arrive and a lot of
people actually get annoyed like I got
to update my phone again but you know
when the negative happens again like we
were talking about if Motorola is really
making it one update one major update
for a mid-range phone that actually
gives me pause as to whether or not I
would recommend other motorola products
if it turns out in the negative like
your phone got no support its way less
likely that I'd recommend a more
expensive product from that man
messenger if that's actually that's how
they treat their customers no I totally
agree exactly it's the experience it's
how you build your the loyalty from your
customers you need to give them what
they are looking for and make sure that
you know it's working if you're not
paying attention to it you know no news
is good news kind of thing you want to
be in that position most of us want to
be there because the moment you hear
about a thread or a leak or something
that goes through says look there's a
patch that needs to come through but oh
my device isn't supported you're gonna
feel short-changed
and you're more than like you're not
gonna go back to the same company when
you upgrade you're gonna probably go
somewhere else and try another
manufacturer that has a better track so
hopefully like Jules was saying is if or
the I think was the other tweet I
mentioned is that Google gets to a point
where they're able to push security
updates because at the end of the day
they're the ones who are pushing it out
anyways to the ballot to the - you know
Verizon t-mobile and so on so if they
can push it into
to our devices and it just updates the
system I think it's a much better
experience and then if anything else it
creates value I mean honestly I mean I
understand why some of these things are
you know Qualcomm has these issues with
the vulnerabilities and some of those
have to do with the radio through the
carriers anyways but still it's just I
don't know how kind of stuck in this
dilemma but if you're able to see if
you're able to feature proof in any way
if you're able to you know take a chance
on an Android one or pixel or whatever I
think will be much more better setup if
you're on the Android side fear less
then we're already in that kind of mode
but right and a lot of that is that that
talking point vote with your wallet but
it's guiding people out of the mentality
of being on team manufacturer instead
looking like what really is gonna be the
best product for me and whenever that
happens if you need to make a decision
pocket nail will be there for you well
