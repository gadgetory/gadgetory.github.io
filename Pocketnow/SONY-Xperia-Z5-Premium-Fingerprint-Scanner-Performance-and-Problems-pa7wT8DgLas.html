Xperia z5 Class smartphones it is
embedded in the side mounted power key
on the Xperia z5 compact z5 and z5
premium but how does it really perform
in real life let's check it out in this
quick video I'm Anton Dean odd let's
dive into it having a side mounted
fingerprint scanner can be awkward or it
can be the perfect placement we've heard
both sides of the story but in the end
its placement isn't as relevant and
important as its performance
we've been extensively testing the
Xperia z5 premium for more than a week
now and we can say that the fingerprint
scanner is a hit or miss its rate of
success in our experience is about 2 out
of 10 whether it's a software hardware
or implementation issue we simply
couldn't find it consistent and reliable
enough to keep it activated so we
decided to ditch it not before showing
you the problems you'll face when using
it after successfully registering
fingers a number of five are available
the phone simply stops recognizing them
randomly
aside from reliability issues this also
kills one-handed operation in certain
scenarios whether you're driving or
carrying something after five failed
attempts the system locks and requires
you to input your PIN
initially we were inclined to believe
that this was an isolated issue maybe a
problem with our unit and maybe it is or
maybe it's just a small batch problem
but both Twitter users and Sony blog
posters on the company support page
confirmed and complained that they have
the same problems first of all the
scanner needs to be clean take this in a
very strict way we're not talking about
thick grease or dirt we are talking
about previous fingerprints from a
single touch that can render the scanner
unusable so if you really need or want
to use the scanner
make sure you add an extra step to your
unlocking procedure wipe it off every
time and since this is a waterproof
phone forget about unlocking while your
fingers the phone or both are wet or
even moist but you know we could live
with that
if dry operation
and performance was better we also tried
registering the same finger several
times just to improve its success rate
needless to say that this did not help
either
we really hope Sony manages to fix this
issue if it is fixable via software and
we also hope that this is if indeed a
widespread problem confined and limited
to a small batch you know for Sony's
sake do you have an experience a 5 class
smartphone do you experience the same
problems drop us a comment below add an
ant and deny and as usual thank you for
watching and see you next time
