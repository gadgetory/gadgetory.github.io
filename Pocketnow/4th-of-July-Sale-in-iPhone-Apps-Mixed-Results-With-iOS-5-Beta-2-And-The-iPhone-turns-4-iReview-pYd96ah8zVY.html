fourth of july sales Apple's iOS beta 2
hits released for sheriff cool and
not-so-cool things and numbers of the
iphone 3gs sticking around for another
year all to send more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm Jaime metal ulit
and welcome to the pocket now I review
the show we go through all this week
school and the not so cold inside the
world of Apple's iOS devices let's start
this week off with a cool well the
fourth of July is almost there along
with fireworks we also get some really
good deals just about everywhere and
yeah that includes apple's app store EA
gameloft and other companies have
already said their titles to 99 cents a
piece and that includes popular games
like nova to fifa 11 Matt and need for
speed and a lot of board games so if
you're interested hit on over to the App
Store we also posted that on
pocketnow.com recently and if anybody's
interested in a nova multiplayer hey
send me a tweet well the iphone just
turned four years old this week and
you'd wonder how things have changed in
the industry in the past four years ever
since it was released before the iphone
was released things like for example
kinetic scrolling WebKit browsers and
even capacitive glass displays and the
whole idea of using your fingers to
control your device were actually
unheard of everybody was moving to cure
the keyboards as blackberry was the king
back then and Nokia was also the king of
feature phone so it's really interesting
to see how things have evolved and
changed over time we now have even
tablets they use the OS and well that's
just to say happy birthday iPhone and
let's hope September bring something
better than what we currently have
rumors have it that suppliers are
already preparing to begin manufacturing
the iPhone 5 or us or whatever it's
going to be called for September release
the detectives reporting that Foxconn
has already begun preparing their
factory still work on the next
generation iphone and apparently another
device for September release now a lot
of speculation out there has that Apple
is working on a cheaper iPhone others
have been mentioning that Apple's
working on an iPad 3 with
high-resolution
to be released with a next-generation
iphone but people forget that Apple
releases the ipod touch every September
so most likely will get just the next
generation iphone and the next
generation ipod touch 4 sep tember being
released then well there's going to be a
lot of talk about that in a not so cool
section also while iOS 5 beta 2 has just
been released to developers but you'd
ask why don't we leave this for less
than close to the not-so-cool section
well Wi-Fi sync is now available you can
just set it up on iTunes and as long as
iTunes the text your iOS device being
charged with in the same wireless
network it'll sync your device aside
from that over-the-air updates are now
available and active though you won't
get any right now and it seems to also
be working through 3g which is really
cool then I cloud is now working with
backups in the past that wasn't really
working and now really backs up your
device though it's not as quick as we
want and well Apple is also brought
Notification Center keep your calendar
available all the time really cool but
then again a lot of other things really
went bad so let's talk about that in the
not-so-cool section
well left us for the coolest continue on
with the not so cool what's wrong with
iOS 5 beta to just about everything i
call this the buggiest beta release that
apple has ever sent to developers first
of all FaceTime doesn't work you wonder
why it has pretty much nothing to do
with the enhancements that you get but
it's completely the activated an apple
hasn't really said why aside from that
whoa itunes syncing over Wi-Fi is not
really working items is always looking
for a file out there that it can't find
so every time you want to sync it'll
tell you it can't because it can't find
the file then you have to connect your
device to pretty much sync that's not
Wi-Fi sync apple and well apples
currently been tweaking Notification
Center over and over again they're
bringing new things that look like
notifications in the past at least in
the lock screen so not really sure we're
enjoying these changes again Apple go
back to the drawing board and how about
if you bring us beta 3 or release
candidate gold master one just about
next week that'll sound really cool but
wait there's more iOS 5 beta 2 is not
good news at all for the jailbreak
community first of all the Getty sim
card exploit has been blocked so now you
can't unlock your device with the devi
sim card after iOS 5 beta 2 not sure
what to expect back to the full release
aside from that Apple has also figured
out how to block your ability to bring
you the vice back to a previous iOS
release by saving your SSH blobs so
that's not really cool if you want to
jailbreak your device and well the dev
team has even been blogging about the
fact that Apple also figured out how to
block the unto their jailbreaks you know
for good not really sure what to expect
after iOS 5 gets released so everybody's
worried it seems that only the line ring
exploit will work and through a tethered
jailbreak so again not good news rumors
rumors rumors something smells really
fishy about the fact that iOS 5 almost
fully supports the iphone 3gs wasn't the
same story with iOS four coming through
the 3gs because according to Apple the
hardware just didn't support it so
everybody's mentioning out there that
Apple is war
hang on leaving the iphone 3gs for an
additional year being sold as the free
device you'll probably get it free on
contract and really cheap for those
prepaid customers out there you'll
probably get the iphone for us to budget
device that will cost you ninety nine
dollars and you know just a cheap
contract and then you'll get the iphone
5 or 4s as the flagship device from
Apple you'll get three iphones but then
again it's technology that's almost
three years old I don't think any
manufacturer leaves an iPhone sorry a
smartphone for three years so not really
sure what to make of it but it's really
not cool it Apple's not bringing more
devices to the table competition spheres
and it's just interesting how Apple
works in handling competition by
releasing one device hmmm not really
sure what to expect that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm hime every veteran where to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
