is information on the feature oneplus
smartphone tablet sales are down yet
again and it seems that there is nothing
picking them back up and Microsoft gears
up for yet another event where we expect
more computers I'm hanging out of event
and that how exactly do you celebrate
your Cinco de Mayo because the fact that
it fell on a Friday is a very
interesting combination
this is parking out daily the official
list today has to do with yet another
Microsoft event we just got the
education event the surface laptop there
is build coming up there's also another
one in June but the company has just
announced an event in Shanghai for May
23rd and according to trusted sources
the product we should be expecting here
is a surface pro 5 and Microsoft there
is anything you know about me you'll
know that I'm a big fan of the surface
so I can't wait other very interesting
news have to do with Apple and what I
said yesterday about fit but I mean
historically Fitbit has owned a wearable
market when it comes to market share but
that actually changed as of these
quarter results believe it or not Apple
has doubled the sales of its Apple watch
which is not something the company
actually shares separately but according
to sources that is the case meaning
Apple is the current king of wearables
and that's really sad because these are
not the most affordable or best
wearables out there and speaking of
market share one market where Apple is
not having a good time is when it comes
to tablets first of all it has been on
decline for years and if you're asking
how many years we're talking pretty much
five years tablets have only existed for
seven so that's even worse news just to
give you an idea the company has dropped
a 13% of its market share Huawei even
worse and we would love to know why you
think this is happening why tablets have
been sold so well after the iPad 2
pretty much because I believe it has
everything to do with the fact that I
know people that are still using that
iPad 2 now how about if we talk about
the future Galaxy Note 7 as if you
thought that it wasn't going to happen
it just crossed through the FCC and you
know I wonder how people at the SEC had
to handle that I mean that phone arrives
it's got an explosive reputation and how
do you test that how do you conduct
tests with a product that you don't
trust I can't even imagine how
and finally the very hotness they have
to do with the successor of one of my
favorite smartphones of 2016 we've got
sources that claim that yes the name
will be warm +5 and they're not claiming
these as rumours they're claiming that
these are official one plus five and
that we should expect it in the summer
pretty much at the same time frame that
we got the one plus three not three T so
bear in mind what specifications weren't
really mentioned but we do hear
Snapdragon 835 which makes sense we hear
dual cameras which would be amazing we
also hear eight gigabytes of RAM which I
am going to put on a grain of salt but
it leads me to the question of the day
number one do you look forward to the
future one plus five number two do you
believe in these specifications in my
case Snapdragon 835 yes - of course I'm
waiting for this feature oneplus do I
believe in the a gigabytes of RAM I
don't know but oh my god
dual cameras one plus if you would add
that to that smartphone and you would
figure out your camera technology that
is going to be an insane sell leave us a
