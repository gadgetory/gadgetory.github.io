Samsung gear live is probably the more
attractive of Google's first to Android
wear smartwatches it's also got the
better screen and the lower price tag
but is this new accessory and the new
platform which powers it worth your
money or your time let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Samsung
gear live this isn't our first dip in
the SmartWatch pool we've covered
several risk born accessories since
pebble reinvigorated the space last year
so the fundamentals are known to us in
addition to telling the time a
SmartWatch exists mainly to allow you to
keep your phone in your pocket for
longer to free up your hands for life
while still keeping you plugged into
what's going on via smart notifications
the gear live has no trouble tossing
notifications at you from hangouts to
emails to pedometer stats to all the
third-party notifications you could ask
for there's a card for it and in the new
Android wear platform the cards stack up
vertically in what's supposed to be an
intelligently arranged order buzzing
your wrist with a gentle vibration as
they arrive and you can swipe
horizontally to act on those
notifications or swipe the other way to
dismiss them all the while the gear live
is telling you the time with one of many
available watch faces on its Super
AMOLED display which is colourful and
crisp and offers an always-on mode so
you don't have to tap on it to see the
time it's not the easiest to see in
direct sunlight but it's serviceable
raising the watch illuminates the
display and perks up the Snapdragon
processor and that's where Android wears
bonuses come to the forefront when the
screen is on all you need to do to
initiate actions on the watch is speak
to it saying OK Google will activate
listening mode and you can tell the
watch to send a message ask what's on
your agenda take a memo even translate
words into other languages you can also
dictate replies to messages you've
received and launch apps third-party
titles are limited to just a handful at
the moment but by and large they're very
well polished and they offer a lot of
hope for the future of this ecosystem
from flash cards to ordering food to
summoning a taxi
there's simple and powerful stuff here
and that's all just from the launch
developers the maps plug-in is also
impressive letting you navigate from
your wrist and you can also control
media you're listening to from songs to
podcasts to the FM radio there's no
shortage of raw capability here
unfortunately that capability comes at a
cost in quality not in terms of the
hardware we actually quite like the gear
lives subtle but classy silver styling
and it's reassuring weight on the wrist
and even the much criticized changeable
wrist band works well for us
exercise buffs will also appreciate its
heart rate sensor and water-resistant
housing the shortcomings are mainly in
software where Android wears first
generation routes become apparent some
of it is easy to look past the card
based interface takes some getting used
to the pedometer is too generous and
Google now still doesn't understand some
commands which should be elementary
what's the battery level
but others are more serious the voice
prompt forces you to rush through your
inputs not even giving you enough time
to think before it's dispatching a
message sorry
period shooting watch footage period now
see you got to wait longer so I can
finish some sentence shooting G
watch footage period we'll take a second
to get in now you got it you gotta let
me think what voice dictation on an
Android phone
gives you plenty of time so we're not
sure why Google felt the need to build
in a shorter window on the watch in
addition to that sometimes SMS messages
just don't send there are other
usability problems too cards appear in
no particular order changing positions
often and if you clear one it's not
always easy to get it back also if you
want to access a third-party application
manually you need to scroll through
literally every other option it's like
Google intentionally buried the manual
app list to get you to talk to the watch
but it's not always convenient or
appropriate to talk to your watch
thankfully there's already a third-party
app to address this which works well and
also bodes well for future community
sourced patches maybe one of them will
allow users to better leverage the long
press on the side button which right now
only functions as a shortcut to settings
and hopefully one comes along to solve
the problem of the watch waking up when
it's not supposed to the only real
hardware deficiencies are a tendency
toward image retention or burn in on the
AMOLED display and also something you
can hopefully avoid by being extra
cautious the gear lives charging cradle
is reportedly pretty fragile which
becomes even more critical when you
consider that you'll be charging it at
least once every two days and more
probably every single night even if
you're good at putting the screen to
sleep with the palm gesture and even if
you disable the always-on clock the gear
live sucks down a lot of battery every
day 7 days of testing the gear live with
several Android smartphones has us
convinced of a few things it's
attractive and Kay
but not so pretty or powerful as to
overcome Android where's handicaps like
most smartwatches the notifications it
brings do add convenience but the
additional features Google tries to
deliver are either inconsistent or
teases that redirect you to the phone
even when that's not really necessary if
the gear live brought the beauty and
novelty of other forthcoming Android
wear devices we probably give it some
more slack but as is this is basically a
more attractive gear to powered by an
undercooked platform geeks will love it
and we expect it to quickly improve over
time
watch out for the after the buzz on this
one but for now the Samsung gear live is
hardly a must buy accessory see our full
Android wear review later this week at
PocketNow and our Android wear vs.
pebble and G watch versus gear live

more wearable coverage from pocket now
most importantly thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
