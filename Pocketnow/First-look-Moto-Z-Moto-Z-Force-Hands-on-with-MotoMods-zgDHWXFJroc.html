phone release from motorola whatever
devices might have been in the pipeline
during Google's ownership of moto the
new Moto Z and Z fours look like the
first real smart phones born under
Lenovo's guidance starting with the Moto
Z hardware this thing is shockingly thin
Lenovo claims this is the world's
thinnest premium smartphone we're
inclined to believe them because this
manages to make a galaxy s7 feel shapely
though this does mean we walked back
from the current trend of larger
batteries and phones closer to last
year's galaxy s6 at 2600 milliamp hour
sell of both phones are packing 5.5 inch
quad HD AMOLED displays pushing this
near phablet territory we were in dim
lighting so this looked like a rich
vibrant and colorful screen we get a
fingerprint sensor under the display
this caused a bit of confusion while
handling dizzy is it doesn't seem to
function as a home but we still have on
screen navigation controls I can't
personally say these hardware buttons
deliver a great first impression the
thinness of this phone combined with the
even spacing and small button size makes
these feel fiddly and there's not a lot
of tactile delineation on first use
likely an area where you'll build a
little muscle memory while using the
phone the top of the phone has a pin
tool door for the sim and SD card tray
and the bottom of the phone delivers a
USB type-c connector
did you notice a missing jack neither
the Z or Z force will have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack beating Apple
to the streamlining punch motor will
include an adapter dongle but it looks
like it's time to start moving to USB C
or Bluetooth headphones the rear of the
Z holds a 13 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization dual LED
flash and laser assist focus the camera
app is nicely refined this is
pre-release software but we get all the
standards like UHD video 60 frames per
second 1080p and at least 120 frames per
second 720p slow motion now the Z force
is nearly identical to the Z though it
is a bit thicker the main design
difference is this edge running around
the sides of the device we had a little
chunk to build in a much tougher screen
utilizing the modo shatter shield tech
found in the Droid turbo - we asked to
bump up to a 3500 milliamp hour battery
and a 21 megapixel camera sensor these
phones are pretty similar in terms of
design is they both need to use these
six
kingpins on the back bottom edge that's
how we get to them moto mods and the
best step forward in making modular
phone hardware a consumer solution a
little magnetic click engages new
hardware without any rebooting or
pulling the battery in our phone usage
isn't interrupted when pulling a mod off
we got to check out some of the backs
which will be available when the phone's
launch later this year JBL speaker back
has its own battery to provide playback
which won't tax her phone and the boost
in audio power was significant even on
the business show floor
and we get that in our brains whenever a
message like hold reply arrives we're
also seeing research suggesting that
lenovo has incorporated projectors on
yoga tablets and now you can slap one
onto the back of your phone capable of
projecting up to a 70 inch image on a
wall or ceiling with a hinged kickstand
to help land the perfect angle and true
to Motorola's roots we'll have plenty of
options to customize the backs on moto
Z's with a mix of different materials
and colors and there will be some slick
options for extending battery life from
to me and incipio with Kate Spade we're
already seeing rumblings from other
third-party developers for future mods
with easily accessible standards and
developer kits from Motorola but only a
few teases on what moto might do for
camera hardware I really want to try
that laser keyboard though it's a bold
move from Motorola covering the basics
dropping an older Jack in pushing the
boundaries on how we might customise our
phones for our own specific uses we'll
definitely be taking a closer look at
the Moto Z Z force and the Moto mods
when they drop later this year in
September as always thanks so much for

thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
