phone release from Motorola whatever
devices might have been in the pipeline
during Google's ownership of moto the
new Moto Z and Z fours look like the
first real smartphones born under
Lenovo's guidance starting with the Moto
Z hardware this thing is shockingly thin
lenovo claims this is the world's
thinnest premium smartphone we're
inclined to believe them because this
manages to make a galaxy s7 feel shapely
though this does mean we walk back from
the current trend of larger batteries
and phones closer to last year's Galaxy
s6 at 2600 milliamp hour south of both
phones are packing 5.5 inch quad HD
AMOLED displays pushing this near
phablet territory we were in dim
lighting so this looked like a rich
vibrant and colorful screen we get a
fingerprint sensor under the display
this caused a bit of confusion while
handling dizzy is it doesn't seem to
function as a home but we still have
on-screen navigation controls I can't
personally say these hardware buttons
deliver a great first impression the
thinness of this phone combined with the
even spacing and small button size makes
these feel fiddly and there's not a lot
of tactile delineation on first use
likely an area where you'll build a
little muscle memory while using the
phone the top of the phone has a pin
tool door for the sim and SD card tray
and the bottom of the phone delivers a
USB type-c connector did you notice a
missing Jack neither the Z or Z Force
will have a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack beating Apple to the streamlining
punch moto will include an adapter
dongle but it looks like it's time to
start moving to us bc or bluetooth
headphones the rear of the z hold the 13
megapixel camera with optical image
stabilization dual LED flash and laser
assist focus the camera app is nicely
refined this is pre-release software but
we get all the standards like you HD
video 60 frames per second 1080p and at
least 120 frames per second 720p slow
motion now the Z force is nearly
identical to the Z though it is a bit
thicker the main design difference is
this edge running around the sides of
the device we had a little chunk to
build in a much tougher screen utilizing
the moto shatter shield tech found in
the droid turbo 2 we also bump up to a
3,500 milliamp hour battery and a 21
megapixel camera sensor these phones are
pretty similar in terms of design is
they both need to use these six
kingpins on the back bottom edge that's
how we get to the Moto mods and the best
step forward in making modular phone
hardware a consumer solution a little
magnetic click engages new hardware
without any rebooting or pulling the
battery in her phone usage isn't
interrupted when pulling a mod off we
got to check out some of the backs which
will be available when the phone's
launch later this year JBL speaker back
has its own battery to provide playback
which won't tax her phone and the boost
and audio power was significant even on
the busy show floor
we get that dope in our brains whenever
a message like overfly arrives we're
also seeing research suggesting that
lenovo has incorporated projectors on
yoga tablets and now you can slap one on
to the back of your phone capable of
projecting up to a 70 inch image on a
wall or ceiling with a hinged kickstand
to help land the perfect angle and true
to motorola's roots will have plenty of
options to customize the backs on moto
Z's with a mix of different materials
and colors and there will be some slick
options for extending battery life from
to me and incipio with kate spade we're
already seeing rumblings from other
third-party developers for future mods
with easily accessible standards and
developer kits from Motorola but only a
few teases on what moto might do for
camera hardware I really want to try
that laser keyboard though it's a bold
move from Motorola covering the basics
dropping an older Jack and pushing the
boundaries on how we might customize our
phones for our own specific uses will
definitely be taking a closer look at
the Moto Z Z Force and the Moto mods
when they drop later this year in
September as always thanks so much for
