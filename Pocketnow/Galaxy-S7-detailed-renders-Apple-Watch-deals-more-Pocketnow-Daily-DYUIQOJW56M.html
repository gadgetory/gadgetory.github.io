variants and design details the number
is still well into smartphones as it now
teases a launch for mwc and the Apple
watch just continues to get cheaper by
the week I'm hi Mary vera and if you're
seeing memes on Twitter about me
complaining about mondays they're right
on this is out daily there's
probably no better time to buy an Apple
watch it also no worse time we're
expecting a refresh to happen in March
but there is no guarantee that we'll
also get a launch in March it could
happen that will get it until later this
year and if that's the case then you
probably want to buy one right now best
buy now has it a hundred dollars off in
addition to B&amp;amp;H photo and best buy is
actually continuing on with these deals
all variants are pretty much included
except the Gulf ones obviously links in
the description for more details and if
you were thinking that Lumias were going
to die alone it could still happen but
we notice a job listing from Microsoft
looking for an employee to work closely
with HTC aren't building hardware this
could mean another HTC one m7 for
Windows probably the m10 and we're also
hearing that the HP Falcon has a also
changed its name apparently it's going
to be called the elite 3x meaning it
could still happen at some point another
company we thought was going to die into
Motorola when it came to mobile is
Lenovo and it's actually the other way
around the company is already teasing a
phone that it considers to be gorgeous
from WC 2016 we will be happy event
covering everything the problem is that
some leaked specifications don't really
claim a high-end phone it seems that
we're getting closer to more of a
mid-ranger to a low-end phoned but hey
stay tuned we will be there and speaking
of another major player that will be at
mwc Samsung oh my god the company has
finally launched marshmallow for the
galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge just a few
days before the Galaxy s7 just to make
people happy the company has done
terribly when it comes to software
updates this and pretty much every year
but yeah the galaxy s6 globally is
getting it up next the galaxy note 5 and
galaxy s6 edge+ but it comes to carrier
variants oh my god it could just not get
any worse
or it could we never know what Samsung
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with Samsung again the Galaxy
s7 this time because we are finally
looking at leaked renders that are high
resolution we get more detail on what to
expect with these phones not just
necessarily in design but also in color
options in the past we only saw the
black variants now we also see that the
gold and silver titanium are also making
the cut and we see it in both the Galaxy
s7 and galaxy s7 edge all phones
gorgeous obviously but hey at least us
to today's question if you had to pick
out of these three colors which one
would you choose in my case I'm going
for the gold option i loved it on the
Galaxy s6 edge+ but then again if they
came with something like Ferrari red I
definitely go for it leave us a comment
