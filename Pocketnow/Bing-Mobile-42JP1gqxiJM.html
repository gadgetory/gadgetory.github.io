and today i'm going to show you bein
mobile which is the updated version of
windows mobile live search and if you've
used the internet recently you know
about being and it's a new search engine
by microsoft and it's pretty similar to
the windows mobile live search and we're
just going to go into some of the
features so you can see the categories
go to that so you can select different
categories if you want to search for
something nearby there's a cancel mean
view the map so we can see where we are
as you can see it loads pretty fast we
can close this and get directions
driving direction so we can either pick
our GPS location or we can pick from a
list of other locations that we have
predetermined in our in our thing or we
can also add a new location and for n
location we can also select a new
location or one of our predetermined
locations you don't see a traffic
information and just as it will update
every two minutes so i'll show you
traffic information for your area and
the black is the worst traffic red is
more severe yellow is mildly severe and
green is clear so we'll just close this
again and get movie information so we
want to search for movies in our areas
we can also search for movies or we can
select by theater so if we know we want
to go to a specific theater we can pick
that and view the movies that are on
there so the orange look at the movies
that are playing and as you can see
transformers just came out so we can go
back it will also show you a location on
the map if you want to see where that
movie theater is
you can also get gas prices within the
vicinity of our area so we want to check
for gas prices and see which one is the
left least expensive and it's saying
that safeway foods is the least
expensive at two dollars and sixty cents
a gallon just close this it can also you
can also go to collections and this is
just different news web pages that's
within the vicinity so if we wanted to
look for our BBC world news it's
probably nothing too close to my area
but as you can see it shows that the
closest related article is 2312 miles so
that's pretty far just close that you
can also go to the web which will launch
the internet browser and we can get
weather information and right now it
says it's 70 degrees Fahrenheit where I
live so that's pretty nice it's pretty
good weather out there we can also go to
the map and get some other settings so
if we want to track myself so if i
wanted to track myself using gps i can
do that I can locate myself which will
go through the cell phone towers or
through GPS and I can zoom in to our
zoom out and I can also view aerial
which is like a satellite view or I can
also view the birds eye which is pretty
neat it's pretty good feature and it
shows you a more detailed view of your
location which is a pretty good feature
so so this is being mobile the update to
live search for windows mobile devices I
will post a link of pocketnow.com as to
how to get this and the program is free
