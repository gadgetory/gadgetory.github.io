Paco calm and this is the unboxing of
the motorola cliq 2 on t-mobile's
network so this device is running
android 2.2 and it has a very unique
keyboard so let's get to it so start by
cutting open this mailer here see this
fedex naylor cloth the box okay so we
have the device on the front it says
motorola cliq 2 with motoblur let's see
on the side we have tmobile on this side
we so what's inside looks like we have a
hands-free headsets that's kind of cool
and go to this side shows a tamper
sticker here and we also have some
information on the back 1 gigahertz
processor 5 megapixel camera and access
to android market so we'll just open up
the box and i'll zoom in a little bit
okay so it looks is that we might have
gotten a previously reviewed unit from
t-mo also i just take out the device let
that decide so nothing comes in this box
as you can see all we have is the micro
USB sync charge cable and a wall charger
so that's all we don't even have any
information on the bottom except for
reading me first but it does say on the
box that you will get headphones as well
as a micro SD card and all that great
reading material so i'll take a look at
the phone here zoom in a little tiny bit
okay so we have this nice screen which
is pretty good to take it's a 3.7 inch
LCD capacitive multi-touch of course and
it goes almost all the way to the edges
of the bezel which is a great feature to
have on newer phones we also have this
really cool hexagon shaped kind of like
a honeycomb keyboard and you know what
it feels pretty good to type on i'm
going to have to try this out and see
how great it is if we pop off the
battery cover let's see how to do this I
have a little fingernail slipped on the
bottom it comes with a 2 gigabyte
microSD card let's see what the battery
size is a 1390 milliamp hour battery so
that's pretty good size I think that's
the same that was on the motorola Bravo
so if compared the cliq to a couple of
other devices we have the motorola Bravo
right here and the priest
or devices this one does have a 1
gigahertz processor well this one has
800 the screen size is the same most of
the hardware is the same we also have a
search button here it's missing on the
motorola Bravo of course we do have the
full qwerty keyboard which does make it
a little bit thicker than the motorola
Bravo we also have a samsung focus here
of course the screen is a little bit
bigger and just as a size comparison and
one more device here we got the nexus
one same size screen of course this is
the amal that this LCD a little bit
thicker than the nexus one so stay tuned
for the hardware tour coming up next and
the software to our following that and
if you like our videos make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below we like to hear
you're saying and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
