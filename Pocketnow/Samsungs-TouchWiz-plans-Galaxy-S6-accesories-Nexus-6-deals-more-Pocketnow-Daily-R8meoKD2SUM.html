accessories to come with the galaxy s6
LG bring some extra clarification on the
Snapdragon 810 processor and if you want
the google nexus 6 t-mobile is probably
the best way to go right now
I'm Jaime Rivera and excuse me if I
begin celebrating Friday early that
means later today this is PocketNow
daily let's begin today with what's
official as some of us have given up on
getting the Nexus 6 mainly because of
how bad it's been for Google to have
enough stock of the unit but if you're
still interested in getting the phone
t-mobile is probably the best way to go
right now the company is offering a full
discount of 48 bucks if that check out
online you type Nexus 6 deal as the
promotion deal yeah 48 bucks that's
pretty much a 10% discount it's a really
good deal so links to the scripture for
full details on how to get it another
official news Microsoft is just showing
off how quickly it can take acquisition
seriously the company acquired accompli
a few weeks ago and now they're already
offering an update to its Outlook email
client and yeah you get all the swiping
and all the features that you got with a
complete like mailbox you can pretty
much a defer a male's for later or for a
specific purpose and its really cool
went into the description give it a try
also about LG if you remember the
company pretty much ditched to Samsung's
claims that the snapdragon 810 processor
would heat up and well the company is
taking it back now and it's a conference
call for quarter results and yes they
had a good time and a quarter results
but the company confirms that yes it is
true that the snapdragon 810 processor
was heating on its initial units and
that eventually while configured about
so yeah Samsung was not lying and it's
sad to see that this processor may not
make it to the galaxy s6 but then again
the G flex 2 is out there and it
performed really good when we tested it
and speaking of Samsung and some very
interesting galaxy s6 rumors it seems
that we are getting another year VR
headset for the Galaxy s6 and galaxy s6
edge and the reason why this is
interesting is particularly because the
gear VR already supports the galaxy s5
and no three and four so
could it be that the changes in design
of the galaxy s6 are so significant that
Samsung needs to launch another VR
headset that's compatible with it
this is extremely interesting let's see
what we get hopefully at MWC and
probably for the very interesting news
of the day believe it or not the rumors
are that the way Samsung is going to
make things great with TouchWiz is
actually dismembering the whole system
and let me explain that for example a
lot of Google applications like the
camera and other services have become
will play applications that can be
updated at any time not requiring an OS
upgrade and really what Samsung is
planning to do apparently is launch the
galaxy s6 bare-bones
with just the basic TouchWiz but none of
the bloat that we currently see with all
the sensor thing and all the hovering
stuff Carolee that's not gonna make it
to the initial launch of the galaxy s6
but you do have the option of installing
these applications this is pretty much
one of the things that we've wished for
the longest time that all these things
were optional and not bundled in and it
leads me to the question of the day
would you like a TouchWiz that looks the
way it does but offers you the option to
install only what you want it's a ham
because in my particular case yes well
mine the way TouchWiz looks I really
just wanted to work well it was a
comment down below what's your case
