talks jellybean for their current
devices and the new motorola droids hit
retail i'm high metal ivetta wondering
what the Nexus 20 will look like and
this is parking out daily get this some
of the spec information was leaked for
the google nexus 10 which will probably
be being by samsung and some photography
information apparently the screen will
be a whopping 2560 by 1600 which would
give it a 299 pixel per inch density
that's a first in a tablet of that size
and even though the X of information can
be faked we've also got more rumors of a
32 gigabyte Nexus 7 coming so you know
where October 29th is headed speaking of
Nexus devices we've got good and bad
news report on the good side we've got
leaked images of the backplate being
removed off the LG Nexus 4 and we've got
a twenty one hundred million power and
non user replaceable battery but the
good news here is the fact that we've
got an eight megapixel camera which will
be an improvement when compared to the
current 5 megapixel on the Galaxy Nexus
the problem is that the Galaxy Nexus is
now being considered end of life as a
product and that's what Bell Canada is
reporting as of today so if you're
planning on getting a nexus device
surely the Galaxy NX is a cheap right
now but hold your horses for the 29 now
if you're interested in either the
motorola droid razr HD or droid razr HD
max with all that mouthful of a name
that is verizon is already offering them
on retail starting for 200 bucks or
three hundred dollars respectively if
you're still on the ropes trying to
decide if these devices are for you to
come in for a two-year contract our
review units are already on their way so
stay tuned now you've been thinking
about buying an ipad right now our
advice to you is hold it first of all
you already know that october twenty
thirds event is about an iPad Mini or at
least we assume but apparently the ipad
2 will be discontinued on this event so
the rumors are that the current
generation new ipad will also be
discontinued and replaced for a new or
ipad that will have improvements over
all the flaws that the current
generation new ipad has and I'm already
confused right now but stick with me
apparently the ipad mini will become the
budget model so again hold it will most
probably have
something much better being released on
october twenty third and we'll be
covering everything anyways and finally
for the disappointing news of the day
sony has just announced their plans for
upgrading their current smartphone
lineup to android 4.1 jellybean get this
if you're currently holding a 2011 so
any smartphone forget it you're off the
list and if you're holding a 2012 sony
smartphone and some of them haven't even
been released yet you're gonna have to
wait till 2013 sometime within twenty
thirteen and after my experience with
the Sony Xperia S trust me that's
terrible so that leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about Sony's terrible performance and
software upgrades I seriously have no
faith in them but leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on pocketnow.com
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm high never be
better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
