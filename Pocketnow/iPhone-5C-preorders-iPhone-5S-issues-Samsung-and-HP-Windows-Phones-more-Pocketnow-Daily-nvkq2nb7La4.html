5c while the 5s has some constraints
rumors of Samsung building yet another
Windows Phone emerged and speaking of
Windows Phone apparently HP wants to
build one as well I'm hi Mary vana and
I'll refrain from all these Friday and
beard jokes just for you all to miss
them for next week this is walking out
daily let's are they off with the wait
what news of the day insiders from the
New York Times have recently interviewed
people after this whole change with
Microsoft buying Nokia and as it turns
out these people have revealed that the
company tested Android Lumias way before
they made the deal with Microsoft so as
it turns out you could have had an
Android lumia 1020 right now and not a
nokia lumia 1020 running Windows Phone 8
but sadly that is history it's not going
to happen anymore as Microsoft bought
the company but leave us a comment down
below with that have been a good phone
you would have been waiting for or will
you just like the Lumia 1020 with
Windows Phone 8 and believe it or not
next up we're gonna talk about HP and
yeah we're talking about that company
that totally killed a compaq ipaq whole
lineup and that's the same company that
bought palm only to kill it and then
destroy webos in sylhet LG for TVs that
is exactly that same company that is now
rumored to be working on a smartphone
and apparently they've been working on
this for a while apparently the device
is going to be running Windows Phone
which is kind of odd judging by the fact
that we've got a couple of tablets from
HP that run Android so this is just to
give you an idea of the disparity of
this company owning their own operating
system was actually a good operating
system and ditching it for something
different leave us a comment down below
would you be interested in the HP
windows film I had a lot of windows
mobile phones from HP and sadly that was
history now an interesting surprise we
thought that Samsung was pretty much
done with launching phones right now but
we've got one reaching the FCC and
apparently this is a Windows Phone and
this could be nice because apparently
it's going to be an AT&amp;amp;T device but as
we dig into the specifications that we
see a Snapdragon 400 processor here
along with some other things that make
this phone resemble the Samsung atty
best neo from sprint oh man buyers
beware this phone came out terrible in
our review links to the description for
that
so let's see what we get it this is
another atty vest Neil don't buy now
let's talk about hcc one of the most
anticipated devices that we did not get
an ephah in berlin was the HTC phablet
aka HTC One max it's still hard to know
why the company did not launch this
device at that event since that is
pretty much the phablet event of the
year as the Galaxy Note 3 was launched
there in the 2 and the 1 but well it
seems that probably HTC is still testing
the waters we've got some leaked
photographs of the phone being compared
against the HTC One and we do see that
little portion at the bottom of the
camera that could be a fingerprint
scanner that we still don't know if
that's going to be it now there's no
denying that the pictures show that this
bone is just enormous it is gigantic so
it's really hard to see why HTC is
building up on this big unless its
software makes or takes total advantage
of it so let's see what we get and
finally for the hot news of the day
those of you that way ting for the new
iPhones well pre-orders have just begun
for the iphone 5c in not the iphone 5s
which is kind of interesting we're
wondering why we have to wait until we
can pick the phone up on a 20 in with
the 5c and not have pre-orders for the
5s that's actually a new thing that had
happened before but anyways apparently
it seems that the companies that
manufacture the 5s are having trouble
with that fingerprint scanner apparently
they won't be able to meet the man links
in the description for the full drama of
everything that's going on but yeah you
can get the 5c as it turns out
apparently the only model that has sold
out on the first day is the yellow model
which is interesting since we're not
expecting for the 5c to be much of a hit
but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day did you pre-order
the iphone 5c or are you interested in
this phone or are you waiting for the 5s
in my particular case honestly for a
hundred dollars and for all the added
features of the 5s I'd rather wait for
the 5s but leave us a comment down below
