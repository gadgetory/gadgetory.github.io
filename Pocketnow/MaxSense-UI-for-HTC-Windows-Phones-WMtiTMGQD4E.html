pocket now calm and today we're excited
to show you a new windows mobile user
interface called Mac sense now over the
past few months we've been keeping you
updated with cookies Home tab which
modifies HTC sense 2.5 with some much
needed enhancement but overall it still
looks like sense 2.5 well max ycy from
XDA Developers has decided to tear down
the sense interface and rebuild it with
a completely new design he's also thrown
in a bunch of new features and the
result is mighty impressive I believe
he's created a monster and I mean that
in a positive way let's check it out
okay so at first glance you can already
see this is going to be a totally new
Sense experience let me give you a
rundown of what we're looking at here
starting from the top we have a taskbar
replacement and obviously there are a
ton of icons up there so we'll start at
the left where we have a windows flag
this will pull up your traditional
Windows Mobile's start menu the next
item will pull down this drop-down menu
and this one is for tasks the next one
allows you to toggle airplane mode this
one will allows you to turn bluetooth on
or off and access some settings same
with Wi-Fi network settings signal
strength info disconnect data and here
we can switch the different sound
profiles so we have silent vibrate and
automatic and when it's on one of these
other modes you'll have an option for
normal battery info battery backlight
adjustment and battery power settings
and here we have some time options so
you might be concerned with a how
cramped the taskbar is and how
finger-friendly that can be well I can
assure you that Max has figured out a
way to easily use your finger and switch
between all these items I'm pretty
surprised I
go to any item I want to without any
miss it's it's pretty nice so if we tap
the active icon we can exit out of there
and at the very right we have our
shortcut for task manager so below the
task bar we have some widgets here we
have a clock clock widget and next to
that we have a weather widget so if we
tap on that it will actually take us to
the sense 2.5 weather tab so we're
starting to see some sense integration
into the user interface here so we have
our soft keys which are the same soft
keys but obviously done up a little bit
and if we tap on this home icon it'll
take us back to the home screen as you
can see the weather animates over there
below those widgets we have some program
shortcuts that I've set and below those
we have a notification bar so as you can
see I have some emails that I haven't
checked yet so this little window over
here pops up and lets me know that I
have something waiting and if you switch
between the different categories you can
actually see the the last SMS or the
last call or your last email in this
window so I'm going to click out of
there and now when we tap on those same
icons it takes us directly to their
respective sense 2.5 tabs so a nice
touch and here we have our SMS tab and
right here call history tab and this is
the the default home screen but as you
can see by these little indicator dots
there are actually two more home screens
of widgets so that's pretty nice and you
can see that we can navigate easily
between these screens and it's quick and
responsive which is great because this
is a touch pro 2 and it has an aging 528
megahertz processor so it shows that you
really don't need a powerful device like
an hd2 to run this interface so let's go
back to the first screen and check out
the
the widgets here we have a slide clock
and it's called that because it has sort
of a slot machine effect as you saw
right there when the digits change under
that we have a music player I'll press
play play some Metallica okay and next
to that we have another program shortcut
so i'll go ahead and assign it to a
program just to demonstrate how easy it
is I'll go with Facebook okay and down
here this is an interesting widget
because it actually takes your favorite
contacts from your people tab and
consolidates it into one simple widget
so we can just swipe up and down and we
can check out all of our favorite people
so pretty cool and if you tap and hold
for a second it'll pull up the contacts
card next to that we have some
communications widgets we have Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and airplane mode moving on to
the last screen we have another digital
clock over here internet search bar for
googling keywords and under that we have
an appointments widget as you can see
you can either collapse or expand the
appointments and this can look up to a
week or more in advance so pretty handy
and in the settings yes you can
customize these widgets you can actually
show choose to show up to five
appointments like I said these widgets
are customizable you can rearrange them
you can move them around and remove them
or add some more but these are all the
ones that come with the first release of
this interface I'll show you a second
how you can customize the widgets but
before we do that let me actually show
you the max sense settings okay so here
we can change the color of the bottom
arrow and text color to either white
black red green blue or gray I'll stick
with white and the taskbar here's a
great setting you can actually right now
it's set to maximize but we can actually
switch to minimize which will cut down
all those icons we saw earlier and
basically just show your traditional you
know sound profiles and battery status
and stuff like that so it cuts out a lot
of the clutter and if you really want to
you can actually hide the taskbar
completely to have sort of a
clean-looking Sense experience so I'm
going to go with that you can disable
the weather animation for sense 2.5
enable auto rotation using the
accelerometer so you can get some
landscape action going enable auto lock
so when you put the phone headfirst into
your pocket it'll actually lock the
screen so we'll click done and as you
can see we don't have a task bar anymore
so it looks really clean I like that a
lot ok so moving on let's go back here
we can actually change the home
wallpaper and edit widgets so we'll go
ahead and edit widgets and now we're in
the widget editing mode so we can move
widgets around the screen sort of just
put them wherever we want to or you can
tap on them and we get a number of
options so some of them have more
options than others but this one as you
can see we can either remove the widget
or show it we can also change background
settings so if you want to have the
default sort of semi-transparent squared
off background sitting behind the widget
you can have that you can hide that
background or you can set a custom
background which allows you to set a
picture to rest behind the widget which
is pretty cool we can change the text
color here's one that I like you can
resize the widget so if you don't want
to have a widget that's too small or too
large you can resize it here and it
really allows you to cater your widgets
and their sizes according to the amount
of real estate screen real estate that
you have available so that
cool we can change the layout this
weather widget has three different
layout choices original graphics we can
have that checked or if we uncheck it
will have some custom graphics I'm going
to go ahead and uncheck it and we can
choose to hide the temperature or show
the temperature again many of the
widgets have different settings and I
don't have enough time to show you all
of them so I'll just go ahead and
reconfigure all the widgets and come
back to you in a second and show you a
different look to some of these widgets
and we're back and we're still in the
widget editing mode but let me just show
you before we finalize it that you can
add widgets by going here and here we
have five different categories clocks
alerts quick links communication and
others we've already showed you all of
them but that's how you would add some
more widgets and let's just finalize it
so now you see I have a different look
here I increase the digital clock i
added a background behind the weather
and also change the graphics that it
uses i didn't change the missed calls
and SMS widgets because i wanted to show
you that you can actually have a
different layout here as you can see
with this email which it's sort of a
longer bar and when you press the plus
sign you can see the latest email also i
remove the text from these programs
shortcuts so pretty cool over here you
can see i put a custom background behind
the slide clock I made the music player
a little smaller increase the sizes of
the communications widgets and also made
the favorite contacts widget much larger
alright so let's go to the last one I
change the analog clock to a different
style there's a third style as well but
i'm not going to show you that in this
video i also changed the color of text
for the search widget and the appts
widget like i said before you can change
these to a multitude of colors to make
it more personal I also made these a
little smaller so those are the
widgets of max sense and how you can
customize them but that's just half the
story really for this interface and I
say that because there's a lot more here
than just the three home screens we'll
start with this star over here this
pulls up an action screen which allows
us to quickly compose an email SMS MMS
create an appointment task a note added
contact Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options
stuff like that so that's for quick
options for the power user in us oops
let's go back and here's what I was
talking about before this home icon
isn't just to get back to the home
screen if you swipe over here you
actually get shortcuts to all of your
sense 2.5 tabs all in one screen so
that's pretty cool we can go to contacts
messages email internet shortcuts as you
can see it works really fast too here's
the e-reader tab that HTC created for
the tmobile hd2 album here's the moves
music tab calendar
stocks footprints documents the Twitter
tab whether we saw earlier the custom
Facebook and calls call history tabs
created at XDA and the Settings tab so
yeah we get to use our sense tabs so if
you want to go back you can hit the home
icon and if you swipe the other way you
get 25 icons on one screen for your
quick links and if you swipe over you
get 25 more swipe over again 25 more for
a total of seventy-five so you're
probably not going to run out of
shortcut links and if you rotate your
screen as you can see landscape does
work and you'll get the screen while
you're on any of the home screens over
here but say if you're in maybe contacts
and you rotate it you'll get the Manila
tab in landscape it's pretty cool all
right before we close let me just show
you a couple things that I forgot you
can actually reorder these tabs hide
some or show the ones you want just by
tapping this little icon over here and
you get the sense homescreen tab
personalization options over here so
that's that and also for these quick
links you can move them around by
tapping and holding on anyone you can
switch them or you can remove them and
add some more so this was a first look
at the new max sense interface
unfortunately the initial release will
only be available through custom roms so
if you're not familiar with flashing
roms onto your device now may be a good
time to learn how look for soon on
devices like the touch pro two touch HD
HD two and other popular HTC windows
phones of course it all depends on who's
doing the cooking
for example this rom was packaged for a
cdma touch pro2 by big and it's called
Big Macs sense as you can see it's a
windows mobile 6.5 point X rom according
to the start bar being at the bottom and
it's been beautifully skinned and has
some pretty cool features to boot so
comment below with your thoughts let us
know if you like what you see in max
sense and if you do what you like best
about it maybe you mention what other
widgets you like to see added in the
future or maybe even comment with which
roms you'd like to see the interface
cooked into i'll post more information
on pacquiao com be sure to follow us on
twitter at twitter.com slash pocket now
tweets where we'll let you know the
exact moment when Max cents and any
updates for it are released and if you
