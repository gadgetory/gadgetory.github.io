will take much longer the launch that we
expected even after the Galaxy Note 1000
that Huawei's new foldable smartphone
might look very different and we have
the different dimensions of the Google
pixel for smartphones including camera
humps I'm Jaime Rivera and this is the
ugly face of a person that woke up
really early to record before I catch
the flight this is by now daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for more Apple
products and I promise you we're gonna
start looking for deals on other things
being H has their mega deal zone where
it will actually last for 72 hours which
means you still have up until tomorrow
to be able to take advantage they have
deals on Apple products like $500 off
the 2014 Mac Mini meaning obviously the
maxed out version or a higher tier
version of the Mac Mini and up to $1,000
off the 2018 MacBook Pros which should
bear in mind these are the ones that I
used to edit these videos so that's
great up to $700 off IMAX and 560
dollars off iPad pros once again these
are products that we use on a daily
basis for work so we're actually looking
for a replacement to a MacBook Pro from
the team so you learn more in the
description now let's talk about LG and
an important announcement of the LG v 50
think e1 by zenith they're up to speed
events there are two reasons why this
phone is important the first one being
the fact that the footprint is like the
LG be 40 so it's a smaller phone than
the samsung galaxy s 10 5g and then the
second one is the fact that this is a 5g
phone and you're only going to pay $9.99
for it only I say because you pay $1,300
for the galaxy s7 5g so those of you in
the market for a 5g phone you can learn
more about that in the description as
well now let's talk about the asou ROG
phone - the company has just teased that
we should expect a device coming very
soon very interesting change is 120
Hertz on the display which we don't
really know as if it's available on all
EDS yet 90 Hertz I think is the max and
the ROG one was the first phone to bring
that so I don't know might be an LCD but
we'll keep you posted on that Qualcomm
Snapdragon 85 up to 12 gigs of ram but
the price tag is the craziest one $635
is the past
so definitely look out for that as
gaming phones keep getting more popular
now let's move the spotlight over to the
Google pixel 4 as we've been covering
more rumors as to what to expect we know
that there are three design firms we
don't exactly know what the design is
going to be but we keep getting more
leaks and then Google finally teased at
least what to expect in the back now we
did see that there was a grill back
there for you know it looks like a stove
definitely but the thing about it is we
hear that that is going to be a
significant camera hop up to the point
where it might add an extra millimeter
in thickness in the portion where that
hump is going to be that's one of the
leaks that we have and then the second
one is screen sizes five point six to
five point eight inches diagonal on the
small variant of the pixel four and then
six point two to six point four I
believe on the larger variant stay tuned
for what to expect as obviously we're
getting closer to the future pixels and
how about if we talk about Huawei as a
yes we do know that the mate X is
delayed but we continue seeing more
patterns of what to expect for foldables
we saw that xiaomi has an outward
folding device that folds in two parts
now we see Huawei patenting this design
and obviously we can't tell you if this
is going to launch this year I doubt
it's gonna happen this year but
according to certain sources will always
consider this to be the better design
for reasons we don't understand they
even consider it to be better than the
galaxy folds so those are bold
statements if they're true
we'll see if we end up getting this and
finally the hottest news today have to
do with that Samsung Galaxy fold hold up
hold it let me interrupt a regularly
scheduled programming and I know I'm not
wearing the same shirt and how many
airports
this is the problem when you record
things early and then the news change
after you're flying across from one
country to another let me tell you what
we knew yesterday and then I'll come
back and tell you what just changed
today we've been waiting for a possible
launch we heard that it would happen end
of May then we heard June then we heard
sources claiming July now we've got
internal sources claiming no apparently
there hasn't been much progress actually
and July is definitely not going to be
the long
State according to the source the
company is reducing the gap and also
figuring out a way to make that
removable non removable screen protector
of a different material or design a
different way to be able to make this
less prone to the problems that happened
the thing about it is according to the
source we might not expect this launch
to happen until the Galaxy Note or after
they even said after the Galaxy Note
actually were not thinking that Samsung
is going to let delay it that much right
that's what we heard yesterday now as of
today Samsung's displays vice president
just came out on record to state that
the display problems of the Galaxy fold
have been ironed out but it's ready to
hit the market and that it'll grab a lot
of attention when it does so now we
still don't have a launch date but
rumors are split between July the launch
date or probably even the Galaxy Note
tens unpacked event and we have been
hearing rumors as to when that launch
they will be so back to our regularly
scheduled programming as the question of
the day remains the same
let us know in the comments down below I
mean what do you think do you think that
the samsung has shot itself in the foot
with how much it's delayed the galaxy
fold or do you think that it's a good
idea for the company to delay it because
in my case this is the third time that I
cover this I still wait for it I still
want it but I still consider this to be
a problem the more they delay it because
of the expectation that was generated
this is just me obviously what we'd love
to know what you think in the comments
down below

news earlier follow us I'm talking about
