you review the hangout series from
pocket now where we let you the
listeners viewers and readers of pocket
now ask us questions and give us your
opinion about the hottest and newest
devices on the market today's device
Samsung's 2013 flagship the galaxy s4
I'm Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and my co-host today is
senior editor taylor martin taylor how's
it going everyone uh how are you yeah
I'm great I got coffee and tea over here
so I'm wonderful good we have uh I have
a couple notes to get out of the way
initially here first I want to talk
about the show's format in a second but
everyone in the chat who was here before
the countdown ended already is aware of
this when it comes to google hangouts i
am something of a geriatric i have no
idea i had no idea what i was doing
until very recently so i apologize in
advance if this is a bumpy show secondly
i want to welcome a bunch of veterans
from pocket now live the show that
spawned this series and a bunch of
listeners of the pocket not weekly as
well old friends very nice to see you
down below everyone everyone knew very
nice to you as well the format of this
show is is kind of a little bit
different we did this a little bit on
the pocket now live last week as kind of
a prototype but basically this is your
chance readers listeners viewers to ask
us questions about a device that we have
in that most of the world doesn't the
galaxy s4 has been released so this is a
little bit of a late roll out of the you
review but so this is your chance to
just basically ask us anything and and
and make us be your monkey with these
devices that you may not have yet so the
devices we have on the air today are the
GTI 9500 international version of the
galaxy s4 as well as to sprint version
to the galaxy s4 they SP hl7 20 they're
all in midnight black I couldn't get a
white one and I'm sorry and if it makes
you feel better i have a white galaxy s3
and they're practically the same thing
so
zing a good point so i won one final
note before we jump into reader time
this is gonna be like an hour-long show
we're going to try and not go over time
we always say that but we'll see how
successful we are everyone is gonna have
a five minute block if I can get well
right now I'm hogging the floor so it's
ok you get some hogging time later
you're putting in your time now but
everyone gets about five minutes and
then we do have to ask you to clear the
the room for somebody else to come in so
long time folks new folks if we if we
address you right afterwards we'll just
ask you to sign out this will be
familiar to a lot of people but Taylor
anything you want to cover that I forgot
before we get started an episode I'm on
the interview yes a little disclaimer I
do not have a galaxy s4 yeah I have not
used one so all of my questions or any
questions directed towards me are kind
of uh well to eat I don't you're an
expert you're not have an expert yeah
sure and I've got a one so i can i can
counter it with that right as an agency
one actually until you make a really
good point i also have a bunch of other
devices at the ready for this so if you
want an on-the-fly comparison readers
you want something like that let us know
if we can do it for you on air will do
it as we said on the weekly a couple
days ago we're not going to be dropping
these and beer or anything we're not
gonna be testing these units to
destruction actually all these do have
to go back or and one of them us to go
to Aunt Tandy naudia in romania so how
does it stand up against a camera
somebody love that in the comments Oh
stupid I love that show all right what's
up Taylor I as co-host I'm going to
delegate some responsibility to you and
that is going to be to select our first
guest ever on the pocket now you review
please right I'm gonna have to go with
Greg Gibbons because I have never seen
him on a live show before he may have
been here I wasn't but I've never seen
you so welcome you'll have to unmute
your side guys can you hear me hear you
yes we can hear you Greg welcome to
little pocket now you review how are you
hi yeah i have a HTC One awesome as
congratulations on your recent purchase
how do you like it so far
it's best fun I've ever had I concur
yeah it's um we try we tried I think not
to let the what the pocket now live that
was focused on the galaxy s4 get to one
centric but here we can do absolutely
anything so um but that's that aside
deep would you have considered the
galaxy s4 at all was it always the one
for you Greg I would have gone with the
s4 am I'm not biased towards any kind of
manufacture but I I have a question for
you please on a lot of sight you see
comparing speeds or phones and that and
it's like half a second between one and
another I think we're spoiled now we're
with the way phones are running out
there is no slow phone that you can buy
especially high end and that is a very
very good point Greg you're absolutely
right and continue I don't mean to
interrupt you do you think it you just
think we're spoiled just say Tom could a
half a second between how long it takes
a web page to upload uh yeah I do Greg I
so pocket now has been doing comparisons
for a long time and when I came on board
I mean it pucking I had been doing
embarrassing videos for years but
Brandon there's a good example this he
loves the the comparison videos where
you take two phones side by side and we
tap the apps at the same time on the
east of ice and see which one loads
first and we often have this
philosophical discussion where Brandon
finds that to be exceedingly useful and
will make buying decisions personal
buying decisions based on it and I'm
like I do not care i mean you know I'm a
child of webos so I i I've waited
seconds minutes perhaps to load some
time you know blackberry rebooted
battery pool tennis later you can
actually use it again exactly okay yeah
yeah i agree i mean it would tell are
you uh are you in the same same boat on
that I mean do you think that we've
become spoiled and we're looking for
micro seconds to to make a difference
here yeah really new yeah i mean i used
the the HTC first and i did to compare
someone with the nexus 4 and literally
the difference between them using them
opening apps doing anything there was a
split second difference
everything they did and that's the
difference between the s4 pro the 1.5
gigahertz s4 pro and the 1.4 gigahertz
Snapdragon 400 and it's just the
slightest little miniature little tiny
little difference but using them
side-by-side and everything it's fine
but the the thing that I've I guess
considered or something that's hit me
recently was what were you doing I'm
just I'm just being an animated
wallpaper broke okay so i went from the
first i think it was back to the galaxy
note 2 and granted that was a huge
switch from size but going back to the
galaxy note 2 it felt a little slow and
clunky and I figure able to discern that
that minut change in performance yeah
and I think it's more TouchWiz than
actual all right hardware and
specification fits its TouchWiz but just
that slight little thing and going back
to an older device the 1x I come back to
it and I'm just like oh my gosh I want
to pull my hair out so but it is
concerning a little bit right and i
wondered Greg if this is why you brought
the question up because the galaxy s4 is
is a brand new device it's supposed to
be the headliner the big you know
monster especially the dr coeur one
where they're kind of boasting about how
much power it has its is it Greg what
does it concern you to see any kind of
stutter in there or are you a more
forgiving guy I bit more forgiving of it
and i really think people are really
really picky when it comes to these six
so i mean it's a slight little second
it's a slight little stutter it's not
gonna matter yeah everything is a little
extra in in reward performance the video
i posted yesterday the the modification
for the HTC one I opened up the facebook
app in the middle of the video right so
I open it up and I'm scrolling and
Facebook legs it doesn't matter what you
opened it on if you have an Android
device and you open facebook it lags
right and the compliments were like oh
my god this phone lags why does this
phone lag it's it's one of the best
phones why is this phone laggy yeah I'm
like it's Facebook like the occasional
the occasional stutter will get
transmuted often in the comments into
laggy this is
not the galaxy s4 is not a laggy device
but when you when you pop hop out of
apps back to the home screen like you
know you're in whatever Twitter it's not
going to do it now because of the demo
gods they're jerks but you know you
press the home button and the animation
instead of being very smooth will will
stutter halfway through and Stefan and
Greg I think your point is that you're
it doesn't really impact the usability
of the device today that everyone
complains right yeah we're a little more
radical in and drill Greg I completely
agree and I think fans get maghreb but I
will say this android phones started out
for years as as frankly laggy slow
devices for the most part there were
some you know standouts there so I think
people have never done a little gun-shy
after a while you know where they were
like if they see any lag at all on a new
build because they know it's only going
to get worse from that point on so maybe
that's the source of some of it but this
is why we have after the buzz so we can
re-examine the phone after a certain
amount of time and see if it's rotted
you know you know exactly Greg I want to
make sure that we're coming to the end
of your time slot and and well Taylor
and I have done most of the talking so
this is a learning experience but Greg
before we uh were we ask you before we
move on is there anything else you
wanted to ask about the galaxy s4 or
comment on about the galaxy s4 and no
not really i leave it to other people
just one more thing you go it's gonna
hate me for this my HTC wore flip case
whoa I do not hate you at all for that I
mean I'm envious if that's what you mean
yeah no I mean that's a pretty cool does
the device know when that's when the
flip cover is open or closed no does ha
well I I mean that's what I did too if
it's nicely oh it does sit nicely I'm
sorry we're having up we're having a
flip off now hi cuz I'm in this of your
block model too or is it white with
knots this silver just clips up oh ok I
want a black one so bad mega be in the
DSM you come prefer them for the galaxy
s4 I haven't no this is you check out
I'm going to pimp my own video which is
just class lesson
but check out the video i said this is
actually a really really smart cover and
i think it is one area that the galaxy
s4 has the one kind of indisputably beat
but that's uh that is it that is a
debate for another time not i'm saying
your case still looks good though and
thank you for showing it to us and I'm
Greg thank you for stopping by before
you go can you tell everyone on the
Internet where you're where they can
reach you if if you like you don't have
to i'm on twitter it's at flaky FL tree
GGY very nice and Twitter's the twitter
is the way to go so Greg thank you for
being our first guest ever on the pocket
now you review okay thanks guys thank
you well your turn yes it is my turn yes
it is my turn so now i'm going to i'm
going to eject Greg yeah I'm ejecting
Greg given from this hangout are you
sure yes yes I'm totally sure you also
want to block the user no I don't want
to do that okay sweet there's a slot
open up and before I pick somebody else
Taylor you had something co-host oh i
was gonna ask greg to leave I don't have
to kick him no it's just it's just nicer
to say hey can you please back out and
you're gone and like you ain't go by the
hose yeah well we started with somebody
new let's let's alternate and let's
revisit let's talk to our friend sim
Floyd jr. Sam how are you I'm will how
about you guys great I feel great I mean
now you know I got my you know
nervousness am I feel feel pretty good
we're getting into a flow here we got
the old friends in the show where are
you Sam but Alabama yes that's right
that's right i forgot i meant in that
room but you know what that's it oh I'm
in my living room my wife yeah we'd uh
somewhat duh I always forget even though
we talked off and on Twitter what is
your what device you carrying and what
what is a relationship to the s4 I'm
carrying the fame HTC Sensation 4G
that's right every week we've spoken at
length about that all right yes Tim
what's your what's your what's your
question or comment on the four well I
had a question about the lock screen um
being that is for tattoo tattoo it's a
it has the all new lock screen compared
to what the nexus 4 has but it's a bit
more comments cumbersome isn't it
compare it to the nexus 4 it is and I'm
glad that you asked that's a really good
question so here i have the what am I
going to do I'm going to lock this on
myself so this is the galaxy s4 I think
my brightness is not great I'm but it's
bottomed out really bright yeah so
that's that's the minimum brightness so
sorry i'ma let for you yeah it is but
Scott it's beautiful though so this is
the lock screen there are no lock screen
shortcuts down here but you can replace
them and the widget area does indeed
exist up here so i think if i scroll
this way if I'm backwards it does
nothing and if I do that alright so this
one is not set up to do it but you can
make the camera live over here and you
can just flip over and auto launch the
camera it's actually one of those pretty
cool places to to see the galaxy s4 is
momentary stutter because that's
consistent still but it's got the time
over here and then there's there's
nothing to eat but these are fully
configurable sim you can do this just
like you can on the on the Nexus 7 or
for any newer jelly bean for tattoo and
above I think yeah when I understand
though you can put favorited apps and
this in the place of the camera is that
correct this is why we are here I'm
gonna go check that out I believe so
from my talk on the you know I need I
need I need an over-the-shoulder camera
for a second angle C so we don't have to
like keep doing this I wondered if
you're gonna have that on this talk or
not that would make like that would make
all the sense in the world wouldn't it
um but we're not we're not going to do
this I'm going to take the camera off of
me so we can go auto while I'm looking
for this the lock screen is right there
alright so here are the options on the
lock screen and there's your lock screen
widgets right there okay let me just see
what do we got there I can't even read
it the resolutions suck so hard yeah you
can this is where you select the clock a
personal message and this is where you
can like make it into a life companion
if that's what you're into I'm much my
life companions right there your phone
isn't
clocker personally I myself an
enthusiast multiple widgets there we go
okay because I haven't seen very many
videos at this so I figured everyone
will want to know how this works no
you're absolutely right and I I do touch
on it very briefly in one of my many
many videos featuring this device but
here you go favorite apps are camera
favorite apps and this is where you can
figure them so yeah you can jump right
into something else the thing is if i'm
going to put anything there is going to
be the camera right yeah but she doesn't
have that double functionality where you
can just hold it turn it sideways in the
camera will launch Oh like on the s3
yeah that that kind of action yes but
frankly I'd once i was working with this
i didn't once i saw how finicky it was
to get into the widget i wanted to do
that but i do not know if that is still
workable here shortcuts it sounds like
it sounds like an issue with the blanket
there and this is the this is the view
as far as the I think I've got it set
here yeah this is the view as far as the
regular set up on the short cuts down at
the bottom of the lock screen there okay
um I cannot say I can't find it right
now I don't want to waste your entire
time slot trying to look for that for
that functionality the tab hold and
rotate but it is no doubt already being
being discussed in the chat I'm not
entirely sure we're in the comments whoo
swipe left in the area the widgets and
it is what yeah I'm apparently forever
alone cuz I want my phone to be my life
companion I do not by the way how do not
somebody going to make the forever alone
Taylor Martin me Sam is there anything
else you wanted me to check out from the
galaxy s4 before yup oh well I wanted to
know um basically if the lock screen
would s4 was more useful than it is on
HTC one so on the one i will say this i
find the HTC one's lockscreen to be it's
been really busy yeah it's really good
looking but then the minute you try and
use it in anything resembling an
intuitive way it's like what do you
what you know like I'm gonna go ahead to
okay so right here is the lock screen
and it looks like a normal lock screen
there are different things there's a
little time clock and everything and it
says dragged up from the lock thing you
tap an icon to open that app but you
pretty much swipe anywhere on it and it
unlocks which right kinda just feeds our
dog's a lot pocket all the time and when
you set your uh when you when you set
your lock screen to be a notification
centric lock screen on the one like you
can't swipe through the notifications
without unlocking the screen and then
dismissing the notification is it's very
strange so yeah so the one on the s4 is
because of its increased customizability
in certain modes yes I think it is more
useful because its own fortitudo to
exactly certainly if you are using if
you are used to using lock screen
widgets because you're used to the nexus
for the seven whatever it is yeah I
think once HTC upgrades the one maybe
we'll see as I could put dash clock on
my phone and I'll be happy again you'll
be great yeah I can't live without
dashclock I get depressed I don't I
don't that's why we're different but
same yeah I think I think for the moment
absolutely you know we're definitely
more useful in terms of lock screen on
the s4 all right thank you guys that's
pretty much everything Tim thank you man
it's always good to see you and thanks
for helping us ring in the new series
would tell people where they can find
you if they if they don't like reading
Oh at higley I own Twitter look me up
what's that mean great we write um well
I was I was raised in a section of the
town called hugely so I'm a hugely I
like Bostonian listen to my wife she she
said is I like it I'm apparently a pen
equation so you know patient weird
that's even worse a googly-eye yeah Tim
thank you again thank you guys take care
alright Taylor your turn all right let's
go with the way we go if we keep trading
off
like this i'm never gonna pick i am like
a repeat mmm vendor offender I'm gonna
call on a fender but that's okay because
I'm gonna pick oh gosh I I'm gonna
slaughter this is it I galston AG Austin
I'm let's see oh I'm you have to okay
tell me now yes I am never how is that a
plant how is your name pronounced yeah
that's a difficult name it sir I go
study yeah yes that's nice what thank
you sure so guys thank you very much I
must say yeah I've been having you in my
head for quite a while and what I mean
by this is that I listen to your podcast
when i'm out running and so especially
you two gentlemen that is being and
simply I think you've been on for men
yet so it's now in the road but yeah we
yeah we've been on for forty two
episodes as of as of right now we have
not missed a week since we started I
don't think so it's awesome i love
hearing about where people are when they
listened so thank you for listening to
the weekly yeah and the night before
every time Michaels like hey what are we
on the podcast yeah yeah like sure
because preparation is useless yeah
preparation just stomps all over
spontaneity lady okay you funny and you
are entertaining so keep keep it up oh
well so to have but I have two things
one is that I have to show my entry
ticket yes I have the one as it looks
like it is the end tickets for this show
and even though it's about the galaxy s4
and everyone is going to accuse us of
planting those in our audience yeah
congratulations on your purchase thank
you I'm not going to continue about that
but I will tell you this story
when I saw the first reviews about the
galaxy s4 I just know I had to return it
I i pre-ordered both devices and I said
okay well whichever the one that rise
first i will use and i got the one first
and then I was thinking I mean I could
use the galaxy s4 as well it's buy
expensive but no hope at the st. any how
to buy these expensive homes so it
arrived at the coast and I was sitting
with it at the table I said no I'm not
going to support this I didn't buy the
apple iphone 5 i'm not going to buy this
phone sorry now what if what was it that
made you would that push you over the
edge looking at the phone looking at the
galaxy s4 on the table saying no I'm not
going to do this what was it that that
did that yeah I didn't I didn't open it
of course it was an open so I didn't
hold the phone in my hands but you know
it seems very much like it sir it's the
same in many ways i mean i like the
screen I like the new camera I'm not
sure I liked the black and the pattern
you know it's not like completely black
but it's this shiny strange thing I'm
not sure I like that yeah almost
textural yeah but the texture is a bit
we are you know it pro choice of black
for me at least there and service I was
thinking this phone is it's just the
same you know and when you are in the
phones and when you read fuck it now
another size daily you just wish for
something new and you know have a little
light thing yeah why is quite the one
such a great success is it is it the
battery is it the SD card no because it
doesn't have it and everybody loves it
it's because it's living know if they
departed from what they did before they
we invented sense they try to remember
where are the sounds and you know we
appreciate that I appreciate that and a
symbol for like a radical change radical
improvement progression it's it's a
symbol for progression which is always
always going to be more impressive
certainly than than a more iterative
escalation like like the s4 now is there
anything that having gone with the one
and this is not a dig against the one is
there anything having gone with the one
now that you wish you had stuck around
with the 44 is there anything you you
don't get not having oh that's difficult
to answer the one thing I don't like
yeah I have a question I have a question
but I answer first the one thing i don't
like about the one so far is actually
the keyboard I've been using swiftkey
for a while and you know it's so good
sense is so beautiful so I wanted to use
the stock keyboard and I think it's keep
slowing me down I get crazy I replaced
to within two or three minutes of
getting the plan is all fine that's
interesting because my use of the of the
s4 has been that the this samsung stock
keyboard which I've kind of never really
liked all that much has really really
really slowed me down I really can't
can't handle I'm gonna see if I can
showed you on the on the screen here it
has swiftkey it's swiftkey that's what I
stock keyboard is on there okay but it
doesn't suffer does not behave the same
way as swiftkey it's not just look the
same the auto substitution is not the
same yes it's laid out similarly and if
you type perfectly I imagine it would be
all right but the autocorrect is just
mind-blowingly stupid and it always is
on manufacturer anyway I I'll go stand
you have it your way a question and I'm
question yes ok and I'll be sure about
that you know and I I had galaxy s3 and
I think you talked about that in one of
your podcast with Adam doubt that's you
know that phone you just the only way to
hold it is to hold in your right hand or
left
and the press the buttons anything else
you want to do with it you will hit any
key that you don't want to hit either is
it the volume or the power or the
capacitive buttons or the power button
it it is really something that drives
and crazy and you just can't give that
phone to someone has to take a picture
of you because then they were you know
yeah so look after you they'll hit the
menu III know I see that the galaxy s4
had they made something to the edges so
that they're a little bit more you know
flat so you probably hold can you can
hold the phone a bit better and so I was
wondering did they actually do something
is it's the experience better it is and
I'm sorry that I'm like moving all
around the frame here but I was trying
to find a galaxy s3 and I I don't know
where how it went but yes absolutely so
on the on the s4 you'll notice that that
the device is very very rectangular and
a lot of from a lot of different aspects
it does not have the sloping curves of
the s3 and in almost any sense
everything is much more rectangular and
as a result when you take it from
someone or when someone takes it from
you there's not as much of an impulse
for the thumb to to go over that kind of
curved glass that actually felt very
nice on the three but it also resulted
in you hitting that back in menu cut it
has it doesn't happen as much on the
floor certainly these capacitive keys
are just as invisible as they ever were
so anybody who doesn't expect them to be
there will still take it and run and
everything so there you know you're
never gonna be able to get away from
that but it is an improvement yes this
is a product of trimming away the bezels
yes yes as also have a purpose i've
always said this like the ipad mini have
right here has very little bezel on the
sides and brandon was trying to tell me
all my neighbors are back hitting the
ball the other venomous telling me it's
got the technology where you can hold it
with your family it's white and it
doesn't register but that there's like
this context or complex that i just
can't get past like i'm going to touch
the display if i'm going to use it i
don't use the display to hold the device
right I can't get past that so
especially if you have a flip cover on
that I have a flip cover in mind and
moving icons from one screen to the
other is not easy it's well and that is
a good way to its gonna sound like I'm
selling this SVU cover but that is a
really good way to get around those
invisible capacitive keys me like at
this odd so nice I can't I can't
overstate how how much this improves the
experience of using the galaxy s4 how
much are they paying you Michael how
much of the only but they're not may be
anywhere close to the seventy dollars
this boss don't say that uh but yes
anyway I think that that was that's a
very good question them it did
pronunciation again I'm sorry it's
agoston alliston yes great thank you
sweet home holds a person I do know one
thing that he misses about the s4 that
he wishes he had on his one and that's
smart Paul's because everybody wants
that yeah cuz everyone everyone
definitely need smart pause on a useful
feature why wouldn't you need it it
works so well I guess don't tell
everyone where uh where they can find
you on the Internet now you can probably
see my named sou had that in and then a
facebook the end they you should be
looking for me in Denmark because its
own story but I'm from another country
so not many people have this name in
Denmark so just well congratulations on
on being weakened Denmark and and and
and thank you very much for your for
calling in and please keep listening and
and thanks for your question yes thank
you very much thank you I'm doing about
alright well this is great stuff Taylor
have used your more polite dismissal
approach and you're right that feels a
lot better than ejecting from home
uh-huh this is so just jump as i
understand i'm gonna go ahead and mute
no no I'm muting it's not necessary i'm
gonna go ahead Taylor because you want
to welcome a veteran right so I'm going
to go ahead and flip up my order and I'm
going to invite another new person will
do two new people in the row then we'll
come back to a veteran how's that sound
everybody sure I might have to go like
backhand some kids or something else I
gotta tell you man none of that is
coming through the show you sound

them get off my long and I'm only I'm
only half power without without you
co-host oh sorry I won't leave you oh
yeah dumb don't don't leave me behind
I've never spoken to Brandi McNeil
before i do not know if this person's
been alive but i would really like
Brandi McNeil to uh to speak awesome hi
can you hear me yes we can hear him
ready welcome to the know you review how
are you I'm great how are you I'm very
well we're having a great great episode
so far effort to kick off our new series
so I I really couldn't be happier yes
and well Taylor yeah I've chugged half a
Stein of tea good yeah I didn't get I
didn't get the coffee I wanted before
the show so I'm a little Spacey but yeah
we had a Keurig Randy one Todd gunnar
optiks and curing bringing you the
latest from pocket now I have a Keurig
and it is a must-have I must say it's
really amazing it changed my life I got
one last Friday for my birthday and it's
amazing it's amazing yeah they're just
like you're like I want coffee and a
minute later you have coffee it's like a
food replicator oh I save so much money
ready what well technology do you carry
with you what's your what's your mobile
device so all right now yeah other than
the keurig that i could with me at all
times I actually have an HTC 10 just the
third one in a row is that I know but so
actually I'm a bit of a of an addict so
I had an s3 and then I sold it because I
wanted the nexus 4 and then I still have
the nexus 4 but now I have the HTC One
these are the only things i buy so i
feel justified in you are making an
awesome point i used to say that to
people people will be like kari's like
two phones that's how i got my captain
two phones name and I'm like yeah it but
I don't really spend a lot of money on
anything else this is my luxury
expenditures that it's the same kind of
situation for you it sounds like exactly
yeah yeah oh that's awesome which I wish
I could say the same you just buy a lot
taylor just buys like cars and I by
amazon like
I get bored the mic what's the daily
deal what's the goal box today I
definitely need one of those Brandi did
you ever at any point consider the the
galaxy s4 and why or why not so I
actually went to The Times Square live
event so I had a chance to play around
with the s4 and actually I had all along
I had planned on getting the s4 uh and
then I started reading reviews in my
concern with the HTC one was the camera
otherwise I was just totally sold but I
was like I'm not really sure about the
camera and then more and more place
because we're saying if you if you know
how to take cameras if you're not the
person who just hits the shutter button
and that's it the HTC One actually isn't
a bad camera and so I went into an AT&amp;amp;T
store and played around with it and I
was like I I guess it's the same as what
everyone says which is when you hold it
you're like oh I love this phone I gotta
I gotta have it it's easy Nana yeah and
the camera is it's definitely underrated
it is I was I uh and I thought the Zoe's
were kind of a dumb feature but they're
actually awesome especially if you have
dogs and like oh that's the main reason
I have a dog and I obsessively
photograph her and I'm always missing
hilarious like shots of her so he's
always there a lifesaver they are they I
I too thought they were down at first
and then I had to start once i started
using them in addition to HTC share and
so forth but yeah the camera on the on
the s4 I just finished doing a feature
on it's like a 12 minutes a ridiculously
long video because there are so many
features on the s4 and it's funny that
we're talking cameras here because
frankly for me personally the s4 S
camera software is the thing that would
make me want to hold onto it yeah
especially if I'd had like a like an s3
or some of that I'm not trying to say
you've made the wrong call I would love
the one but um the S force camera really
does come packing a lot of interesting
stuff and it really does keep pace with
the one as far as fun unique features
like I don't know which one I would pick
between Zoe and drama shot growing up
you miss your self shots
Zoey like you mrs. Zoe selfshots that's
what you miss isn't it that's why you
want your one again right yeah yeah I
don't I forgot to put that in the
article on the site my completely
completely did forget about that thank
you do you have a branded you have a
question that a particular question
about the s4 or a comment yeah so I'm
wondering I guess I'm wondering you know
the HTC one is obviously its its rival
and I guess uh the one question I
haven't seen answered is if you're
somebody who plans on routing and ramen
your phone anyway though you think is
the phone to get uh well Taylor Taylor
would you do me a favor and and and
field this question very quickly yeah
yeah I'm just gonna go sorry i'm just a
band with bitches aren't you sorry
Brandi yeah i'm gonna go ahead and it's
exactly what I'm gonna do thank you I
know you too will ya okay so there but
there are many many many sides to that
question and there has been a lot of
misinformation on the issue I'm stuck on
Michael I'm gonna not be stuck on
Michael there are many people going
around saying that cyanogenmod is not
going to support the galaxy s4 which is
false there were some people who
developed for cyanogenmod who originally
said that and Steve Kondik came out and
said they're speaking on behalf of
themselves not cyanogenmod and all this
other stuff Steve Kondik also found out
that the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s4 comes with a
locked bootloader which makes things not
impossible but it's like a really high
hurdle or a loop to jump through it
makes modding a little more difficult
every little process that you have to do
you have to make sure that all of your
your normal checks for a secure boot
loader and recovery and all this other
stuff check out so there are some some
complications there HTC is also a little
weird in the way that you have to mod
their devices so there's not a lot going
on right now in terms of models but I
made a video yesterday losing track of
days but I made a video yesterday about
HTC One mods so there's already some
development for
and the galaxy s4 is obviously a little
more it's a little behind because it's
not out yet but if you get anything
other than the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s4 it'll
probably be fine probably of mods work
I'd like a philosophical bent ahead of
this in addition to dealing with a
bandwidth issue i also went and got that
the one from the other room which should
have been in here but i was shots with
zoe well right yeah i just wanted
another angle on my face uh no what what
strikes me about about the question of
modding these devices is that it's an
entirely different experience i think
because the s4 relies so heavily on
TouchWiz modifications for its essence
like it's not the galaxy s4 without it's
like running stock on this would be
ridiculous it's just you know it
wouldn't be the same by a long shot but
in some ways it would be the in some
ways aesthetically speaking it would be
it would be better whereas on the one
I'm not convinced that I want to run
stock on this and I know I may be in the
minority on that one I really like the
the modifications that you know and
Brandi how do you feel about that yeah i
mean i'm actually really intrigued by
that cuz I with my s3 I rooted and
robbed it and I was happy with what i
could do with that but with the HTC One
I guess my concern with routing and
robbing it is that I'll lose the camera
kind of adjustments that they've made
and and that whatever the stock whatever
the stock rom is is going to ruin that
and all of a sudden going to be taking
crappy pictures whereas with the the s3
it seems early s4 it seems like that
that phone is just so powerful that if
you took away all of the touch wiz crap
that they laid onto it you actually have
a really powerful and interesting device
that you could do a lot with i put a
snog android on my galaxy note 2 and the
camera went from being one of the better
cameras on an android phone to absolute
garbage yeah so it yes it was running
official cyanogenmod 10.1 and the camera
was just so awful oh my god so i
actually went back to touch with but one
way that I've actually just learned to
deal with Simpson
and TouchWiz I'm a I'm a purist I love
stock Android especially jelly bean i
just love the interface one way I've I
guess learned how to commit yeah well I
cope yet one way I've learned to cope is
downloading third-party launchers and
that for the longest time for me that
was probably the worst decision there
were a lot of launchers out there and I
didn't like any of them and past two or
three months I've kind of fallen in love
with action launcher so I put action
launcher on my one so you get all the
best features and then you still have no
mostly stock interface right there yeah
there is there are middle grounds there
I'm Taylor Taylor goes to put up his
phone and then I start talking in there
there you are I'm neway so yeah moms pad
we do have to move on though I and I
want to make sure that Brandi has had
spoken as much as she wants about the
galaxy s4 and also i need to remember
something which i didn't remember a half
hour ago 40 minutes ago when the show
started there's another component to
this show I thought of this show and I
didn't remember to initiate this thing
and Taylor I meant to tell you to remind
me I wanted to ask everyone for general
thumbs up or thumbs down this is not to
be included in a review this is not to
be is considered at all official but a
general sense of how you feel about a
device is it good as a bad thumbs up or
thumbs down so Brandi you have the
distinction because i'm a forgetful jerk
of being the first one to give us a
thumbs up or thumbs down on the galaxy
s4 for you i think i know the answer but
you know oh i think generally for most
people it's a good phone but for me i
was i get i don't know that's hard i
feel like i'm in the same position you
guys are where it's like well a good
phone but yeah i'm in the middle you're
right that you can doodle you know it's
funny that's an unintended side effect
that is positive where it's like it does
sort of place you in the reviewers shoes
for a second doesn't it he have yeah I'm
going to go to 10 from now on I'm gonna
pretend like I intended for that to be a
really philosophical point what are we
gonna say Phil oh I was just gonna say
like every review i do ever is kind of
like i don't want to say it's too bad
but i don't want to say it's great right
and you
to walk a thin line and bran do you make
a really good point there that uh when
you when you said that you know for
everyone else it would be a good device
it's just not the one for me it's always
a personal choice so really if you can
see things subjectively yeah objectives
lead right objectively is seeing things
through your perspective subjectively as
seeing things from another perspective
yeah I just I just pretend to be a
writer all right and thank you for thank
you for joining us I'm gonna lock the
camera on you and if you like tell
everyone where they can find you on the
on the internet ah you can find me on
google+ pretty mcneil and i also have a
blog that i right tech in the real world
uh no oh cuz that domain was taken yeah
awesome oh thank you yeah Brenton coming
on board all right that was awesome
Taylor I think it's your turn is it
right is that right I guess it is I
don't know what's going on here between
well we've got what is that is their
code happening in the ribbon maybe I
have no idea what you talked about but
uh I'm gonna go with they're actually
under Devon this time and that is it hi
Otto I don't have to pronounce yeah but
Devon and I ought to know if you could
yes hello what's up i was about to talk
to you unmute but i'm pretty sure that
you've done this more than I have so
actually I think that's entirely true
that's no exaggeration what I love about
here if anybody from pocket now is on
the internet they're like boom we're
here or on a hangout it down here every
time yeah it's awesome i'm not
complaining her for making fun that's
all so so how are you doing this fine
evening every good yeah we just got back
from i actually just applied for a my
first apartment um right before we got
here oh nice is awesome you you like you
put in your applications and did all
that paperwork kind of stuff yeah yeah
waiting for the yeah it's gonna be like
two days before we actually know if I
got it but
we got the paperwork and all that dead
girl you know what we've been really
cool as if i had a sound board up for
that so that i could give you some
applause but um loud thank you no
problem on top you love him wake up
everybody uh Devon and an iota we see
you guys all the time we we frequently
get derailed together which is fun I
like going into the weeds with you guys
and like you know I'm talking about
random stuff but let's talk galaxy s4
yeah ah let's pretend like we've never
talked about the galaxy s4 before
because effectively we haven't because I
don't remember anything ever so uh
neither of you has the yes for an Ohio
to you have the one correct ray and
Devon you were also rocking an HD suit
of also if i remember correctly yep the
one v yeah the chin mmm yes the world of
that shit I wish that chin was on more
HTC devices okay by the way uh your your
uh my s4 czar in your hands yeah
anything you want to see anything you
want to ask about or comment on the
floor is yours you can live vicariously
through Michael for a few minutes so I
actually had this uh I had this question
that I threw out there on on Google+ and
Twitter the other day I I you know
basically I was just saying that I would
completely recommend one x users to
upgrade to the one but i can't say that
i would personally recommend s3 users
use their upgrade if they're on contract
to get the s4 and i don't know if that's
more of a statement for last year's
flagship phones or this year's in terms
of you know quality um full that is deep
that is oh that's that's definitely like
in like an industry level observation
and i think it's a very good question i
think i know my answer to it tailored to
you do you know yours but it was a
question told her i missed the question
mark yeah felt that was a statement um
yeah no I actually agree i would i would
say
about the same thing the one for most
people is was a disappointment and the
s3 was not and that's one of the bigger
factors here chama the 1x the 1x I call
that one the one x in the one next one
and the first one and one the first wait
again they're all the same ah oh yeah
the 1x I would suggest people with the
1x to upgrade to the one if they have
the opportunity because they did sign it
to your contract most likely but yes I
would now x plus users there was
something a little more a little a
little broader about what what what hios
are said that I that struck my ear
interestingly because the question is
are we disappointed in the four or many
of us a little disappointed in the four
versus the three because the four is
disappointing her because the three was
so impressive as am i reading it right
there head yeah yeah pretty much yeah
yeah and you know what I have to say I
think the three I think the three set a
really high bar on the galaxy s3 I was
not ready be impressed by and when I
reviewed the sprint version of it last
year I really was even considering some
of its many many many features didn't
really work too well still a really
really excellent device yeah nice is
that your your tmobile boss had yeah
call him back I love getting prioritized
over employers uh sorry team oh it's um
he doesn't watch the hangouts nah ok I
don't got to what you were saying
Michael fee it's um it's it can be
likened to what people say for most
iPhones every year it's just not that
huge of an improvement no wait another
year and that's kind of how I feel here
you know I wouldn't have suggested
people with an iphone 4 upgrade to the
4s I wouldn't have suggested people with
the 4s to upgrade to the five unless
their hands are seemingly large and then
still I'd say something else because
it's just too small but anyway that's
another story for another time but yes
for people with the four i would suggest
upgrading to the five but you know
there's so much gray area there that the
is not a lot of difference between
individual models that little guy died
on generations you know it's not
necessarily that I'm I'm not
disappointed by the s4 because even
though it's an incremental upgrade I I
kind of like that I think that's a good
thing because I would rather a company
spend a year improving on a good product
and making great than just trying to
reinvent it again right but um for me
like I I I had though I had the 1x last
year and I I really liked the 1x was a
great phone and then I got I I the s3
came out within my 30 day buyer's
remorse um and so I trade it in for the
s3 and I was I really liked the 1x but I
was just blown away by the by the s3 i
love that follows it was a fantastic
phone um and and now this year it's
again I'm not disappointed by the s4 I'd
still think it's a fantastic phone I'm
sure it's I'm sure it's only been you
know gotten better since the s3 but that
the one is so much it's so much more
tremendously better than 1x to me ah yes
yeah and and the 1x even said set
something of a high bar and then when I
the one really surpassed it but you know
the one acts had some issues that I
think really impacted it I mean it
didn't didn't run very smoothly a sense
was very heavy and I I hated sense for
but actually really like since five it's
I'm enjoying me too absolutely and I
agree and and the thing that Samsung is
positioning for the for the s4 like the
thing they want you to be impressed by
because they have to play this game this
perception game right and they have to
say well listen what are the awesome
things about this the awesome thing
about this is and I'm really annoyed the
three isn't here and I'm sorry God the
awesome thing about this is that they've
managed to fit really awesome
improvements into a package that does
resemble the three not just in form
which is a little disappointing but in
size and it's actually lighter and
smaller in and I think every dimension
that is that's huge I mean that that
that's massively impressive
I'm just not in a very visible way so
there's there's one here's your s3 you
can have a pic thank you did I didn't
see no no you didn't Joe did but I was
in the minority I didn't ever really
like the galaxy s3 I didn't like the
original Galaxy S I didn't like the
galaxy s2 and all of its different forms
I have never really liked any of the
galaxy devices until the original Galaxy
Note we lost Michael we didn't lose him
we didn't lose me back I'm Rafi he's
playing dissipating Hameroff you'd like
I don't I don't need you to like I don't
nobody needs nobody needs to see my
midriff well I like circuit on behind
the computer yeah but I wasn't really
impressed by what again why do you keep
doing this to me what a mid sentence
it's still here I mean it's not like I'm
going anywhere I'm just turning me you
left me how would you do that never I
wasn't impressed with the galaxy s3 and
and I really didn't like any galaxy
phone until the galaxy note in the
galaxy note 2 and I've tried to put a
finger on that for the longest time I
don't know what it is it just can't
figure it out for me it was just a
screen size i don't know i think what i
liked about the s3 better than the 1x
last year was that it i think we're just
the smaller details as opposed to like
software or anything I mean I did like
TouchWiz for better than sense for but I
really didn't even like TouchWiz for I
still stuck with cyanogenmod um so for
me it was just the small things on the
hardware like I love Samsung's button
layout with the power button on the
right volume on the left us be at the
bottom that I i want i want that setup
on pretty much every phone i own i don't
touch about a standard setup but there
what we're talking about while we're
talking about yes made up the wall this
nonsense what do you what do we think
about this are we tired of this yet or
we're just going to live with this until
they get tired of putting the right the
back button on the wrong side of the
phone yeah and that order every time I
go back to a more conventionally
designed phone like the one or like the
achieve s or like a bunch of stuff like
I'm consistently hitting the wrong
button for days and it drives me nuts i
hate that they've done this motorola did
this back
the day they put the talkin and keys
they reversed them and they were going
back sure that had reversed talking in
cases like what do you what why you're
just making me my life worse anyway
that's nobody else cares nobody else
cares I'm just gonna go back to my old
blackberry curve and be happy I Otto
Devin Devin especially because I don't
think you've said more than four words
any give closing also thing about the
yes for cuz I I haven't even got to
touch it and watch me anything on it
really he should be getting it in stock
soon so I I like to have a chance yes
but other than that I just kind of been
flying blind on at all well that is I'm
gonna drop a bomb on you then you're an
HTC girl right yes yeah so HTC One or
galaxy s4 it's I'm pretty much answer
that question before I like the one so
far if you've not seen I did a small
camera test that got put on twitter with
some pictures I finish that on the side
do a comparison with your your DSLR is
this on 21 I'm gonna no way my right now
no spoilers no we look I'm also very
mindful of the clock so we actually have
to gotta move on but I want to use that
mention as a segue can you tell people
where they can see that comparison when
it's ready um yeah it's not up yet but
it'll be on my side at droid each mobile
com that's how you pronounce it I've
always have been like right age droided
to its dro I da GE right you really are
old wait droid age rite aid hey you open
on the droid age dotnet yet off my lawn
and of course your twitter handles the
telltale the team well I'm still enjoyed
it again and because Anton can never
forget to fan out that it Debbie doodle
it's taking devin and removing the end
lillian awesome oh I also have a shout
out from our good friend michael
Lombardi oh and he says hi mobile down
are you gonna be here he actually
tweeted me and I didn't reply yes if
you're busy teaching here's the Hangout
um ok but is he making fun of you for
being old that's true that's true die
die Otto heaven guys thank you for
joining and uh but before you go give us
mmm all right you can each have one give
us a thumbs up or thumbs down on the
galaxy s4 if you give us a thumb-sized
ways it's Brandis stick you can't you
can't reuse that I mean to you I like
the one better but I still give it a
thumbs up it's a great phone i'll give
it a thumbs up because i can't give
something a thumbs down if I have
nothing to say negative about it yeah
you know what that's a that's a good
philosophy and mandible thank you for
bringing it agreed guys thanks for
joining us we'll see you next time you
take the devilís care CIA's alright we
are going where we're approaching the
one-hour mark but I want to talk to a
few new faces before we go and I think
Taylor I think for the remainder of the
show let's uh let's let's stick to new
new listeners so we can just you know so
you know why I mean yeah everyone we
pick we have less than a minute go oh
good idea now let's go with them have we
spoken with Fernando before I don't know
everyone just kind of lucked out for me
okay and he has no video yes and I know
uh we generally do require I you make it
happen for us oh are you falling down a
waterfall oh wait a minute okay we're
gonna go ahead and mute that Fernando
can you hear us yeah I don't think we've
got him sorry Fernando we're having a
connection problem there and please
please please try again let's see what
about
I'm going to mutilate this name that's
awesome that is really cool Emery is
that am i pronouncing that anywhere
close to correct yeah pretty much nice
Emery well you much fucking cool that's
a nice way of saying no Fernando please
excuse me I have to i'm going to i'm
going to ject you just to make room in
the slot there I probably shouldn't have
done that Emery tell us what phone
you're carrying and tell us your
thoughts how galaxy s4 I actually got it
like few days ago haha is this I think
is our first person on the year review
actually has the device so how do you
like it I absolutely love it I used to
have ipod and sits a big upgrade from
that so I'm sorry did you say you had
the ipod G you the iphone or I mean
actually I bought because you have an
old nokia phone with it so I kind of use
the both at the same time oh yeah you do
wielded you have the ipod touch and a
dumb phone yeah pretty much and so there
I but was so like black in shifts so I
kind of like I'm the galaxy s4 and it's
so much better it's I can't even compare
that it's like when I but crashed and
everything I did it even progressed into
menya so so it sounds like your move to
a modern device really yeah transit I
mean cuz it's your first smartphone
right the galaxy s4 is your first sales
that's it that's like a transformative
moment do you remember your first mart
phone Taylor I do i do I took it back
you returned it when those moto q oh god
I love the moto q I was the only one but
you always remember your first mart
phone so I mean to have that something
as capable as the galaxy s4 as your
first smartphone that's that's awesome I
mean I can understand why you why you
would love it you know people who own
smartphones for years love this but your
first pump phone that's great what's
your favorite part about it um just a
lot of good things it sounds like the
like you're leading thing is that it
doesn't crash with everything you do
right yeah
yeah I can I can basically like be on
skype and actually like open stuff at
the same time so it's kinda mazing yeah
you can actually multitask yes what no
more than one thing at a time so
absolutely love the camera as well
become it's really nice what do you like
most about the camera the quality inn in
kind of normal shooting modes or the
added features or both what's your
favorite actually love so i can take
like a close-up pictures and they're
actually like really high quality oh
yeah yeah she does okay and in close-up
now did you have an ipod that had a
camera were now yeah this i bought 4th
generation alright so that wasn't a
terribly good camera was it I think it
was Thunder 2 megapixels yeah that's
quite a leap that you've made to this
gigantic beast on the back of this
sucker have you seen that the camera
tour the way I mean have you managed to
drill down into every single camera
feature yet because God there are
there's so many of them so there is I
don't really know how do you ever really
know what you've actually hit the bottom
of the menu yeah yeah they link to bury
settings within settings within settings
well that is Shannon's inception there's
a lot to complain about them yeah there
is like a settings inception feel on
this on this thing I love that that mode
selector there i mean you know that's
the camera UI is just it's just great
it's very easy to use do you agree Emory
I think he froze no no that all those
hmm his video still there but I'm not
getting any any audio from wigan
anything no audio the internet there's a
the internet is a joking at audio memory
yeah the thing we could purchase about
to crash Emory you you have a
long-standing relationship with things
that crash apparently Oh indeed and the
funny part is my computer isn't bad it's
actually quite good it has like I seven
eight eight gigs of ram and it's kind of
trashing my girlfriend has a similar
problem she has a really spectators all
the time and
Emory before we lose you forever final
thoughts on the on the galaxy s4 you
want to ask for your thumbs up or down
as well complete the thumbs up I love it
so much what he was gonna give it a
thumbs down just gonna say I mean was
introducing 1 by L stunned that's great
and really really really happy that that
you got a device that you're you're
happy with here in a year closing
closing time well I would really want to
ask for you guys to make a video about
like good stuff on Android since it's
like my first android device and i canna
like but no really about it so much oh
boy now that's that's been a Content
generator for sites like ours for four
years we have so much backlogged stuff
for you but um and we're always making
new stuff so that's yeah I if boy I
don't even know where there's so much of
it Taylor where do we direct him I'm
talking now umm pocket now become / tags
/ galaxy s yeah yeah we need to like
rethink our hub structure a little bit
day lost him we love we lost him oh no
well we got his I think he's got all you
yeah Emory um yeah yeah you're still
here everything we are your it's like
you're it's like you're slowly slipping
out of our hands and tell everyone on
the Internet where where they can find

media that's okay you don't you don't
have to just a courtesy we extend if you
do I want to thank you for joining us
for the first episode of you review and
I hope you'll come back for a future
episode I hope so great have a good one
yeah thank you all right I'm gonna back
away yes I'm gonna quickly choose is it
far he's been with us for a while
awesome look how are you doing I'm gonna
do good I'm well I've had almost all of
my coffee and tea and I'm really wired
right now I'm trying to tame myself
that's other for us for me to have my
coffee it's three thirty in the morning
out there oh there anything wow we're
dedication this is dash
where are you where are you calling in
from I'm going from India wow great to
have you on workouts in India just just
throwing that out there oh it's close by
to Mumbai to Pune it would offer I have
not okay I was just wondering it's about
choice yeah oh that's our what kind of
not what kind of smartphone are you are
you working with currently and what that
to the s for you is that what is that
that's asked for alas the second one
nice yes there's an MP gone there is
there some Envy there Michael there's a
little bit of envy you know a lot of the
review units this year we're black and
so to see the white one is kind of nice
thats that's good yeah I've
congratulations on your purchase by the
way thank you oh my thoughts on this
moving from the north to its feels kind
of a miniature in hand and everybody wow
you upgraded from the no to you yeah and
the people with the large hands I mean
especially when pressing up those
screens almost twenty-five percent of
your tumblers on the screen so you
almost having double presses out there
apart from that it's pretty much a good
phone oh yes i would have liked the HTC
one's build that's pretty much pretty
very good on this cc1 I mean I thought
what do you do would you miss things
like did you miss the S Pen from the
note 2 i'm very curious about that
because you know they're note 2 dope
around that pen not really that much I
mean apart from video editing and
editing photos on the test then it
wasn't really much of a use I mean the
handwriting recognition was not really
at part yep do you use air view on the
four extensively I know I've actually
turned it off it kind of cuts buggy yeah
yeah it says it doesn't feels kind of
unfinished yeah um it's fascinating we
did that comparison between the note 2
and the 4 so it's like I'm fascinated by
someone who upgrades from the note 2 to
the s4 because obviously a better device
I mean that excuse me a better device in
some respects and a worse and
others do you what's your favorite part
about having moved from from the note to
whether it was actually a false decision
I had to handle what I know to to my mom
so I had to move on when you saw the
next thing was online was either decisi
one or a tasteful so I went in for this
for coming from the samsung and wanted
to stick to the you know the usage part
of it I mean with s1 there's to the mood
to one just wanted to continue the
lineage of that also you skipped the s3
yeah I mean I didn't feel it was much
more upgrading and there wasn't anything
hot passing wanting me to switch over
that's interesting it's very interesting
yeah here's you often hear on people
saying that the jump from the s2 to the
s3 was so large that's it that's that's
interesting yeah good I i I've got a
I've got a question for further since
since you we both have the same device
we you and I both have the s4 with us is
there I uh is there a device that you
are curious about how it matches up to I
mean something that we might have you
have a specific question before we
before we move on I know I mean
competitively HTC One and s4 are the two
best phones in the market at the moment
and when I was looking for a phone or
making a choice between the two phones
Oh what I would look into a phone is the
processing power and I mean coming by or
use those benchmarks so whereas the belt
and the other parts actually go into a
second really nature or a second
secondary lets down the list bcp and
awesome sorry I had some packet loss
there sorry okay and most of the
features the zoe the drama shots on this
one I mean I frankly see we won't be
using it that much as you would use the
phone and I mean you use it for your
social networking for your games and
most of your business application since
you're amazing but that's the same
across on both the phone so the most
pressing point out put out there would
be your processing power
true enough any I mean display quality
yeah it's always interesting to hear
like what what factors people use to to
shop with because you know the
occasionally you get authority get
somebody who shops on benchmarks and
galaxy s4 as in either of its forms or
in any of its four or five forms has
very very powerful processing capability
are you pushing that like are you using
really intense 3d games or are you going
to oh very well it's been two days since
I've got the phone haven't installed
anything and much on to it not even my
office seeing it so yet to go into those
details blank slate it's just ready hair
blacks except for my contacts on toys
that's well you've got a long period of
fun you know in the in your immediate
future so congrats and thanks for for
calling in tell people where they can
they can find you I'm on to put on
twitter my handle is a time on school
can you spell that for us it's a tha our
Emmy and SWR oh there you are yeah she
just can't have reverse engineers and I
have a feeling this is gonna be a thumbs
up am i right yeah cool thank you not
even connect your data that's a one
middle and four thumbs up yeah so yeah
janessa's keeping that keeping a cuban
score that i know he gets to get some
visual input down there no the caesar
thanks so he gave to so all right yeah i
get the math right well actually I since
I completely bungled it for the first
half the episode we're not keeping track
um if you if you took the numbers from
our post which is better where we all
chose the one pretty fun o our book yeah
our 721 like selection yeah it was like
a point five to Stephen chose both
Steven kind of yeah he just said it go
to yeah we uh I am I am becoming more
luminescent as the show goes on because
I've had to close the door to my booth
because this is the first time we
usually broadcasted we do stuff in the
morning a lot like the live happens our
own in the afternoon but the weekly
happens in the
morning and this is the first time I've
done a show this late actually and as a
result i forgot about the increased
traffic outside my office so i had to
close the sound booth door and when I do
that it just gets so hot in here ah so
what I'm saying is and because we're
over the hour mark already we're gonna
go and we're gonna take two more we're
gonna take one more veteran color and
one more new collar and I have to duck
out cuz I gotta get going soon too and
we're gonna take one more caller I'm
sorry and Taylor because you are the
reason we have to end early you have to
make the choice all right well I have to
go with the nesa I have to she has been
she has been hitting the random button
on the a good cool effects stuff like
just crazy i saw bring a mustache at one
point and and who knows what else I
don't know how are you I know you said
I'm forever alone today and made fun of
my hands and I don't even know was not
being sarcastic i said that yeah you
were saying my hands are huge and i'm
not being sarcastic or something like
that I don't know we are going to get to
one more Knesset janessa welcome to the
show and we are going to get two to one
more after you Taylor I know you'll have
to bounce but I'll end on one more
person after after donessa it's good to
see a ring yes tell us so yeah together
we both want to give the floor away yeah
get your the MC here I know so do you
have any questions for us about the
galaxy s4 specifically or another device
that we may have on hand yes few
questions from me and my friend that is
a fanboy oh yeah go ahead first things
first i wanted to point out that um I
don't have the old fashioned buttons on
my phone and honestly I do not use the
search button I just used home and menu
and back maybe but I think it's not so
much of a huge like difference if you
have those two basic phone options once
you get used to it it's all about being
getting used to using a certain
and the buttons underneath judges repair
the modern configuration denese or do
you prefer the old school one with the
one that you're rocking right now my mom
has a samsung galaxy I don't I remember
which one because it kind of all look
like and I'm so you're still having the
four options it's it gets a little like
oh wait I don't have that option here on
this phone right it's about getting
useful having that those two options is
that over all four yeah this is oh go
ahead go ahead okay no I was going to
say this is the hardest though this has
been the hardest thing for me to get
used to on the one is the button layout
because you have only to you have back
at home and that's it no menu and I'm
okay with not having a menu I just I
really wish I just had a twit ask
switcher button or a recent apps button
then that is the one thing I want and
you know double pressing the home button
just isn't intuitive I don't know it's
just mashing matching a thumb down on
the home button is not intuitive either
but we could we talk about this for a
while but I let's keep it on that on the
s4 Dennis I keep you were driving on
something there hang out with Domenico
that now he's old high on morphine
because of his surgery and we're talking
about it it's all about getting you soon
having making the change and getting
used to having that change in adjusted
to your life but I'm going back to the
questions the first question is do you
guys prefer having the stock option of
the megapixels that went on your video
michael point yes the one about the
cameras do prefer having the nine
megapixels that is set up by the phone
by the full or put it a little higher to
the 13 12 megapixels i think it is right
it's 13 yeah so the question is uh the
question relates to the resolution of
the camera and the fact that any
otterbox default a muting time in the
out of box default the camera is set to
a resolution of
9.6 megapixels 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
that results in a shot that fills the
frame nicely when you switch to 13
megapixels it you get these vertical
inner you these vertical black bars on
the side of the viewfinder because it is
a 4 by 3 aspect ratio this was a such a
mind trip when I was reviewing this
thing I had to get Taylor on the phone
Mike Taylor why is this happening the
explain to me things about sensor size
but to answer your question I don't find
myself ever needing their a 13 megapixel
shot or very rarely I'm perfectly happy
with 9.6 nothing most people are because
in exchange you get a nice letter box
crop ratio of 16 by 9 shooting stellar
you have more than a viewfinder to yeah
you do have more than viewfinder too and
also the galaxy s4 already offers so
little because of its narrow field of
view that you want pretty much all you
can get in the viewfinder now 13 give
you a little more on the top and bottom
no but yeah nobody really wants that
yeah the effect that they're trying to
get from that and it's something that
all cameras do is not something they've
started or anything but the effect
they're trying to get from that nine or
16 9 aspect is is why it's a wide angle
shot but it's not and that's what I had
to explain yeah it's not at all it's
what's going to affect that more so than
your your sensor anything is the the
lens the glass mm-hmm and the focal
length of that so that that's one thing
that differs between say the one and
this is the comparison I had to make the
difference in the one and the galaxy s4
is your focal length on the lens the one
was somewhere like 28 millimeters I
think in the the s4 was somewhere like
35 to 38 somewhere in there I don't
remember what exactly was yeah the end
result is of course that yeah like with
yellow one gets a much wider shot yeah
you do this and then like it with the
galaxy s4 you kind of have to be like
you shouldn't the same scene is like
totally shit footsteps back I actually
uh video that I saw way he has he's as
far as he is with the one as he is with
ask for but I think that but as Thor
looks like he's swimming in yeah that's
kind of late I never noticed that and
the only problem that I've had with the
Samsung cameras on the punt phones is
that I'm used to taking vertical
pictures uh-huh I'm gonna go with my
corner and cry over here yeah my mom
keeps asking me all take a picture of
this and I always go like this and then
I'm like oh no I cannot use it like this
i have to use a landscape yeah you do
that that bothers me so much well that
become the one good side effect of it as
that's gonna teach you how to you how to
do landscape photos Jeanette I don't
want to move on without without getting
to your other point so Taylor I mean
it's over we didn't answer the question
really the question was completely
different from what we answered we just
start going to be right there yeah she
chance would we rather have the 13
megapixels or or nine and the answer
that i will have is i would rather shoot
their team because you can crop down to
the nine it that's all that's doing the
13 megapixels is taking the full sensor
picture like it uses every bit of the
sensor and basically if you're taking a
9 megapixel image all you're doing is
cropping out pixels that you know might
be helpful it's good that you caught
that because I mean you did thank you
for answering for you I answered for me
and then I'm going six is fine and and i
agree Taylor you're absolutely right the
ting above the 13 makes more logical
sense if you want to do more work which
is cropping the fact and I am I do not
need that that type of resolution so I
think if you are interested in just
having a nice collection pictures that
you don't have to crop and edit after
the fact too much you can leave it this
if it's not going to add anything to the
quality it's just going to put more in
the viewfinder more in the output image
that's all it's going to do so I mean
technically I'd probably just use nine
because I'm going to end up dropping it
down so it'll be Rexy nine anyway but
yeah danesi you have we have time for
one more from you and then we got to
move on to our final guest but your old
tell Jax it's it's it's 87
easy 700 degrees in here now I'm just
gonna combine the three questions if the
camera was that what would be the
comparison between the camera from the
s4 and the s3 and the overall look and
feel of the phone like the finish
between the two and i guess the pixels
because i keep getting both questions
can you see any pixels I don't Nick pick
up other pictures cuz i don't really far
for them but ya know that's you can't if
you want to see a pixel difference
between the s3 and the s4 you legit have
to do this and then you have to just how
i use my phone red if you're not Taylor
much got an email never ever exactly
yeah I'm not eating you are now all
there is there's no way to see pixels
with a 1080p display it's not that you
can see pics it's not that you cannot
see pixels that you can see on a 720p
display but the sharpness effect is
detectable this idea that human eye
can't see past a 300 PPI is completely
wrong it's actually somewhere around
between four and five according to an
article I read recently yeah there's a
lot of discrepancy on the research done
around it in the memory yeah human eye
can see like 50 some mega pixels but
right it's all relation to digital like
there's no direct correlation there yeah
and it's it's all on how you use it how
close it is to your face that angle
you're using it there there are so many
factors you can't put a single number on
it I'm going to play the look at the
video card on the club on the camera
comparison between the s3 s4 because
honestly I remember doing the comparison
and I remember saying boy there's not
much difference here but if you look
close you can probably find some
impressive ones the difference in the
cameras primarily features between the
three and the four and that's about as
far as I'll go on that I cover it a
little more deeply in the video but
finally the fit and finish once again
we've talked about this a bit but if I'm
going to make a choice between the 3 and
the 4 i'm going to choose the four
because it looks better to me in that it
looks finished the s3 had a kind of
gross seem that ran through the mid
played that made it look like cheap
plastic
this doesn't this really looks like
metal until you touch it I happen to
like this pattern better than on the s3
it still feels like hyper glaze kind of
slimy stuff but is still it's much
better in every sense I think they made
it up a better fake metal you did they
really really went huh it does it is
right especially when you get the S view
cover on it every time ah but you know
it's ridiculous right uh janessa thank
you we uh we have to close on we're
going to close on a new person but
before you go don't interested in this
because you're an HTC super French tell
people where they can find you on the
internet and then and then tell us
whether you give the s4 a thumbs up or
down overall you can find me here you
can see it is my twitter and instagram
handler over there right there honestly
i say this i'm not a fan girl that I'm
blinded completely from every other
device or brand right um even though it
was more gimmicks than anything I think
the s4 is definitely have something
thumbs up cool donessa thank you for
joining us as always hope we'll see you
again on another episode of the you
review and thanks for squeezing three
questions into one that was a crafty
move turn that into a 3000 word
editorial stay here really quiet cuz
I'll have to leave it that sounds that
that sounds good we're down to the last
person and Taylor I believe you have 5
minutes right yeah I've got five that's
exactly exactly exactly perfect so go
we're gonna close out episode double oh
one of the you review down here with
with Dylan Dylan Kirsten welcome to the
you review on mute yourself if you're
muted and say hello top right thank you
for praying together yeah writing Dylan
do you with us not yet do you have the
the microphone on muted in the upper
right
she's got a little swagger there you go
done welcome to the show thank you thank
you for joining us where you where
you're calling from Arizona from Arizona
very nice uh it's a little earlier for
you over there good it's not the middle
of the night uh what uh what kind of
phone you working with and feel about
the galaxy s3 in that order for you can
actually have the s3 and nice I I like
it but obviously that's for much better
but go did you get the three doing uh
like Oh Mike together something okay so
it's still a new device to you I mean as
you haven't is the honeymoon phase over
who you bored of it are you still oh
yeah that's definitely over yeah he's
like uh um are you are you dined up
upgrade to the s4 over any other device
or is there a smartphone you'd pick
before the s4 if you had unlimited funds
uh either that HTC one probably that's
the big question right that's the
question always what it is but uh which
one would you lean for amin like this is
this is your your choice i mean this is
the choice you have to make either you
walk away with one of those phones or
you walk away with neither uh I probably
choose the s4 because I really know how
I feel about the like new user interface
HTC here I'm gonna get some i'm gonna
use this excuse to get some screen time
with these two devices in the same frame
together again boom there we go oh hey
camera no ah there we go so there we are
and you you're not entirely sold on the
12 ones uh what nuh uh it was your
having you x okay yeah yeah so the the
blinkfeed stuff the sense is not is not
necessarily your up and but although
it's like understood so you would stick
with what's what's familiar that would
be the driving force in getting you on
board with the s4 and it's kind of
familiar TouchWiz and all that kind of
stuff yeah but I've installed
cyanogenmod anything now you're broke
yeah
now we were talking about that before
Taylor won't we we were discussing mod
ability on each one of these things yeah
they're both flagships are both very I
don't know what you would call it I
guess they're both popular devices that
developers are all going to have their
hands all over the AT&amp;amp;T s4 is its
bootloader is locked so that's gonna
call some problems for some but there
are already mods and road and everything
else for the agency one on AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile and Sprint if i'm not mistaken
i don't know for sure because i haven't
looked at all of them so packability
there's going to be plenty of mods for
both of them but it's hard to tell so
early in the game because developers may
or may not run into snags right uh that
Dylan is that background noise coming
from your end there oh yeah oh no no no
worries i'm just making sure that i
didn't have to meet anybody it's all
right yeah I have a question now you're
only four months into the s3 when do you
think you're gonna get to the s4 and or
excuse me get to upgrade to any device
and by that time do you think you'll
still want to guess for uh and save
someone they can mortgage from but I'd
like switch to something else so sound
but Samsung as your lead contender oh
yeah well it's my her samsung phone but
i had like a motorola droid 3 last but i
don't know i just i just always take
what's the best out there yeah so your
own verizon correct yes ok so the ones
out of the question anyway let me ask
you this i want to turn this around on
you if the verizon wanna get galaxy s4
wow I'm all tongue-tied and twisted up
but if the verizon galaxy s4 has eight
locked bootloader would that turned you
away from it because you couldn't mod it
and well you could mod it but it really
kind of put a wrench in and I definitely
like a downside here but is it enough to
turn you away from the device entirely
probably not but it's definitely
something that I think about
sweet I done your uh your final thought
on the ugly s4 and and your your thumbs
up or thumbs down you are the reviewer
and you're our last review of episode
double oh one uh oh I think it's a great
coat it's just all around good phone
there's nothing too special about it but
it's mostly just an average really I had
filler well it's uh so youryour it
sounds like you're trending toward
toward thumbs up there yes well don't
tell everybody on the on the internets
where they can follow you if they wish
to do so and if you want to share uh
follow me on twitter shadow Dylan 99
very nice shadow is the name of the name
of a dog I had once also notice that I
knew anyway um no thank you thank you
for joining us Taylor do you have a give
a final thought before we close out this
episode 4i you know polling when I pass
out from heat exhaustion yes so much for
the one-hour mark give that away
completely destroyed it yeah now that is
entirely true it's good we go a little
long with pretty much everything we do I
think right yeah and I need to start
sitting down for these things my feet
are killing me oh you were standing this
whole time I've been standing all day
some well screw 8am yeah I normally
stand when I'm not in the booth I stand
but I haven't stopped doing video on
about two weeks but anyway that's coming
to a close we're coming to the tail end
of our galaxy s4 coverage overall
obvious we're going to cover it for this
entire product lifetime but the not the
honeymoon phase but the release phase is
kind of closing coming to a close here
so I'm glad that the the you review
could could help kind of tie things up
on release release double week and
Taylor I'm glad that you could be my
co-host today thank you thanks for
having me even though I haven't used
this for yet I know I know but nobody
has on the team and you and I are you
and I are good a good media co-hosts I
think something like that you know
you're good at telling me to shut up
exactly yeah well that's all it takes
really really for a good on a
relationship
but thank you to everyone who is still
with us and everyone who's already
signed off and those of you watching on
the rebroadcast thank you for a very
successful pilot episode I think of the
pocket now you review some things didn't
go quite as planned we didn't get a
device score overall but I think we came
away feeling that the galaxy s4 was a
thumbs up overall and I'm not even going
to qualify that because seriously
standing on its own I think I agree to
my score of whatever was 8.8 right
Taylor sounds right yeah 8.48 point a
point I don't know anyway read the
review go to pocketnow.com and find out
what the score was I'm so hot and tired
that we have to get out of here and
Taylor good luck in your bowling
expedition more than look so bad do
follow us on social media so you can
find out how Taylor did tonight at
bowling he is at casper tech cas p ER
tek i'm f captain two phones in pocket
now is that pocket now follow us on
facebook and google+ and if you have a
question suggestion or comment for the
you review or you just want to say hello
we are at you review at pocketnow.com
this letter you review at pocket now
