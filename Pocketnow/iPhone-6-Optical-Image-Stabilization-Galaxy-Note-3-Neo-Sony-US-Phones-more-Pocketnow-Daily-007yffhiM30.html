stabilization on their next smartphone
camera the galaxy note 3 neo just got
leaked in photos along with the current
Note 3 and Sony rethink their strategy
in the United States market finally I'm
high memory that I and if this video
doesn't go up in the next two hours look
for me at the bar at the corner please
this is pocket now daily let's turn off
with some official news as for those of
you the thought that Sonia was crazy
with their ideas of neglecting the US
market well the company has just come to
their senses they have now confirmed
that they will start with the US market
and obviously after our CES coverage we
do Z the z1 compact than the c1s I hate
these names but these are devices that
are focused on the US market which is
great and on other rumors we are hearing
that Sony is gonna work on a Windows
Phone they kind of officially said it so
let's see how that goes as Windows Phone
8.1 I can't remember when I heard about
that now so called samsung's android 4.4
kitkat update to their galaxy lineup as
we were kind of bumped about that whole
you I think that we saw at CES they're
telling you why is really cool we were
expecting it to make it to the future
galaxy lineup and that's actually going
to happen but then again if you're
talking about the current phones we've
got some sad news we've got some leaked
photographs of the you are and it looks
like the current TouchWiz so for those
of you that want samsung's new UI as
always with Samsung you'll have to buy a
new phone sadly if you were wondering
which is that secret OEM that's going to
be working alongside of boom to on their
future launch of their mobile operating
system sometime in the year 2020 well as
it turns out we are seeing that meizu is
probably going to be that OEM as we do
see some leaked photos of the mx3
running the operating system and since
we did hear that meizu wants to make a
big launch of the United States it could
be that Ubuntu is going to be the way
they're going to try this but let's just
see because you know that wound to get
reported on just about everything if
you've got the skill obviously or at
least you can fake it on a photo now
even though yesterday we were really
disappointed at Apple probably
considering to keep the 8 megapixel
sensor on their next-generation iphone
we got some patent details that say that
things could probably get interesting as
we see that Apple is finally embracing
optical image stabilization on the
camera for the feature iPhone but we
can't really guarantee that's going to
happen on the future iphone and we know
that Apple does the sort of revamp and
then improve the specification so it
could be that it could happen two years
from now but still it's great to see
Apple working on it we just wonder how
Apple plans to bring us the thin and
light design that they're famous for and
also give us the optical image
stabilization as well stay tuned for the
rumors and finally for the interesting
news of the day we finally get the first
leaked photograph of the samsung galaxy
note 3 neo alongside the current Note 3
and of you were expecting something
different this is actually a smaller
phone but not necessarily a good phone
because well it's got an LCD instead of
an AMOLED Palace got less Ram it does
have an interesting processor but
everything else is less and less which
we don't understand given the fact that
this phone is still bigger than the
galaxy s4 but again they could probably
have a different focus but that leads me
to the question of the day would you be
willing to buy a lighter note 3 if you
get less specifications than the current
one because in my particular case unless
the price tag is significantly different
there is really no purpose in this phone
really but leave us a comment down below

the drill if you want to get the news
