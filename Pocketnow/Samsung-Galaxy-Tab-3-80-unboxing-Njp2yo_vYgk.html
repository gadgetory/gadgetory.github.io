offers more choice and personalized
experiences for consumers well we'll
find out about that in our full review
but first we have to unbox it so let's
get to it I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 so one of
the first things that struck me about
the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is packaging is
just how tiny it is for comparison we
have an AT&amp;amp;T branded Galaxy Note 8.0
here and if we put the tab 8.0 on top of
the Note 8.0 packaging it doesn't look
like that big difference but this is
absolutely probably one of the smallest
tablet boxes I have seen so kudos to
Samsung for being economical in their
cardboard and of course we've got that
same wood grain here that we see on all
the new Galaxy s4 product boxes product
name on the side we'll go around to the
back see if we can get a little close
shot of the specs here we're dealing
with an 8.0 inch WXGA Super Clear LCD
1.5 gigs of ram 5 megapixel camera on
the back there's that IR blaster or IR
transmitter call out for the universal
remote control processors dual core 1.5
gigahertz Android OS obviously in a 4450
milliamp hour battery we're not supposed
to accept this product if the seal is
broken and thankfully it is not let's
just go ahead and slice on into that and
tear up the Box a little by accident oh
well here and let's see what we can do
ah look at the color action happening
here yeah I was wondering about this so
as far as the color goes here on this
device I was wondering which one we were
going to get the new Galaxy Tabs come in
either a white or what Samsung calls
eight unique gold Brown and it's pretty
clear which one this is this is a this
is a difficult color to describe we're
gonna come back to it in a second let's
see what what is in the box in terms of
inventory here
so kind of an interesting unboxing
experience here trying to pull that
Center module out it doesn't really
cooperate but this Center box contains
all of the accessories that come in the
package there's a USB cable of course
the standard Samsung charger that we've
come to expect and what looks like some
documentation and that's about it we
have a encouragement to register the
product
what is this Galaxy Tab Quick Start
Guide that's nice and is this the
warranty yeah this is yeah health and
safety and warranty guy just in case we
were wondering how to keep safe while
using a tablet very very important and a
call out for samsung watch on of course
Samsung missing no opportunity to
promote its software efforts let's get
this stuff out of here and get back to
the tablet so here is the Tab 3 8.0
finished in this unique gold Brown that
we heard about before some more specs
called out on the display it's nothing
that we didn't already see on the box
but it's nice to be reminded of what the
device is packing I'm very interested in
the color here so let's take off the
back protector first if we can wow
that's satisfying now this is quite an
interesting color here it's appearing
somewhat black in my viewfinder here but
it's actually quite a warm brown almost
a ruddy brown it's it's kind of
difficult to describe see if I can get a
different angle for you here up against
the wall maybe it is a bit more evident
that this is a very very unique color
somewhat better than I expected you'll
notice that instead of silver the camera
of bezel here is finished in a sort of
brassy kind of a ruddy brassy tone and
so is the bezel on the side of the
device which also recalls the galaxy s4
of course up and back around to the
front of the device we'll take the
opportunity to take the screen protector
off silence please
and there is that beautiful 8.0 inch
display we don't know if it's beautiful
until we turn it on but right now it's
flat sheet of very smooth glass and it
looks nice we got some other plastic on
the sides here that can come off
progressively as we as we take you on a
tour of the hardware here down low
you'll notice the three buttons that
have come to characterize the Galaxy S
Line the home button in the center and
the capacitive back and menu keys along
side the only distinctive feature on the
back is that five megapixel autofocus
camera taking it around to the side we
can see the power standby button volume
up and down and the IR transmitter on
the right-hand side on the left-hand
side the only distinguishing
characteristic is the micro SD card slot
and down bottom the dual speaker ports
and the micro USB port now before we
power on the unit for the first time
we're gonna show you a couple devices
next to it first is the galaxy s4 no
mystery at all where the design
influences are coming from on this line
Samsung making a big point of staying
consistent in their Galaxy products
these days and this is about as
consistent as you can get and since we
teased it with the packaging before
there's no reason not to pop open this
AT&amp;amp;T branded Galaxy Note 8.0 which we've
already reviewed by the way the
international version of the Note 8.0
that is we reviewed several weeks back
in terms of aesthetics there's not much
difference between the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0
and the Galaxy Note 8.0 once again
consistency is the name of the game here
which would be even more apparent
if these colors were identical right off
the bat though you can see the Note 8.0
has some really really hefty bezels on
the side whereas the Tab 8.0 and the tab
3 8.0 does not very very slim bezels
there but consistency in the volume
rocker placement the standby key the IR
blaster all that kind of stuff round
back they've moved to reshuffle the
camera a little bit we're not gonna talk
about specs at all just just aesthetics
but the main value at of course in the
node 8 is the s-pen absent on the galaxy
tab and for our last trick we'll go
ahead and power on the new tab 38.0
press and hold and power and there we go
we can see by the brightening around the
edges this is an LCD panel and as it
powers up we'll just mention here that
the tab 38.0 it packs the same line of
features found in the rest of the galaxy
lineup or the more recent galaxy lineup
the IR blaster comes with the universal
remote
along with Samsung's watch on service
which we saw called out in the
literature earlier and of course the
access to the Samsung various Samsung
content stores and of course TouchWiz
running on top of an Android and there's
our welcome screen and ready to assure

Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 hope you
