today is the fourth of july in america
that's independence day and to me that's
a really big deal you see I'm a deeply
patriotic individual so today I thought
I'd show you some apps that I found for
Android that have to do with
independence that have to do with the
Constitution and some stuff that just
has to do with fireworks let's go take a
look alright first of all all the apps
that i'm going to show you here today
are available for free in the android
market just search the market for the
app name the first one I'd like to show
you is called fourth of July quotes
which would be better titled
independence day quotes but we'll
forgive the developer for the time being
hopefully he'll push out a patch all
this is is a collection of quotes this
one for example says a man is morally
free when in full possession of his
living humanity he judges the world and
judges other men with uncompromising
sincerity there are those I know who
will say that the liberation of humanity
the freedom of man and mind is nothing
but a dream they are right it is the
American dream just fabulous quotes I
wish this was in a widget so you could
have it rotating on your screen all the
time perhaps the app developer is
watching this video and we'll take that
recommendation to heart but there's tons
and tons more but we are kind of short
on time for this video so let's move on
to the next one next one is patriotic
quotes it follows the same basic thread
as the first app that I just showed you
but rather than just quotes about
independence or independence day in
particular these quotes are more generic
to patriotic values on more focused to
American patriotic values but they
should apply to Patriots and in really
statesmanship all around the world again
same type of user interface still paid
for by ads so you don't have to pay a
penny of your own money in the mark
get place and has some really really
good quotes moving along we've got
Benjamin Franklin quotes which is really
great Benjamin Franklin was one of my
favorite founding fathers he's just an
amazing man if you've ever read any of
his papers the same type of information
more quotes these are categorized so you
can see what topic it's talking about
you can even favorite a quote just by
tapping on the star and then look that
up later in your favorites collection so
that's one feature that I like in this
app that the others don't have moving
along let's go over here to some
documents first and foremost the Pledge
of Allegiance this app simply has an
American flag the title and the Pledge
of Allegiance just in case you didn't
know what the words were and sometimes
it's nice to go back and review what the
words actually say because we've been
reciting this from memory since we were
in kindergarten it's nice to go back and
reread it this app goes a little bit
deeper going into the menu lets you go
into lyrics for various American
patriotic song so that's kind of nice to
that they put that into the app that was
just the Pledge of Allegiance it gives a
little bit more utility and takes up
very little space next is the United
States Declaration of Independence which
just very simply is the declaration of
independence has some interesting page
turn animations that are a little bit
processor intensive but this is really
the document that America was founded
upon and from this document then came
the next one which is the United States
Constitution with the preamble the
articles all the way down into the
amendments and lucky for us it's got all
the amendments in here so we can go and
check them out recent one in the news is
the second amendment we just had a
Supreme Court case rule that the Second
Amendment does guarantee an individual's
right to keep and bear arms
and that does apply not only to the
federal government but to the states
cities counties municipalities watch the
news there's going to be lots of
fireworks I happen about that one and
speaking of fireworks we're almost there
hang on we're getting close okay next is
this app which is kind of fun it's a
little bit inappropriately named and I
can't see if I can get the name of it
for you over here it's called the
Christian Patriot now if you're not
Christian that's fine stick with me on
this okay the reason that i want to show
you this is you've got this us a tab
over on the USA tab you've got all these
different things Birth of a Nation the
Mayflower Compact so it's a very
historical document but the reason I
wanted to include it today is because of
this it's the Federalist Papers now if
you don't know the federalist papers are
a series of essays that were written
written by a few of our founding fathers
back in the 1780s 17 87 and 88 to be
precise and sent to various new york
state newspapers back in the day the
federalist papers are a look into what
the founding fathers were intending when
they were writing the Constitution than
the initial ten amendments the Bill of
Rights so really nice to have of course
there's some theology and some creeds
and whatnot in here as well that follow
the the judeo-christian line of thought
so if you're into that stuff it's a good
app too but still a very good
Independence Day app of course we can't
get too far without Congress and I've
already written a review on this but it
bears showing again here the Congress
app is one of the best ways in my
opinion to find out what your elected
officials are doing at the federal level
and I would really love if these would
get these guys would develop something
that was more state county and even city
level and I know that's an awful lot of
data to aggregate so it's a huge task
but I would love if they have that kind
of granularity here so nice and here's
this is the the home screen that you get
you can find your legislators again
these are federal legislators by your
location so if you're vacationing
somewhere it'll show
you who your legislators are in that
particular area of the country in this
case we've got bob bennett who we
recently fired for not listening to his
constituency orrin hatch the senior
senator from Utah and Rob Bishop let's
go in and take a look at orrin hatch and
I'm choosing him because he's pretty
active on Twitter you can see it brings
in a picture it shows you what parties
in in this case he's a Republican from
Utah and he's holding a junior seat
you've got one touch access to call his
DC office which is brilliant if you've
got any questions comments whatever tap
call leave a message for the senator hey
I like what you're doing here I don't
like what you're doing here vote for
this vote against this whatever just
really fast really quick really
convenient gives you one touch access to
his website what bills he's currently
sponsoring a whole bunch of stuff there
which is great not necessarily the bill
said he's sponsoring but it's great you
can see what he's doing and then the
committee's that he's on so if you don't
like what he's doing with for example
financial reform Senate Committee on
Finance he's a powerful guy so you can
really lay on him and say hey I don't
like this or I do like this or whatever
so nice stuff there you've also got news
this pulls in news articles where the
good senator was mentioned Twitter which
is his Twitter feeds really cool right
there and if you've got the Twitter app
installed you can tap to respond and
then open up a dialogue that way
unfortunately most senators don't pay
attention to messages or even direct
messages sent to them via Twitter but
it's nice to get out a little bit of
information to others who are following
that Senator when when you mention that
name other people can see that you're
talking to the senator and can either a
lie with you or or have a diff any
differing opinion so really nice to open
things up and have a little bit more
transparency last tab is YouTube which
is just what it sounds like it's where
in this case senator hatch has been
captured on YouTube talking about the
Supreme Court nominee Kagan filibusters
immigration reform yada yada yada
and it just tap play the YouTube video
but since this is Independence Day and I
know most of you are not looking about
how you can contact your legislator on
independent state you're really after
what fireworks now fireworks has a long
tradition in the United States it goes
back to back to the founding of our
country really you're familiar with the
song has the phrase the bombs bursting
in air I'll let you look that one up if
you don't know what it is and I sure
hope you do but fireworks are a
reenactment if you will of that night
it's not just a spectacle to look and
see and say wow that's pretty you should
really think about the men and the women
who died sacrificing themselves for
their country for the liberation and
freedom that we as American citizens now
enjoy then I realize a lot of you aren't
in America so I appreciate that that you
can look at our traditions in our
holidays and see how how fanatical we
are about them and not hold it against
us if you will but this app first and
foremost its fireworks but it's a
firework safety rules app only use
fireworks outdoors never give fireworks
two young children always wear safety
glasses just a whole bunch of rules not
a bad thing to say okay kids if you want
to use fireworks here go read the rules
and you've got it right there on your
phone so that's really nice and of
course the last thing that I want to
show you is a live wallpaper you get
back and get to live wallpaper and this
one is just that it is fireworks there
are some settings that you can configure
but we're just going to go ahead and set
the wallpaper and you can see here we've
got a nice night sky with fireworks
being thrown up in the air and exploding
so that we can remember these bombs
bursting in air which gave proof through
the night that the United States flag
was still flying so kind of neat and for
patriotic holiday
I hope you can go out and grab a couple
of these apps on the holiday is not just
about fireworks and it's not the fourth
of July it is Independence Day which
carries a lot more meaning so be safe
this holiday season subscribe to our
video channel so you get more of these
types of videos and of course leave us
comments down below I'd like especially
to hear from my non-us friends out there
to get your take on our independence day
possibly when your independence day is
what traditions you have maybe you don't
do fireworks maybe you do something else
very interested to see what those are
just feedback and let us know and of
course like I already mentioned be safe
have fun and remember all the people
that have sacrificed their lives and are
currently serving their freedom for you
and for are not American brothers as
well so my hats off to all those
currently serving and all those who have
served in the past and wishing you a
safe and happy holiday i'm joe from
