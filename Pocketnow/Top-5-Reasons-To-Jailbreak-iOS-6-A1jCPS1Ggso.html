is the question evasion for iOS 6 was
just released and we know there are a
lot of you that are still on the ropes
trying to decide if it's right for you
so I'm high memory beta this is
PocketNow
and these are the top 5 reasons why you
should jailbreak iOS 6
number 5 it's extremely simple all you
have to do is download evasion to your
Windows PC OS 10 computer or even Linux
based computer and simply connect your
iOS 6 compatible device to the computer
and hit the jailbreak button it's not
like an Android where you have to root
and unlock the bootloader with different
procedures that sometimes we require to
remember the do s prompts and everything
no it works on everything and all you
have to do is press a button that's it
number 4
you're really not risking the device you
really can't brick an iOS device and
that's really cool about it I mean even
jailbreaking is bulletproof whatever
other people have told you it's not
really true if something ever goes wrong
with your jailbreak all you have to do
is place a device in DFU mode which is
another video that I could probably show
you later and once that's done I mean
your phone is back to whatever it was it
restores the factory settings and then
you just try jailbreaking it again it's
that simple
number three it's completely free and if
anybody has ever tried to charge you for
jailbreaking their device obviously if
they're doing it for you then it's fine
for them to charge you but really
jailbreaking is free all you have to do
is access the website and the links down
below and download the jailbreak and
you'd get it for free you really don't
need the help from anybody but again if
you really want to stay safe it probably
just hired somebody to do it but again
the good thing about it is it's
completely free you're not obligated to
donate it you don't really have to pay
anything that you see on eBay number two
Cydia whenever you think about why you
would want to jailbreak well the truth
is there's actually another app store
out there that's not really only the ios
app store city is the store that offers
you different types of tweaks some of
them are free some of them are paid for
but they'll give you the opportunity to
side little different things that you
can do with your iOS device that are not
really intended and some of them are
really actually so cool that even
apple's eventually use them in the
future so it's really worth it and the
top number one reason why you should
jailbreak iOS 6 is because iOS 6 is
boring it is terribly boring Apple has
not changed the UI and the operating
system for the past five almost six
years
it is completely dated and if you think
about it the departure between iOS 4 and
iOS 5 was great there were some great
things coming to iOS 5 but then iowa's 6
just completely threw everything down
the drain there have been so many
complaints that Apple stock is down
nobody is trusting Apple they even fired
the head of iOS
simply because it sucks so you know to
be honest with you there are a lot of
great developers in Cydia up to the
point where some of them have even been
hired by Apple there are a lot of great
things that you can do with jailbreaking
iOS 6 device so we do recommend you give
it a try it's just worth it and again if
something goes wrong simply go DFU and
go back to what you had even if it's
boring that's it for today's top 5 thank
