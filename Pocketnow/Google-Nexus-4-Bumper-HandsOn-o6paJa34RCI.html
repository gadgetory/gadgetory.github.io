now that some of the hype about Google's
newest smartphone the Nexus 4 has
started to wear off a little bit we want
to go back and take a look at well one
of the only accessories that's available
for it it's the Nexus 4 bumper it comes
in a really big box will unbox it will
show you what it looks like so if you
want to get it for your nexus 4 right
now inside this deceptively lightweight
box is our Nexus 4 bumper let's go ahead
and cut into it will use the Kershaw
official unboxing blade it's a shout out
to Michael Fisher and his blade it's
also some filler so that you don't have
to sit in silence well I'm unboxing this
guy go ahead and open the box inside
we've got packing material we've got
shipping information and we've got this
plastic case opening that up is
relatively easy i say as i make it look
at it buckles slide that out of the way
and now we have just a sheet of paper
really cardboard with the bumper on top
kind of suspended on this little bump
out that's about it on the back it says
bumper case customize your Nexus 4 with
a lightweight bumper case and it says
that in lots of languages made in Korea
interestingly enough so you might be
able to rock your phone Gangnam style
now looking around up at the top we've
got a hole for our headphone jack we've
got a microphone hole we've got kind of
the same look that we had on the the
Nexus 4 which is up on the top we've got
kind of a black color we've got a semi
metallic plastic looks like plastic any
way around the middle and then black
down on the bottom as well moving around
to the side we have an actual physical
button for your power and that just
passes right through if you can see that
on the inside over here we've got our
volume up and down also as a physical
button so this is going to look like a
an actual part of the phone not just an
accessory going around it looking at the
bottom now we've got a nice big opening
for the micro us being another
microphone hole down there and really
that's it in fact you can see kind of
comes apart a little bit until then it's
not going to be problem since we're
going to have a phone in there holding
it out but just to show you it is
actually a couple separate pieces in
there feeling it it's a little bit
textured a little bit gritty which is a
kind of a good thing this is supposed to
help you hold on to your phone a little
bit better since it's got this lip on
the back we're going to put the phone in
from the front and I like starting out
with the button side it's a little bit
pliable and there we go it's on it's
that's it it installs very very easily
the buttons are quite responsive volume
up volume down they work really well in
fact you wouldn't know that this is a
bumper unless we showed you that it was
a bumper you might just think it's part
of the phone it's that integrated and
that stylistic which is nice so looking
at it the the bumper does elevate the
back of the phone off the surface of
whatever you're setting it down on so
that's going to protect it from getting
any Nick's or scratches down here on the
back that's very nice especially because
scratches eventually lead to cracks and
you've got a couple of crack points
right down here where their holes in the
glass already for the camera and speaker
on the front however it also does that
which I I realize you've got to do that
so it has something to grip on to but
it's kind of a pain because one of the
nice things about this phone is it's see
if I can get it back out again is this
nice curved front I don't want to call
it a bevel because it's more rounded
it's rounded on the sides and then just
nice and flat on the top which is really
really nice for when you're swiping
because you've got a nice gentle
graceful approach into the swipe right
to left and I love that about this phone
putting the bumper on it however
interrupts that you lose that entirely
and now you're dealing with just like
any other phone has a hard edge to it
now you've got that hair as well overall
it doesn't look like it adds any
noticeable weight to the device it
doesn't look like it adds any noticeable
width or height to it it looks like it's
essentially part of the device like it
was designed for it and they just kind
of left it off when they shipped it to
you the twenty dollar accessory I don't
know if that's worth it or not but if
we're considering it might protect the
front or back glass from getting cracked
or scratched that cost a lot more than
twenty bucks to fix so overall I like it
quite a bit we're going to run with this
for a few days and I think everything is
going to come up peachy from what
everybody's saying it's a nice device
it's an it's a nice accessory for your
device we like it we think it's worth it
for you to buy if you've got any kind of
concerns about cracking or scratching if
you've already got this device on your
Nexus 4 we want to know head over to
pocketnow.com leave us some comments
down in the comments section on the
article do that over at pocket now
rather than here on youtube if you're
watching it on YouTube just because we
like to keep all the comments together
in one place so we can all learn from
one another's experiences let us know if
you like it or if you don't like it and
why that's kind of the big part of that
question is why do you like it why do
you not like it 4-pocket now showing off
the nexus 4 bumper i'm joe levi thanks
