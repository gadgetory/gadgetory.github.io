full screen display thanks to a neat
party trick with the selfie cameras
specs on the less expensive pixels
continue to arrive along with the
possible launch date and Apple's
quarterly results show that sales are
not what the company is handling best um
hi I'm Adam Iveta and where I'm from it
should be Labor Day and we commemorate
it by working this is pocket out daily
sponsored by the 1 plus 7 pro the
official news today begin with deals
believe it or not Apple products
continue to be on sale if you want that
new iPad Mini the current one it's three
hundred and eighty nine dollars right
now for the base model on Amazon and for
those of you interested in air pods if
you want to get the new air pods without
the wireless charging case it's 140
bucks on Costco you can find the one
with the wireless charging case for 180
which is great it's so rare to see Apple
products on sale now I guess the main
reason why we get to see so many
discounts from Apple is because they're
quarter results are not going great
iPhone sales are down 17% and surely
they're making a ton of money up to 31
billion dollars in sales so it's not
like if they're dying because they're
selling less but then we see other
interesting aspects like products like
iPads that are selling more in addition
to Macs and then their wearables have
also grown significantly up to 30% so
it's clear that Apple's focus continues
to be iphones when it comes to numbers
but they need to figure something out
now let's move the spotlight over to the
Oppo Reno 5g which pretty much just
launched in Switzerland making it pretty
much the first 5g phone to launch in
Europe even if the service doesn't
necessarily work everywhere right now
specifications are gray qualcomm
snapdragon 855 in addition to all the
usual suspects and the price tag 980
bucks which for 5g phone that's actually
really good now let's talk about the
Google pixel 3 a pixel 3 a excel I'm so
scratching my head over specifications
which continue to not show anything
above the snapdragon 700 series it seems
that they're both on the 600 series and
we've got some interesting sources that
claim that we're getting nitesite on
these pixels and usually you need a
really good isp to be coupled with that
which
is not necessarily what's available on
these processors but then again it seems
that we are getting a launch in India on
May 8th meaning that it'll pretty much
launch after Google i/o whatever the
case may be we will be covering Google
i/o so we'll keep you posted on whatever
happens
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with Samsung and their
approach to the knotch
even if the galaxy fold is the complete
opposite of the approach to the notch we
have seen the company do great things
with the Infinity oh the Infinity V and
now we hear that in addition to
everything that's been done with the
Infinity V where we noticed that the
sensors are behind the display no longer
need to be shown optically apparently
they've found the solution for the
camera and that we can't see that
solution as soon as next year on
smartphones which I find to be great
but in today's question let us know I
mean what do you think do you think
that's a good approach or not because
honestly in my case after seeing that
galaxy a series that pops up and then
flips over for you to use the primary
camera for photography I wish that
selfie cameras got better not
necessarily just hidden that's just me
leave us a comment down below let us
know what you think
