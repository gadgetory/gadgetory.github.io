gained new popularity thanks to cameras
like the gear 360 but what about 3d
audio there are very many expensive
tools to achieve this but Sennheiser has
just come up with a solution for the
rest of us
I'm hi meadow Nevada with pocket now
with some late coverage for Mika GPC and
Lisbon and meet the Sennheiser AM Bo
smart headset so even though the
Sennheiser AM BL is an audio headset it
actually serves a much different purpose
decades ago it was envisioned that the
best way to portray the ambient sound
you hear is to actually add microphones
to your ears and well that's exactly
what this headset is it adds microphones
to your ears the technical term is
binaural audio just like in the case of
the sennheiser clip-on that I use to
record audio for my videos the company
has partnered again with apogee to build
this mvo headset that takes advantage of
Apple's lightning protocol what this
means is that you don't really need an
application for the new headset to work
you simply put them on connect them to
the Lightning port on your iOS device
and record video using the standard
video recorder built into your phone the
headset will instruct iOS to use the
omnidirectional microphones on the
headset instead of the iPhones
microphone and voila your iPhone video
has now been recorded in 3d audio
whenever you play the video back you'll
hear the cars driving and the birds
chirping from the direction they were at
when you recorded them if you're
thinking this is very cool it actually
is the fact that it made it for
consumers is even better this product is
actually very far from mass production
but Sennheiser was nice enough to build
enough of these for the e5 GPC attendees
at Lisbon and yeah I'm one of them so
now that's products like the gear 360
work with iOS and recording audio from
the Ambu you're pretty much got the
tools you need for a true 360 immersive
video and audio experience and yes there
will be a version for Android coming
later
a year so stay tuned as we report back
on that well that happens make sure you
follow us on social media and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one
it also follow me on twitter Hein
underscore event on instagram at hi meri
that please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am
highlighting that I thanks so much for
watching we'll see you soon with more
coverage from me for GPC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
