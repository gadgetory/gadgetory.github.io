pixel phones but we don't have a pastry
name nor do we see many benefits
it looks like Apple may be switching
from Samsung displaced to BOE in the
next generation iPhone and the Google
pixel 3 Excel light was benchmarked
again and apparently it's even less
powerful than we thought
I'm Jaime Rivera and now today is
Thursday and we know what happens after
that this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals and
really good ones on amazon currently the
unlocked variant of the samsung galaxy
note 9 is just 720 bucks less than the
s10 II and well it's the unlocked 128
gigabyte variant it's one of my favorite
phones of last year definitely I feel
that the prices are still considering
that you can now get Android 1 on this
phone so yeah now let's talk about Apple
as according to analysts the company is
planning to sell up to 10 billion
dollars in revenue with their new
streaming services by gaining 100
million users and the way they want to
do that is by having just one streaming
service that does many things
sort of like Amazon Prime everyone I
mean I wonder what the value is here we
hear that there will be unique content
from Oprah Jennifer Aniston Steven
Spielberg but let's see what they show
off It's Showtime
now let's talk about the Google pixel 3
in pixel 3 accel light we were hearing
that we were going to see the debut of
the talk of snapdragon 710 processor in
these phones and therefore they were
gonna be less expensive but not
necessarily chumps they were gonna be
good phones now we've got sources
claiming that know that there are
benchmarks that show that it's the
Snapdragon 625 which makes me wonder how
that isp is gonna pull off great
photography on those pixels and the
price tags weren't really rumoured to be
great so I'm starting to get worried
noticeable the spotlight over to Apple
and the next generation iPhones as we
hear that the company might not be using
Samsung panels anymore
and this is a big concern as we do know
that Samsung makes the best displays in
the industry apparently they're making a
shift of boe because they're capable of
building displays that are asked good
but with a thinner profile to make the
phone thinner so
all right we'll see let's let us know in
the comments what you think about that
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with Android cue and its launch
you might be wondering why we have a ton
of video on the features to be fully
honest with you I mean I saw what it is
and I was like yeah I mean we don't have
a pastry name which is fine that usually
is the case we do know that this might
be Android 10 if you notice the cue it
pretty much signifies a one and A zero
but then the changes are mostly privacy
oriented now you will have more granular
control over your location information
but then other than having better
theming options by being able to change
the accent colors and a dark mode that
only works if you set off you know
battery saver and other things I just I
don't see significant changes here
probably there under the hood and we
don't get to see them maybe they'll
finally make pixels fast again whatever
the case might be let us know in the
comments down below one what do you
think do you like what you see here and
not and two of you'd like to see more
coverage from us on this because
obviously I'd rather wait for the next
beta we actually even have a full
timeline of the betas because I don't
see anything hot here so far but this is
just me leave us a comment down below
and obviously if you want to know how to
install it on your pixel there are
instructions in the description as well
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on packing out on
comments trip to both of our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one and follow me on Twitter I mean
underscoring that are on Instagram at
high metal data please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hating that I thank so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
