no longer an ipad air Microsoft begins
to throw the towel on porting Android
applications to windows 10 mobile an HTC
makes a ton of promises over what to
expect for the one m10 I'm hi meri behna
and as we pack our stuff to leave
Barcelona or nostalgic we want to party
some more this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with both
Leica and huawei as both companies have
now partnered in a long-term
relationship with the whole idea of
improving smartphone cameras not that
smart phone cameras your bad this time
nor is it that Huawei hasn't done an
amazing job with devices like the Nexus
6p but the fact that these companies
want to collaborate to build something
better is great news we just don't know
exactly when it will start other
official news come from Microsoft as the
company has a not necessarily set it out
loud but they pretty much killed project
historia and for those of you that don't
know what that is that's the whole
concept of porting Android applications
to windows 10 mobile right now the only
option you'll have is pointing iOS
applications because according to them
they wanted to avoid confusion as of all
android applications are available on
iOS but anyways as will the spotlight
over to HTC as we hear that the company
is planning some very hot changes with
the one I'm ten we see the teasers now
we hear that number one it will start at
16 gigabytes which is terrible in this
day and age but the other very important
ones are that if you see executives are
claiming that the camera is going to be
great and they've said that for the
longest of time so we want to see it
happen this time that's a very
interesting developments from analysts
are claiming that the iPhone 5s he is
not necessarily going to help Apple
Apple has a tremendous black log of
supplies in orders because seems that
obviously their current iphones haven't
really sold as much as the company wants
to and apparently the whole project of
bringing a smaller iphone is to fix that
but analysts don't think that it will
happen it's very hard to predict it'll
all depend on what design comes what
Apple does to promote it
and we've known that Cupertino doesn't
always win and finally the very
interesting news today have to do again
with Apple but this time with its iPad
lineup we've been dubbing at the ipad
air three ever since we've started
hearing about the rumors but seems that
that's not going to be the name
apparently this device will not only
look like the iPad pro but also shave
the air name we've seen Apple kind of
doing that we saw the new macbook which
is lighter than the ipad in the macbook
dare sorry apparently that's going to be
the case here this project will be
something different could it be that
it'll be called the ipad again and it
leads me to the question of today would
you buy a new ipad regardless of
whatever name let's just say that Apple
brings a revolutionary new tablet what
exactly would that tablet have to bring
for you to want to buy it in my case I'd
love the speakers but I would also love
some more productivity leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion and friends you know the
