company is dubbing as the speed you need
and also the boldest evolution that
we've seen from the company in recent
years it's arriving earlier than
expected to an already crowded markets
and this time with a slight bump in the
price tag I'm high metal II that I would
pocket now and to learn if it's worth
the price change and all the hype join
us for our full review I've always found
the never settle slogan to be peculiar
it's a bold call to consumers and the
aggressive pricing on every model pretty
much meant you shouldn't settle to pay
more for what you get now the reason why
I use the word peculiar is that in
previous models there was always
something missing but notice I said in
previous models the one plus six is a
significant departure from the past we
have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 in the
front and the back adding a tad more
weight and quality to the feel in
addition to a glossy finish to the
horizon line if you go for the mirror
black variant that we have here little
things like the mute slider on the side
continue to be reasons why I love to
come back to a oneplus device I also
praised the vertical approach to the new
dual cameras in the fingerprint scanner
meaning wobbling on a table will at
least be uniform this time and yes I
also compliment the company's cases
because they're very affordable and they
feel like if they fit the phone as part
of the hardware the quality extents of
the internals this is literally the most
powerful smartphone you can buy today
thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
options for 6 or 8 gigs of ram 64 128 or
256 gigs of non-expandable storage a
3300 milliamp hour battery dual-sim
capabilities both supporting LTE and
this time gigabit OT were available
no there is no wireless charging but
once you try - charging trust me you
won't really care and even if there is
no IP rating the company does confirm
that it is
splash proof now the elephant in the
room is the notch on the top of the
display but trust me I'd prefer this
approach any day over the bezels of the
past at six point two eight inches
diagonal and nineteen by nine aspect
ratio
this full HD optic AMOLED screen is
actually one of my favorites and it's
mainly because of the 84% screen to body
ratio about the only thing that I wish
that were here are dual firing speakers
to complement content consumption but at
least we get a headphone jack and the
audio performance on this phone is
really good and for those of you asking
why this phone is being dubbed the speed
you need let's talk about oxygen OS five
point one point two it continues to be
my favorite approach the Android given
its flexibility and taste and design if
anything I'd even call this more stark
than what we get on the current Google
pixel - there's a new GP optimization
feature that detects layers that are not
important to the user experience and
whatever app you launch and it just
simply doesn't load them the result is
precious resources being saved that
translate into a smooth user experience
that I still find this class-leading I
love cool features like reading mode
making a return for those of us that
want black and right reading to avoid
eye strain this also continues to be one
of the most useful ambient displays in
my opinion the company is also enhancing
what it now dubs as game mode to help
these launch faster optimize network
performance and save battery and trust
me in my experience gaming on this phone
is definitely great
flexibility comes in the form of either
gestures or buttons for the user
interface out of which I actually
recommend the latter yes I find the
gestures very natural and practical to
navigate and I love having all this
screen available to me the problem is
when you try launching the Google
assistant and there is no gesture for it
you actually have to call on it but then
again as I said at the beginning buttons
continue to be as flexible as they were
in the past with extra mapping options
for commands of e double tap or press
and hold I've been using the 1 + 6 for
nearly 2 weeks between New York City and
London phone calls are very crisp and
the experience extends to the speakers
and during my experience testing it on
t-mobile I found it to be amazing and
clinging to Wi-Fi and data battery life
has been good I wouldn't call it better
than competing devices but definitely
competitive enough even while sporting a
smaller power pack than most of the
devices it stands up against I'm not
gonna deny that I also enjoy features
like face to unlock which since the 5 t
continues to be blazing fast and I also
love conveniences like the new Bullitt
wireless headphones which is the phone
quickly the text and that provide great
audio at an amazing value
but fine let's switch to the most
important topic of this phone the camera
this has always been the company's
Achilles heel at least until now we have
a new Sony IMX 5/19 sensor in the
primary shooter at 16 megapixels at 1.7
aperture 1.2 2 microns and both E is and
oh is the secondary 20 megapixel cameras
at F 1.7 aperture and single microns now
the interesting mix here is that the
second one is really just to assist with
portrait mode the resulting photos are
just shocking I seriously think the
company finally figured it out
and it could be thanks to their own
enhanced HDR solution I mean sure you
know that during the day this phone is
gonna perform well pretty much like most
other flagships with great color
saturation and detail the thing is my
photography has seriously improved I
notice important things like zero lens
flare minimal light spill and just
overall a well composed night shot which
was a serious problem with the 5 t even
in cases like moving subjects the camera
is fast to take the shot and performs
admirably and then portrait photos are
also really natural less of that fake
background blurring that we see from
competing devices and no gimmicks like
fake lighting effects that never really
work selfie portraits are still not
available at the time of this review but
they will arrive with a software update
soon and overall selfie performance was
good as well but depending on the
situation this probably might only
complain with the cameras quite noisy
and low light if you don't use the
screen flash and as for video recording
my impressions are that it is awesome
particularly in stabilization while
you're filming you won't really see the
work going on in the background but the
resulting video is very stable through
both E is and OIS and even if I'm not a
fan of the crop for selfie video the
result is also very stable
and believe it or not I will praise the
slow-mo video where the company doesn't
just let you record seconds at a time
but a full minute and 480 frames per
second at 720p or 240 frames per second
at 1080p to conclude I honestly asked
myself the question could it really be
could it be that this is the one
finally the oneplus device that truly
has every single element that embodies
the slogan never settle from a rice
stand I honestly think it is you have
great build quality great specifications
great software good battery life and
finally a great camera these are
seriously all the things that I
personally look for in a smartphone for
it to become my daily driver add the
fact that this phone pretty much retails
at almost half the price of certain flat
ships and I don't really need to say
more the oneplus 6 mate finally crossed
the $500 price mark but I'd pay that
extra nudge any day for a phone that
finally addresses my needs this is
definitely a phone that I recommend you
consider for 2018
