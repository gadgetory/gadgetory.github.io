calm we've got one highly anticipated
Windows Phone for you today this is the
Nokia Lumia 800 we're gonna box it right
away all right here we go now the box is
a nice matte finish so we have the phone
printed on there and it goes around the
sides there's a little info I have a red
one over there so it's all matte so kind
of refreshing to see it's not shiny
orange box and we have a little tab
right here
that's what slides it open and here we
go it's assuming a little bit just so
you can see there's the device

little tab here to open it up very good
looking Wow all right we're gonna take a
look at that later let's see what else
we got

it I assume that is for info
we have book lifts lots of different
languages so that's good we got
different versions alright let's try
what else we have I know what that means
little rubber case
black case that's nice good to have a
case and we have a microUSB cable and
your charger with USB port and it's
white that's it in there and over here
we have some headphones looks like just
little regular headphones see if they
have a button on them and just one
button one little button on the
headphones silvery doesn't look like
they might be pretty good all right

comparisons with a few other thoughts

device there so here it is next - lets
see the n8

good size somewhere size to that and
