the fiercest competitive markets ever in
the quest to stand out from the pack
some companies make bold moves and
succeed brilliantly others are more meek
and fade into the unexceptional
background still others fill the space
between innovating once and then
endlessly iterating over and over again
then there are those that just screw it
all up
thanks to choices that are either too
bold too meek or just plain old
absolutely insane these are the products
that fall flat on their face they're not
to be mocked but the lessons they teach
should certainly be remembered one in 10
smartphones sold globally last quarter
was an iPhone that device introduced in
2007 has proven one of the most
impactful devices to hit the mobile
landscape ever but most people don't
remember that there was an Apple
sanctioned mobile phone before the
iPhone and had it proven successful
today's smartphone landscape would look
very different indeed I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow
this is the Moto ROKR e1 and this is
episode 4 of pocket now's worst gadgets
ever
the Moto ROKR e1 debuted in the fall of
2005 a world where feature phones still
reigned supreme and smartphones were
devices for geeks and people who worked
too hard even in that low expectations
environment though the e1 almost
immediately failed to impress the phone
didn't even feature a new design it was
actually just a rebranded Motorola e3 98
which at that point was over a year old
and about as sexy and design as its
model name suggests in a world where the
typical high-end cellular phone camera
was already pushing 2 megapixels the
rockers VGA shooter was pretty horrible
as was its tiny 1.9 inch display and
considering Motorola was the company
behind the widely acclaimed razor
launched less than a year prior the e
ones chintzy plastic build quality was
nothing short of embarrassing this is
the last phone you'd have expected a
company like Apple to go anywhere near
so why was the Moto ROKR e1 unveiled by
Steve Jobs himself at a September 2005
Apple event because the e1 was the
first-ever
iTunes phone that's right this cheap
plastic bar of soap is the
great-great-great great-great granddaddy
of the modern iPhone but that doesn't
mean that Apple was necessarily excited
about the product and judging from the
audience reaction at the unveiling
neither was the technology press warning
what you're about to see is severely
underwhelming and given Steve Jobs tone
it's pretty clear that he knows it is
made by Motorola we have designed the
iTunes client and worked with them to
integrate it into the phone it's called
a motorola rokr
ROK r and it's pretty cool phone where
yeah I'll talk to you later thanks bye
so I go there and I just resume my music
right back to where it was well I was
supposed to resume my music right back
to where it was
I hit the wrong button but you can
resume your music right back to where it
was if you hit the right one the e1
launched exclusively on singular in the
United States and it was immediately
clear that it wasn't what people had
been waiting for from Apple besides its
shoddy build quality and hopelessly
outdated feature set the iTunes client
itself was crippled sure there was a
dedicated itunes button to jump right
into the media player and the interface
looked like that of an iPod and there
were even hints of later greatness like
the phone's ability to pause and auto
resume playback after a phone call but
the iTunes app was fundamentally flawed
hobbled right out the gate by a
crippling limitation despite the phone's
ability to support up to a gigabyte of
additional memory via microSD you could
only store a maximum of 100 songs on the
phone this seemingly arbitrary
limitation had the effect of making the
e1 much less appealing than dedicated
mp3 players like the just released iPod
Nano which many speculate was the entire
point in fact as the story goes then
Motorola CEO ed Zander accused Apple of
purposely undercutting the rockery one
by announcing it the same day as the
iPod Nano
and then failing to fully support it
thereafter but whether these accusations
carry any water is irrelevant at $249 on
contract the rebadged feature phone with
sluggish software USB 1.0 and a 2.5
millimeter headphone jack was never
going to set the world on fire no matter
how many celebrities showed up in its
commercials or how intriguing its disco
club side lighting may have appeared to
some buyers the e1 delivered a user
experience so bad that one review
written at the time said even if I
bought one I would still use an iPod to
play music because it simply gives a
superior music playing experience with
the exception of one more iTunes enabled
device the Motorola sliver the Apple
motorola relationship quickly evaporated
and just over a year later Apple went on
to change the face of the mobile
landscape forever by going it alone
meanwhile Motorola while not without a
handful of significant hits entered a
protracted period of decline
culminating in its purchase by Google
six years later what lessons can we
learn from this well plenty including
the old caution not to rest on one's
laurels in the case of Motorola but
probably the most important takeaway
here is one Apple embraced
wholeheartedly following this incident
too much compromise can be a very bad
thing
Apple's subsequent unwillingness to
budge on fundamental aspects of its next
endeavor meant that initially only one
carrier again singular was willing to
give Apple the kind of control it wanted
an apple gained a reputation for
zealously guarding that control but that
inflexibility eventually gave us the
first generation iPhone and with the
possible exception of the flame wars in
the Internet's comment sections the
smartphone world has been a better place
ever since it's a very good thing in
retrospect that the Moto ROKR e1 failed
as brilliantly as it did do you remember
the ROKR e1 or it's iTunes packin sequel
the Motorola sliver did you own either
one if so drop us a line down in the
comments or pay us a visit at the
