pocketnow.com and in this video we're an
unbox the HTC legend here you may
remember the legend from Mobile World
Congress where john wong of HTC slammed
the device against a wallet to prove how
rigid and durable it is it is cut from a
single block of aluminum kind of like
the MacBooks so it's very rigid very
durable it also is a really interesting
feel to it
we're gonna do our own durability tests
it also has an AMOLED display which
means great battery life
fantastic contrast it has Android 2.1
the latest version of sense and a lot of
other goodies that we're going to talk
about coming up soon let's get to the
unboxing of the HTC edge all right here
we go looks like a very similar box to
the newest HTC devices which makes a lot
of sense let's take off this bubble wrap
here very cool it shows actually the
block of aluminum and implying that it's
cut out of a block of aluminum at least
I think that's what it means let's take
a look around the box and see what we
have here let's zoom in a little bit on
the specs so it's running at 600
megahertz CPU it's got android 2.1 which
is of course equip it's got 384
megabytes of ram with 512 megabytes of
rom this will not do 3g in the US
unfortunately but if you you're in
Europe you'll definitely be able to get
3G it's got the AMOLED capacitive
multi-touch screen GPS of course and
we'll talk more about specs in a future
video let's look at the legend so I
think it slides out actually on the
bottom you need to sort of run your
finger now along here let's take a look
Wow tiny little device but to put that
to the side very solid feel I can tell
you in hand already and let's take a
look what else we got interesting that
HTC put the battery behind the device
they usually package it sort of
underneath of everything here let's see
how big the battery is it is 1300
milliamp hours quite
nice size she did a really good battery
life thanks to the AMOLED screen in the
large battery life see what else we have
here
some random stickers some plugs micro SD
card two gigabytes that's always a
welcomed addition HTC manual warranty
statement safety and regulatory guide
let's see if we get a case hopefully we
do accessories a little wall charger
here
HTC pretty much includes the same
accessories on all their devices these
days so here we have microUSB and
headphones no case unfortunately let's
take a look at the device okay so here
it is I'm going to take off this film
get a better feel for the device it
definitely feels thinner than the hero
we reviewed the hero the screen is only
3.2 inches diagonal which is the same
size as the iPhone the devices are
coming with larger and larger screens
these days the the legend isn't really
intended to be a multimedia machine I
don't think it's just has a really great
form factor very durable has buttons
down here makes it easy to operate with
one hand but it feels very very solid
and it has a really interesting way that
you get to the battery you kind of slide
this bottom part here that's where the
SIM card goes and what to look more into
that to see exactly how all of that
stuff works but it's really interesting
to feel a device that is carved from
aluminum okay let's take a look at the
legend next to some other devices here
we have the iPhone it actually made a
mistake the screen on the iPhone is 3.5
inches on the legend it is 3.2 inches of
course you got that chin that sticks out
on the bottom and the the legend is
pretty thin not as thin as the iPhone
really liking the feel of this phone
it's very on the usual very solid
feeling let's see it next to the HD 2 of
course it's kind of quite a difference
in screen size there let's see it next
to and device like the palm palm pixi
which obviously it's a much smaller
screen different form factor completely
you should probably stack them this way
and next to another HTC device that was
very very popular the HTC Touch pro2
just to
kind of get a feel the tallness is
pretty much the same here but of course
the touch pro2 is can be much thicker
because it has that slide-out keyboard
the keyboard on the HTC legend is an
onscreen keyboard but HDCP boards are
very very good it's got a glass
multi-touch capacitive screen so in that
very sensitive great feel to the
keyboard so that was the unboxing of the
HTC legend and something that I just
noticed is that the branding here on the
back is extra-large if you look at a
recent device like the HD 2 the HTC
branding was very modest but on the
legend not so much
I guess that's an OK thing HTC wants to
show off their brand a little bit more
and you know I'm proud to be using an
HTC phone I think a lot of other people
are too so not too big of a deal having
the larger logo back here and of course
they have with HTC Sense they're also
trying to promote that in a really big
way so a lot more coming up on the HTC
legend sure to follow us on youtube by
subscribing to our Channel that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
