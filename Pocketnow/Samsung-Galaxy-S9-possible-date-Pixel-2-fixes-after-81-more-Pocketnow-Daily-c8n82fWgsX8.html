to expect on the dates of the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 a few brands of smartphones
are reportedly wanting a piece of the
always connected PC Pi and Google is
currently working on some fixes for the
pixel - after Android 8.1 I'm Jaime
Rivera in New Orleans for my birthday
thank you for your kind wishes I forgot
to pack the t-shirts this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for a
smartphone and a SmartWatch Verizon is
currently offering a very interesting
deal where if you go for an Apple watch
Series 3 or 4 a Samsung gear s 3 you get
the advantage that you get $200 off a
good list of smartphones yea you can
learn about the list of the description
now let's talk about the Google pixel
book which is still one of those
Chromebooks that I find heavily
overpriced but if you're interested in
one it is a very beautiful product and
it's currently available for $100 off
and sure $100 for such an expensive
laptop is not really much but you also
get a free Google home and it says for
all the configurations you can learn
more the description as well and
speaking of Google those of you that
have been dealing with slow fingerprint
scanners when it comes to the Google
pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL after Android 8.1
well Google is already working on a fix
we don't know exactly what's going on
but the company has confirmed that there
is a problem and that they're dealing
with it I do notice some inconsistencies
though I can't really say that it's
significant we should learn more as soon
as the company figure something out and
for those of you that were left enticed
by the always connected PC and that HP
Envy x2 that I saw well apparently these
are not the only companies that are
going to provide always connected pcs we
hear that there are some smartphone OEMs
like in the case of Samsung that was
already into the PC market and we also
hear Xiaomi also wanting a piece of the
pie what is this going to happen it's
hard to tell but we will definitely keep
you posted and finally the very hot news
is they have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy S a 9 we already saw leaked
renders we already have pretty much a
lot of the information that most of the
leakers provide about around this time
the question is exactly when are we
getting the phone we've got Bloomberg
already
in that the launch will be in February
and February is rather interesting as
it's not necessarily at MWC unless it's
late February but it leads me to the
question today do you think that
February is the best time for the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 or do you think that
Samsung should launch it earlier at CES
or do you think that Samson should wait
until later in my case the earlier the
company launches it the better with all
the damage that the iPhone 10 is
currently making that this is just my
opinion leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion and
apologies for the lighting and the noise
this was the best setup that I could
figure out friends again if you want to

one you can watch last week's bargain
out daily up here and our thoughts on
the pixel to excel down here and also
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscored
early that aren't Instagram at high
metal data please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
hi Mary but I think so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
