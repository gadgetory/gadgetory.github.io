should wake up earlier man how to make a
pocket now daily video hi meri behna bad
jokes saying trusted sources and every
story leads me to the question of the
day hi mera mera hai meri behna hai meri
lit up yeah try making a video every day
buddy see how that goes I'm as it me or
your jokes are getting terribly better
it's not necessarily just you my son is
helping me out that's right it's that
time of the week I am high net event
this is pocket now and this is the
pagano daily recap for last week on
Monday the topic was the galaxy s7 leaks
we saw the first renders of the phone
and I asked you what do you think about
the design that we saw we had 626
comments I love the new design those
curves at the back actually helped in
holding the phone I do agree I love that
on the note 5 and it would be awesome if
it made it to the s7 I think it will her
front and back equals less vessel to
hold could be a bad idea and I do agree
they fumbled with it with a galaxy s6
edge they fixed it with the edge plus
hopefully they do something about here
as well I don't really care i just want
the micro SD card slot and longer
battery life and apparently those two
things are making it but it would be
cool if the phone look futuristic don't
you think speed of the galaxy s7 the
rumors on Tuesday have to do with the
possibility of no camera bump or a very
small one with these new phones sort of
like what we see with the galaxy note5
where it does house a smaller camera
bump because the phone is Victor I ask
you what do you think about that do you
mind camera bumps and we can 579
comments I didn't find it that bad and
neither did I I actually consider it to
be a good improvement if any it's not
definitely a deal breaker but having it
there would annoy me knowing that they
could have filled it with battery and I
do agree I would rather they give me a
thicker phone with battery life and no
camera hump than what they currently do
everybody you ask I own a nexus 6p that
kind of stuff doesn't bother me anymore
and dude right it should that camera
bump is just insane and once the topic
was dual cameras we hear that the iphone
7 plus might be getting something like
that and I asked you what do you think
about design changes like these ones we
had 650 comments dual cameras on the
front don't mind it but on the back it
is disgusting it depends on the design
implementation but I
to agree i've never seen a phone with
dual cameras that actually looks good i
wonder how apple's gonna pull that off
apple taking other companies ideas and
calling it innovation again i see and
you know it's a two-way street at some
point it was apple innovation that was
others innovation so i really wouldn't
consider this a bad thing and being what
we want is a functional phone with
better you know functionality actually
don't mind if it's implemented in a very
smart way knowing apple they will sell
this idea in a way that other
manufacturers will copy next year but
forgetting that it was an HTC or that it
was HTC who popularized this on the m8
okay HTC launched it on the m8 but it
was never really a popular or very
functional feature but it wasn't really
because of the dual cameras it was
because of the whole ultra pixel thing
so yeah I do feel that people will
forget about HTC and just say Apple did
it true Thursday the news were the LG g5
the company had finally sent teasers and
presentations for the LG g5 day I asked
you what was on your wish list for this
phone we had 826 comments I want LG to
stick to its roots those are very long
roots man be more specific what
precisely you wanted to keep the g3
design g4 design I would love for it to
bring back the battery life that we had
on the g2 and the camera but they fix
that with the g4 true let's just see
about the battery life Oh GUI redesign
it needs one badly I'm sure they'll
figure everything else out true we've
been putting up with this UI for years
the problem is that some people actually
like it I just am not on that listen I'm
sure you aren't to help me improve the
battery life on this next LG phone at
Niagara i love the battery life on the
g2 i don't really understand why they
haven't really been able to figure it
out with these new phones but i think it
has a lot to do with the snapdragon 800
that previous processor was amazing when
it came to battery life I wish Qualcomm
would figure that out and helped OEMs
let's see if the Snapdragon 820 can do
that and then finally Friday the topic
again was the LG g5 we saw case makers
leaking renders of what to expect for
the phone we saw some very odd camera
designs and I asked you what do you
think about this do you like it we had
811 comments looks terrible hopefully
they keep the buttons at the rear the
camera design looked terrible indeed but
I do believe that the buttons are going
to move and that's actually not
necessarily a bad thing I couldn't make
the camera symmetrical and I mean the
Rings one eye is smaller than the other
and I know they have to remember kaisa
renders are not necessarily the final
thing and that could be a very early
prototype but man it was ugly it looks
like LG fans will have to skip out this
year I think the b10 was where they
should have taken expiration in terms of
design I don't know I wasn't really a
fan of the LGBT 10 design and mainly
because of how heavy that phone was but
hey if that's your opinion this is mine
I know a lot of people also did not like
the buttons at the back so I do feel
that the customers do want changes and
it wouldn't be cool ability just give
you the option you want buttons at the
back there's this variant and if you
don't there's another variant that's it
for the parking out daily recap thank
