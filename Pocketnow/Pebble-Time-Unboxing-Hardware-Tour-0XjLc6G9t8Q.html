strapped on a pebble to get a taste of
what SmartWatch life was like and after
a quick jaunt with its metallic cousin
the pebble steel we're ready to try out
the true next generation I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is an
unboxing and first look at the pebble
time SmartWatch
despite the significance of this sequel
the Kickstarter sourced pebble time
comes in much the same package as the
original pebble a nondescript
postal service ready cardboard box that
tears open to reveal the watch itself
our review device is the red version of
the pebble time standard edition not the
steel variant and it's accompanied by a
charging cable QuickStart literature and
not much else where the packaging has
stayed constant the pebble itself has
definitely matured while there's an
awful lot of bezel between the edges of
the e paper screen and the edges of the
casing this watch is actually quite a
bit smaller than the first gen pebble in
some dimensions impressive considering
its 30 meter water resistance and it
feels better than the original in almost
every respect
it's simultaneously lighter slimmer and
higher quality than it might appear
especially when it comes to the stretchy
silicone band which contains quick
release latches for swapping and a
nicely finished buckle type fastener
like the Apple watch band it feels
almost impossibly soft against the skin
the charging cable is higher quality too
with a more robust construction and
stronger magnets to hold it against the
more logically located charging port the
company claims seven days of uptime
between charges will see the new watch
retains pebbles for button control
interface but there's lots of new stuff
here too a microphone for one thing a
color a ink display for another and once
we power it up we see that it's just
about as straightforward to set up as
the first one at least on Android follow
the link on the screen download the app
and a few taps later you're checking
notifications changing watch faces and
surfing the timeline on your wrist
this ain't no watch OS from Apple and
it's no Android wear either this is
custom SmartWatch software from the
company
that jump-started the wearable
Revolution in 2012 and I'm excited to
see how well it stacks up against the
competitors that have sprung up since
leave your comments below to let us know
what questions you want answered in our
full pebble time review coming later
this month and PocketNow and give this
unboxing a thumbs up if you did enjoy it
until next time this has been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
sparing you the predictable time pun at
least until next time thanks for
watching we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
