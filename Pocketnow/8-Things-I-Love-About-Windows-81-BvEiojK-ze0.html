system from Microsoft that's designed to
appease and improve upon some of the
criticisms that last year's Windows 8
was met with there are many changes in
Windows 8.1 some of them you'll love and
some of them you might hate this is Adam
Lane from PocketNow and in this video
I'm going to talk about the eight themes
that I love about Windows 8.1 but be
sure to also check out the eight things
I hate about Windows 8.1 number one I
can use professional programs on a
tablet there are many other tech
reviewers who slam Windows 8 because it
can run existing professional grade
programs in a separate desktop
environment and their design doesn't
match Windows 8's new touch friendly
Metro design language I say who cares
the fact that you can pick up the stylus
or plug in a laptop style keyboard in
order to get real work done on such a
mobile and touch friendly tablet is a
huge advantage to speed instability
Windows 8.1 is the fastest most secure
and most stable version of Windows ever
I didn't think it could get much better
than Windows 7 ones but it has three
flexible snapping window panes on more
screen resolutions when does they
originally only allowed you to snap to
apps on the screen at a time in a
specific ratio and only on specific
screen resolution sizes with Windows 8.1
the multitasking from Metro apps is much
more flexible
number four tabs syncing in Internet
Explorer this feature has been on other
browsers for a while but now it can
access all the open web pages that are
active on each of your PC's associated
with your Microsoft ID
it doesn't sync them per se but there's
a pop-up menu that allows you to choose
which PCs browser sessions they want to
load number 5 use your profile cloud
sync if you log into Windows 8.1 with a
Microsoft ID you can allow it to save
all sorts of your customizations
passwords app data language preferences
etc to your SkyDrive number 6 the app
listing has some great new sorting
features you can now sort all apps by
date installed or most used in addition
to by name or category number 7 the
reading lists this is an app that shows
up in the share charm for many of the
Metro apps
it's basically a bookmarking system for
everything and it gets synced across all
of your Windows 8.1 devices so say you
see a few interesting articles on your
home PC but you don't have time to read
them right now
you can add them to your reading lists
and access them later from your Windows
tablet or laptop while on the go
number 8 global search and Bing
integration with Windows 8 the search
charm was very context-sensitive it
mainly let you search the active app
that you're in but allow you to also
search other apps or content types by
choosing the other options in the list
and what does 8.1 that search - launch
method is gone and the search charm
defaults to searching everything in
other words it's no longer contact
sensitive and individual apps need to
add their own search buttons now but the
new surgical builders are still pretty
awesome thanks for watching and don't
forget to also watch the 8 things I hate
about Windows 8.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
