pocketnow.com and this is the software
tour of the samsung epix a phone that
just came out on the AT&amp;amp;T network this
is a follow up video to the hardware
tour video that we just shot so be sure
you check that out if you're looking at
this moaning you're considering it I
want to start off with the optical mouse
I know a lot of people have been asking
about that so before I get close in on
the screen let me just give you an idea
of how well the optical mouse works so
you operate it quite simply by moving
your finger along this touchpad here
below the AT&amp;amp;T logo and i'll tell you
what guys it worked really really well
in fact i haven't taken out the stylus
too many times because you can control
really everything through this mouse and
let me show you the settings for because
there are some settings so if we go over
here to finger mouse we can change the
speed of it from fast to medium too slow
we can also make it into a four-way
navigation standard d-pad if we really
don't like having this on the screen we
can also change the pointer you get a
variety of pointers and if you have a
sale samsung omnia you know that it also
has the mouse but it doesn't have the
the pointers so we can change it to a
little a little ducky here if you if you
like to have a duck which is kind of
unconventional but um i'm going to leave
it on the on the standard cursor and i'm
going to turn it off actually because
during this video i'm not going to be
using it because it's kind of awkward to
shoot the screen and be able to operate
the mouse at the same time okay and
we're back the today screen you see here
is not the default today's screen that's
installed on the epics it's included and
i've turned it on because i think it's
kind of the most flashy today's screen
the epics doesn't have any sort of
interface replacement like touchflo 3d
or spb mobile shell but this is kind of
what they include so you can do a few
things from here you can go two favorite
people you can go to settings and you
get this animation and the sound we can
go to favorites which is just a list of
favorite programs and we can press the
plus button and find another program
that we want to add to the list and we
can go back home and from here we can
access our email our email here our text
messages here and our missed calls
there's also a link to AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
it's kind of you so I'll probably leave
this on here for the time being i'll
switch over to spb mobile shell after i
complete the review but for now this
looks nice and it's nice and clean now
the soft keys the samsung use on on on
this device is phone and contacts so you
can't change either of these you can't
customize them and that's unfortunate
let's go into the program's menu and see
what we have there now unfortunately the
program's menu is not flick friendly you
can't flick and scroll as is the case on
other HTC devices that have the flick
scroll functionality that's unfortunate
we have a lot of AT&amp;amp;T things here so
AT&amp;amp;T mall AT&amp;amp;T music media net cingular
video which they should have renamed to
ATT video they have an IM client which
works really well you can use aim and
msn and all the major messengers it
works quite well for that going down the
list we have games and they actually
throw in a few extra games but they're
all java-based then they don't look that
great and they're all demos so you have
to pay to actually use them for more
than a few minutes I'm going down the
list further we have applications let's
go in there and wave some standard
things like camera going down the list
we have some more java applications like
mobile banking fox sports mobile pro we
have a version of mobitv and mobitv is
really cool it lets you watch a variety
of live TV stations on your device but
it's ten dollars a month and they only
give you five minutes of free viewing as
a trial going down the list we have
something called photo slides which will
allow you to take a bunch of photos and
make them into a slideshow which is
pretty neat if you take a lot of
pictures and you want to show off the
kids or other things like that we have a
standard RSS reader we have the windows
mobile 6.1 task manager and then we have
some more java based applications here
that I'll probably never use but they're
on here if you if you want to use them
okay let's go down the list we have my
stuff which is basically like a file
explorer then we've organizer which
includes the standard stuff like
calculator and stopwatch and then
they're smart converter which is which
is pretty useful I mean you can use you
can make conversions from milligrams to
tons and that sort of thing so a lot of
people may find that useful and the
device does not come with upper 9.5 i've
just installed that and i recommend that
everybody does that because the
fantastic browser it's a lot better than
pocket internet explorer which is what
this device uses as its default browser
i should also note that the office 2000
sweat 7 mobile suite is included so
that's good and finally I want to wrap
up by showing you the settings because
there are some interesting settings that
i want to show you so let's start with
function key settings and if you
remember in the first video I talked
about how all of the keys on the
keyboard are customizable so you can do
function G that'll launch a certain
program function H launch a certain
program well this is where you do it
from so if we go to show list we get a
whole listing of all of the different
letters that you can assign to launch a
program so that should be great for
those that like to do that if we go into
buttons we see that we can assign the
these keys on the bottom to launch
certain applications so we have a camera
button here and a mail button here and
all of those are assignable just like
the the keys on the keyboard are with
the function key going down the list we
have theme and we can change the color
of the whole environment of the device a
little bit so if we want to do like a
like a kind of like a magenta here I
guess you would call that nuts more pink
let's do a yellow and you do okay
and there it is color changed okay let's
go down the list we have video share the
AT&amp;amp;T video share you have to pay extra
for that that allows you to do live
video one way so I could hold my phone
up to something and somebody would see
what video I was streaming at that point
but I couldn't see video from their
device we have a full version of voice
command which is good always a welcomed
addition we have some settings on what
we can do with the wake up button just
the behavior of the standby button also
in the personal tab we have sounds and
notifications which will allow us to
turn on the vibrate function so it kind
of gives a feeling of haptic feedback
but not really it's really a waste of
battery life some people may appreciate
it but I'm just going to leave that
turned off because I really don't see
the need let's go over to the system tab
in backlight we can adjust the keyboard
backlight and when it comes on and when
it comes off unfortunately this doesn't
have a light sensor built in we can go
to brightness and of course change the
brightness of the screen right now it's
on medium going down the list we have
the settings for the finger mouse that
you already saw going down further we
have the standard windows mobile 6.1
task manager have a lot of programs open
right now and let's take a look at how
much memory I have with all those
programs open right now a lot of a lot
of free program memories 70 megabytes of
free program memory and as you've seen
so far the device is pretty snappy I
mean I'm going screen to screen at a
pretty fast pace let's finish over in
the connections tab and we will go to
the wireless manager see what it looks
like standard windows mobile task
manager wireless manager I should say it
hasn't been skinned by Samsung and some
other more advanced things for the
business users like proxy manager and
GPRS authentication all that sort of
thing are in here and one more feature i
want to show you that's included on many
samsung devices but i never have
understood why it's there if i press and
hold on the camera button watch what
happens to the screen
I get a magnifier effect and I can move
around on the screen I think by tapping
and dragging I you know I I can be
creative and trying to think of a reason
somebody would want to use this but I
just can't I mean if something small on
the screen in most programs you can make
the text bigger I wonder why you would
want to zoom in like this oh well it's a
it's a feature there if you want to use
it and that's it for the software tour
of the samsung epix we've got a lot more
to cover in the upcoming review or we'll
talk about the pros and the cons and the
device will talk about battery life
camera quality pretty much everything so
watch out for that follow us on twitter
twitter.com slash pocket nail tweets and
you'll know right when the review hits
so that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
