pocket now calm and this is the hardware
tour of the samsung propel pro now on
the AT&amp;amp;T network in the US let's talk
about the hardware on the device overall
the device has a nice feel in hand
except for the fact that it's completely
covered in shiny chrome mirror like
finish from top to bottom so it's very
slippery in hand which kind of feels
nice sometimes but other times it really
is problematic because it can slip out
your hand easily or it's a fingerprint
magnet or it's prone to scratches there
was actually a similar device like this
released in europe with a slide down
keyboard called the I 620 it didn't have
this shiny coating for some reason when
they bring it to the United States they
chrome it up they make it extremely
shiny because I guess that's what
Americans like they like shiny chrome II
things and so that is why we have a
device that's completely covered in a
mirror anyway so let's move around the
device let's start at the top at the top
this is not a front-facing video camera
it's actually a light a light sensor
which is pretty rare for non-touchscreen
windows mobile devices which is good
helps to regulate the backlight so that
you don't use that much battery over
here is the speaker over here is the 2.5
5-inch non touch screen display and it's
320 x 320 pixels this is the first
windows mobile non-touchscreen device to
have this resolution why does this
matter I'll show you exactly why over
here I've got the blackjack 2 which has
a 320 x 240 display so that's 80 fewer
pixels want to see the difference here
I'll show you so I'll start off in the
home screen and you can see immediately
that you get to see more information on
the home screen because of the taller
screen but let's go into the start menu
and again here lists are all longer you
can see more of an email on the screen
when your web browsing it really makes a
difference so that's one of I think the
best features of having that extended
screen is to be able to see more on the
screen at one time ok so let's move
along below the Samsung logo we have two
soft keys and they are very
pronounced which is fantastic because
you can use them quite easily without
feeling for them or without having to
look at them I should say because they
are just very much raised if we go down
we have what looks to be a d-pad but
actually there's a joystick in the
center and joysticks aren't terribly
usable especially in this case when the
joystick has a little divot in the
center so if it was raised on the
outside I could imagine that it would be
easy to use but because it's got this
divot when you're trying to use it you
actually have to position your finger up
here to go down and it feels weird on
your finger and it's not fast it's not
easy if you're flipping through a long
email using this d-pad you're probably
going to get a sore thumb I think this
is one of the biggest problems with the
propel pro is this annoying joystick now
around this joystick area is actually an
indicator light so if I open up the the
charging port and I plug in the power
cable you'll see that it will light up
red like so and when it's done charging
it will turn green if you have a new
email it will light up purple and some
other random colors as well so moving
along and you can see I mean how many
fingerprints it's picked up already
here's the call star button the home
button back and end now this device has
a slider and one of the greatest parts
of this slider is that it's functional
so you can answer a call by opening the
slider terrific you can end a call by
closing the slider excellent you can
also lock and unlock the device by
opening the slider which will unlock the
device and allow you to use it or you
can close it which will lock the device
after a period of time or actually it's
already locked see I can't do anything
this is great because you don't have to
remember to keep holding down the end
key unlocking your device or having to
go through the annoying that seat key
sequence when you want to unlock the
device so that is a major major plus
let's go to the side of the device over
on the side we have the volume up and
down rocker which is also very
pronounced much like these soft keys to
the right of that is the external
microSD slot which is good that its
external so that you don't have to take
out the battery to put in a new card
nothing on the bottom on this side we
have the proprietary Jack for audio
charging and syncing and I did not find
a
convert Oh jack in the box that connects
to this port that allows you to listen
to 3.5 millimeter audio hopefully that
was an omission because that's a
much-needed accessory and to the right
of that is a camera button which will
power the camera on the back and the
camera on the back is 3.0 megapixels
it's actually autofocus which is pretty
rare for kind of a mid-range smartphone
and it's got this fantastic brushed
metal coating to it I wish they had used
that on the rest of the device or other
than this cheap mirror plastic that
looks like junk after you've used it for
a few minutes along with the third point
0 megapixel camera you have a
self-portrait mayor but no flash
unfortunately and finally a little note
on the keyboard I'd mentioned that this
keyboard may be as good as the keyboard
on the q 9h because they are shaped in a
similar fashion and they have raised
bumps on them so you can feel for them
and I still kind of hold by that except
that these buttons are about thirty
percent smaller than on the q 9h so if
you have smallish or medium sized hands
then yes this is a really really good
keyboard but if you have large hands or
if you're used to keys that are spaced
apart like the blackjack two then you
may not like it as much so that's it for
the hardware tour of the samsung propel
pro on AT&amp;amp;T overall I really like the
320 x 320 display I like the
functionality of the slider I like the
keyboard what I don't like is this
horrible finish all over the whole
device that makes it a fingerprint and
scratch magnet and I also really don't
like this d-pad I think that was a
horrible horrible idea in terms of
usability it really takes away a lot of
usability and really hurts this phone a
lot we'll be back with a software tour
of the samsung propel pro and for more
on this and other windows mobile devices
