enough that's a problem for most
handhelds but especially for ultra-thin
devices with lots of features and
embedded batteries devices like the
iPhone 6 the good folks at Mophie have
cooked up a solution for that and we've
just spent 48 hours with it on our
in-house iPhone 6 join us then for a
quick tour of the Mophie Juice Pack air
the Juice Pack air is the slimmer and
lower capacity of Moe fees battery packs
for the iPhone 6 but it crams a lot of
power into it's rubberized frame it
incorporates a 2,750 milliamp hour
battery Mophie says that's enough to
double the iPhones typical endurance in
talktime internet usage and video
playback you pay a price for that added
power of course in size strapping on the
juice back air converts the iPhone 6
from one of the world's civil test
smartphones to well not that mass takes
a big jump and thickness more than
doubles the result is a much beefier
somewhat more cumbersome handheld so the
juice pack air is a much more elegant
route to better battery life than a
tethered external power pack it
completely encapsulates the iPhone
protecting it from drops and falls with
an ultrasonic welded casing and a
dedicated impact resistant ring that
surrounds and protects the display
importantly it doesn't appear to impair
any of the iPhones built-in features
either Mophie has built-in pass throughs
for the speaker's the mute switch and
external buttons still work
Apple pay seems to be unaffected and you
can still charge and sync the phone
while it's in the case the iPhone
charges first followed by the juice pack
you'll need a computer with a USB port
or an AC adapter for this a microUSB
cable comes in the box but a wall plug
does not when you're out on the town
charging is literally as simple as
flipping a switch green to turn on the
juice red to switch it off
you can check remaining power level with
the built-in meter our juice pack came
with only about half a charge but that
was still enough to take us from a
completely drained iPhone to 49% in less
than an hour
and we were using the iPhone the whole
time one important note for music fans
the juice pack air puts the headphone
jack at the bottom of a deep silo so it
comes with an adapter really an extender
to give the earphone cable enough length
to plug in it doesn't effect sound
quality but it is one more thing you
need to remember to carry around if you
don't use a Bluetooth headset how well
it does over time and how much power you
can really get from this case we'll have
to wait for a more in-depth look this
isn't a review after all but after about
two days with it it's easy to see why
Mophie has been the go-to name in iphone
battery cases for years it blends added
protection with extended endurance if
you're comfortable with the added bulk
it seems a worthy sidekick for that
plane ride hiking trip or just a longer
than usual workday the Mophie Juice Pack
air for the iPhone 6 is available now at
Mophie comm if you're curious how long
the iPhone 6 lasts without the juice
