serious money to Qualcomm to secure
those 5g chips next year we have new
renders of the Google pixel 3a and 3a
Excel and hint to something at Google
i/o and another Facebook password breach
is now public but this time it seems to
be for Instagram accounts I'm high
memory data and for those of you
interested in hearing more verdict on
the galaxy folds watch our pocket out
weekly
three people that have used that are
currently using it are on the stream I'm
there too this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals
again Apple watch series 3 not my cup of
tea but right now it's nearly $80 off
depending if you're looking for Walmart
or Amazon and we're talking about the
larger variance so the discounts
actually even more impactful if you go
for the smaller one you learn more in
the description now let's move the
spotlight over to blackberry for those
of you wanting that key to Brett Edition
it's going to be on Amazon and Best Buy
very soon $6.99 it's a crazy price it's
a limited edition but you know that's
not the saddest news when it comes to
blackberry how about if we talk about
the fact that the blackberry messenger
all two of you sorry just one okay all
one of you that we're using the
blackberry messenger that's gonna die on
May 31st so backup your data
whichever inexistent theta you have now
let's talk about Facebook and the fact
the sad fact that they own Instagram
because recently the company told
everybody the thousands of passwords
were kept in plain text and that their I
don't know they got leaked now it turns
out that no it's not thousands it's
millions of passwords my advice to you
change your password right now
can somebody buy Instagram I mean if we
could just you know collect money all of
us I think we could buy Instagram II
just get it away from these guys now
let's move the spotlight over to Google
and the pixel 3 a pixel 3 a excel it
seems that we've got some final renders
this time from trusted sources and the
rumors are that in the documents that
they found the launch will be at Google
i/o and this is really interesting as
usually Google i/o is a developer
conference so we're trying to understand
how these mid-range Android devices from
Google
are going to be any better than what we
currently have we'll see and finally the
hottest news today have to do with the
whole Qualcomm and Apple dispute over
iPhones yes we know that they're now
partners yes we know that they are now
working together but for those of you
wondering exactly how much money was
paid here apparently between five and
six billion dollars were paid from Apple
to Qualcomm in damages
they're not necessarily damages but part
of the settlement up to eight to nine
dollars per iPhone sold
do the math so yeah the good thing is
obviously there is a partnership for
2024 5g modems let us know what you
think in the comments down below are you
happy with the fact that these companies
are making up are you not in my case I
have complained so much about the bad
quality and Intel modems on iPhones that
I'm happy but that's just me obviously I
also wish there were more competition
and you know what I mean leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
 out on comment subscribe to both
of our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one you can follow
