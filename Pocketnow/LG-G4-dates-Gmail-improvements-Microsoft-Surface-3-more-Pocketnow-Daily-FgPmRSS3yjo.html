we didn't forget the pro in the name
gmail finally wakes up and smells the
coffee and some new feature updates and
expect LG's next flagship to be
announced on April twenty-eighth I'm hi
meri behna making the best of Tuesday
since I can remember and I failed that
at every single time but this is pocket
out daily brought to you by lynda.com
believe it or not I think this is the
only pocket now daily in history where
all the news are going to be official
news for all you rumor haters beginning
with Gmail the company and talking
Google here has just updated its
application for Android and possibly
Iowa's in the future where you finally
believe it or not get a unified inbox
there's probably one of the features why
everybody has moved over to other gmail
clients and not stuck the gmail mainly
because you have to be moving between
accounts and yeah there are other
improvements here as well make sure this
referred for the full list of what
you're getting really cool now start
about alcatel one touch and it's watch
the company showed us its wearable at
CES 2015 and in addition to the circular
design and innovations in a USB charger
on the band the coolest part is you
really won't have to install
applications for it to work of
everything has already built in from a
tracker to a pedometer to everything and
even cooler is you're gonna make it work
on iOS or Android it costs 150 dollars
you get pre ordered today in the links
in the description now it's not about LG
a lot of us are waiting for the LG g4
even though the G flex 2 is already a
very cool phone the company has just so
now press invitations for an event to
happen on April twenty-eighth and even
though we don't really know what we're
getting here we are expecting to get the
company's next flagship looks in the
description on what we think we might
get and make sure you leave us a comment
with whatever predictions you have for
now even though a sous is a really only
famous for tablets like the Nexus 7 in
the United States the company has done
an amazing job with its issues zenfone 2
mainly because it says customizable as
you can get from internals to externals
and
the options for Europe in particular are
very interesting we get some listings of
an option that will cost you three
hundred fifty euros you're getting a 5.5
inch 1080p display but the coolest part
you're getting four gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of storage which is interesting
Gavin links in the description there are
a ton of options that will be available
but yeah it seems that this option will
be available at least in France and
finally for the very hot news of the day
Microsoft has just unveiled its new
surface 3 and yet it's not a pro tablet
and we're still calling it the hottest
news of the day mainly because the
company has just woken up and smell the
coffee this is not an arm-based
processor tablet we're talking about a
full-fledged intel atom processor tablet
that runs windows 8.1 that even brings
you a Wacom digitizer for a stylus
option even though you'll have to buy
that and even cooler it brings a new 2
by 3 aspect ratio not the odd 16 by mine
it's brought a new hinge it's got a lot
of really cool features that are coming
for just 499 as a starting price a
really interesting up to the point where
I'm even considering and it leads me to
the question of the day do you like
surface three licks the description look
at everything that you're getting here
where are you waiting for the surface

over the surface 3 but obviously I'll
