those of you that want to give it a try
Microsoft cloud based gaming shows us
how to play halo from a windows phone
and believe it or not iOS 7 customers
are complaining of dizziness I'm hi Mary
Vanna and does this mean will now have
banners stating friends don't let
friends use their iPhones while drunk
this is parking out daily so what
happens when you launch a golden iPhone
you expect the golden galaxy phone I
mean how else does this market work and
as it turns out you can pick up your
golden galaxy phone very soon in
combinations of either brown and gold or
pink and gold which sums up all my
theory that golden phones are a girl's
best friend but anyways we still don't
know when these phones are going to be
launched and probably this is just gonna
be a middle-eastern thing but anyway
stay tuned you never know from Samsung
now let's move the spotlight over to
Microsoft yesterday was steve ballmer's
last meeting with employees before
retiring and as it turns out during the
events they have to showcase of a new
cloud-based gaming project that they
have where they were playing the console
based version of halo on Windows through
the cloud and even a windows phone but
wait a second I'm not talking about a
Lumia 1020 I'm talking about the
cheapest Lumia 520 that you can buy that
variant that you can actually buy four
hundred bucks at the Home Shopping
Network that foam was running the full
based console version of halo yes I'm
not lying to you and well as it turns
out we'll probably see these services
coming very soon and let's hope that
Microsoft makes these service is
exclusive to Windows Phone to at least
make it you know to at least give it a
point of being I mean the fact that
skype doesn't really work with the
previous versions of Windows Phone no
man that's just that's just infuriating
have you thought the things were bad for
blackberry yeah think again I mean
t-mobile has just confirmed that they
will be the first carrier to actually
drop blackberry fully from their retail
stores which means that if the company
was having trouble selling bones it's
just gotten a lot more complicated as
t-mobile has been one of those very
close partners to blackberry in the past
so anyways let's see what the Canadians
do about this because obviously it's not
good news for them now let's talk about
google glass you know that very cool
product that sadly
not sit well with us reviewers because
it was just too limited to be actually
useful too many of us and it turns out
google wants to make it popular which
ever way possible and what they're doing
is actually going cross-country with the
product they're going to different
places having events and allowing
everybody to test it out so they're
starting in north carolina on october
fifth and then they're moving around the
country to show it off so make sure you
see it and tell us what you think i mean
so far i'd love to have google glass I
just wouldn't like to pay for it and
finally for the both interesting and
hilarious news of the day we've got some
leaked photographs of the ipad 5 and
space gray and if you cannot tell the
difference between that and the current
generation ipad I don't blame you i
don't know what the difference is so
stay tuned for whatever it launches and
let's see how the silver one actually
looks and the golden when most likely
but and even more hilarious news we've
got some confirmations that in apple
support groups people are complaining
about iOS 7 giving them dizziness and
most likely because of the parallax
feature which you can actually turn off
you watch Sailor Mars video on how to
get it done but anyways can you believe
if you are complaining about getting
dizzy about an operating system which
kind of leads you to the question of the
day I mean do you believe that these
complaints are real or fake have you
seen iOS 7 do you actually consider that
the parallax will make you dizzy in my
particular case i've been using iOS 7
ever since beta 1 i have never gotten
dizzy and with the fact that there are
so many paid chills out there that
actually use support forums to stare
opinion in other directions you never
know of these comments are actually fake
or not so let us know there's iOS 7 to
make you dizzy leave us a comment of
course it's always for another scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's our old machine follow

youtube channel as well you'd also
