pocket now calm and this is a look at
the new Windows Phone custom theme and
generator now Windows Mobile has always
had the capability to customize the
background and the color of the menu
bars but this new custom theme generator
goes a lot further and lets you
customize even more aspects of the
windows mobile operating system that you
couldn't before it's also web-based and
it's free so it's really easy to use so
that you can whip up new themes when you
get tired of your current theme to get
it you go to Windows Phone calm you'll
be redirected to this URL up here and
then you click on custom theme creator
down here towards the bottom of the page
and we're going to walk through this so
click start the custom theme generator
now right now you get a choice of three
devices but don't let that deter you if
you click on the HTC pure or the HTC
imagio these are just going to generate
themes based on the screen resolution of
these devices so 800 x 480 also known as
wvga so if you have a touch pro 2 or a
touch HD or touch diamond2 or the
plethora of other devices that have the
wvga resolution that doesn't matter
click on any of these the pure or the
imagio and it'll work over here if you
have a qvga screen you can click on the
intrepid we should note that the theme
does not work on windows mobile 6.1 or
6.5 so let's start off well go to the
HTC pure and let's start with a color
palette before we customize the color so
we can choose orange or green you know
for October let's do orange and right
away we can change the style of kind of
how the corners look so we can round off
the corners a little bit make them look
a little bit 3d or we can have kind of a
glassy effect that's a little bit more
subtle we can keep it basic by doing
sort of the flat not glassy or not 3d
look you know I like the 3d look we're
going to stay with that and we can flip
between these three different screen
shots to customize certain elements so
let's start with this top bar here I'm
going to click on that it gives you some
color choices but if you click on the
question mark you get a color palette so
I'm going to make the top bar actually a
bright red click keep okay that's good
and on the bottom I'm going to make the
bottom bar actually a black kind of get
the Halloween color thing going so black
okay that looks pretty good and I'm
going to click over
to this screen here and change the color
of this strip that appears on the top of
a reminder so click that and we're going
to go with black again just to kind of
match the bottom and we're going to go
over here to change the highlighting
color so click on the highlighting and
this time we're going to go with let's
let's do yellow this time kind of a
mustard yellow its kind ugly but it
works so a yellow color and finally we
can change the color of these little
scrolling bars here when you're in a
context menu and you guessed it we're
going to make this black as well just to
keep the whole everything kind of
congruent so here's our theme it's not
the most beautiful theme you can
certainly mess around and lex let's go
to the next step so the next step is
wallpaper your phone so we can keep this
wallpaper which is the standard thing or
we can upload our own image so here I
have a sample gallery of pictures none
of them are really Halloween like or
october but let's use let's use desert
that kind of works now from here we can
move the picture around and if you want
to move it around on the landscape view
let's say you have a touch pro 2 so you
look at the landscape view when you
slide out the keyboard you can move it
around you can zoom it on the picture
let's say we want to just capture the
the top of this this rock structure here
and over here in portrait we want to do
the same zoom in a little bit get that
rock structure there we can rotate the
picture we can revert it to the we can
flip it vertically so I'm going to click
keep and now we can do some other things
to the picture so we've already changed
the size and position we can change the
color by changing the hue kind of giving
it a tint although that really is kind
of ugly change the saturation reduce
some of the color kind of make a
grayscale I'm going to click cancel
because I like how it looks go to
contrast you can change the contrast on
the brightness it finally can go to
effects and if you want you can make it
monochrome you can make it blurred a
little bit or you can make it embossed
and so on and so forth you can really
experiment to your heart's content i'm
gonna click cancel and finally this is
the last that we go to generate your
theme now you're going to want to name
your theme i'm gonna call this october
and you can have it put on your device
in two ways you can have it set via text
message
you'll get a link to download it and
then you'll download it and then you'll
have to go through this quick procedure
you go to start settings and today
you'll see a list of themes and then
you'll click on october or whatever you
named it or the alternative method is
that you save it to your computer
locally and you take the cab file
transfer it to your phone you run the
cab file and then you go through that
same procedure start settings today
people that have been using Windows
Mobile will find this very easy it's
what we've been doing for many years so
that was a quick look at the custom
theme generator for windows mobile 6.5
devices again you can get to this by
going to Windows Phone calm for more on
windows phone and windows mobile 6.5
