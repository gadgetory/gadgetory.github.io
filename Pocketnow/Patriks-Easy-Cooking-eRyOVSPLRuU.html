partner calm and if you're like me you
like to cook and the one thing that I
find annoying when I'm in the kitchen is
trying to figure out what to make so
sometimes I usually go on to
foodnetwork.com or something like that
and get recipes but it's a it's a little
annoying especially you'll have a
computer inside the kitchen to print
them off or try to browse on your
windows mobile device to look up
arrested and today machine little
program called Patrick's easy cooking so
I'm just going to all programs real
quick and click on it and it will load
and as you can see it gives us a large
variety of different categories of
recipes that we can choose from so if I
wanted to choose something let's say I
want to make dinner and it's a main dish
or something like that I can just click
on here to main dish and it gives me a
few recipes quite a bit actually up just
I think there's 72 recipes on here which
is pretty good i mean it's about the
same as a cookbook and the program does
only cost 299 so let's see here so let's
see here here's a curry dish we can pick
and it gives us a little slide show
about the preparation it's actually
pretty cool because a lot of the times
the one thing that i hate about
cookbooks is it doesn't show you how to
prepare things so i usually spend time
watching food network learning how would
have actually make it so this is a this
is a good program because it will show
you how to cook things as well as just
give you a recipe so you can go scroll
down and will give us a list of our
ingredients and it will also give us our
step-by-step preparation so this is a
really great feature to have and like in
any cookbook as well as on a windows
mobile device and so we just scroll
through until we get to the end of the
dish and it looks pretty good actually
so to go back to the category we are at
before we can just click on main dish
and then if you want to go up even
further you can look through some other
some more of these recipes as you can
see there's quite a few and go up even
further into category and Natalie are
back at the beginning so we could pick
another category okay so if I'm at the
category screen I can click menu or from
any screen in that matter and I can
either pick category or chapter so I'm
going to actual
chapter right now and it gives you
instructions on how to do other things
like cooking in jars and cans keeping
foods longer cooking with leftovers when
something is missing and improving food
so we can just go back you can also
search for certain recipes add to your
favorites and of course about
information and exit so this program is
pretty neat it's called Patrick's easy
cooking and it does cost around two
dollars and ninety-nine cents and i will
post Linkin Park another comments on how
to get this so for someone that wants
quick and easy access to a recipe this
is the way to go hopefully there'll be
more recipes in the future thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
