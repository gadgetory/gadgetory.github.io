significant camera improvements nokia
already looks forward to returning to
the smartphone business and let echo
joins the crowd with some significant
black friday deals I'm hi meri behna and
as much as i enjoy fridays this is a
crazy when I've been packing since
yesterday this is pocket out daily the
official loose today begin with deals
companies are doing an amazing job with
black friday deals lately and let echo
has just joined the crowd you get an le
s3 for the purchase of a 4k TV for
example and in addition they're also
offering the left pro 3 for a crazy 279
dollars yeah that's actually a really
compelling deal I highly suggested
another very interesting news come from
Nokia as the company has just manifested
that it is looking forward to returning
to the smartphone business in 2017 as
the whole embargo whatever it is that
the company had with Microsoft this is
lifting we do know that the company CEO
will be a speaker at mwc in Barcelona so
we are assuming that this could be the
event where we'll see the first nokia
smartphone running Android cannot wait
to see that as well as will the
spotlight over to t-mobile believe it or
not even though deutsche telekom wanted
to sell the company a couple of years
ago ever since the administration of
john ledger well things have grown
significantly the company has posted
great numbers lately up to the point
where deutsche telekom has confirmed
that it is not interested in selling the
company on the contrary apparently it
wants to learn of a couple of things the
t-mobile as a innovated with and apply
it in other of the companies of the
company owns so yeah let's see what
t-mobile brings next year hopefully
better signal because I'm not really
that impressed and for those of you that
are still waiting for apples air pods
and i'm sure that at most there must be
just only three or four of you because
165 bucks for pair of headphones that
will fall off here here extremely easily
is not something I'm looking forward to
but anyways we were expecting these
products to be announced in Apple's
recent event for the Mac didn't happen
then we heard rumors that they were
going to be launched in November didn't
happen apparently we're going to wait
until mid the
december and well we're going to wait
actually probably sounds too big no some
people are graduating and finally the
very hot news they have to do with the
iphone 8 KGI securities is very famous
for predicting a lot of things that will
happen with the next generation iphones
and we hear a couple of things number
one the plus variant is getting a lot of
improvements apparently we're getting o
is on both cameras not just the
wide-angle lens as we currently do but
in addition to that glass on glass is
going to be the design element according
to kg I and this is rather interesting
as Apple tried the glass on glass I
remember the drama of the day so it
leads me to the question of the day you
think that Apple should stick to
aluminum and continue to explore that
whole jet black design that looks like
glass in my case I think the company
should just figure out a way for that
thing not to scratch or probably come up
with other colors but glass on glass I
don't think that's a good idea leave us
a comment down below I'd love to know
