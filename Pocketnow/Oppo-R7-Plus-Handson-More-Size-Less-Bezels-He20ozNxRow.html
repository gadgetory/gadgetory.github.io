ten-year celebrations by bringing us a
couple of new products at the table and
after having a look at its more
conventional Oppo r7 in the previous
video it sends a given speaker and
battered brother a quick look I'm hey
Matt we got it with pocket now here in
Beijing with our hands on the Oppo r7
plus even though we're barely a couple
of months away from opos launch of the
revolutionary design that made the Oppo
r5 possible the company is out with a
new lineup of successors and we're the O
bore 7 plus follows in the tradition of
defining product design if compared to
its more traditional sibling that is the
new Oppo r7 plus is significantly larger
than the regular ol r7 and the company
takes advantage of this larger real
estate to bring some cool new design
innovations first of all we've got a 6
inch 1080p AMOLED display up front
that's covered by 2.5 D class and yes
you'll notice that there are no apparent
bezels here now this design is more of
an illusion as there is more than a
millimeter in separation between the
edges and the visible panel thanks to a
black internal bezel and the 2.5 B glass
that we've mentioned so yeah you don't
see any bezels but it depends on which
angle you're looking at it from it
doesn't match it's smaller sibling in
certain specifications like for example
bringing the same 1.5 to 2 pairs
Snapdragon 615 processor in the same
three gigabytes of RAM and but some
elements of the curved metallic unibody
design making it to the bottom just as
well but that's just about it
the old bars have been + sports a larger
32 gigabytes of expandable storage a
larger 4,100 milliamp hour battery
that's compatible with its loop rapid
charging technology
it also supports dual nano SIM
connectivity and it even includes the
same touch sensitive fingerprint scanner
that we know from the Oppo and three now
just keep in mind that as opposed to the
full button that exposes the fingerprint
scanner feature of the oppo n3 the new
Opel r7 plus doesn't support a push
button in this feature so you have to
activate the display and then on
the phone we also have a 13-megapixel IM
x27 a primary shooter with an 8
megapixel front firing camera with a
wide-angle lens as well in our disparity
with this device and it's a smaller
sibling is that it runs the same color
west 2.1 but this time it has an android
5.1 lollipop under the hood we do see
the same flat iconography making it to
this launch if you compare it to the
smaller sibling but other than that the
design of the feature elements are
almost identical to KitKat
what a cool addition though is that the
new UI is based on the software buttons
and not capacitive keys which is
definitely welcome for the newer
features that are brought to this larger
display you could say that the Oppo r7
plus is a more complete product
experience and with small enough bezels
to not make the phone feel massive in
your hand but again you'll have to wait
for our full review to give you our
final impressions we've got a lot more
coverage coming from Beijing's and make
