the name HTC was synonymous with windows
smartphones and after a slightly
concerning low Microsoft fans can
breathe a sigh of relief HTC is back
with the device we think is the most
attractive Windows Phone ever from the
company but does its performance live up
to its look i'm michael fisher with
pocket now and let's find out in our
video review of the HTC One m8 for
Windows as we said in our dedicated
comparison last week the One m8 for
Windows is physically identical to its
Android powered predecessor that means
we're looking at a unibody metal casing
with a brushed hairline finish and a
feel in hand that highlights its
exemplary machining while Windows Phone
isn't wanting for high-quality Hardware
most of its top-shelf offerings till now
have featured a polycarbonate build and
that makes the 90 percent aluminium One
m8 stand out even more dramatically and
it stands out under the hood as well
from the Snapdragon 801 to the
expandable 32 gigs of onboard memory to
the 5-inch 1080p display the One m8
carries some of the highest specs
available on a Windows Phone including
rare extras like an IR port and front
firing speakers about the only thing we
don't like about the hardware is how big
it has to be to accommodate those
speakers and also that slippery finish
which makes it easy to drop this
exceptional hardware demands an
outstanding software platform to match
in a visual sense Windows Phone 8.1 1 is
that platform Microsoft's operating
system looks better on the One m8 and
almost any other smartphone and there
are times that we think the m8 looks
better running Windows Phone than
Android these two were made for each
other as for Windows Phone itself most
of our impressions from our 8.1 review
remain unchanged we're sad to see
Microsoft compromised some of the clean
look and feel of its original vision and
annoyed by the occasional bugs that the
company
has yet to iron out but we are excited
that the new software includes things
like Action Center and start screen
folders both of which are executed with
Microsoft's usual visual flair Cortana
is smarter than ever striking a nice
balance between the utility of Google
now and the personality of Siri and even
traditional pain points like navigation
are gradually improving
don't let Verizon sell you on the need
for its paid navigation software
download the free here sweet instead on
a road trip during our review period
here maps actually plotted a decent
course for us here drive plus got us
there safely and here transit helped out
after our return when we had to take a
bus back from the car rental office here
in the States
we still prefer Google's navigation
solutions on Android phones for the
traffic prediction and delay alerts but
even without those bells and whistles
here usually gets the job done for us on
windows phones and we like how easy it
is to download maps directly to the
device as well our bigger beef with
Windows Phone 8.1 is its buggier than
usual behavior with respect to past
versions especially in terms of
third-party apps with over 300,000
titles the Windows Store is more
populated than ever but many top-tier
apps lag months behind in terms of
updates and even popular titles like
Spotify hang and crash more often here
than on other platforms first party
software isn't immune to a rough edge or
to either HTC zone blinkfeed app is more
crudely honed here than it is on Android
and it's camera app is less consistent
as well sometimes bogging down right
when it's least convenient speaking of
the camera this is the first Windows
Phone to boast HTC's duo arrangement and
it carries the familiar mix of ups and
downs the UI offers both simple and
granular controls and the faux bouquet
photos with enhanced depth of field are
good enough for a quick wow effect but
not much else we have a better time
shooting conventional photos with the
one m8 and despite its low resolution
output it's quite possible to get some
nice results as we've seen from past
comparisons HTC software bumps
up the saturation and contrast a bit and
we don't have a problem with that when
it leads to photos that look this good
turn down the Sun and the m8 ultra pixel
enhancements come into play to pull
every last photon from the scene
Windows Phone already had some excellent
low-light cameras in the Lumia line and
the m8 only bolsters that offering it
also ups the game on the other side the
wide-angle front-facing camera will be a
welcome sight for anyone who takes a lot
of group selfies videos shut with the
1080p camcorder are bumpier than what
you'll get from one of those optically
stabilized Nokia's and the manual focus
could be a bit more precise still for
the overwhelming majority of consumers
that's picking nits especially if you
make use of the excellent video
highlights feature to spice things up
this video camera is more than enough
for documenting most life events from
the banal to the spectacular this phone
is for now exclusive to Verizon's LTE
network which thanks to some recent
enhancement got a made up marketing term
X LTE and a not so made up speed boost
we averaged 50 down and 12 up in Greater
Boston on our six day test period which
is a huge improvement over Verizon's
performance last year coverage between
Boston and New York is also excellent in
rural and urban areas voice calling is
also good with no clarity or loudness
issues on either end audio through
earbuds is rich full and loud and
speaker phone calls are outstanding
thanks to the boom sound speakers which
are still the best smartphone speakers
we've heard on a US carrier smartphone
budding racecar drivers will be happy to
know that gaming is no trouble on the
one m8 for Windows so long as you can
find a game you want to play in the
Windows Store our old reliable asphalt
ran wonderfully even in max graphics
mode as did infinite flight and while
you shouldn't play too many 3d games
without being plugged in you'll be happy
to know that battery life isn't bad
usually on a day with two and a half
hours of continuous moderate mixed usage
we were still at over 70% charge after
about 7 hours off the charger that said
on another day with light usage but
poorer coverage we blew through a
quarter of the battery in one hour of
standby so as always keep an eye on your
power consumption the One m8 might not
be exciting to you if you're a veteran
of the Android world after all this is a
phone that launched back in the spring
but in the land of Windows Phone the m8
represents some of the best build
quality and the highest specs the
platform has yet seen along with an
unparalleled audio experience if you're
searching for the finest Windows Phone
on Verizon Wireless and you don't need a
camera with crazy resolution look no
further than the HTC One m8 for Windows
for more detail on the One m8 see our
full written review available August

comparison live now and our One m8 vs
Lumia icon comparison coming later this
