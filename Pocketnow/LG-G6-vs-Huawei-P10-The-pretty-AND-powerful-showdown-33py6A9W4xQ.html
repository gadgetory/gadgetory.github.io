year one manufacturer focused on
refining from a successful run in 2016
the other manufacturer taking a bolder
step towards redefining its smartphone
lineup it's time for a showdown huawei
p10 vs. LG g6 kicking things off with
design while we played this year fairly
conservatively from t9 to p10 the main
controversy here is moving the
fingerprint sensor from the rear of the
phone to the front it's an attractive
handset and we're enjoying this textured
shimmering blue but LG certainly made
the more dramatic move in terms of
aesthetics the two phones share some
nice elements like flush camera sensors
but ultimately we think LG manages the
wind for style moving over to hardware
this is an extremely hard fought battle
again LG delivers the bolder update
lifestyle features like water resistance
and wireless charging are always
appreciated
and this two-to-one aspect ratio display
is a radical shift recalling how
exciting it was to see the huge screen
in the LG g2 this is a lot of surface
area to find in such a reasonable form
factor while the p10 isn't nearly as
dramatic visually were consistently
impressed with how powerful this phone
is the Kiran 960 won't face any real
competition until devices start shifting
with Qualcomm to 835 chipset Huawei
unleashed a monster easily the most
powerful performer available right now
I'd prefer calling this a tie but
ultimately we're going to give LG a tiny
lead here for the broader collection of
lifestyle features and tech improvements
now for fans of stock android both of
these phones are likely to take some l's
Huawei and LG still shipping skins which
are often polarizing in our comments yet
both custom layers have matured nicely
and we find areas where manufacturer can
still improve on androids feature set in
UI LG delivers the more modern aesthetic
software which straddles holo in
material design but we're going to give
the software win to Huawei even though
these design elements are sure to be
controversial we expect EMU eyes
background resource management
defragging and garbage collection to
keep the phone running smoother over
time especially when paired with this
powerful chipset and
the visual appeal well Google is all
about steaming right now to audio both
phones have good bottom firing speakers
but the g6 takes the lead for having
slightly louder and fuller playback
though both are mono solutions their
each respectively punchy for media and
loud enough for notifications and alerts
add bone game however scores an easy win
for LG the g6 recovers nicely from last
year's missteps and this phone gets Us
close to iPhone and HTC 10 territory
noticeably better quality and a louder
amp the p10 just simply isn't a match
for LG this year but the script slips
for battery running our media test not
only is the Huawei more powerful it's
also more power efficient and we need to
mark these tests with a giant asterisk
since our g6 is currently still on
pre-release software but this is a wide
performance gap which we're not sure LG
can completely make up after updates the
recharge game also goes to wall way LG
is using a faster quick charge 3.0 spec
but it can't quite catch the p10 super
charger again with the asterisk as LG
claims a 50% recharge in 30 minutes
which we just couldn't manage to hit
plugging this phone in saving the best
for last
let's chat about these cameras again
it's exciting to see dual sensors and
hardware image stabilization without any
bulges out of the rear casing so kudos
for both getting down to performance
this is one of the more brutal Sofia's
choices we've had to make while way
using two sensors in tandem for every
photo taken and boasting a fantastic
software depth of field mode LG uses one
sensor for a normal field of view and
the second sensor for ultra wide-angle
shots improved over the v20 the p10
delivers some of the most stunning still
photos we've ever seen from a phone but
the g6 is no slouch an LG solution is
more flexible closer to simulating a
zoom lens between wide normal and crop
fields of view the video comparison is
also tricky the g6 inherits nearly all
of the controls we enjoy on the b20
producing very high quality youh videos
but those files eat up a lot of storage
the p10 solves the storage and bandwidth
issue with h.265 compression but those
videos require a little extra work to
edit or share on YouTube
because of Google's licensing issues
while the p10 video is much improved
over the p9 the g6 ultimately delivers
smoother and higher quality output
excellent photos with photographic
output and very good video against one
of the most flexible cameras for stills
featuring excellent video output in
control its again by the narrowest of
margins that we give the win to LG but
both manufacturers should be commended
born of very different philosophies
these are fantastically comprehensive
imaging solutions carrying both phones
at the same time has been a rare treat
for this reviewer so let's wrap this up
where does that leave us between the LG
G 6 and the huawei p10 no cop-outs here
though this is a terrifically difficult
choice for the horsepower junkie it's
tough to deny what the p10 is packing
it's an absolute screamer with very good
battery life to boot but even though the
g6 loses the performance point the
broader collection of lifestyle features
better audio and a bold new screen
aspect ratio take the win in this
