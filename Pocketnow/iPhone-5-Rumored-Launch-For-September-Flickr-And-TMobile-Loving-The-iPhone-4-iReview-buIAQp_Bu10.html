smaller as artists that September
releases are mentioned the unlocked
iphone proves true to success at
t-mobile and guess what camera rose on
flickr all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm high metal
Yvette and welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with a cool so
what's on rumor mill this week for the
iphone 4s or five well the answers a lot
some people are speculating that the
device will be released in august though
our biggest bet is that it will be
released in September for the itunes
music event that happens every year no
specifics on that just yet but aside
from that well others are speculating
that the device will be the same iphone
4 design with a dramatic bumpin specs
but others are speculating the device
will change completely and dramatically
more like what we saw with the ipad 1
moving to the ipad 2 aside from that
other rumors have it that it'll bring a
dual LED flash though some people are
mentioning that it'll be on one side
other people are mentioning that it'll
be beside the camera and some others are
speculating that one flash will be on
one side and another flash will be on
the other but that's not like Apple so
we'll see what happens in the end after
these rumors become a reality if you
thought selling the iphone four unlocked
for six hundred and fifty dollars a
piece last week was crazy think again a
tmobile spokesperson just revealed that
over 1 million unlocked iphones are
working on their networks and yeah
they're all sinking on crazy slow 2g
edge speeds so this just to give you an
idea of how the market behaves some
people really don't care about the cost
or the speed at which they navigate and
just to get their hands on a specific
device that they want in this case it's
the iphone so not all these devices are
the iphone 4 you know the ones that were
sold last week some of them are
obviously iphone 3gs and 3 g's that were
unlocked through jailbreaks in the past
but again that's your market man so
what's the most popular camera on flickr
well it's not the canon t2i and it's not
the canon eos rebel
no it's not the nikon d90 either that
was the top one before guess which one
it is now well it's the Apple iPhone 4
and no there's not the most popular
camera you know for smartphone know
there's a most popular camera period
this just to give you an idea of how
popular the images of the iphone 4 are
you know it's not the best camera in the
world obviously it's not your typical
point-and-shoot camera but it is
definitely superior that most if not all
smartphone cameras out there you know
except for the samsung galaxy s2 you
know Brandon really gave really good
reviews on that but still the iphone 4
is obviously obviously the most popular
smartphone in many areas right now so
you'd guess why it's so popular lately
apple recently want a patent that they
filed four years ago when they release
the first generation iphone and it's got
a lot of controversy lately and we'll
talk about this here and in the
not-so-cool section also first of all
well it's about having multi-touch
gestures on a capacitive screen and
you'd say yeah well Android devices also
do that and before you tell me about any
superiority about Android remember this
came to the iphone first before that
well android was a pretty much keyboard
device or that's what they were working
on and then windows flown and just about
everybody else was doing different
things they were using resistive
displays and not capacitive well this
has just been won by Apple four years
later and a lot of people are worried
and we'll talk about that later but
first of all one of the really cool
things that was revealed by the patterns
that it's interesting to see that Apple
already considered widgets back then
when they release the first generation
iphone and well we're not sure if
they're going to include them eventually
you'll say that yes Android brought
widgets you know most probably Apple
chose not to release which is because
Android did first probably you know it
was probably a patent then but it wasn't
executed immediately and then Android
caught it up and did it but you know it
could be that you know it'll come
eventually to either Notification Center
Oh to the home screen a lot of people
have already shown that it's they're
able to bring third-party widgets to the
Notification Center through a jailbreak
so it's only a matter of time before we
probably see that come as a release of
apps in the future see
happens well that does it for the
coolest continue on with the not so cool
what's all the stress about Apple
winning this patent well first of all
it's a multi-touch gesture on capacitive
display patent which is pretty much the
same pinch to zoom thing that we see
everywhere and well before anybody
complains about this Apple did invent it
and I do remember even Steve Jobs
mentioning on macro 2007 when he
released a first generation iphone boy
have we patented and it took Apple for
years to get this patent the question is
why did Android manufacturers and pretty
much you know the Android design crew
and you know Google end up considering
pulling up these things of Apple had
already patented it the question is what
will Apple do with this could they sue
everybody just like Nokia sued them and
pretty much get some royalties over the
fact that a lot of manufacturers out
there are using it or could probably
Apple just sue them and give them a
cease to the sis letter to tell them hey
we don't want you building that into
your device's but then you have the
whole capacitive display technology
involved women the whole patent so we're
not really sure what could happen I
don't really think that Apple will try
to hurt the industry by you know telling
everybody to stop building competition I
don't think it's gonna be that easy I
could just see Apple making money over
it just like they do with a lot of other
pans that we do see out there but then
you know it's just a question of why
didn't competitors figure out another
way to zoom that's not pinch that could
have been the smartest thing to do in
the past speaking of pens all of us have
been on the edge of our seats waiting
for a judge to rule in favor of Samsung
an obligate Apple to give them their
iphone 5 before us and their iPad 3 but
sorry guys sadly the judge ruled in
favor of Apple we're not going to get a
little demo of these devices before
they're released sadly so you know we're
not smiling anymore about that not cool
at all Apple II should have given to
them new verizon customers prepare as
the unlimited data plans are going
bye-bye if you were paying 30 bucks for
an unlimited data plan sadly that's soon
to desist
you're now going to be have to be paying
the same 30 bucks for two gigabytes 50
bucks if you want five gigabytes and 80
bucks if you want n gigabytes of data on
your device it's not confirmed on which
state of d'lai this is going to happen
but everybody's speculating and almost
certain that this is not going to happen
for those current unlimited data plan
owners of verizon so the smartest thing
to do is to act now they'll get your
device or plan of yours considering
switching to verizon do it now before
these changes happen because we're not
sure it's going to happen you know that
you currently have a plan but your
probabilities are much broader that
you'll keep it and well most probably
you'll just be asked to forget about it
when your contract gets to be renewed so
we'll see what happens sad news that's
it for today's show thank you very much
for watching I'm high metal be better
i'm ready to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
