to take a factory tour walk down a
corridor right now had to leave all of
my other phones and gadgets and stuff
aside but they are letting me walk
around with the camera so I'm hoping I
understood them properly and that all my
stuff is going to be there when I get
back but this is the Oval campus and
we're going to see cool SEP hopefully
about how different phones are
manufactured and made and all that all
that jazz you know I'm feeling a little
like that a Mister Rogers reach out you
have crayons are made yeah we're totally
styling definitely I like the I was
going to ask but you know I kind of like
my hat don't get me wrong I mean that
looks great on you
thank y'all you're looking great yeah
that's fallen I like it it totally does
not make you look like a cafeteria
worker not in the slightest parish
design
[Laughter]
no no not even a little bit
oh really so like you've only just
started giving tours of the facility oh
that's cool
Oh
[Laughter]
what would your favorite part part where
they put the things on the thing yeah my
favorite parts where they made the phone
good one yeah yeah I was definitely
and this exact softbox
kind of
yeah so that's pretty intense watching
them go through that kind of testing
process where we're talking about
hundreds of thousands of button presses
and millions keyboard presses and
dropping from between one and three
meters and sort of Braille drop test
situations so it's a it's they're
definitely trying to step up their game
on quality assurance and QA making sure
that they can deliver a consistent
product I think that's one of the
biggest issues facing a lot of
manufacturers is consistency
fifteen
[Laughter]
