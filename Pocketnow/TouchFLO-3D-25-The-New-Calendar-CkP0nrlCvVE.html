pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the evolution of
the HTC calendar application from
touchflo 3d 12 to two now two point five
which is unreleased but we're going to
show it in this video so if you remember
touchflo 3d version one point oh right
so we had this great interface that was
knew we could flick through favorite
contacts but there was no really way to
get into the calendar tab because it
didn't have a calendar tab so you had to
go to the start menu and go to calendar
and then you've got the ugly windows
mobile calendar which looks the same
that it did on the Pocket PC operating
system many years ago and then HTC came
out with the calendar tab for touchflo
3d version to point up so now we could
scroll to the right or just go right to
it and we have the calendar here in this
beautiful looking display we can flick
our finger get a great animation but it
was read-only we can only do a certain
few things with it we can go to a
particular day by tapping on the day
button here and we can make a new
appointment but when you make it new
appointment you're thrown right into the
ugly windows mobile interface kind of
takes away from the elegant touch flo 3d
experience also there are only two views
month you and debut so it was quite
limited but now in touch flo 3d version
2.5 which I'm running here on a touch
diamond2 we have a new calendar
application that actually goes a lot
deeper so it starts from the main screen
here and we went over touchflo 3d 2.5
more in depth in a previous video i'll
put a link on this video to get to that
and of course we have the the redesigned
main screen but we can also see our
first appointment here and if we tap on
the appointment we're taken right to it
and let's go right to the calendar tab
so you can take a look at what's new so
we still have this month view and we can
flip through and get the nice looking
animations but now we have a gender view
which is a really great way to see your
next appointments and you can scroll
through and kind of get a checklist of
what you're doing in the next few days
but also new to touch flo 3d 2.5 is the
ability to actually add appointments
with touchflo 3d so if i go to this day
and then i type a new appointment or I
tap on new appointment it will take me
into a very elegant-looking touchflo 3d
interface where I can add a new
appointment and really not go out into
the ugly windows mobile calendar which
is not too pretty and also new to touch
flo 3d 2.5 calendar is the year view so
if i go into menu and you go to year get
a nice view of all of the different
months in the year and you can quickly
reference you can even flip to the next
year just like you can with the months
and also there's a little bit of a some
things you can change not too much
though you can change the first day of
the week to another day Monday or Sunday
and the default reminder of course you
could do this in Windows Mobile before
but now it's skinned and elegant touch
flo 3d so a lot of people are really
going to appreciate the updated calendar
application people that use the calendar
a lot on their windows mobile device
we're going to see this in the upcoming
HTC devices like the Firestone and the
superstar and all those other ones that
we don't know about yet and are just
rumors so that's it for the new new
calendar in touch flo 3d version 2.5
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
