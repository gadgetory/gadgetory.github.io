project apart but this time it seems to
be good news for Finland more leagues of
the samsung galaxy s active show us
color options and google i/o teaches us
a thing or two about mobile assistance
I'm hi meri behna and ok Google can I
please have somebody edit this video
this is parking out daily the official
news today start with google i/o i am
not even going to bore you with
specifics we pretty much had to make
another video just separating everything
that google announced because everything
was hot starting with google assistant
with the new version of android and with
everything that's coming to android wear
to android home sorry google home
because of yeah apparently Ghul wants to
take over everything and the company's
assistant is just something completely
different completely unique I suggest
you watch the whole video and answer
that question of the day there and
speaking of smart digital assistants
this is rather interesting as the wall
street journal is now teasing that
Amazon is working on taking its alexa
project further it was nice for Google
to actually claim that Amazon began
everything would be Alexa echo smart
speaker now we see that apparently
amazon is probably working on bringing
some sort of a tablet with alexa
functionality let's just hope this
tablet doesn't flop we'll keep you
posted now we have seen the teasers of
the issues zenfone 3 and this time we
have some benchmarks that show us a
snapdragon 820 4 gigs of ram in addition
to a 23 megapixel camera all great
things except for the fact that we have
a 1080p display tilt that's not
necessarily bet it could mean great
battery life it could mean a lot of
things and we sadly aren't sure which of
the three variants is going to bring
that so we can't wait to learn more at
the event and for those of you in the
market for Galaxy s7 active i know i am
we have some leaked renders that show us
two things number one the military-grade
color option that i consider terrible
but some people might like it and in
addition to that we also see some very
interesting buttons at the front that
don't necessarily look better than the
previous one hopefully this means some
sort of added functionality or just some
enhanced
since the design we will keep you posted
as soon as we learn more because I don't
really like it and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with Microsoft not necessarily in a bad
or good way as we see that the company
is selling off it's a feature phone
handset division nokia is licensing it
as well so we will continue to see these
branded phones though from another
supplier it also means that nokia will
probably now be able to build its
android phone and there's a lot of
anticipation for this we've seen this on
the nokian one tablet we've seen that
the company is also working on some sort
of an android phone that we have not
seen anything concrete as to timing but
pay it leads me to the question of the
day what would you like to see in a
nokia android smartphone in my case as
long as they bring the essence of nokia
great camera quality great design I will
be happy to test one out but leave us a
comment down below we would love to know
