for parking out com Tony on camera again
we've got the HTC One S here we just
talked about recently and we're going to
compare it with other flagship
smartphones obviously first of all the
Galaxy Nexus which is the current
android 4.2 smartphone obviously the
Galaxy Nexus is a Titan phone it's a lot
bigger than the 1s but if you'll notice
obviously this is a qHD display this is
a 720p display you'll notice the colors
I mean first of all the 1s for some
reason just look scripts it looks
beautiful comparison I don't know the
Galaxy Nexus I like the screen a little
more definitely a lot thinner
for some reason obviously you know
galaxy exercises hump over here with
another than that this phone is still
thinner this one is still taller this
one is still wider I don't know why this
feels if I had to compare this feels
cheap this feels a little bit better
build quality HTC One S so far winning
they're definitely if we compare it to
the galaxy s2 galaxy s2 is almost the
same size we noticed the same height
super same with same thickness this
one's a little bit thinner this one also
feels plastic and achievements this one
feels better bill followed with the
aluminum at the back so far the display
well that's kind of a hard one you know
galaxy s2 does a really good job of the
display but this curation displays
actually good wvga here not really sure
what's better but let's compare it to
the iphone for us well it's kind of a
hard one this one is obviously a lot
taller this one's definitely wider than
the 4s and then this one the HTC device
is definitely thinner than the iphone 4s
so far but this place well that's kind
of a hard one obviously this wallpaper
that's a really good job in making ice
cream sandwich and since four point oh
look good impression to the iphone 4s
but so far you know i say that they're
really good fighters obviously the
screen sizes are very different but so
far i got handed to the 1s it's actually
very beautiful device even if it's sort
of a mid-tier device if we compared to
the other smartphones that we just
compared it with
is definitely a good device for a lot of
people that are probably not going to
want to spend much not really sure what
pricing is going to be like but we're
going to see that very zooming so far
well we got to say that the oneness is a
really good contender and we're going to
compare to the 1x see these other phones
very soon so thank you very much it's
kind of a letter blogger.com with the HT
one s2000 with other flagship Sparkman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
