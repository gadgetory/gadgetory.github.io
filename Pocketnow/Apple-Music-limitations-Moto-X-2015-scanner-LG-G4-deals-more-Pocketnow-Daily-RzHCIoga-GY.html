will work at the end of the month leave
them adjust show us up substantially
better Moto X and if you're in the
market for an LG g4 this is probably the
month to buy I'm hi Mary vitta and yeah
I am refreshed that we have one of the
just apple news today this is foggy now
daily the official news today start with
LG as the company wants to sweeten the
pot of you're interested in an LG g4 or
already own one as a the company has a
deal that only lasts for this month
where you can get an extra leather back
cover if you buy another leather back
cover meaning there are five color
options you buy one you get another one
free which is odd since you're
apparently not getting this if you buy
an LG g4 if the vibe leather cover is
well but does yeah having three covers
is not a bad idea either and remember
there's only last for one month now one
of the most anticipated phones of the
year at least for us reviewers is the
Moto X 2015 because we love the previous
two iterations of this device one of the
biggest caveats with this phone is that
it doesn't have a fingerprint scanner
and that's something that a lot of us
really like and we've got some leaked
images to show us the back of a moto x
2015 and yes it seems that the
fingerprint is the fingerprint scanner
is coming we just don't know exactly how
Motorola plans to pull this off given
the fact that it seems to the bin full
will change in its design will keep you
posted as we learn more and if 2k
displays aren't enough for you ZT has
got the solution the company is
apparently working on a star 3
smartphone that will include a 5.5 inch
4k display and we're not sure if this is
the sharp 4k display that was announced
a few months ago but yeah it seems the
technology is there and the company
wants to push it out in a new smartphone
and apparently have a couple of things
in order to be able to be efficient in
power consumption this is just crazy 800
PPI for a 4k display my god now seems
the Microsoft is losing the battle in
being popular with social networks
google has pretty much killed everything
when it comes to its mobile platforms
for Microsoft and well Facebook is
apparently doing the same the committee
has just updated its graph API and it
no longer support the things that
Windows and Windows Phone users need for
facebook to integrate to it so if you
notice something very odd happening with
your windows phone yeah that's the
excuse and we have no solution but we
should learn more soup and finally for
the very interesting news of the day if
you thought that Apple music will be the
next Spotify killer I back to the firm
we get to learn more details about this
product and well it's similar to Spotify
on certain things like for example
artists have to allow their music to be
played on these services so yeah you'll
probably will get Taylor Swift if you
care about that but the problem is that
what happens with the artists that don't
want to be part of this which is one
thing and then the second thing is is
there a freemium model in this service
yes it seems that there is certain
services will work but only for iphone
users if you're an Android user you will
have to pay for the service or else and
it doesn't lead me to the question of
the day after all the announcements of
Apple music and everything you've seen
when you ditch Spotify over Apple music
or whatever service you're using right
now we've talked about that before
because in my case oh that's gonna be a
tough one I really really like Spotify
but hey I can't wait for the trial to
start at the end of the month and we'll
let you know in the comments down below
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filmed machine phone was on
