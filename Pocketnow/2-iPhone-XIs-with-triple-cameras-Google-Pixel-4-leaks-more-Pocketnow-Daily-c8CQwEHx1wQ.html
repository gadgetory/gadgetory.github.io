models could feature triple cameras
after all we've got some renders of the
Google pixel for and actually least see
something familiar here and Huawei just
published the patent of a phone with
three cameras and two displays I'm hey
mater Iveta and it's Friday happy st.
Patrick's Day for those of you
celebrating over the weekend we'll be in
the parade in New York hope to see you
there
this is Fargo now daily the official
news today begin with events Apple has
just announced at WWDC is happening on
June 3rd invitations and pretty much
everything is gonna start rolling out on
March 20th and this is actually 30 years
of WWDC so hopefully we get something
cool to commemorate now let's talk about
the Huawei P 30 P 30 Pro we get more
renders and possible specifications we
hear Kiran 980 in addition to 8 gigs of
RAM options between 128 256 gigs of
storage depending on the Burien that you
get for those of you that we're
wondering if we're getting four cameras
or not now we look closely into the
renders yes there is a fourth camera
that time-of-flight sensor seems to be
under the flash thanks to everybody that
pointed that out by the way we got more
confirmation on that with these renders
uh looks interesting hope to see
something soon now speaking of Huawei it
seems that this is not the only product
the company is working on we've got some
patent applications where the company is
working on a device with three cameras
in the back and a horizontal array and
then there's a display at the bottom
sort of like what we saw with the new BX
sort of like what we've seen from other
devices yeah for bebo so yeah it seems
that Huawei also wants to experiment
with this design I actually find that
idea to be compelling even if I haven't
really try one of these phones yet let's
see what we get now let's move the
spotlight over to the Google pixel for
pixel for excel we've got some leaked
schematics of what the design of this
phone might look like it seems that
there isn't much change from the back
but there are two things that are
important here number one notice that
there is no fingerprint scanner that's
interesting could it be that it's
embedded in the display and then the
second thing is that well there is no
long island notch apparently what we're
getting is a punch hole cut out sort of
like what we see with the Infinity o on
the Galaxy S 10 Plus do
cameras that's rather interesting let's
just hope it happens this looks far
better than what we see from Google in
the past
and finally the hottest dishes that I
have to do with the iPhone 11 possibly
iPhone 11 plus whatever the case may be
we have some leaked information that
shows us that these three cameras are
actually a possibility now the
interesting part is that it seems that
not all iPhones are gonna get it we hear
the rumors that there are three iPhones
but only apparently either one or two
will get it and we still don't have
information over what the third camera
is going to be doing we assume that it
could be a time-of-flight camera but in
today's question let us know I mean what
would you want that third camera to do
would you rather a time a flight sensor
for better 3d or would you rather a
wide-angle because in my case I would
definitely prefer the wide-angle but
that's just me leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on pocket now
