Baku now calm and one of the coolest
things about android 2.1 is it has a
built in google navigator so all you
have to do is talk and find out exactly
where you want to go or whatever to use
google navigator but what happens when
you're out of service and you don't have
a data connection well today I'm going
to show you copilot live professional
which is a great application if you're
going to be traveling out of the country
or anywhere whether it is no signal so
let's get started okay so here we are on
copilot live and it's a pretty powerful
GPS application for Android devices and
it allows you to download the maps
directly to your storage card and you
can either do that through Wi-Fi or
through your data plan if you'd like so
we can go down to menu and we have a lot
of options we can go to my places
destination quick stop we can also add a
detour get live services just scroll
over plan or edit a trip change the
driving views so right here I can either
go to a 3d or a 2d so as you see it's
just changed to a 3d view go back let's
see here we go in some of the settings
we can get routing settings map styles
let the one to change it to let's see
the day let's say I want it to be this
one right now it's nighttime of course
so I'm just going to change there click
OK and now we can go back and back again
and now it's changed the way that the
map looks and it also gives us all of
these great points of interest and all
we have to do is click on one of them
and it will show us exactly what that is
and we can either call them or go
directly to their and unlike a lot of
other mapping programs out there this
one actually allows you to get updates
directly from the copilot server you can
also send your location to your friends
if you like and download additional maps
so we can go here and pretty much
download the entire world if you wanted
to another good feature about this
navigation Program copilot live is that
it will speak the street addresses and
numbers to you so if you're driving and
you don't want to look at your now
program you all you have to do is listen
to the device and it will tell you
exactly where you should go and this is
another Android Market pick and the poem
is called copilot live and it costs
twenty nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents but if you're out in the middle of
nowhere it'll definitely be worth it
thanks for watching and if at any time
you want to download this program for
your device just navigate using google
goggles to the image of the QR code on
the screen and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
