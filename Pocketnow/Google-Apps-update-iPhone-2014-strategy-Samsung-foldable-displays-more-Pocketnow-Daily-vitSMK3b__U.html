reaching the rest of the Android
ecosystem Apple might be considering
launching more than one iphone every
year and Sampson keeps showing us what
their next technology will be I'm high
memory better and if I look like crap
trust me should have seen me with this
cold about an hour ago this is
out daily let's actually off with some
official news those of you interested in
getting all the Android 4.4 KitKat
Google application updates should be
happy these should be reaching your
smartphone's very soon as Google just
begun pushing updates to hangouts which
will now integrate with SMS messages and
aside from that their keyboard is also
being updated aside from other
applications as well obviously as with
everything google this will take some
time for every smartphone to get but
it's great to see it it's already
happening and speaking of Google how has
been your experience with the Nexus 5 as
our own Michael Fisher has told us just
how unpredictable the camera is and how
squeaky the speaker is and well with the
speaker case we were kind of expecting
that since the LG g2 did not have a good
speaker but apparently google has just
said that it seems to be a software
glitch and they're planning to fix it in
the next coming weeks still again do you
have problems with your camera with your
speaker let us know in the comments and
speaking of updates a company that's
done a great job and getting a software
updates for their current lineup a Sony
which is really surprising since in
previous years they were terrible it
turns out we've gotten the best updates
already for a current lineup this year
and so it has already confirmed that we
are getting Android 4.3 and 4.4 to every
smartphone they've launched this year so
you can expect 4.3 to reach your phone
in the next coming weeks and then 4.4
might take a couple of weeks more stay
tuned for that is obviously as long as
we're getting updates its great time now
let's talk about Apple as we're getting
some rumors that the company will now be
considering launching more than one
iphone update every year and I'm not
saying that we're getting more than one
iphone I'm saying that they might just
launched an update for their iPhone
twice a year like they did with the iPad
last year apparently Apple has been
noticing how their performance drops in
sales obviously in that last quarter
before the next iPhone is announced so
most probably they want to play with
that but still stay tuned for that let's
see if that really happens because this
is not like Apple and finally for the
interesting news of the day Samson
continues
teasing and demoing their future
technology for the next two years first
of all you remember there I so sell
camera which should bring better
contrast and color accuracy should be
ready for galaxy phones next year so
stay tuned for that one but on the other
hand they've also shown us their
flexible display technology foldable
flexible display technology and
apparently the company is working to
bringing that on 2015 but that leads us
to the question of the day what use
would you give a foldable display
because in order to give a case the only
like logical thing that I would do with
it is probably get a tablet that's
foldable into a smartphone probably a 7
or 8 inch tablet that turns into a smart
phone but leave us a comment down below
what would you do and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
