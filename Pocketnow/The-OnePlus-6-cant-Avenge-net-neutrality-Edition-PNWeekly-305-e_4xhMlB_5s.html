deliver the introduction as we are
joined by friend of the show and my
co-host for our book review podcast the
geek book
mr. fat produce himself and Drew Wallace
greetings how's it going fellas it is
going well I was actually gonna ask you
how it's done this show it's going
pretty good there's so much so much news
this week talked about so much hardware
I'm pretty excited so get you frazzled
by all there's I feel bad Andrews that
we sent you like the night before like
well here's 20 links we want you to read
up on well well luckily it's been pretty
I mean the news has been so engaging and
so interesting this week anyway that you
know it's just been easy to keep track
well it's just it's been more incentive
to keep track of it it's been hitting so
definitely into the podcast all the news
it's a podcast and speaking of engaging
news if you would like to engage with
this podcast that was a great segue

email YouTube chat the Twitter's with
the p-n weekly hashtag you too can join
the conversation and I'll be looking
through this week's comments to see if
we can pick out some fun conversation
topics I think we need to jump right in
guys need its phone announcement this
humongous phone's humongous news
speaking of engagement there's that
Prince Harry guy and the Megan Marco
consummating their engagement and that's
gonna be like the seventh marriage since
well I do not believe well be discussing
the consummate marriage since the whole
in the seconds rain speaking of 7:00
you know what makes a seven right one
plus six I was arc that and you made it
but again I I think I think we all got
hung up on the idea of Megamart gold
with a jitterbug so are we gonna turn
that podcast into a fan discussion on
the crab great
anyways let's talk about the one plus
six and let's pretend that we have all
of our stuff together so if you don't
mind we'll just talk about specs first
of course we're talking about Snapdragon
45 for this build biggest year this
flagship killer that was called flagship
killer six point two eight inches full
optic AMOLED display likely means that
Samsung Nathan display but sad 1999 Full
HD resolution aspect ratio this time
around we got six is a ramp standard
eight possible and or actually it gives
us the standard technically because the
mid-range model is kind of the the
standard model but there is a six gig
option with 64 128 and 256 gigs of
storage
you got the dual 16 20 megapixel
combination camera at the back the 16s
for color the 20 is for monochrome for
the detail 16 megapixel selfie can't
wrap 3300 milliamp hour battery and all
this coming in with oxygen OS Android
8.1 and you know now the price and what
you get for that price is what's been
changing constantly since the
introduction of the oneplus series
because we started out at that kind of a
$300 price point it moved up
400 now it's 500 and now it's a rule
actually 529 for the six and sixty four
model available only in mirror block
they have used like for the main model
where all three colors are available
near black midnight black and then
there's the silk white we're talking
about 579 that's 8 in 128 gigabytes and
then 8 and 250 kg by 256 gigabytes will
only be available in midnight black and
that will be available for $629 so with
all those things out of the way
most countries was that the 30 or so
countries that will be getting this
movie yes will start to have them on May
22nd I don't know let's say overall
takes so far just from text just from
the event itself I know that there have
been some interesting comments made by
Carl pay especially at this well I'd
really like to applaud them for at least
having getting a sense of unique design
at least back from from what they had on
the 1 + 5 + + 5 t I'm not super thrilled
at the materials they're using but it's
it's nice that they have their own
design back now and they're not
borrowing from Oppo a couple of
generations of that has happened but now
they've kind of Oppo stayed on that kind
of iPhone train whereas 1 + starting to
experiment a little bit with the glass
and like there's like preparation stuff
going on thin and a film canvas but it's
it's all still glass which goes in the
general trend of all the Android and
iPhone stuff that we've seen in the past
6 months
but there's no wire as far as I know
there's no wireless charging so why
would they have glass you know
Baez metal is so
say at this point right like when HTC
throws in the towel you're done yeah I
guess I know it's III do overall like
the design I'm really really interested
in to see because it looks like they're
doing the same camera sort of setup that
Huawei did did before the three sensor
setup and I'm interested to see one to
compare image processing to see if say
like a like the Leica's work with Huawei
is that much better than one plus is
doing or if it's more even even an even
playing field I mean I'm really
interested to see that has a good point
especially considering that it's a new
strategy because they did do the zoom
lens for the second camera up until the
one plus five after that it was the
three-month turnover between five and
five T they decided to change things up
to that monochrome sensor and I have not
been able to get any like sense of what
that has done especially in comparison
to the Huawei products but I mean it has
been a middling subject for oneplus for
the longest time the camera experience
because everything the raw power that
you get sure that's fine that's great
for if I've heard it but when you start
to you know raise that price continually
you expect more you expect more of a
complete package well that's actually
one of the things that I think is kind
of interesting here is the notion of
this phone making bold claims outside of
it's priced here you know the people are
putting the one the oneplus phones up
again significantly more expensive
devices but when we look at the price
tag I find like those media features
like the camera perform extremely well
in that price bracket so how do we
balance what might be a compromise of
price I mean this is gonna be $200
cheaper than a smaller galaxy s 9 and a
300 $400 difference between
that and about P 20 Pro which is
arguably the best in its field that is
gonna be a thin thread to be able to
walk well and especially when when they
don't have they don't have it an
official IP rating and there's no SD
card support which for me that's that's
kind of a thing for me might not be for
everyone especially if you have enough
storage in there sniff nitpickers to
because you got the type c connection
but that's only USB 2.0 spec which is
will disappoint other people who are
just oh hey if this is about speed if
this is smoking fast why not include 3.1
like they didn't talk about that
so like you'll still find that oneplus
has retained a lot of its core audience
all the way up to that you know just how
you seeking power geeks and then they're
trying they're continually trying to
incorporate more of these mainstream or
mainstream appeals and they're still
just not being able to and actually
actuate I'm like just reconciling all
this stuff now the actual announcement
of this phone for the launch of this
phone do you think that oneplus was
actively engaged in misinformation there
were so many moments of well we're gonna
show you these Bluetooth headphones and
teasing that is because every other
company that's done that has teased
wireless headphones at the same time as
they get rid of the headphone jack there
were all of the rumors and all of the
leaks about this being a substantially
more expensive phone than the previous
one plus I just think there's some
interesting psychology of how oneplus is
communicating with their hardcore fans
and the roller-coaster ride even before
the announcement they had they're like
well you know we made a bunch of
mistakes on the oneplus 2 we got a bunch
of backlash we were able to survive that
and we learned a lot about our audience
have they also learned a lot about
gaming their audience into getting the
response that they want I mean are your
top are you talking about as the oneplus
bullets Wireless
in general because we had a whole bunch
of bait-and-switch moments you know like
rumors about this being a six hundred or
six hundred and fifty dollar phone and
they tease that in the announcement like
well and now comes down to price it's
only that's that's always a nice baby
I mean they've all they've always done
this it's not like you know Pete Lau
hasn't gone on and said well it's gonna
be in the general is that one plus what
was it three earth or two like that was
gonna be in the general Vince vicinity
of $333 that's a nice psycho
psychological mnemonic that he wanted to
implanted there and guess what it was
you know somewhere around that hooray
so I mean if if that was yeah people
know when the game is up I think because
once you start seeing that's six hundred
our thing especially when if you're
looking at something and you look at you
and you're looking at your bank account
to see and comparing them to see what
you'll be able to afford when you see
the up million the up enough of you know
the phone that you want and your bank
account just say stay in the same on a
given year or just because pay raises or
whatnot like that's it does it shatters
the loser no yes mm-hmm
well and with you know I've been
thinking about this I even thought about
this with the with the 1+5 the they
don't have a retail presence here really
at all in the u.s. except for I think
aren't they doing like some pop-up
stores in New York and they have like a
few dozen going on right in the Europe
and the US and don't forget about the
Avengers infinity war branded one play
okay I just want to disappear like just
yeah half of half of the phone sold will
instantly vanish from
we feelin so speedy yeah it's just
microd it was a Google assistance just
like I feel I feel funny and you know
but what you have a whole collection of
all like seven of the freakin one-plus
phones and then they all just disappear
and then one plus disappears from
existence oh gosh never happened
don't worry we might be talking about
that I've had another company here so
gonna tweet in from from Peter Hayden
I'd kind of like to get your guys's
thoughts on this using the pn weekly
hashtag do you think the amendments made
to oxygen OS still contribute to the
software do you feel that features like
gesture control are more of a copycat
move when they could have just promised
an update to Android P and that would
bring those new gestures we just saw
everyone's been trying to edge into an
out of android the what the whole game
of just upgrading to Android with a
project treble and just being on that
kind of Google team of just getting
things ready fast and here Xiaomi has
been getting on to the Android one
project and oneplus has also integrated
into the Android P beta themselves so
that and that was already announced by
Google back-end I am so it was I mean
the appeals there we've seen social
media polls time and time again talking
about how people really like pand ride
one or stock Android even a pote even if
it supposed to very simple very clean
and very favorable we rated skins like
oxygen OS so it's they're trying really
hard to be able to continue to make
their mark one pluses but
and stock Android might represent a cost
saving stock Android might represents
more of an attraction to maybe just
normal people that are used to stock on
Android a lot of the pixel or something
like that so yeah there's a road there's
the head its forked well and you know I
wouldn't be surprised oneplus was
working on gesture paste stuff before it
became widely known you know Android P
was going to incorporate a lot of it
because I mean Motorola has been doing
this for a little while with with their
their little home buttons I mean it
would the writing was kind of on the
wall at least a year ago or more before
even before the iPhone 10 came out the
writing was kind of on the wall that
that's where kind of people were kind of
looking and honestly anything that helps
with some one-handed use I'm happy you
know gestures could be good for that I
mean it makes me think of like when LG
and Samsung had their own implementation
of window and window and and then then
they just LG's just straight it was like
whatever we're done with our version and
then just implemented implemented it
seamlessly now of course it was for the
most is pretty similar in how they were
momenta Daz far as from a user
standpoint versus like gestures where
you could have you know completely
different gesture but I mean it most
people most OEM seem to be kind of going
in a similar sort of space when it comes
to one gestures do what so I'm not
surprised Steve Becker in the YouTube
chat because this is sort of the follow
up idea to is whether or not we're were
encapsulating features that are gonna be
built into a future version of the OS
but stocker Android just brings speedy
updates do we do we have concerns here
like I think oneplus has been has been
fairly reliable in updating their
products especially for not having such
a huge portfolio of devices that they
need to support is this another step
where we might be concerned because of
these kinds of additions that it might
prolong the update process or do we
think that they're gonna be able to stay
on top of these big shifts
operating system to operating system and
then security updates in between well if
they're growing as fast as they say they
are then there should be no question
that they should adopt and quickly
update constituents as fast as they can
for their latest phones that's there's
no question their devices have worried
like I guess do any of their older
devices have a worry oh because they've
been really bad about updating older
devices so I'm interested like what's
the last update that the one plus three
is getting yeah I think it's still gonna
be new good because I know five teen
fiver have well you know trouble is a
big thing to like what was it I mean I'm
gonna go back to Kwame again but was it
last year um I'm a nine I basically
didn't get an update the entire year
that I had you know during that entire
year and and I was going on the March
2017 security update this year since I
got the Oreo update with trouble which
I'm in hundreds it's a it's trouble but
it seems like that helps because I've
gotten I mean I'm still a month behind
on the security update but I've been
getting them consistently though so I
mean I hope that that's gonna be
something that helps a lot with with
oneplus because at this point for bad
software support for their previous
devices almost anything's back right now
yeah I remember correctly I don't
believe the five or the five T ever got
proper trouble support so I'll be
curious to see exactly what oneplus
implements on the 6 and the 3 and 3 T I
did get Oreo it's just that they went
through one of those halt phases phases
that it seems like every Android phone
that's trying to upgrade from unit to
Oreo is like oh we're releasing Lauria
right now oh there are buds now and
we're gonna pull back on the a for this
for several weeks to figure out what's
going on so the three three t apparently
went through one of those stages but
they hit they haven't yeah I mean gosh
they're not the only ones who've had
that problem recently I mean Motorola's
been having problems with the Oreo on
their devices Samsung HTC
show me like heck is Google I think it's
a systemic problem for Google yeah it's
funny because we've mentioned before
Apple had those problems with iOS iOS 11
was a really rocky launch Oriole wasn't
as rocky stills had some significant
issues that they've had difficulties
ironing out and it seems that both of
our major smartphone software producers
are having some growing pains in
incorporating new features and new
services wellness two layers with
Android because like I mean I even have
problems on my mate 9 right now with
Oreo because and it's and I think it's a
quiet thing more than Google cuz there's
about a 10% chance whenever I unlock
this thing that it'll just reboot it's
quick but it's annoying or whenever I
have YouTube open and it'll just you
know just have it sitting there and
it'll just go into a picture-in-picture
mode you know and I haven't really seen
that on any other devices so it's like
with Android it's even more complicated
than iOS yeah just a quick wrap up on
this because we have lots of music it -
what are your opinions about the vols
wisely because this kind of bucks the
trend of wireless earbuds just a little
bit which is to be expected from well
plus maybe they just they finally found
it impractical to make the perfect
wireless earbuds at the press that they
wanted to but also they're going with
the flexible band around the neck and
that reminds me the Jabra elites 45t
that I still want but maybe I'm looking
at this instead I mean I really as long
as you get tangible benefits from having
the band like more battery life and when
I'm fine I mean like I've got my little
ear buds here that I just you just claps
and I thought I thought you weren't you
were going to describe that you weren't
going to audio ly describe them for our
listeners yeah well it's like Oh No
like the form factor so it's like I'm
I'm not opposed to it like I'm just I'm
terrible about losing things so anything
truly Wireless I'm I'm accepted that if
I the day I get one I will lose them
within six months I feel like that's
even with like a lost puppy that's not
really good advice but I think outside
of just the fact that they released a
pair of Bluetooth earbuds I I think one
of the things that I take away from this
most recent announcement this is a
company that is doing a good job of
growing up from where they started I
think they still have some significant
issues in how they publicly handle some
of their problems like when their
credit-card processing was messed up or
just the bad look from when they were
uploading user data which was user
identifiable into into a cloud bucket
not really properly safeguarding that
problem but on the whole I think they're
doing a good job of managing a pivot to
a more mainstream popular smartphone
delivery a smartphone approach not just
hinging on pure enthusiasts but trying
to get their fan base to grow that
conversation having an ecosystem of
products not just a gimmicky VR headset
or a backpack but things that really
relate to what it is that they're trying
to accomplish I think is a is a good
step in the right direction I'd actually
like to see them execute on more of
these kinds of ideas how do you like
Apple or Samsung how do you make a
oneplus lifestyle how can you make one
plus a you know a fashionable part or
you know a crown jewel part of your
overall mobile gadget life I mean if
opera or their parent company BBK wanted
to that they could they could splash the
money to create a great rival to Xiaomi
who's trying to expand around the globe
at this point
majestic it of a time for them because
they're already in there primarily
focused on America Europe and outer Asia
so they would have quite the advantage
there sounds good yeah I mean I'm pretty
much an agreement there I mean as far as
like a lot of times when I think with
oneplus it'd be like the minimalist
almost sort of way you know approach
kind of like a essential except I guess
you more customization in the software
side but I'm just imagining the
lifestyle of oneplus being like somebody
lives in one of those really small
minimalist houses you know it's like but
yeah there's a house in Austin in like
the Charles Terrance section that is an
artifact of just you know Colonials and
it's like six feet wide and three
stories tall and it's amazing how the
person lives that it's like and the rent
like the day or something is like $9,000
a month so it's just about as good as
any studio alright are you ready to dive
into the new circuit we have another
comment oh I think we think we're doing
really well I mean there was a long
conversation this is also from the p-n
weekly hash tag and in the YouTube live
chat people talking about the design of
the phone and this is one of those
concerns I think we touched on a little
bit that we don't necessarily need to
dive too deeply but this is from Aditya
in weekly hash tag what's up with Oh
what's up with okey keeping a glass back
supposedly for improved network
connectivity but not including wireless
charging no official IP rating does this
mean that the glass back by itself is
more of a flagship feature than water
resistance and and I think that's that's
a it's a general sentiment which I has
been carried through a number a number
of comments and a lot of the commentary
on this one plus launch and I it's one
of the things that I would personally
point to saying
glass is shiny it seems to get an
emotional reaction out of general
consumers it makes sense to me that
oneplus would pivot towards trying to
expand not just satisfying the desires
of lists so you make your phone out of
glass because people think that that
means premium and it does come with the
benefit of better radio management but
this is still a five hundred and twenty
nine dollar device so you know they're
probably not gonna push too far into
expanding other features like wireless
charging or IP ratings or anything like
that but there will still be compromises
with this price tag
this is a $400 phone with IP 16 whatever
chart like which phone sorry you got a
little too squeaky on me there the Moto
X floor yeah but the Moto X 4 isn't
gonna have a Qualcomm 845 and I'd be
willing to bet good money that the
headphone jack on the oneplus will
grossly outperform the Moto X 4 for
audio one plus one plus has been you
know consistently beating flagships for
things like audio so you've got a shiny
glass phone two shiny glass phone
chipset to chipset display quality to
display quality audio - audio and I bet
the cameras hang in there really close
I'd be I'd be really interested to see
how much what the price what the cost
difference with labor and materials
would be between manufacturing raw
materials and manufacturing for a glass
back with a metal frame versus a unibody
design and just the margin they even
want to achieve at this point right
exactly I mean that could be changing
too and we don't have any sort of line
of sight on that yeah yeah all right
yeah well we'll have plenty of time to
review the one plus six and it will
obviously be given you that review come
due time when the next AB are gonna left
so I'll see you then in the meantime our
podcast continues are the news and
yeah I'm gonna say I'm gonna apologize
for the boringness of the start of the
news because I know people are kind of
already hyped up on politics and you
know you have other places to go do that
but it like this is the Trump era and
this is we didn't expect to be talking
about Chinese manufacturers Chinese
trade tensions in regards to Chinese
tech manufacturers being able to make
phones for international we're like
they're smart easy to use smartphone
business I'm sorry again onto this
tangent before even going to the news
but see teens smartphone business is not
good in China and it's doing it's like
you the u.s. is like maybe like their
fourth like that so this is a pretty
darn important for them and I guess
we'll just get back into it and to talk
about how legislators have legislatures
excuse me have essentially they've
walked the Trump administration from
doing anything to revoke the Commerce
Department's seven-year import ban walk
easy TV from importing any us-made
products there was the House
Appropriations Committee that voted on
an amendment that was drafted by
Democratic Representative Dutch
Ruppersberger the Maryland and yeah this
is it's not good especially with the
Sunday tweet from president Trump saying
that he would work with President Xi
Jinping to basically save ZTE and he
ordered the Commerce Department to seek
alternative remedies as as a Commerce
Secretary Wilbur Ross as said so I don't
know where do we stand here where is
what happens here it sounds to me that
the house is basically telling telling
the Trump administration to follow up on
his campaign promises of America first
as it were on this I mean
what ZTE did was was not right as far as
selling selling their devices in Iran
and North Korea and I mean I mean we've
there's this discussions been said
before about how the severity of the
punishment is really what for a lot of
us techies like to see more competitors
that's kind of our point of contention
really is it's it is kind of troubling
to see to see the the executive branch
being a bit flippy-floppy
on it as it were especially if it's in
the open but with how this is all going
but you know I don't really know oh it's
gonna happen after this point was easy
we've got there's some a little bit more
news about potential first with CT as
far as hardware and you're obtaining new
new hardware for their chipset someone
not but I mean they still aren't gonna
be able to use Android as I as I
understand correct yeah because that is
along with Google Apps which I think
actually they will still be able to use
the International open source project of
Android AOSP does that is sort of an
open you know he's not like that that's
that lock anything but that's not really
what we understand is a working
smartphone today especially with like
software updates they haven't been able
to update their phones because they're
mostly Google patches and then this also
extends to everything else to imagine
every single cloud service from a United
States based company that your phone
will no longer be able to utilize gosh
and you know I I know at least a couple
couple people who have exon sevens and
and I've told them I'm like you know you
might want to sell your echoed seven
before the prices start going down
because it's gonna be hard like the used
market for demand for these is if
depending on how this ends up turning
out is gonna end up hosing anyone who
bought and does eat any easy te devices
I mean yeah he's a nice thing is is like
we're talking about a phone that's over
two years old and so a body
even brand-spanking-new at $400 the axon
7 I'm sure has served you well at this
point the whole thing with ZTE because
their main bread and butter is with the
prepaid sector at the budget sector
that's where they produce the most smart
phones from these carriers and they get
a pretty good killing off of that so
like a half of metro pcs is phones are
just gonna be nanami no mall the head
Creek I currently use cricket but I mean
I bought it unlocked on but I went to a
cricket store and how you enjoyed those
8 megabytes you know it's ok like I'm
not like I'm okay with streaming in for
a you know a standard definition
sometimes depending I wanted to put in
the freaking lowest Verizon's thing I
they launched the thing earlier this
year but I don't remember the the
branding that they used but it's a it's
a prepaid carrier 40 bucks a month for
everything but they limit everything to
like I think if it's per second and then
lower for everything else
so it's just like is this going to be
the new concept in prepaid where we're
just gonna cap the speeds to something
that's barely usable well Cabot LG lucid
3 with like SD and SDHC on coming to the
aid of ZTE in saying that they would
supply Exynos chips to them I don't know
that the chipset would be enough to keep
a smartphone business in in working
order I think you might need a lot more
technology than just processor I'm more
excited about the fact that Samsung is
willing to outsource their to sell some
of their chipsets because I just want
more competition with Qualcomm because I
don't want to have another year of
that's an equivalent of what happened
with the 808 because there was pretty
much an almost no competition at the
high end for
like you know for a lot of the devices
that are out there and so a huge chunk
of devices of high-end flagship devices
from 2015 I can't ever recommend anyone
because the chipset was garbage and it
was widely adopted so I you know I
really wanted Samsung and Huawei both to
go and have I want to see a more
proliferation of their of their chipsets
out there for competition yeah yeah
especially with the media tech - they've
been stepping up their game in the wake
of this Qualcomm's antitrust lawsuits
and they've been doing better and better
by the day and morgan signing up more to
google's initiative so i'd like to see
something coming out of them as well in
the meantime we have more dreary news to
talk about in terms of congress but this
time we're moving over to the senate
where has a pastor bill protecting
revoking the repeal of the FCC's
restoring Internet freedom order which
would have removed net neutrality
regulations on ISPs it was 47 Democratic
members with I believe two or three
Democratic no two independents and three
Republican members as well which is it's
more of a showing than we expected
because we originally thought it was
going to be a 51/49 vote but yeah this
is a I mean II D doesn't count okay
doesn't come up too much because the
house would have to vote on this Donald
Trump would have to sign it though all
they're hoping to do right now this has
been talked about is basically get
people out there voting and using this
as their turkey issue so especially
where where everything where the news
seems like it's accelerating right into
your face on Facebook and Twitter and
whatnot like there are a whole bunch of
splinter issues that's already defined
people but I don't think many people
realize that yeah that access to all
this information or their way to
advocate easily is through the internet
it's just been there for part of their
lives
I feel like this should be more of a
hinge to everyone it really is well and
the big problem with this is just is the
campaign of misinformation that's out
there that's that's basically the big
hurdle that because as far as folk were
thrown at neutrality I'm from the
Midwest and and there is a there is a
big presence of misinformation when it
comes to this topic and it's good it's
gonna take us us out there as people who
know more about this to go and help
educate people even if they're not not
necessarily willing you know because
it's still important to have it out
there I mean go on contact our that
because I mean on Reddit I'm pretty much
every reddit thread that that talk
covers the story they have a list of all
the Senators who voted against it and
even if you know they're probably not
good they might not they might not
listen to us but it's still important to
go out there and state our displeasure
at that the decision-making and voting
Paul the policies that they are you know
with this so it's an ongoing battle but
it's it's symbolic but it's still it's
an important uphill battle yeah
especially because it's I was listening
to the NPR politics podcast this week
and it seems like the Republican side of
things has not really paid much efforts
into their messaging and has basically
decided to let the other side win so
it's only a matter of time before if you
if you're able to educate or if you're
able to get the message to be able to
clarify things for the people around you
or maybe even
other people to strangers you might want
to participate in this whole process
well it seems like they're relying on
the ISPs to try and and educate even
though - they had obviously have a
certain stake in this
but the seems like the the people who
are anti net neutrality are relying on
the Internet service providers to try
and educate their race well it's it's
because that's that's their share that's
their stakeholder oh yeah absolutely and
it's and it's just it's it's important
to help people realize that that
information is not unbiased yeah so you
know that's a lot of what I see on my
and where I live at and and it's
important to help educate people on it's
almost like the the basics of just
realizing that these companies aren't
your friends they aren't really looking
out for you so yeah that's all I know
knowing is half the battle
absolutely all right let's read I will
admit I underestimated read in what
factor that they would not be able to
get more than at least more than one
care here in any particular market for
their hydrogen wine holographic for you
camera smartphone that would be modular
and it's gonna be crazy it's for this
very niche set of Cinematographers and
it's basically not going to sell well so
why would a whole bunch of care they
sign on for this well they may be able
to frame this as an enterprise kind of
felon or something like that notes but
18t and Verizon reportedly working on
this and they're like the Verizon VP of
devices Bart product marketing Brian
Higgins he says that you will have to
experience it yourself to understand why
it's such a mobile game changer
so and AT&amp;amp;T has demos come down to us
right here that's gonna be that's gonna
be I think oh I mean I think it'll help
because I mean gosh they especially with
like that 3d whatever display assuming
that it's not crappy like on the HTC EVO
3d and the LG whatever that was you know
back in the day I mean you're gonna have
to see it kinda it's kind of like what
was 120 Hertz on the on the razor phone
you're not I'm not seeing when
physically so I don't have a visit I
don't have an appreciation for that for
seeing it but you you can't capture it
on video I'm just I just think it's
crazy that that red who doesn't even
have a phone product out is able to get
on more carriers than with their niche
phone then HTC with their mass-market
phone or our essential which had a
sector of Android behind it but I don't
know Jenna's jernard he like who you
knew he said that he who knew that a
sunglasses guy could turn things around
and start up a sitter of dog free
company and well I guess we shouldn't be
under estimating him in the slightest
I'm sorry Janice but I think I think
what's interesting here is getting those
carrier wheels based on the the read
name when this is gonna be a very
unproven product we covered it recently
on the podcast talking about how the
people behind manufacturing in this
phone have admitted they don't know what
they're doing and manufacturing a phone
I this this to me is it I almost think
that may be essential was better off not
having the same kind of carrier
high-profile carrier relationships and
trying to build up a more grassroots I
think they went after the wrong market
going after the same enthusiasts that
might have supported a1 plus I think
they should have tried to go after
general consumers and produced their
groundswell there but it makes me
nervous for bread where maybe they
should just be going after
people who own their cameras may be
going after cinematographers and trying
to build up a user base that way before
going for this high profile Terrier well
maybe it's just marketing talking money
talking to money at this point
I mean denied big success in both this
Oakley and his red friends and a teen
teen Verizon kind of finding their
differentiators and just media whatnot
and perhaps looking at this as a
possibility for further deals along the
line with read the cynic in me and I
don't know Andrew what you think about
like you know price performance and all
that but the cynic and me would say
Verizon is gonna be much more interested
in carrying a $1,200 phone if they sell
fewer of them they still make more money
on that then if they carry the next HTC
which is going to be a 650 to 700
dollars well well and of course there's
attachment someone ought to though
probably accessories and whatnot that
they'll probably sell with it as well
but one thing I'm wondering too is could
the carrier moves be a move to help
mitigate to help shift some of the
advertising costs to the carriers and
then they can invest more of their money
and development R&amp;amp;D in production maybe
I'm not you know I'm not I don't have
intimate knowledge in the deals and how
might you know as far as that you know
how much they have to give to X&amp;amp;Y
carriers to be able to in a wheel and
deal to be able to sell them and have
them promote them but I would believe
that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon would have more
marketing budget to market this
particular product than redwood
themselves cuz I don't know you guys
never really seen a red commercial
probably not a red camera did you say
one more time you probably have seen a
commercial manager on a red camera Oh
seen a lot of commercials made on red
cameras that's the only advertising they
need
pay is ten million dollars to remove the
watermark yeah all right let's see what
else do we have cooking up this week I
have lost the page from where this
podcast is I think that's what I have up
is the HTC story if we want to gentlemen
let's talk about it to HTC stories this
week first all first of all the
confirmed one which is the blockchain
found that they are talking about it's
code named Exodus and basically this is
a we're going to try and create a larger
freaking big watch a network then a
theory a more even Bitcoin hazardous
point which and last check was in the
fifteen thousand range so if HTC is able
to even achieve fifteen thousand sales
of this phone and they're already kind
of breaking their goals here but
encouraging decentralization they're
talking about making sure that your data
is is it as easily easily accessible by
these decentralized services or Bitcoin
cryptocurrency is that you use to pay
other parties and not have it be tracked
or have it all publicly I guess tracked
if you know what I understand of the how
the lettering process goes through so
but overall this isn't this is just a
niche phone now if I want to type that
to my next story here which talks about
rumors of HTC vive phone which appeared
in a video that was leaked by every
blast or just a split second but it was
there of HTC vive phone that now
apparently has a codename
with Genesis and while you can't see
anything at HTC Genesis comm or Genesis
phroneo at this point Evan said that he
was able to see a vive logo for a
on the first page and we were able to
track down who s information detailing
that HTC did own the donut the HTC
generous Genesis tell me so is is this
the right way to go is HTC if it has
really not been able to fight in the
mainstream could specialists be it's
only I'm gonna be a front and honest I
think I I have mostly negative views on
some of this cuz it sounds to me like
they all their board members ended up
meaning upon their boardroom and going
well you know people are pissed off
about the about your privacy and well
and crypto currencies real bakeable this
is let's just make something with
blockchain you know and and it's that
combined with like their one property
that's actually doing fairly strongly
with vibe so it I don't know it just
sounds lack of a better afraid just kind
of desperate to me they already do it
don't worry that's that that your your
choice of voice for HTC is screwed by us
by a staff of Muppets own brand our
owner
Brandon minimun would be proud of you
for being act out in such a fake all of
us do like just like role-playing HTC
and engineers and know like not just
trying to figure out what but why the
hell they decide to use the for negative
so ultra picks okay ultra pixel camera
was great for pixel camera was wrong
yeah okay like I mean I when I saw the
initial article about the blockchain
thing I was hoping that there was just
something wrong with my brain and I and
I was just seeing word salad happening
and I was making it up but no I I really
don't think like I mean I mean mo k if
they're more if you're marketing a
blockchain that's like your big thing
to make it stand out because I because
looking at all the other last leaks
which we'll get to later it looks like
part of what they're trying to do is
have like that be their stand out
feature at least where I'm at with the
with the average consumer like my dad
has nice she cm8 still he's got like
eight of them that he's been
cannibalizing together every time it
breaks and and it's like the first thing
that you'd ask who's goes oh what the
hell is blockchain you know so I don't
think this is really gonna help them
sell phones that well I'll say like I
think I'm a little bit more positive on
this move than you are if only because I
have this romantic notion of some kind
of Silicon Valley can we build a new
backbone for the internet which is
decentralized and removes different
types of controls like government
controls or corporate controls from the
equation we're concerned about net
neutrality policy could we create an
infrastructure which could circumvent it
and watch-chain has become this buzzword
you know investor angel investor kind of
term which is being used for everything
that doesn't really have anything to do
with what we're talking about there but
I am curious to see a manufacturer like
HTC examining what they might be able to
do from that standpoint from a security
standpoint for the by phone I'm just
shocked that it took him that long to
figure out that the vibe brand made them
look mega cool so maybe they should put
it on another product because if they
could do a buy Vico system like what
oculus is doing with the oculus go and
successive HTC branded products a vive
lifestyle phone a vive standalone VR
headset if you were like lenola for
oculus is doing and you flesh out an
entire ecosystem there HTC looks a lot
cooler again five makes HTC you look
cool and hopefully some of that can rub
off on their phone since no at a ton of
their phone talent just went over to
Google you know what well especially go
ahead I was gonna say you know what
would be really interesting is you guys
remember when the GFI they had the g5 in
that little head
set where they basically just had it
where where what was it like you
basically plugged the phone up into the
headset through the USB cable and it
wasn't like the phone wasn't directly in
there well imagine the inverse what if
the vive phone served as a display and
then you could just plug it in to you
know say your computer that you'd want
to have that you could that it's capable
of running VR and have like a budget
version of the head of the vive headset
that has that you can put the phone in
that might be something that would be
interesting it could realistically not
gimmick Li I mean I think that's that's
what we'd be curious to see if this is
just a branding exercise then I agree
with you it's just a move of desperation
to slap a logo on that might be
meaningful but if they're creating an
ecosystem of products that that build
off of their successes then that's
exactly what we want to see from a
company like HTC is learn from your
mistakes and learn from your successes
and pull the company towards what's
working and what's selling anytime I
throw on a vipro it's just head and
shoulders better than any of the other
experiences that I've had in VR and and
to build off of that could be really
exciting especially with the whole
public zeitgeist though movies like
ready player one and people are starting
to get a bit more interested in the
space go look up all the videos that we
you can find on beat Sabre if that's
easily one of the most popular things
that we've ever put together on Newegg
is Trisha and I playing beat Sabre for
the first time in failing but you know
it's ridiculously fun and you see this
stuff explode that really communicates
an emotional response to people and HTC
should be leading the discussion on that
instead they're in this weird holding
pattern on how can we convince you to to
go with this premium VR thing and then
also maybe consider us for the phone in
your pocket - yeah I'm sorry glad Jules
I was about to say that again you bet
before you got a couple things like that
eight the Google deal with 2,000
engineers going away and then basically
just kind of being odion's at this point
to Google as opposed to anything
truly original going on over there and
it's like well I mean they filled with
so many quarters on end just trying to
do their main thing you know appeal to
the mainstream while holding on to these
practices like prank like prestige
pricing that didn't work out for them
and it has not worked out for them and
they've been stubborn and in some cases
we'd like to see them hold on to metal
as opposed to everyone going over the
glass like until well they were able to
make their own take on glass and we were
kind of appreciative of that but I mean
when people it was great in that solar
red car was great
but I'm like no it did the rest of it
was just an Android phone with like
squishy sides that you could blast
they've lost one of their main
differentiators III will get cranky and
I will repeat ad nauseam differentiators
matter and if you want an audio phone
you no longer shop in HTC you shoppin LT
the g7 is the king of smartphone audio
for 2018 so far it's undisputed this is
the channel this is this is the mark to
try and take down if you care about your
ears I mean you might hate your ears and
that's fine but if you if you like you
know listening to good stuff then this
is the phone that should be at the top
of your list I don't know maybe I
prioritize Apple messages over my ears
or or the iCloud thing is you have a
differentiator again you have the vibe
if they can have another differentiator
be security that could be very important
and very compelling for building a
product off of but we're in this holding
pattern until we see can they actually
put up or is it shut up time the one how
much how much R&amp;amp;D budget and talent do
they even have left now because because
I mean I've got to think they don't but
I mean gosh we know that for years that
they've not had it parity as far as
marking budget but now with Google
taking a lot of their talent how much do
they or the actor
we rest in differentiating themselves
from aesthetics yeah as we as we
understand it that mm that was sent over
less half their hardware art the people
working at hardware so yeah well it and
that looks bad but I think if we were
talking about a vive phone or this
exodus what we're talking out is likely
the last year of whatever manufacturing
content was derived from the engineers
that went over to Google smartphones are
usually a two to three year building
process we're gonna be kinda at the tail
end of that now but these are likely the
projects and the experiments and the
designs that were from the company when
it was still intact after this point
they don't have something to build off
of then I would be very concerned about
what future they have left I I'll be
very surprised honestly and this is
coming from someone who kind of got into
mobile technology because of HTC back in
the old Palm Pilot and Windows PDA
days I I don't want to see a world
without HTC but I'll be very surprised
if they're continuing to be a phone
brand in any meaningful way over the
next five years yeah I agree with you
definitely one cuz I'm the guy who has a
sticker at HTC sticker from my that I
got with my droid DNA on my tower yeah
my first HTC phone was the HTC Rezound
on Verizon that's beautiful
oh man yeah like it was and that was I
mean heck that was even before you know
right before the m7 that hardware design
still holds up you know the even though
you know people moved away from you know
the plastics and the soft touch why not
it's still I still think in a lot of
ways that was a some of their best
designs and they came out with of course
it was mostly a large apart was driven
by Verizon but yeah it's just they've
kind of lost their own identity and it
reflects in their lack
user just users and consumers knowing
that they still exist almost these days
yeah well maybe there is no reason for
HTC to battle for something that Apple
Samsung LG Xiaomi Huawei who else
Oppo vivo 90 other manufacturers have
already taken over for them that's
that's I guess we'll have to see if this
specialist or nice round can move
forward further for them let's talk
about these next few just quickly as
possible Microsoft maybe perhaps run in
a Windows 10 iPad of some sort $400
range could be released this fall summer
like are even well holiday season I
guess would be the best way to put it
but uh yeah this is in what do you think
surface iPad surface bad what are you
talking about here hey I'm all up for
things being at a lower price point it
more accessible at a lower price point
especially market disruptors like the
surface line I mean what was didn't we
have one that was similar to that price
and the surface RT and then there was a
33 yeah yeah I mean that's a very
accessible point honestly and if you're
not gonna do any sort of gaming I mean
as a Productivity tool it's great cuz
the form factor makes it worth it in a
lot of ways as long as it performs well
but yeah I mean I think having these
this type of disrupting technology at
lower price points this really is the
only gonna be good yeah yeah well
there's also the fact that this is kind
of straddling into the education space T
because I had always well for the past
several generations they've been
recently I think you're talking green
education and that already has a pretty
good
stauch going on with Chromebooks and
whatnot so is this just crowding out the
market now this is the tricky part for
me is if they change the form factor too
much and it can't rely on other surface
accessories like the keyboard blades and
and stuff that's already been
established III think it's gonna have a
little bit of difficulty in the market
and also it's a premium price tag if
they're talking about education at all
unless they have some amazing
initiatives if you consider the iPad
with yeah but that's that's not really
the benchmark you brought it up yourself
Chromebooks will still eat this thing
for lunch Oh totally out of school
districts out there that are trying to
consider do we want our students walking
around with a $400 slake or a 200 dollar
laptop form factor and one's really more
practical for them getting their work
done well it depends on the benchmark
that's set by private and public schools
and charter schools and whatnot because
they're all different in they serve
different incomes which is kind of
stupid but you know that's a matter of
fact here well yeah I think but but I
don't think there's as much momentum for
the for public schools to look at
premium devices like iPads again the
experiments that have failed
spectacularly publicly well and with I'm
thinking that this would be a little bit
more useful for most post high school
where people people who are going to
school post high school are starting to
get more specialized and what in they're
deciding more what feel career fields
are wanting to be in and just having a
platform that's going to support as the
potential to support more programs and
and what not that they would use in the
real world in the real work force then
saying what Chrome OS might have is I
think that is where this could shine
more possibly perhaps but I mean they're
already trying that out with the surface
laptop which for them has produced
middling okay results so far at 999
right that's where you put the end you
know that's part of
you expect you because that is correct
me if I'm wrong but that's that's you
territory right that's the intel core
you with the more powerful than the like
dual core why processors going on yeah
but for a lot of like for a lot of
consumers out there none of those specs
mean anything they're gonna look at a
thousand dollar thing or four to five
hundred dollar thing and then if it's
basic you know text entry document
support social media web content stuff
like that then the thousand dollar thing
isn't really gonna win that fight I just
hope that Photoshop actually functions
decently well I thought yeah they're
going to be at high school or college
with those specialist degrees let's talk
about a matter of marketing a matter of
branding at this point with YouTube and
whatever the heck it wants to do with
YouTube music the YouTube premium both
these rebrands coming out soon YouTube
music well YouTube music is kind of
google play music but on YouTube
combining the platforms of music videos
and actual music Digital streaming
itself and then there's also YouTube
bread which is now going to be just
YouTube's premium so at least we don't
have to worry about any one confusing
that for a porn site so what do you
think about this Quan I feel like you
you've been pretty agitated about this
movie I mean I there are just so many
different parts and pieces and I got off
the Google music train because of their
ridiculous device restrictions I went
back to Spotify haven't had any problems
there using that service with any device
I want on any on any type of speakers or
TV that I want and Google will
eventually walk that back but it's it's
been frustrating watching them try
things instead of looking at what
services are working which ones need to
just be swallowed up by the others and
then having these
noxious co-branding and overlapping four
things make YouTube red or YouTube
premium just everything
III think I would be much more willing
to give Google more of my money because
I'm a YouTube TV subscriber I'd like
YouTube content YouTube premium content
to be a part of what I'm paying them for
for their TV competitor why are these
they're they're these artificial
barriers to all these different services
when you could just give me the YouTube
plus and I would pay you money for that
I don't want to have to have different
tiers and different subscriptions and
different models and that's what keeps
me on Spotify and it's what keeps me
subscribed to everything else in
addition to YouTube TV and why YouTube
TV has become sort of the least valuable
arm of my cord cutter strategy but it's
something that I still appreciate for TV
on YouTube Play Store awesome I I don't
have any incentive to give Google any
more money right now until they figure
out what what I value as a customer and
it doesn't seem like that's gonna happen
I mean I'm kind of been in a unique
position where I've had Google Play
music since the very beginning so I've
been paying was at $7.99 a month so I'm
just like whatever do whatever you guys
want this price I don't care you know I
was I was there too and I let it lapse
because it's like I can't keep fighting
them to let me like authorize new phones
right I mean and I mean for mine the big
thing for me is that Google Play Music
even though the app is reception has
been mixed I've been really happy with
the feature of being able to upload
music that I have like so I have a you
know gosh what was it back when I was in
Middle School in high school I have tons
of CDs and discs from then that you know
you from music that you might that's not
really available on a lot of streaming
services so I can just upload it Spotify
got rid of that as a you know that
ability and it's that's something that's
important to me so that's why I've
stayed with it but also I still I still
was how much are they raising the price
by what how much are they raising the
price by it's two dollars two dollars
ramune I mean it's still kind of a
better deal because you get YouTube red
or whatever they're gonna call it
rebrand it now and being able to just
have because for example whenever I
listen to this podcast a lot of times
I'm listening to it with my screen off
and you know having that that's a the
individual features make it worth more
to me but that could that might not be
the same for everyone but a new customer
price because YouTube Gregg I'm still
gonna be paying the same price at $9.99
per month and Harry had that YouTube
that gives me Google Play me as a
crossover just a little bit for the same
price as well so it's like yeah I'm
doing the same thing as you guys are but
now I'm still paying a lower price now
they may decide later on to you well
absolutely decide to raise the price at
later point but it's just well why then
why give it the name already to start
I I don't feel like there is much there
is lots of crossover but I feel like
their names are just alright as they
already are especially when you have the
Google Play thing for going on for logo
or like just a sweet suite of services
and YouTube was kind of loyal I don't
know maybe maybe make it play play
youtube video for real well an
interesting thing about with using
YouTube so I've had multiple situations
where I've wanted to share a playlist
with someone whether they're at work or
something but I don't know what
streaming service they use they might
not use the same one as me so I'll
compile something on YouTube and send it
to them because I know they'll be able
to view it so there is value and
branding of having it YouTube for music
even though I don't primarily use it for
music no it's just it's just a lack of
cohesive strategy envision that is the I
find really frustrating with it with
what's going on
yeah well yes in cohesion in congruence
will remain for now until eventually
though be cheating those names come June
5th so yeah it's covering whether you
like it or not and that's also coming
whether Samsung likes it or Apple likes
that or nine of them don't make it is
this ongoing trial that they've had for
the past seven years in which they have
debated about the validity of patents
what constitutes well let's just all
right so there are a few patents a bloke
Hughes Samsung of reaching a few patents
that they owned and some of them include
colorful grade on a display a home
screen and then there's also a general
form of rectangular design for a phone
with the screen and with a butt and
there's a button single button visible a
hardware one that's visible and like
okay so this is kind of generic it's
kind of it's weird but this is what we
have to work with now this one all the
way up to the Supreme Court and to you
know determine what kinds of damages
Samsung would have to pay for infringing
on all these paths because they were
found to have infringed on those patents
but the Supreme Court is basically
something get back to San Jose for the
sides to discuss what constitutes as an
article of manufacture and what does the
patent apply to in this case does they
applies him to halt the value of the
whole phone or the part that the patent
describes itself because you know this
dependent was included in the product
then maybe it should be that the whole
product via home products value may be
acquired for infraction so yeah
the trial this trial this part this I
would just like to point out the
hilarity especially for someone who's
watching our podcast is we're talking
about devices going back to the Galaxy
s2 and we couldn't even find good banner
images to properly represent we've got
like a galaxy s7
the only like one of the oldest phones I
had a decently high resolution image
that we can place from the companies are
all this left Jules you did a great job
it so that's what the freaking gaussians
3 looks like that's the gaseous major to
go back into the archives and make sure
that that that was labeled correctly and
that's an iPhone 4 4 maybe 4s but that's
an iPhone 4 generation thing going on
there
as I did this stupid dollar sign I think
I think you didn't reach out on the
Photoshop like this conversation is so
tired but I digress
I'm sorry Andrew I cut you off oh no
you're fine I was just gonna say it's it
we've crossed and from as consumers
we've crossed into the realm of this
being almost a spectator sport now you
know spectator sport like 60 because I
mean even the designs they're talking
about now even like it's for even 2018
they're they're pretty much obsolete now
because you know with the with the the
button in the center it's it's it's just
crazy now just to think that then it's
taking this long that we've moved far
beyond the designs now that they're even
arguing about like they're talking about
several years ago about banning the X&amp;amp;Y
phones from being sold I mean you can
get them for like ten you can get a
Galaxy s2 for probably under fifty bucks
on eBay now so it's just well all this
is going
like there's a billion dollars at risk
for Samsung at this point because they
were able to cut down their their
liabilities or their damages too just by
invalidating a few patents by you know
so now they're like that four hundred
million dollars but who knows maybe this
will freakin you know draw things dad's
like twenty eight dollars or twenty
twenty-one dollars or like go well
because the debate is how much was
Samsung enriched by violating some of
this some of this copy righted
trademarked frame the polycarbonate
frames of the phone or the whole iPhone
with the Apple a10 processor or maybe
it's just it like the Android maybe they
infringed Android in some way like
there's there has to be something going
on here for Samsung to be guilty of and
having to pay a billion dollars well but
that's what's interesting is that same
song isn't fighting whether or not they
were guilty of fire no there's not these
trademarks it's their argument and this
is the legal I think it's a good-faith
legal argument but what's hilarious is
that it's now having to go back to a
state court to unravel this discussion
is Apple's argument is if they have
because they violated these these
copyrights because they violated these
trademarks they no phone would have been
sold from Samsung if they hadn't made it
so much like the iPhone Samsung is
saying you should be able to generate a
dollar value per unit on what was
infringed upon and that's what we should
have to pay and so the squabbling is
going back and forth and back and forth
and back and forth again and again and
again and again but now we've we've
we've superseded the federal courts
ability to answer this question and the
federal court is literally throwing it
back to California to figure out well I
mean district federal court is the
Supreme Court is a entirely different
beast altogether because they they sent
whole like the final president
in these kinds of issues but this is
still federal this is district court but
this is up this is still federal court
and case law will judge upon this case
very strictly scrutinize and yeah we'll
have to see what happens here but I
guess that that the question what's an
iPhone in in the style of a teenager
running into her vacuum
[Laughter]
yeah what is the genesis a qualities
things all right well if you're a
Russian with a lot of money to spend
I'll show you an iPhone let's do this
what do you want iPhone iPhone solar
powered iPhone with point triple nine
gold gilding double layered with a black
poly black carbon fiber wrapped around
it and a freaking huge solar panel yeah
that's right
we're talking about an iPhone 10 that's
been modded to basically run off of
solar power with so expensive to
actually mod i phone 10 to have all that
because it's it's a pain in the butt to
get that thing apart anyway well I mean
you're talking about 999 dollars being
converted into a four thousand eight
hundred ninety seven dollar monstrosity
and this is all in tribute to Nikola
Tesla because of course electricity and
Elon Musk because Tesla and also a green
technology and there's a little Steve
Jobs because why not
we're freakin modding and I found four
gods this is another one of those
boardroom discussions like well there's
there's two big people we associate with
that so let's I really feel bad you
don't often see you like the Edison
edition that would be you would when you
purchase that phone it also comes with a
lawsuit so
well I mean you would expect the same
things if you click the link in the
middle there you would expect this out
of the company that puts emblazoned the
likeness of President Russia President
Vladimir Putin and President Donald
Trump on in gold onto the back of a
Nokia 3310 yeah like this is my question
I mean like we've seen gaudy experiments
of her two phones things like that does
anyone else get a little bit nervous
about solar power on a phone because you
have to basically put your phone out in
the Sun where it's gonna get hot and
then you'll see was that like in Las
Vegas where that phone exploded out of
the just thing because we see numerous
devices gadgets and electronics die in
cars we are totally hot the battery
expands does have anywhere to go and we
see no you use the enemy of the battery
heat form the good for the good that you
can do would be it's not just it's not
just heat it's also like two so it's a
steam turbine in the phone you can't
drive it now liquid cooling liquid
drives heat I don't know I'm just
shocked that you know like we should
have regenerative braking on our phones
by now it's just really disappointing
that you can well phone by one thing I'm
wondering so there's I haven't seen
anything as far as the charging rate
because I gotta think it's gonna be slow
well if you're sitting it out assuming
you have the phone on and you have it
sitting out in the Sun how fast is the
battery gonna drain versus how quickly
is it going to charge it we don't know
so we might knows I might just maintain
the charge oh I don't even know that
it'll be able to do that I believe a
solar cell this small would probably
just reduce the speed at which the phone
naturally discharges
well if you want to be if you want to
help the world to become equal friendly
then this is the way that you should use
the technologies of the future for 100%
and they will bring more comfort into
your life I can just read the whole
product briefed on this and this is my
son Jack this is my 4 panel solar
charger and this does a great job of in
good light charging a phone you can
charge a phone and a battery at the same
time and get reasonably quick recharge
rates this is this is the surface area
that I need to walk around with if I'm
actually going to charge a phone not
just keep it oh my goodness
so more from the product brief caviar
presented a unique developments ahead of
the time that is able to charge from
light just a while ago it seemed
impossible but already today it becomes
necessary yes we all need solar panels
and it seems impossibly like I don't
know a man solar panels and solar
charging is been around for a while yeah
this is the this is the purest energy
for getting which no expenses are needed
the development in the sphere of
creating solar battery smart homes
equipped with such batteries and
vehicles working on the electricity is
actively carried out by Elon Musk today
the main mastermind of the Tesla company
in honor of his great innovative
developments the new caviar form that
the new caviar phone was named that's
your tenuous link rate okay well I'm
glad we went down that rabbit hole yes
the case of shock-resistant do you want
to have a bonus that's where the $5,000
goes yeah oh man it's like yeah they're
stretching these these connections as
far as to Tesla Elon Musk and all that
just about there stretching it as bad as
much as a Stretch Armstrong with stretch
I encourage you to look at the video
because it's just
it has that like deep Russian voice
that's like almost sexy but stalking
about Nicolas has a Serbian trick in
Serbian that you know has been in in the
age of very volatile age I'll say hey
because Jules we should not be making
fun of Serbian yeah we should we should
not make fun of Elon Musk I'm making
really I think it's I think it's way too
soon for Elon Musk I was disappointed
that we didn't see like a faded an image
of Putin shirtless Putin somewhere in
that why you go to the previous thing
you go to the Nokia 3310 and then you
look at that and it's amazing
from a peter hatin on that peon weekly
hashtag is someone who wants who once
tried to use a portable solar panel I
challenge anyone who buys this to sit
and let it charge in fall and I imagine
that whoever is going to do that is
going to be sitting for a very very long
time even knowing that Apple puts
ridiculously small batteries into their
phones yeah sigh man well at least at
least though aged out and like died out
and you'll be able to get a battery
replacement for $29 oh speaking in which
that reminds me I do have to do the
battery replacement for my se before all
that goes away I have my mom do it and
so so here's interesting thing so my mom
went to went to so the closest official
Apple Store is about four hours away
from where my parents live and they went
to kind of like an authorized retailer
about an hour away and they they won
they didn't have any stock on batteries
at all and then they kind of had the
whole you well you don't really need
this
let me just something in software for
you and it was like needless to say I
got a call from a concerned mother
saying I don't think this sounds legit
and so then she went up to our Kansas
City four hours away and
now done and and really like don't I I
recommend people do not don't go through
the authorized retailers go through the
official channels if you can I know it's
a little you might have to drive for
hours but it's worth it for the quality
of the working from it or get it shipped
yeah well and and if you um we mentioned
him before on the show too if you follow
lewis Rossman on youtube he's a very
angry
third-party repair technician out of New
York
but stories he tells about Apple are
very insightful as to how this company
does business with their authorized
repair service partners and to your
point age you mean like the reason why
that story goes down is something like a
screen replacement often can't be done
by one of those uh author Apple
authorized technicians like they still
have to send the phone back to Apple
anyway so it is one of those things it's
like Apple in terms of service and
support there is a little bit of buyer
beware there you they've sort of rigged
the game to make sure that you are
encouraged to only go to an Apple store
to only send your phone back to Apple or
your product in general MacBook Mac Mac
Pro anything only get sent back to Apple
two well and it's like part of me also
really feels with the business practices
that they have and how they treat their
authorized retailers that a lot of this
is Korea to buy Apple themselves to do
that so that they can for funnel people
towards you know and it's and it's
getting the the quality of work yes it's
really good but at the same time you
also have the problems of well my
product could conceivably be to keep the
costs of parts parts higher than they
might be what prevents from eating
third-party parts but we've also seen
some reports and again I would be very
curious to see how widespread this is
but when you get something like an Apple
like an authorized Apple screen you know
we talked about this on the podcast you
know like if you get your screen
repaired and it's with a lower quality
display then then Apple put out a
firmware that could
your phone one of the things we've seen
though is third-party repair shops that
try to buy legit Apple screens those
screens will often be held in customs
and then destroyed so as to prevent
other repair technicians from getting
their hands on that kind of product
taking the screen out of one phone and
putting it into another phone also can
trigger some of these defense mechanisms
that Apple has put into their firmware
so it you don't have the display serial
number that your phone should have that
can lock down your phone that can break
your phone too
so there I do believe there is some
Apple shenanigans happening your Apple
not necessarily acting in the best faith
for customers getting the best possible
quality service that they might be able
to receive and forcing consumers to go
through a very specific channel which
restricts their ability to get the
service that they might want well if
that's the case then help these Russian
people have all of their components
sorted out and forged and imported
that's that's another thing too it's
like if you're really team iOS I don't
know that I'd want to do business with
anyone cracking nose device it's open I
just let it go if you need a solid gold
iPhone I don't know man I don't think
it's worth it only person I trust to be
what's-his-face from stranger strange
parts you know if you guys even then
like I think he would probably be pretty
pretty clear about what what he would be
able to achieve and not yeah they have a
one-year warranty through them oh man
yeah how could you go wrong yeah yeah
one I mean if you're thinking about it
there's what's to stop Apple from
pushing through an update that kills
their phones those Tesla there there's
nothing stopping it so you're dropping
close to $5,000 on something that might
not work in six months depending on how
Apple feels about it you know so yeah I
mean virtue was a better buy at that
point no know her too
I'm gonna have and and and on that note
Andrew I think you just killed our show
I think I think we're over now because
of what them just said no I want to
