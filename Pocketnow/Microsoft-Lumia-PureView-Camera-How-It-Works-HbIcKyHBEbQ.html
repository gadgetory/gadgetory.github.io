smartphone camera generates better or
maybe worse pictures than other phones
we are pretty sure you did if you care
about your stills i'm anthony nog and
we've talked to Oliver front sights at
Microsoft booth to better understand
what all the imaging fuss was all about
slice has been doing lenses for more
than a hundred years now and the first
plunge into the smartphone business was
back in 2004 with the Nokia and 90
remember that fast forward to today and
the Lumia 930 and Lumia 830 are marketed
by Microsoft as the boast Lumia 1020
camera flagship alongside the Lumia 1520
size told us that any manufacturer could
except producing a single segment of the
imaging system which consists of lenses
or optics the imaging sensor and the
image processing
however only the real good ones are
involved in developing the entire system
and size is doing just that despite
initially only supplying
the optics we've looked at the sensors
from the Lumia 1020
9:38 30 15 26:40 XL and some more and we
understand that there's a tremendous
amount of work behind the shutter button
or the final image which you snap with
your phone and upload the social media
we also understand that in many cases it
is all about a decision to include lower
quality imaging system components in
order to keep the costs down or smaller
components because of size constraints
we also understood that the same lenses
and sensor could generate different
results in different phones based on the
software image processing this is also
the case with the Lumia 930 and Lumia
1520 which share the same camera size
had a Lumia 930 camera module dissected
in front of a microscope where they
showed off the entire system from the
six lenses to the motor components that
are responsible for your optical image
stabilization with several Oscar Awards
behind movies shut with size lenses the
company is proud to call itself a major
part in the imaging success
most flagship Nakia now Microsoft phones
we've also looked at the mobile
microscope that size has developed it's
not a final product but more of a
technology study a proof-of-concept
containing a set of snap-on lenses that
you can add on top of your Lumia 1020
camera so you can have insane macro
magnification on the go in the specific
case of tie systems the light comes in
through the lenses hits the sensor but
it doesn't stop there and the company's
implication doesn't stop either size is
also involved with software image
processing in order to optimize the end
results from A to Z we've already known
that the megapixel story is just a small
part of the entire story but thanks to
size we understand how tiny it is from
the bigger picture and we also
understand that while most manufacturers
are using the same technologies more or
less it all comes down to taking
decisions important ones from materials
to compromises and that can only be
achieved with a lot of experience behind
you we really hope that you've enjoyed
this short presentation of course we
have a lot more from MWC so subscribe to
our YouTube channel social media and our
main website I've been anthony noggin i
thank you very much for watching until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
