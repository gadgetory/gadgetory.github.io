for some great time wasters I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and these are
the top five games for Windows Phone
when this phone is often bashed for its
application situation and rightfully so
comparatively speaking Windows Phone
only has a small fraction of the
applications and games that the leading
two platforms iOS and Android have about
160,000 apps to androids 1 million apps
and over 900,000 on iOS but that's not
to say that the hundred and sixty
thousand apps Windows Phone does have
are bad in fact more and more major
development teams are joining the ranks
and submitting apps and games to the
Windows Phone store and these are the
top 5 games for Windows Phone first we
have to start with Microsoft's own game
of course halo the popular PC and Xbox
game finally drove Microsoft to develop
a halo title for its mobile platform
halo Spartan assault this is a top-down
third-person shooter and while it's not
exactly like the console game it's a
great mobile extension of that and a
great addition to the xbox live game
titles on Windows Phone it builds on the
much-loved story as a sort of game
ception you're playing a simulation game
that lies within the story the controls
are simple yet sometimes clunky and it's
not nearly as in-depth as its console
compatriot but when you love halo and
you can get the nibble of it in your
pocket while on the go there's very
little to complain about
unless you're stingy it does come with a
fairly hefty price tag for a mobile game
699 switching gears a bit we had to pick
a game that was free
well freemium yet still deals with
violence and destruction the game is
called Robo tech it's a turn-based RPG
game based almost entirely on the luck
of the draw
the neon visuals are stunning and
although you don't have a lot of control
over the outcome of the game it's very
fun and very very addictive
basically you choose the type of battle
action you want hit the play button and
let the game do the rest for you it's a
great time waster and it comes with an
online multiplayer mode you should get a
few hours of gameplay out of this game
before you need to fork over some cash
for power-ups for battling more powerful
droids another seriously addictive and
fun game is jetpack joyride like Robo
tech X not exclusive to Windows Phone
but it's
probably one of the more notable titles
on the platform again it's a freemium
title but we won't not get to much as
you can have all the fun you want
without ever shelling out a penny this
side-scroller is a classic gameplay
style with a twist avoid hazardous
obstacles by maneuvering up and down
with your jetpack or various vehicles
try to go the furthest distance possible
collect as many coins as you can and
pick up some spin tokens on the way the
game is simple controls are perfect for
a touchscreen game and it's dangerously
addictive with tons of replay value we
can't do a top 5 list without including
at least one racing game and while
Windows Phone does offer the asphalt
series sometimes we like a little
challenge drift mania championship 2 is
just that it's a fun game that's simple
to learn and very difficult to master
the idea is to drift as much as possible
while keeping your car on the track and
as pristine as possible do this in the
shortest time available with the highest
drift score and you'll do just fine but
don't forget the achievements to unlock
new tracks drift mania championship 2
will set you back a dollar ninety-nine a
neat side note for this game it's the
first Windows Phone game to support the
Moga pro controller but it's not very
helpful since we weren't able to get the
game to recognize the connected
controller another title specific to
Windows Phone is a low mellow it's an
adorable puzzle game with absolutely
stunning 3d graphics and an endearing
soundtrack visually it reminds us of a
mixture between the Cordy series and
Little Big Planet the goal is to get the
two characters Ehlo and meelo back to
one another some levels require teamwork
where the player will have to switch
between the characters to get past
certain obstacles
the fewer blocks you travel across the
better and as with any puzzle game the
3d levels get more challenging as you
press on at $4.99 Iloilo isn't terribly
expensive and it's probably worth
skipping a cup of coffee for how happy
this game soundtrack and visuals will
make you finally because everyone needs
some mindless fun we had to give endless
robot Street the award for honorable
mention in this side scroller you
control only one leg of a giant mech the
objective caused destruction step on
people cars buses crush buildings and of
course lasers you can also kick things
around if crushing is not your style
sure it's a little morbid and we're not
sure why we're so addicted to it
but it's fun and we don't like to ask
questions except for ones
like these what are your favorite
Windows Phone games if I had to choose
just one the award would likely go to
jetpack joyride but please share your
favorites in the comments section below
