Paco calm and today I'm going to show
you a new game from st be called spb
quads and it's pretty similar to a game
that's actually on the new version of sv
v brain evolution too so I'm just me
going to this right now and as you can
hear by defaulters of music in the
background you can always change that I
might go in some of the settings later
but the game is actually pretty simple
and all you have to do is find a square
so like if I find one square here the
nice find another square here and it
makes a total square and some of them
get pretty large let's see here and find
some smaller ones and then we have these
other icons this one is a a nuclear icon
right here which blows up everything
when it gets to the bottom so will allow
that to happen and as you can see this
is a firecracker and once you activate
that it'll also blow up certain pieces
to give you more points so it also give
you a hint so as you can see it tells me
a hint of where I can go and where I
cannot go if you get stuck oh here's a
pretty big one right here and as you can
see that I have this little ice thing
right here so all of the pieces that I
chose which are green turn into ice and
disappear we also this rainbow colored
one over here which will also change the
certain squares of different colors
let's see we have another one right here
and just a bunch of different activated
squares okay so that I can see there's
another ice one which helps in your
score because you get a lot of different
colors that are the same so let's see
here's one that's pretty big
so you can continue to play and we can
go into the options as you can see we
have a progress bar on the bottom that
shows our level and it shows us how many
more points we need to get into the
order to get to the next level and with
each increasing level you get more of
these um specified squares that change
so we just let's get any more hints
right here so close that go to some of
the options so you can change them you
can have it on the sound on or off and
you can also increase the sounder music
go into about information and this is
version 1 and it would just came out
like a day or two ago so I'm just going
to go back we can go to help information
and this gives us rules and how to play
the game and which ones our bonus is and
how certain specified squares work on
this game so there is a trial available
for this game unfortunately it kicks you
out after a couple minutes and the full
version costs around ten dollars i'll
post a link and parking lot of comments
to how to get this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
