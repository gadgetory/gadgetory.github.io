true that true true that true that do
true that he's drunk we lost them
everybody I met weird running photos
Rivera Jack weirdest username 12 what
thanks for not choosing my comments no
problem dude
any time playing this video 8.25
playback speed is gold can we play that
back that's right it's that time of the
week I am high metal even out of this is
PocketNow and this is the pocket house
daily recap your comments for last week
on Monday the topic was 5g iPhones to a
certain degree it's been speculation you
know the whole problem that Apple had
with Qualcomm the fact that in Seoul
wasn't able to deliver on 5g iPhones and
then the fact that you know both
companies made up but we're not getting
5g iPhones in 2019 it's gonna happen in
2020 and then as we looked at the
roadmap it seems that only the premium
ones you're getting 5g as of next year
and it's not until 2021 that all iPhones
are going to have 5g I asked you what
you thought about that we had 579
comments Apple be like 5g equals 5k oh
my god yeah obviously right now with how
new 5g is and because it's it's an entry
to the technology it makes sense for
products to be a little more expensive
as companies continue to you know regain
their investment in everything and take
some time like first generation iPhone
was crazy expensive and it was 2g at a
time when 3G was already ubiquitous so
Apple is not famous for launching
cutting-edge technology and still
charging you a lot for it so yeah 5k I
can
I can't wait for 5g while buying a
couple of apples $1000 stands to stare
at oh my god that monitor stand has been
the running joke everywhere and you know
what I get it I you know Apple I think
that the smartest thing would have been
to be like this is the new monitor we
already explained to you that it
competes with $40,000 monitors so that's
gonna be priced at six thousand dollars
and don't make the stand optional I
think that that would have
the smarter thing to do I mean nobody
would have cared LT is already fast
enough for my use I certainly can't wait
for 5g Jesus dude depending on where you
are I mean if you're in Eastern Europe I
get it you're LTE speeds are great if
you're even in Latin America certain
countries like your nan Lotus speeds
here 4ltr great but in the United States
LTE speeds are not particularly if
you're in New York City they're not and
so I do understand the purpose I mean
instead of investing in more capacities
companies are working on 5g in order to
move people into 5g and have the others
remain on 4G LTE in order to you know
work on that capacity solution but oh
man I just I don't agree with you most
of the United States that hasn't been my
experience
5g isn't in its infancy so it's fine
that Apple will wait for 5g to grow and
become better yes I do have to agree
with that right now if you see my 5g
video with the samsung galaxy s 10 5g
and Verizon I showed that there is still
a lot of work in progress like
beamforming and other services so that
is going to take some time it's not
immediate we're hoping that it's gonna
get done sooner or later and then on
Tuesday the topic was wall-e laptop says
obviously there are fan favorites we
love these laptops but they were pulled
from Microsoft Store over all the issues
and now they're back until supplies last
apparently I asked you would you buy a
huawei laptop with everything that's
going on we had 414 comments the MacBook
ex-pro are really good I definitely buy
one yes I have to say I love that
computer it is really really good hate
the nose cam but it's such a good
machine and I don't think that you
should be concerned because you're its
Microsoft Windows like it's you're
paying for it when you buy the computer
you pay for the license so it's not like
if they can end support for you it
doesn't work that way when you're paying
for a license I would buy huawei laptop
and buy Windows OS separately well if
you want to pay for another license it's
up to you man
I mean I you don't need to the way it
works is in the end user License
Agreement you buy a computer with
Windows you're paying for the license
you get
as long as huawei is in the market I'll
always be buying and you know I have met
a lot of people that have developed a
certain level of fan base for Huawei and
I don't blame them I mean they've been
using their p20 pros now they're p30
pros they love the fact that they've got
good battery life and the software's
good and the cameras great so I get it
and again I wish that the make book X
Pro would have been perfect and they
would have put the knows cam in a better
placement it would be the perfect
computer in my opinion but yeah either
by one Huawei mate book D or one Apple
monitor Stan I'll go for the main
oh my god and we continue to Dremel
apple over this but I get it man I yeah
you can buy the I think you can even buy
the mate book for the amount of money of
that and understand tell you what you
can buy a MacBook Air for the price of
that monitor stand we should actually
make a separate video for every single
thing that you can buy for the price of
the Apple monitor stand and then on
Wednesday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy fold obviously there's been
fumbling over if it's gonna launch or
not we had trusted sources claiming that
it was not ready and then Samsung came
on record to say that they were I don't
know I asked you what do you think do
you think that Samsung is shooting
themselves in the foot or nah we had 448
comments they should delay it until it's
ready
that being said consumers need to
understand it will be a more delicate
device than the regular slap phone
perhaps they should offer two-year
warranty I do totally agree with you and
you're buying a product at that that's
that expensive I remember when the Apple
watch the first generation Apple watch
came out and they wanted I think 16
thousand dollars for the gold variant
and I'm like what else am I getting am I
getting like lifetime warranty for that
thing and so I feel the same way about
foldable products because as cool as
they are they have a lot of moving parts
and so their opportunity for failure is
larger than on a regular slab that would
be a great idea if the company would
bring the two-year warranty I mean
companies like LG already do it
regardless of the if you have a foldable
product or not that's how much they give
you for an LG phone so I think that
should be the norm delay it as it's
going to be great when it comes out wish
I could buy one I will see I mean we
were covering separate rumors that were
actually gonna discuss later over
if it's gonna be 5g or not 5g or if it's
gonna be two devices separately and then
what are you gonna pay for the other one
it's not a cheap product definitely is
it cool oh man it's it's freaking
fabulous delay the Galaxy fold perfected
and add an S Pen done oh man I wish they
could fit a Wacom digitizer in that
thing and yes that would be like B
perfect reason why to buy a foldable if
you've got that added functionality of a
stylus they're gonna hurt sales for the
note 10 if they wait too long that is a
possibility that no 10 I don't expect to
be an inexpensive phone and therefore
yes there is a possibility that they
could but I don't think that they Hertz
sales of the Galaxy S 10 and these were
announced in the parallel form even
though the S 10 launched a lot earlier
it's a good point I wonder what will
happen I mean I think that's one of the
main reasons why the company has
probably not launched anything yet
because we're so close to the note 10
and then Thursday the topic was Huawei
and the future Android Q for its devices
because well the company has just
announced that it's got 17 devices
getting it there are some on our phones
that are also getting it meaning there
is support if you currently have a
product there is a guarantee and
actually Huawei posted a whole website
where they came clear about a lot of
speculation over what happens if you're
a current huawei customer you know just
to put those worries at ease and I asked
you what did you think when you still
buy huawei products we had 558 comments
to be frank Huawei is one of the most
secure phones right now as it doesn't
come with Facebook pre-installed oh my
god yes you deserve all those likes dude
I despise Facebook I have to agree I
can't comment about if they're secure or
not man because you know the world is
full of other phones that don't come
from China that will still spy on your
location and listen to you and then
serve you ads for it so it's not just
Facebook the Huawei situation is like
innovation are made with the hard work
of engineers killed by the politics of
governments you're getting philosophical
there but I
you get your point I mean we've been
dealing with unprecedented development
over the last 20-30 years with trade and
how its improved I find it funny how the
United States is now not wanting to
trade once a company has clearly I don't
know be its US companies and technology
and certain things you can argue if this
was copying or not I'm not gonna argue
over that either but yeah I do agree
with your point I don't see a reason not
to buy Huawei phones if there's any
other smartphone maker that can make
waves in this segment
that'll be wall wave you know that's the
beauty of a company that's private if we
could call it that way they don't depend
on the stock market so they're not
worried on you know looking good with
investors or this or that and let's fire
people because we are our you know our
stock is down
no they're they've got all this money
and they invested in R&amp;amp;D and this is the
result there's another company that's
like this which is Samsung and this is
the reason why Samsung is the most
popular brand and then finally Friday
the topic was you know the fact that
with the whole China ban this is a
rather interesting development because
we had Fox Khan's founder and former
chairman listen to former as a telling
Apple you know we should move out of
China the thing about it is he's
recommending that they moved to Taiwan
and then we learned that he was running
for president so obviously it makes
sense for him to want to bring jobs back
to Taiwan and yes Foxconn is a Taiwanese
company and everything but you know it
just it got too weird I asked you if you
care where phones are built because you
know the rumors were that everything was
going to move to India we had 374
comments in the 90s I do care where the
product was made but right now since the
dawn of online shopping not anymore
exactly I mean I worked in an industry
aviation where I would never get on a
plane and be like where is my pilot from
was he born in the United States no you
don't ask those kinds of questions
because it's a the duty of each company
to have their own procedures in order to
guarantee that you know either safety or
the quality of a product is guaranteed
so I don't think that we're at a stage
where we have to worry about these
things anymore but yeah tell us where it
comes from unless words coming from is
costing me more money
then I'll care deeply you know but
that's a big issue and it's immoral it's
a broader political issue than anything
because like I come from a third-world
country where I know that minimum wage
is very bad people can barely survive on
that and so it's one of those things
where it's like I would rather accompany
again where I'm getting political and I
apologize but it's just a very broad
topic where I know that there is cheap
labor but it's not necessarily fair
labor if you understand what I mean I
would rather companies worry less about
providing you know income to investors
and buying the next yacht and the new
rolls-royce for their CEO and instead
making make it a little more equal you
get where I'm going I don't care which
country it's made as long as it's high
quality and can lower the price that
would be good true and I do feel that
you know going broader on the point that
I just made I think that manufacturing
in certain countries is overly
exaggerated and the cost as well so I'm
not saying that one thing is the only
bad thing a lot of things need to
improve but true obviously in the end as
a consumer you want to pay the least for
it true don't care where tech is made as
long as it performs as promised yes true
and then that's the problem like right
now the Galaxy S eight active was the
phone that I used to that I used to run
I mean it's made in Korea great quality
and everything and now my battery is
expanding you know so even the top
brands deal with certain quality issues
I mean we even talked about the galaxy
s7
active having issues with water
resistance and it was an active phone so
you know even the best companies have
issues we remember the battery issues
with Apple or foldable products from
Cupertino so yeah it's it's even that
it's not guaranteed
that's it for the pocket house daily
