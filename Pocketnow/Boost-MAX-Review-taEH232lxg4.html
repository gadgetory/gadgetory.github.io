smartphone market but can its latest
oversized smartphone help I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
full review of the boost max by ZTE over
the years we've come to expect poor
hardware and budget devices okiya and
motorola have done wonders to change
that and ZTE wants in on the notoriety
from a short distance the boost backs
closely resemble some older HTC devices
thanks to the two-tone backside composed
of a soft touch plastic and a metallic
Center however the boost max does not
feature an aluminum build even if it
looks like it it's made almost entirely
of plastic any phone this size will have
a considerable amount of heft to it put
the boost max is notably weighty hitting
the scales at 201 grams and it's
dimensions are expansive compared to
save the note 3 which has the same size
display this is due to the large vessels
on the top and bottom but we must say
the boost max feels a lot better in the
hand than you might imagine it feels
extremely solid with no notable squeaks
when gripping the device tightly however
there are some odd aspects of the Max's
design worth noting the microUSB port is
found near the bottom along the left
edge which makes the device more
difficult to hold and use while charging
and the hardware shutter key something
we're normally jazzed about isn't a
2-step key like most also the microSD
card slot is oddly only accessible via
removal tool like many SIM cards the
boost Max's internals are about as
modest as they get it ships with only 8
gigabytes of fixed storage though that's
offset with a micro SD card slot Ram is
only one gigabyte and the Snapdragon 400
SOC is a combination of a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core Krait CPU and Adreno 305 GPU
the camera around back is 8 megapixels
and the battery is an impressive 3200
million powers the most upsetting
feature of the Boost max is the display
instead of the 1080p resolution we've
come to expect on such large devices the
max comes with a 5.7 inch 720p display
which is understandable for a $299 phone
those who aren't pixel junkies won't
mind it but after taking a close candor
at the display we quickly noticed
pixelation in the corners of icons and
text light bleeds at the bottom edge of
the display
porvis
bility from wide angles and an
unmistakable warmth to the color of the
display whites appear more cream-colored
than true white when you consider the
price as is advisable for a phone of
this caliber
the boost max isn't bad on paper
boost back ships with Android jellybean
version 4.1 - already two versions
behind the current 4.4 kitkat update but
on a lighter note it's a very near stock
version of Android at least as far as
appearances go you can tell some things
have been tweaked like the homepage
indicator dot above the dock the custom
settings toggles in the notification
shade and even the giant signal
indicator and there are some few
additions such as ZTE s own apps in the
place of stock ones as well as widgets
and wallpapers but outside those few
slight changes the visual appearance of
the software is very close to the
original there is some bloat but
fortunately it's minimal and most if not
all pre-installed apps can be
uninstalled and ZTE has tried its hand
at some value adds tossing in a Dolby
Digital Plus eqf which noticeably
improve the media playback quality and
what ZTE calls Smart viewer or its take
on the split pane multitasking feature
we've seen on other like size devices
the really cool feature in this one
however is a window specific mute switch
also any installed application will work
with smart viewer to boot
the effects of running jellybean over
KitKat stretch further than just missing
features however it affects the
performance since the boost max isn't
equipped with the most impressive
internals the Snapdragon 400 has proven
in the past to be a worthy budget SOC
but performance on the boost max is
really hit or miss sometimes it works
just fine but about 60 percent of the
time with the boost max it's been
abysmal there is noticeable lag in
switching between home screens or
flipping between app pages opening and
closing apps will cause the device to
freeze at times and loading web pages or
videos even a Wi-Fi can literally take
minutes for no apparent reason and
benchmarks only tell us what we already
know the Snapdragon 400 in the max is
nothing to get terribly excited over but
it has managed to power through some
games even asphalt 8 without a hitch
signal has been an issue here in the
Charlotte metro area we've been jumping
back and forth between one or two bars
of 3G and LTE and data speeds have been
very poor in fact we've spent the vast
majority of the review period on Wi-Fi
that said call quality has been passable
and we haven't dropped or had trouble
making calls
despite the spotty service on a more
positive note battery life has been
quite impressive
often lasting upwards of two days on a
single charge at the very least it is
typically lasted a day and a half
through moderately heavy usage on a
single charge we'll go into further
detail in the written portion of this
review the camera is not noteworthy
either the 8 megapixel sensor manages to
capture a fair amount of detail in
optimal shooting conditions but photos
are notably cooler than they should be
muting colors and sucking the life out
of photos we also had trouble with the
autofocus mode on the boost max it had
trouble locking on closed objects and
not having a two-step shutter button
made the switch between tapping the
focus and pressing a hardware button to
capture a bit strange the camera should
suffice but it's not quite on par with
flagship smartphones so what do we make
of the boost max from ZTE for a prepaid
option at $299 it isn't a bad smartphone
the camera is passable the display is
large and great for multimedia
consumption and gaming and the battery
life is phenomenal it may not be our top
choice in smartphones but if Boost LTE
data coverage is more readily available
in your area the boost max is a fine
bargain and one of the better picks and
boosts smart phone options we just can't
help but wonder how much better the
phone's performance would have been if
we're running KitKat instead of an old
version of jellybean for a more in-depth
look at the boost max and for our final
score of the device be sure to check out
