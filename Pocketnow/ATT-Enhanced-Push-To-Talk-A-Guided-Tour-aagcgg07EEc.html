king phone calls weren't the only game
in town some wireless carriers offered
push-to-talk
or a walkie talkie two-way radio like
method of communication for when voice
calls just wouldn't do
recently AT&amp;amp;T rebooted its own
push-to-talk offering for North America
and thanks to our friends at the carrier
we've got some handsets to test it out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is your guided tour of enhanced
push-to-talk on AT&amp;amp;T in America carriers
have historically found little traction
with push-to-talk the eye dentist
carrier Nextel now part of Sprint Nextel
gained a lot of visibility offering
dispatch service to its customers at one
time around 20 million people these days
that number of PTT users has shrunk to
below 5 million but other carriers are
still trying to pick the Nextel carcass
clean the most dedicated one is the
nation's second largest AT&amp;amp;T
push-to-talk is obviously still a hobby
for AT&amp;amp;T it's not on many of the
carrier's devices but the ones it is on
are robust in keeping with the
historically rugged nature of
push-to-talk our test devices are
Samsung rugby pro units they're still
running Ice Cream Sandwich and they
won't win any beauty awards but their
LTE enabled and they're rated to milspec
810g standards of durability including
water immersion they also feature a
dedicated push-to-talk button right
above the volume keys from the home
screen pushing and holding the
push-to-talk button launches the
enhanced push-to-talk app the home
screen is a simple affair offering
access to contacts groups and favorites
up top a call history list in the middle
and calling and alerting options down
below because this is a data based
push-to-talk implementation you can also
set your availability much like an
instant message service or Google Voice
or the iPhones Do Not Disturb feature
when you want a place have push-to-talk
call it's as simple as selecting
someone's name from the list yes they
also need to have a PTT enabled phone
and pressing and holding the button to
talk you're getting a lot of feedback
there because these devices are right
next to each other but when you're
through speaking you release the button
and then the other person can press and
hold to reply just like that
yes I'm testing these myself because no
one wanted to test them with me womp
womp now a lot of people ask why this is
still useful when with a phone call you
can have full duplex communication
without the hassle of pushing a button
well for one thing there's group calling
ability with the touch of a button you
can be communicating with a large group
of people instantly PTT is also faster
the set-up time is quicker than a phone
call and you don't have to deal with
protracted steps like leaving a
voicemail and waiting for a response and
all that kind of stuff you push the
button you talk you're either connected
or you're not the closest analogy is
that it's like SMS for voice calls and
since it's Network supported you don't
have to be in a specific geographic
region one of you can be in Florida the
other one can be in Washington if you're
in the United States the push-to-talk
connectivity is unaffected but that's
rude you say you've got a phone in your
pocket all the sudden it beeps and
someone's just talking talking talking
without your permission well we've got
the availability indicator as we
mentioned before and also you can take
push-to-talk calls privately on the ear
they don't have to be ratted through the
speakerphone and finally if the
conversations going a little too long
you're getting a little tired of pushing
the button you can easily switch it over
to an interconnect call a regular voice
call through the interface so what's the
downside well unlike next tells old I'd
n network which was legitimate trunked
dispatch radio the AT&amp;amp;T push-to-talk
solution is an
app that ties into a data connection to
transmit your voice that has advantages
it means the service can run on a wider
swath of Android devices like the Galaxy
s3 as well as the BlackBerry Bold and
some specialized devices the app itself
isn't designed terribly well though with
a UI that takes some getting used to and
there are a few rough edges here and
just like any data based push-to-talk
connection the service is vulnerable to
occasional timeouts and if the
server-side connection fails you're in
trouble we ran into some problems when
we tried downloading a routine update to
the EPT app from the Google Play Store
which momentarily broke our connection
to the push-to-talk service in general
it's less reliable than a dedicated
dispatch solution of course with the
sunset of next Li down even sprint is
using data based push-to-talk so these
aren't problems unique to AT&amp;amp;T they're
just worth mentioning when it worked
service was good and the voice
connection was clear with typical
latency of between one and two seconds
very good for a data based solution that
was over a TN t--'s LTE network your
experience may differ over a slower
connection at $5 a month on top of a
voice plan or 30 a month for a
push-to-talk only plan is AT&amp;amp;T s
enhanced PTT worth the price it's
definitely a stronger offering than
their earlier attempt but with other
highly rated push-to-talk clients on the
Google Play Store like voxer and tickle
most of them free it's hard to say AT&amp;amp;T
seems the carrier most dedicated to
poaching disgruntled Nextel subscribers
during the ident damn those and there
are some specialized features here
AT&amp;amp;T claims interoperability with LMR
and PMR radio systems so if you're a
business owner with dispatch needs or a
sprint expat looking for a solid carrier
based push-to-talk solution AT&amp;amp;T has
options and a vested interest in keeping
you happy that alone might be worth the
small monthly outlay folks that's going
to do it for us who hope you enjoyed our
guided tour of enhanced push-to-talk on
AT&amp;amp;T in the United States if you have a
