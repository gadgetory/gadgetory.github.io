pocketnow.com and this is a look at some
of the digital photography features of
Windows Phone 7 let's take a look okay
before getting started it's important to
mention once again that what you're
about to see is not final windows phone
7 hardware or software so let's take a
look at these photography features of
Windows Phone 7 starting off when the
device is turned off if you want to take
a picture really quickly and you don't
want to turn on the device unlock the
screen and find the camera program you
can actually tap and hold the dedicated
hardware button up here for the camera
which is required by Microsoft on all
windows phone 7 devices if I hold it for
30 seconds like I'm doing now it will
actually launch the camera application
without you having to actually turn on
the device so let's take a picture here
another cool feature of the camera we
talked about this in a previous video is
right after you take a picture the
picture slides to the left and you can
swipe to the right to see it instantly
or you can go to the right to go back to
the viewfinder now you can also continue
to swipe to the left to see all the
pictures that you've taken or you can
keep going to the right to the
viewfinder and you're back taking
another picture now you may be wondering
what happens if the phone is in my
pocket and mmm accidentally the camera
button is pressed down maybe you sit on
the phone weird well the this feature of
Windows Phone 7 where the camera can
launch without unlocking the device is
actually proximity sensor aware so if
you cover up the proximity sensor and
try to hold down the camera button here
nothing is going to happen because it
realizes that it's in your pocket very
smart feature of Windows Phone 7 so
let's go back in okay and let's go into
the picture sub and by the way this
picture tile that you just saw is one of
those live picture tiles meaning that it
will change so it's supposed to change
every five times you go into the
pictures hub although you can have it
change manually if you change the
background of the pictures hub so here
we are on the pictures hub and we have
several different panels here we can tap
and hold on the background to change the
background or have the phone actually
change it for you and so it just changed
to kind of an ugly picture I took
earlier I don't like that too much so
I'm going to
change it for me one more time yeah
that's not any better let's try change
background manually and I'm going to
choose a picture that actually comes on
the device that looks a lot better than
anything I've taken okay that works so
now the background changes and if we go
to the home screen you'll see that the
tile has actually changed to represent
the background of the pictures hub
pretty cool okay so let's get into the
pictures hub so we swipe to the right we
see recent pictures that I've taken with
the camera to the right of that is
what's new so it's actually pulling in
from facebook and I can actually view
photos on my device here from facebook
as if they were native so here's a
picture that someone took I can go into
landscape and this picture actually
feels like it's on my device when it's
being pulled from Facebook swipe to the
right we're back to where we started we
can go to albums by date and here is the
date view we can swipe to the right to
go to favorites or back to all and here
are all the different photo albums and
here's another cool thing it's pulling
from my facebook albums so here are all
my facebook albums cruise photos random
pictures that I've taken over the years
almost as if they are native pictures on
my device super cool I'm just going to
go to the camera roll because they'll
load the quickest so I'm going to tap on
one of these so I can show you a cool
feature of Windows Phone 7 when you're
looking at photos of course you can
swipe to the right or swipe to the left
it's actually thinking I'm looking this
way but you can actually zoom out to get
a filmstrip view so this gives you kind
of an overview of all the pictures that
you have without having to see one
picture at a time just a cool way to
look at your pictures and then when you
see a picture you like you can zoom in
and pinch to zoom as you would expect
and of course when you tap and hold on a
picture you can do a bunch of things
with it so let's try that you can add it
as a favorite and it will add it'll go
into the favorites gallery you can also
upload it to SkyDrive you can delete it
or you can share it via a variety of
social networking services or you can
send it via email or as an M
s there's also a feature where you can
automatically upload pictures to
facebook or SkyDrive another great way
to keep your pictures synchronized so i
just added a picture as a favorite now i
have two pictures set as my favorite i
can look at them like so or of course i
can zoom out to get that filmstrip view
and view them like that so the way
windows phone 7 treats photos is pretty
interesting the way that you can take a
picture without having to unlock the
device the way that you can go into the
pictures of and view have been a very
organized way all the pictures that
you've taken + pictures that you've
taken on facebook + pictures that other
people have taken on facebook it's a
really immersive digital photography
experience couple that with really fast
performance and greats multi-touch
pinch-to-zoom panning you have a really
good digital photography experience on
windows phone 7 if you like this video
