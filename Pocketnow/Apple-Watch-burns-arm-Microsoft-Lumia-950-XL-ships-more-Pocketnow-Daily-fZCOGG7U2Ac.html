serious burns on a customer recently the
microsoft lumia 950xl began shipping
after a very odd wait and believe it or
not HP just made it not and trade into
the wearable market i'm hi i'm adam
Iveta and my textbook definition for
sleepy in the morning is currently
happening right now
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with HP that company
that just reorganized itself yet another
time and that has decided to get into
the wearables market they had actually
announced something last week with a
swiss maker Movado but the company has
now announced a new partnership with
india's titan for a smart wearable and
we're not really sure exactly what the
whole purpose of this is because
apparently tightening watches are now
going to be engineered by HP and we're
trying to understand what exactly they
plan to bring as a sort of innovation
particularly from a company that's never
really done a wearable so stay tuned as
we learn whatever it is they're planning
to do and as we begin with the leaks we
found some interesting images of an oppo
device to come and for those of you the
thought that opal devices look too much
like an iphone in the case of the our
lineup or that you feel that color OS
the new version looks a lot like iOS
don't look at this photo then because
this phone looks exactly like an iphone
success it's not necessarily bad it's
got some curves on the edge just which
is good but the problem is that
well the horrible antenna marks have
made it into an even more predominant
form with this new design we're not
exactly sure when to expect this phone
or if this is the feature our smartphone
but we'll keep you posted as we learn
more
even though lenovo pretty much made it
official that they would be merging
brands with motorola at some point we
haven't really seen that on the contrary
actually lenovo has continued launching
smartphones in europe and we were still
waiting to see when motorola was
actually going to take over and we've
got trusted sources claiming that that
is apparently going to start happening
with the vibe lineup now we're not
really sure if lenovo is actually going
to create the Moto vibe or if that's
going to be the case but yeah you can
expect the vibe the lineup to
appear from Lenovo and to make some sort
of appearance in Motorola let's see
what's coming soon for these 2 grands
now let's move the spotlight over to
Apple as it seems that the Apple watch
is getting hot in ways that it's not
supposed to a Danish customer just
complained that the Milanese loop Apple
watch apparently caused some serious
burns on his arm and there is a link in
the description to show you the photo
but bear in mind it is rather disturbing
it does show that the Apple watch caught
fire for reasons that are not specified
but even more interesting these news are
apparently a month old and Apple has
seems to have brushed it off so not only
they've just paid attention and then
they're investigating what happened so
hey there's a reason why I swapped and
finally the very hot news of the day
have the lumia 950xl launching in the
united states those of you that were
disappointed because you had to wait for
it but we're able to pre-order the
product last week should be getting it
within the next few days we're not
exactly sure when our coverage of the
Lumia 950 started a few days ago so far
so good but obviously this is the more
powerful flagship that a lot of people
are waiting for it does lead me to the
question of the day did you order any of
the new Lumia sweather 950 or 950 XL in
my case I haven't but I am waiting for
the michael fisher review of the XL to
confirm if it's something that's useful
to me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know what you did or what you
plan to do with the Lumias friends as
always you know the drill if you won't
