what I have here is a go phone SIM card
and yes you can use prepaid with iPhone
yeah just have to set up the APN
settings and I'll put a link in the
description on how to do that now I
don't want to use the sim that came with
the the iPhone 5 I want to use my own
SIM and use my own phone number and
everything like that so I've got to cut
this down and I'm gonna do it sort of
the old-fashioned brutal way I might
regret this
I might not I think I can do it right so
what you're going to need to do this is
a razor blade yeah you know where this
is going you're going to need a straight
edge to get a nice even cut you're also
going to need some sandpaper this is 180
grit you want to go with 180 or higher
somewhere around 240 would be ideal
because actually then this is going to
be an interesting experiment I must say
the nano-sim is less thick than the
micro-sim so we're gonna have to shave
off about a quarter of a millimeter it's
it's possible that it will fit in there
at the same width but who knows so let's
start this okay so I don't cut my desk
here I'm going to put a piece of paper
underneath of the sim here and again
this might not work okay this is a bit
of an experiment but I did this before
actually this used to be a regular sim
and I cut it to a micro sim and it
worked just fine and you know the theory
here is that this is just this with less
plastic so what I'm going to do is kind
of size this up and determine how much
plastic I need to cut off and it looks
like I literally need to come right
within that golden contact so I'm going
to take my straightedge here and let's
zoom in so you can see what I'm doing
and you might even see me cut my finger
off if you're lucky and I'm going to go
right into the edge I definitely don't
want to cut off the gold contacts and
I'm going to hold this down pretty tough
and now I'm going to score this I only
want to score it I don't want to cut it
all the way through because I'm going to
and as you can see if you don't hold it
down enough this might be a disaster if
you don't hold it down enough it's going
to move so you want to press real hard
on that coming here
kind of gently rub the blade against it
a few times and don't stab yourself with
the razor blade okay and success I got
the right side nice and tightly cut
around the plastic and now what I'm
going to do is just go around the other
edges I need to take some off the top
and then it should fit I'm then I'm
gonna have to sand it of course and I
might need to round the edges just a
little bit but again I'll be back after
I do the top and we'll see what happens
okay so after many minutes of finagling
sanding and cutting I finally got my
what once was a micro-sim into a
nano-sim shape it's pretty much
identical but now I need to shave off a
tiny bit from the top of the card
because it's not fitting into the iPhone
5 because like I mentioned the nano-sim
you can see it is slightly slightly
thinner so I'm just gonna take some
sandpaper here and just give it a few
kind of movements along the sandpaper
and I'm going to keep doing it until it
fits okay so I shaved off not that much
actually you can see I kind of shaved
off the word GoPhone and guess what it
works it fits so that is how you cut a
micro sim into an annus I mean you might
be wondering what if you want to go back
the other way well I've got here a
nano-sim de micro sim adapter and it was
actually pretty cheap it was about seven
or eight bucks and you know it's a good
thing to have on hand in case you change
phones when you decide to go to a phone
with a micro sim I'll put a link in the
description on how to get this hope you
enjoyed this video tutorial please give
us a thumbs up if you like what you saw

that's it for now
