calm and this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup in which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started mo tweets is a
great twitter feed application allows
you to update your status on the fly
directly from your windows phone 7
device so we can tap here we can add
multiple accounts so if we wanted to add
our update directly to multiple accounts
we do that we conclude our vacation add
a image can also select direct contacts
and shorten the URL we can view our
mentions just by swiping to the right we
can go find people that are near me we
can view the image wall and go back to
our timeline there are two versions
available a paid version which costs 99
cents any free version pc remote is a
free application allows you control
practically any pc on your network all i
have to do is help install the pc remote
server software onto your computer and
then just configure it directly on your
Windows Phone 7 device so you can use
this as a keyboard a mouse you can also
launch Windows Media Center so you can
play movies discs you can watch video
the photos go back here we can also use
this as a remote for our media and go
here the greatest feature that I would
find useful is the mouse because you can
use the mouse from across the room bit
bought this great application allows you
to watch on-demand television shows and
movies directly from your device so you
can even download these directly to your
device and save them for later so you
can watch them if you are out of a
coverage area so we can go here you TV
shows the service does cost around ten
dollars a month or is it free trial and
there are hundreds of television shows
available so there are hundreds of
television shows available so we can
search one here let's choose bones will
just click on that I don't begin playing
directly on our device over a 3g 4g or
Wi-Fi connection fraud blog is free and
paid application available on the
windows marketplace across 99 cents so
we can well the object of games to drive
our logs down and to set our frogs on
top of them to prevent them from
drowning in the water so once we've
completed that task we move on to the
next level so now i need to save 15
frogs from drowning so will our
change them onto this set of logs here
go kind of fast just to get through this
level and the game continues on like
this there are more difficult frogs to
use and of course other obstacles that
come along bye bye brains the free and
paid game that cost one dollar nine
cents on the windows marketplace so the
story behind the game is that all these
cell phone users which are now zombies
it became brainless after they use their
phones for too much and have rotted
their brains so the objects of games
defend your area from these zombies that
are tagging through these from various
hordes so we know how to do is place
your weapons I guess it would be on the
playing field and you can also upgrade
them to different levels and defend this
area from the zombie attacks so this is
been another episode of the windows
phone 7 app roundup and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
