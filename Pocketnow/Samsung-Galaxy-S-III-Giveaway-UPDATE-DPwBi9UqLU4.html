here with a quick but critical update to
our samsung galaxy s3 giveaway you
responded and we listened initially we
were only offering this giveaway to our
us readers because it is an AT&amp;amp;T branded
samsung galaxy s3 device we couldn't
confirm that it was unlockable so what
we decided to do is just open it up to
the American audience however our loyal
international readership did not like
that very much so we investigated the
possibilities to see if we could unlock
this device to see if there was any
restrictions on it turns out there
weren't we have successfully unlocked
this phone meant we had to take it out
of the box put in a sim card and unlock
it but that's the extent of the
tampering we didn't get our fingerprints
all over it or anything like that so
with the exception of the u.s. only
restriction all rules are still the same
the only thing that's changed is that
now everyone on planet earth can enter
this contest so please see the original
post at pocketnow.com for the full rules
of the contest on how to play see the
original video and get the details there
one thing though remember if you live
outside the United States you are still
getting an AT&amp;amp;T branded samsung galaxy
s3 now it is unlocked but that means
it's got support for gsm 850 900 1800
1900 and support for 3g wcdma on 850
nineteen hundred and twenty one hundred
and not that this will matter much for
most people outside the united states
but there's also LTE support on seven
hundred and seventeen hundred if that
doesn't line up with your what your
carrier offers wherever you live on
planet earth you might want to give this
contest to pass but that's just some
friendly advice you can enter the
contest if you live on planet earth that
is the only restriction geographically
speaking so that's it everyone once
again thanks for your feedback sorry
about the confusion there and good luck
we'll talk to you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
