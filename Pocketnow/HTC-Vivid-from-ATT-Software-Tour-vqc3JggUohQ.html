pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the software on
the HTC Vivid from AT&amp;amp;T so sit back
relax enjoy the show as expected with
this device we've got the HTC Sense and
the typical ring unlocked functionality
here which you can see still gives you
the number of shortcuts that you can
modify yourself and customize to your
heart's content and does have some
notification pieces up here at the top
we go in here to the home screen view
then as you move across the page you got
your slide indicator down here at page
indicator down here and typical widgets
that are available you've got your all
apps button here which will come back to
the phone and then you've also got to
the personalized button here which is
also available via the menu here which
all apps and notifications personalized
wallpaper ringtones etc settings going
down the notification bar up at the top
gives you the HTC notifications on this
side and then if you slide over this tab
then you get your quick settings both
are available in landscape and portrait
format pretty nice setting a
functionality although I do wish that it
said stock gingerbread on it rather than
being forced to use since there are some
nice features of sense but mmm I do miss
the ability to have customizable buttons
down here without installing you know
side loading a launcher or installing a
launcher from the markets such as go
launcher ex we go here into the settings
about phone
then you can see we're running Android 2
3 4 which is gingerbread HD sense 30 the
rest of the settings here in the device
are pretty standard nothing too amazing
or or different here you've got your
typical display settings so you can lock
the device to you know stay on all the
time like I've got said now you still
have your personalized options wireless
and network is where you can turn on and
off the wireless tethering option which
I've used on this device with much
success then and then you've got your
applications your power etc etc
accessibility so go back home screen
here and go into all apps I hit the
right button so got the typical once
again HTC Sense slide up and down to go
through all of your apps some of the
apps can be removed such as this 18t
family map app you can actually
uninstall but the AT&amp;amp;T navigator app you
can't uninstall even though it's a pay
for only style app so that's a little
disappointing there there is a FM radio
capability here which requires you to
use the headphones in order for it to
work as the headphones have to act as
the antenna it's fine that's just a time
of note there and then down here at the
bottom you've got the ability to change
your sorting options so you can change
this to your frequent apps to your
downloaded apps and then back to all
apps and then if you go into your
settings you can also change a list and
share and sort them to your heart's
content remove app etc etc one thing we
didn't get catch on the speed test was a
speed test in the hardware app video
review and mostly because we don't have
the 4g service but i do want to share
with you that we even with the 3g
service the garlic quote-unquote foji
service at some devices are getting you
can see here i got some pretty
impressive speeds 5541 kb here and then
37 there
with upload speeds that are really
really nice compared especially compared
to sprint device or a verizon device on
there for geez that's part of a 3g
service these speeds really blow that
away other than that i found that with
the sense on here even though it's not
pure gingerbread moves very very quickly
and i haven't had any problems other
than the occasional flash where the HTC
Sense block will appear up and almost
like the phone is crashing and i did as
mentioned in the hardware review have
some phone hiccups where the signal
would disappear so let's take a quick
look at the camera application here
we've got the zoom bar up on this side
and over here we've got the shutter and
then being able to rotate the camera to
front back and then camera to video
flash on and off the kind of nice
functionality here is being able to go
into this effects window here there's a
lot of interesting effects that can you
can apply to a picture as it's being
taken unfortunately a lot of these facts
cannot be applied after the fact which
would be kind of a neat functionality if
you go into a picture after it's been
taken then you can tap on it and use
this magic wand again but again it just
gives you some effects but not all the
effects that are on the camera full
camera capability so you can go into
vintage or bleak antique just some some
interesting kind of Instagram Instamatic
style photo editing capabilities right
in the phone that give you a little
better shot overall
the image quality on this is we
mentioned in the hardware is actually
pretty good what I really liked about
this camera is that the lens on it's got
a really nice aperture so you can
actually get some really nice depth of
field and the little difficult to see on
this particular picture but there's some
some decent Boca but if it gets too and
you'll see these in the final version
they you look back in this section here
on the final image and the bokeh really
breaks apart very quickly and gets
really grainy and and ugly and that
wraps up our software overview on the
HTC Vivid from AT&amp;amp;T if you have any
comments or questions leave them below
and we'll try to cover them in the final
review if you liked the video please
give us a thumbs up we'd appreciate that
otherwise thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
