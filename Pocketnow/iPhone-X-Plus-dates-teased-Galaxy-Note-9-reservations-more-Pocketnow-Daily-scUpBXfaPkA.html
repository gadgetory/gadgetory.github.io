next generation iPhones along with some
confirmation of iPad hardware set your
calendars ladies and gentlemen it is
time for Android P very soon if you want
to pre-order the new Galaxy Note well
you can reserve it right now I'm Jaime
metal Iveta and definitely for those of
you that ask for the pocket out daily in
podcast version it is now live in the
link in the description in addition
these next couple of weeks are gonna be
really cool with all the product
launches this is pocket out daily the
official news today have to do with
Microsoft's official launch of the new
surface go and this launch is aggressive
more aggressive than I've ever seen from
Microsoft 20 countries starting today
and obviously even more aggressive than
that is the price tag it starts at $400
and ranges over is 600 depending on the
configuration that you look for if
you're looking out for one night and one
of them actually stay tuned for that
coverage but yeah link in the
description for more information now
let's talk about Samsung as well the
company is offering some benefits if you
pretty much reserve your new Galaxy
which we know is the note 9 a link in
the description for that if you're
interested pretty much they guarantee
that you will be getting your phone on
August 24th and second the fact that you
can trade in any smartphone that's
eligible on the list that they have and
get up to four hundred fifty bucks back
which is great now let's talk about
Facebook the company has just sent out
new marching orders to whatsapp its
company by stating you have to make
money and for those of you that didn't
know whatsapp for the longest time has
had this policy where they don't serve
ad so they have done is launched a new
service called whatsapp business where
there are a couple of ways where the
company is looking into monetizing which
I find that grave to figure that out and
not monetize whatsapp that would be
horrible terrible unless they figure it
out some alternatives like what we see
in WeChat or you can use it to pay for
services and obviously they get a
commission for that attention to other
things but hopefully they're not gonna
end up ruining whatsapp as Facebook is
ruined its own services and yes everyone
famous tipster Evan Blass has just set
his own calendar for August 20th and
he's got a P in that town
screenshot that he sent it to everybody
meaning that yes we are expecting
Android P to go live on August 20th and
this is interesting because could it be
that we're actually getting the
operating system before the
next-generation pixels or could it be
that we're getting the next-generation
pixels being announced earlier than we
expected whatever the case may be we've
seen great rumors for this phone I can't
wait to look at it and obviously I can't
wait for the official build of Android P
as well and finally the hottest news
today have to do with Apple I've asked
you to set your calendars more than once
today but this one's worth it for those
of you looking forward to new iPhones
new iPads well iOS 12 developer beta 5
pretty much hinged to a possible launch
date or announcement date at least for
September 12 so set your calendars for
that we heard September 11th before so
that makes sense
and definitely new iPhones and well we
also get the hint of new iPad design
with the new icons where there is no
longer home button in the drawing it is
pretty much just all small bezels and
icons so yeah it seems that the new
design for the iPad is coming but in
today's question let us know are you
looking forward to any of the possible
new Apple products at this event and if
so which one is in my case I am
definitely looking forward to a less
expensive iPhone that would be great but
also definitely the new iPad pro I am a
big user but leave us a comment down
below we looked in on your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on pocketnow.com
