built a droid and for Verizon Wireless
and this one's tougher than most but do
a huge battery and a shatterproof
display justify the new turbos price tag
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
let's find out in our video review of
the Motorola Droid turbo to the turbo
twos design is best described as
polarizing lots of commenters have
called out its wide bezels and chunky
frame it's pockmarked face plate but we
dig it because the turbo 2 owns its
ugliness rather than trying to be
something it's not all those casing
penetrations stand for different
features the proximity sensors for Moto
display the front-facing flash for the
selfie camera the twin front firing
speakers and the biggest port of all
accommodates a one-of-a-kind display a
5.4 inch AMOLED that's now really blue
on the whites and frankly not as bright
as we'd like it to be in sunlight but at
quad HD its pixel packed and yes it's
very nearly impossible to shatter to
test that claim we dropped the Droid
turbo to a lot heights ranging from 4 to
9 feet surfaces including hardwood and
stone tile even with impact after impact
there wasn't a spider web in sight this
is thanks to the 5 layer construction of
the shatter shield display which uses
flexible plastic OLED a redundant touch
sensor and two lenses mounted to the
phone's aluminum frame there's not a bit
of glass in the whole thing but that
means there's nothing brittle to shatter
which is good but it also means the
screen materials are softer which is bad
even with the hard coat on the exterior
lens this is a surprisingly easy screen
to scratch Motorola says the outside
lens is easily replaceable by users
thankfully so the company will start
offering lens replacements for sale at
some point the turbo 2 is the first
Droid to be featured on moto maker so
you can build one to your own custom
style and finish it with soft touch
silicone pebbled whore wine leather or a
revised version of the original turbo's
ballistic nylon
the aluminum frame and dimpled camera
bezel come in various shades with accent
colors custom engraving and boot
greetings all customizable the leather
version is a little more expensive but
it's worth it if you want a little more
luxury in your hand feel the turbo two's
build of Android lollipop is almost
identical to the Moto X pure editions so
we'll just touch on what sets this phone
apart that starts with Verizon's
customizations which are littered
throughout the software the signal
strength indicator persistent Wi-Fi
banner and the notification shade the
circular time weather calendar widget
that evokes the Moto 360 and that
honestly we actually kind of like then
there's the bloatware Verizon is packed
in a ton of preloaded apps 22 distinct
titles to be exact
several of which lead to redundant paid
services that Google already offers for
free all carriers do this to an extent
but when one of the nation's most
expensive operators feels the need to
nickel-and-dime its customers like this
it seems especially picky
then there's the update situation the
turbo 2 is already launching on an
outdated Android version and we're not
holding our breath for marshmallow
anytime soon not after it took the first
turbo a half a year to get promoted to
lollipop once you get past this stuff
the turbo 2 software is vintage Motorola
just pull the phone from a pocket and
motor display will show you your waitin
notifications raise it to your ear and
moto voice will automatically come on so
you can tell the phone to do anything
from calling your brother to setting an
alarm or if you don't have a hand freak
call out to it with your custom key
phrase gutentag hair turbo and you can
get it to do your bidding without laying
a finger on it what's the forecast for
Saturday if someone texts you while
you're driving the phone will dictate
the message to you and let you reply by
voice and yes the turbo 2 also offers
the chop-chop hand gesture for quick
access to the flashlight and the wrist
twist shortcut to fire up the camera the
same simple utility defines the camera
software
which is again identical to that of the
Moto X pure edition if you aim the
camera at a barcode or a QR code it will
provide a link to open the browser take
a flurry of burst shots and the phone
will offer its suggestion for which one
is the best the camera hardware is
identical to the pure editions to a 21
megapixel Sony sensor and performance is
right in line with its cousin
there's no optical stabilization so a
steady hand is necessary when shooting
especially in low-light where an
automatic night mode kicks in to
brighten things up a bit you'll still
get better night captures on Google's
Newton excesses but the turbo 2 does
better than most Motorola phones in
low-light and its HDR mode brings
highlights to the shadows without
washing everything out selfies taken
with the 5 megapixel front-facing camera
are also quite nice and at night you've
got a front-facing flash to help out as
well video has its highs and lows on the
bright side you've got excellent digital
stabilization when shooting in 4k and if
you've got a microSD card you don't need
to worry about wasting space because of
the phone's storage expansion but the
lack of higher frame rate options means
fast pans are pretty blurry and there's
plenty of digital noise when shooting
indoors even in brightly lit areas on
the whole the droid turbo 2 packs a
serviceable set of cameras it's not the
best camera phone on Android but it's
better than Motorola has managed in the
past and for most folks it'll be more
than enough
while the turbo 2 offers Motorola's
typical water resistance it packs no
impact resistance rating of any kind at
least none that the company has
mentioned so in addition to scratching
up the display our repeated drops have
damaged the phone's speakers making them
sound tinny and horrible that's a shame
but keep in mind that the damage
happened after repeated
worst-case-scenario drops a lesser phone
would probably have come away with
broken speakers too and a shattered
display to boot
generally speaking the phone does well
in day to day use the SIM stayed firmly
seated in its slot no matter how hard we
dropped the phone the Adreno 420 GPU
kept up with us in asphalt 8 the
Snapdragon 810 didn't stutter when
scrolling pages in chrome and the three
gigs
Ram let us shuffle between open apps
with a plum we were quite pleased with
Verizon's network performance - we spent
much of our first day with the phone
using it as a mobile hotspot from the
heart of Manhattan to the middle of
Amtrak's notoriously barren Northeast
Corridor big red only stumbled in the
deep boonies with few exceptions voice
calls went through as they should the
reception was never an issue in Greater
Boston Verizon Wireless may be expensive
but you sure do get your money's worth
that kind of performance takes a ton of
energy so the droid turbo 2 comes with a
boatload of battery power in our case it
was enough to take us through 16 hours
of moderate usage with five hours of
screen on time on one occasion the
heaviest of users will still need to top
up throughout the day of course and the
droid turbo 2 comes with a very fast 25
watt charger right in the box
if like us you find cables so 20th
century you'll be happy to know that the
turbo 2 has both Qi and PM a wireless
charging built right in the droid turbo
2 went on sale yesterday for 624 dollars
in its 32 gig configuration or 720 for
the 64 gig trim more expensive version
comes with a bonus - if you get tired of
your phone at any time within two years
of purchase Motorola will let you
exchange it for an entirely new droid
turbo - with a new design that's pretty
cool
still those are some mighty steep prices
when you consider that the Moto X pure
Edition comes with almost as much power
for about $200 less so the Droid turbo -
isn't for unlocked phone shoppers or
deal hunters it's for a class of
customer will call the Verizon lifer the
loyal subscriber who knows that he or
she is going to be with big red for the
next two years at least and wants a
high-end phone to last the duration a
two-year installment pricing the Droid
turbo - maxes out of 30 bucks a month
pricey but doable the kind of customer
who can afford Verizon in the first
place in exchange they get high-end
specs clever feature set
one of the biggest batteries around and
a display that's basically impossible to
shatter it's still too expensive if you
ask
but if you've got the money and you know
you're going to be on Verizon for the
foreseeable future there are few phones
that offer this level of power in more
ways than one and just be sure to factor
in the cost of a replacement screen
protector you're probably going to need
one if you want more info on the turbo
