couple of you have asked if you can run
the older launcher apps like launcher
pro an ADW launcher on a phone running
ice cream sandwich that's a good
question so let's go take a look this is
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus it is a running
ice cream sandwich which is Android 4.0
and one of the main things that comes
new with is this a new launcher now what
I mean by launcher is your home screens
that holds your app shortcuts and your
widgets and also your app drawer which
in this case is this new horizontal
paginate adverse and it also has nice
little previews of your widgets and a
quick launch over to get it to your
market so you can buy or download new
apps so a few things we don't like about
this well this is kind of ubiquitous
it's everywhere and it doesn't need to
be the Google search bar we've shown you
in previous videos and articles how you
can get rid of that but it's not really
ideal another launcher app can get rid
of that easily for you and that's really
what we're going to talk about today
another thing people haven't liked is
there's a little bit of lag here in
switching screens which just is kind of
slow and not fluid it still works it
looks nice but for some of us we want to
be able to speed that up in the past
we've also done that with custom
launchers to custom launchers in
particular ADW launcher and launcher pro
now you'll notice this is the e x
version the e x version is a little bit
higher end than the free adw.launcher
version which by the way comes
pre-installed as the default launcher on
the majority of cyanogenmod roms at
least the recent ones and of course
launcher pro that we like so let's go
ahead and take a look there are really
two questions here one is can you run
them and two does it look good on this
larger screen so let's answer both of
those atw launch or e x you can see we
have our stock search widget there no
more the the ubiquitous ubiquitous
widget
that kind of sits across the top if you
notice I've got my nice little
animations to to roll the screens in and
I can choose which transitions I want
it's no more of this one size fits all
there isn't a grid to drop things on
with a little plus signs but if you can
see the little blue highlight behind
adw.launcher does its best to try and
imply that little grid not quite as
smooth as the default ice cream launcher
our ice cream sandwich launcher but it
still is a good job your app drawer you
can change how it looks I've set this to
be a horizontal paginate it so it's very
close to what the Ice Cream Sandwich
launcher is like but still very fluid
very fast you can customize what you
have down here and if we take a look at
this we'll go ahead and put books out
here you can even drop them together and
make folders that look very very much
like the Ice Cream Sandwich launch your
folders so very nice very handy very
easy to use and you have all of the
benefits of adw.launcher at your
fingertips you'll also notice you have a
menu button down here so you can get
into that and jump right into your
settings that's the system settings or
the ADW settings which let you do a
whole bunch of things let's go ahead
before we go to launcherpro if you
notice this is a much larger screen but
it works very very well I there's no
resolution problems or anything at all
like that so really cool let's go to
launcherpro open this up and of course
if we want to pick one by default we put
the check box right there to say use
this for the default home action from
now on since i'm showing you these i'm
not checking that but you could do that
launcherpro also looks pretty much the
same as what we're used to it works well
you can theme your tray down at the
bottom just like you could with other
versions your app drawer is still very
responsive you don't have the widgets in
it like you do with the the launcher pro
but if you tap and hold it's right there
it's the same thing that you're used to
in accustomed to and it works just great
also you've got the menu button down
there at the bottom so not all of the
been
fits and all of the features that the
new launcher from ice cream sandwich has
but it's fast it's slick it's what
you're used to and really can do some
other cool things like those page
transitions when you're switching around
on the home screen both of them work
well on the larger 720p screen of the
galaxy nexus and both of them are fast
and responsive so I hope that's answered
the question for you can older
gingerbread or froyo launchers work on
an Ice Cream Sandwich phone absolutely
do they work on the larger screen size
yes they do as well and I can only hope
and really I expect that both ADW
launcher and launcherpro will start
adding in some of the new ice cream
sandwich features that we've seen in the
launcher and make their their launchers
even better one questions left to remain
we know that there's hardware
acceleration behind ice cream sandwich
is that hardware acceleration built into
the launcher as well yes it is is it
built into launcherpro an ADW launcher
ii x i don't know i wasn't able to find
that answer out so if you know please
let us know down in the comments of
course if you like seeing this kind of
stuff make sure you give the video a big
thumbs up tell your friends about it and
head over to pocketnow.com so you can
read the right up on this video and see

only android but other smartphones as
