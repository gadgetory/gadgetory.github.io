interesting the company claims the
general smartphone sales are down
because the wow factor is gone the
strategy with the tennis to challenge
that and it's time to see if all the
obsession walks the talk I'm home it
away that I with pocket now when this is
our review of the HTC 10 if tennis for
perfection then a very tall order is
being placed on the HTC ten the company
has come a long way to reinvent itself
and some products would even make you
believe that it got lost in the process
the ten is the company's new proposition
towards an obsession it's been teasing
for weeks and so far it seems that it
has paid off the hardware story is a
clear indication of the HTC we remember
the sandblasted aluminum feels
incredibly solid in the hand the shan
furred edges might have stirred a lot of
concern in the leaks but there is not a
single rough edge around the phone and
the light reflection they generate is
just gorgeous
a sheet of 2.5 d Gorilla Glass 3 that
insensate s-- the finish at the top with
elements like a matte fingerprint
scanner only helping it stand out aside
buttons are also quicker than past
iterations and the firm feel just
extends to the removable trays on the
sides this phone is a beauty in looks
and feels like a product that would
definitely withstand the beating the
story doesn't end there the 10 is
actually IP 53 water-resistant it may
not be enough to get this phone
submerged but it should come in handy if
you're caught in the rain for example
dazzling the view is a 5.2 inch Super
LCD 5 that's now quad HD in resolution
that's what every LCD blacks aren't the
deepest but this is probably the best
LCD display I've seen in years
color accuracy is top-notch and the
brightness is good enough for direct
sunlight HD see also decided to return
two capacitive keys at the bottom
meaning the display is fully used for
content consumption the buttons include
a software tweak that allows you to
toggle the
menu when hard-pressed and you can also
set these to remain active along with
the display other changes sadly included
the miss of HTC's famous IR blaster
which is now replaced by a headphone
jack mounted at the top or better for
worse and what we're talking audio the
most interesting change came with the
approach to boom sound we have a built
in back for studio quality 24-bit high
res audio but instead of two front
firing speakers we get a tweeter at the
top and then a woofer at the bottom
sound this very crisp though loudness
depends on the content or you'll
probably notice the theater mode isn't
as loud for YouTube than the music mode
for whenever you're playing audio still
what I love most is that covering the
speakers won't muffle the audio
something that's completely rare for a
smart phone Bridge sound continues to
support Dolby audio it now extends to
enhance applications on a system-wide
level you can even set personal audio
profiles when using headphones
sadly us customers won't receive the
high res audio headphones in the box
which I highly suggest you give a try
powering the show is a snapdragon 820
processor match with four gigs of ram
and 32 gigs of storage that's expandable
via microSD there are some interesting
tweaks to the display to improve
responsiveness and software enhancements
even boost launch times the result is a
very fluid experience with a phone that
hasn't bogged down even with the 160
applications loaded the same experience
extends the graphics intensive games
with fast load times and speedy
performance all around the aluminum does
get a little warm after the first 10
minutes of gameplay but nothing that
would really hinder the experience
overall the HTC that spent two years
cutting corners is now gone by now you
probably notice that there is no such
thing as compromising Hardware all
around
since we started talking about software
let's just say that a lot has changed
if you dig within the settings you won't
even find the version of cents HTC is
calling this a unified and polish user
experience and has joined forces with
Google to fight fragmentation it starts
with eliminating bloat HTC has decided
to ditch duplicates in software and pick
the best of both worlds when compared to
stock Android so instead of two calendar
applications there's just Google
Calendar instead of two camera
applications there's just the HTC camera
instead of two galleries there's just
Google photos we like that HTC kept the
launcher since it continues to be one of
the most polished and includes the best
widgets in addition to great theming
capabilities the company does need to
take a full step into improving its use
of quantity with a denser grid of icons
in the homescreen instead we see a new
freestyle theme that lets you toggle
elements within as app launchers you can
also place app icons anywhere you want
the idea is rather good but only my kids
actually like the existing themes
blinkfeed is back with faster responsive
times but if it's not your thing don't
worry it's still removable HTC Connect
has also received some interesting
enhancements by supporting Apple's
AirPlay out of the box first we've ever
seen in Android now even with the
launcher being HTC apps have also
adopted a closer look to material design
which we actually praised as it unifies
the experience across HTC and Google
Apps but the company's commitment to 15
days of software updates the new change
only makes the process easier for the
team to change it
HTC also includes a new boost plus
service that should be available for all
Android phones very soon in a nutshell
it helps you quickly boost your phone's
performance by eliminating bloat and the
necessary cash in a few seconds
something very useful to complement the
software or the company continues to
support lockscreen gestures and there's
a new ice view case that takes full
advantage of them the back is now a more
flexible silicone making it easier to
play some remove and instead of the
funky dot matrix icons things are now
easier to read
double slide down and you're greeted by
the camera viewfinder which then boosts
the display for visibility on your photo
we've tested the HTC ten for nine days
in New York City as with previous
devices phone calls are solid through
the earpiece and speakers just make the
experience better beta speeds on AT&amp;amp;T
sadly depend on where you are but this
phone is really good at retaining
wireless signals in the toughest of
places a company claims up the two days
of battery life but we didn't have
really high hopes for the three thousand
milliamp hour power pack know the
results then though is far but they were
above average with a solid 24 hours of
use before the phone called it quits and
four and a half hours of screen on time
even better the charger bundled in the
box is now capable of quick charge 3.0
going from zero to full in a little more
than an hour the camera experience is
where things are almost there
HTC has spent years calling its camera
revolutionary but with specifications
that didn't really meet the standard
today hardware is finally there thanks
to a 12 ultra pixel camera with F 1.8
aperture and optical image stabilization
by ultra pixel we mean that each pixel
is of 1.5 5 microns and three times
faster focusing that its predecessor
photos during the day are gorgeous with
deep color saturation and contrast the
new user interface is simplistic and
includes quick access to different modes
that include a pro feature for full
manual controls the only problem is
actually something that HTC can fix the
software seems to need a little more
tweaking in the focusing front the
system acknowledges focus through a
green indicator and sound but the camera
hasn't really focused 50 percent of the
time during the day this isn't really a
problem but during the night it does
fumble a lot
that being said we received two software
updates during our review period and the
camera has become very snappy at night
the selfie five megapixel shooter is
also of 1.34 microns as well all tucked
under an 86 degree wide angle lens the
results are great and that's mainly
because this is the first selfie camera
to include optical image stabilization
as well that combo of stabilization is
clearly evident in video this would be
the perfect vlogging camera thanks to
that and even though stabilization isn't
as aggressive as the galaxy s7 it
performs far better than average overall
when it comes to the camera the hardware
is here all it needs is a little more
software tweaking for it to reach a
perfect 10 to conclude it would be best
if we reference HTC's plan with this
phone calling this a perfect tennis
objective as needs vary per user what I
do know is that this is not only the
best HTC phone I've used but also one of
the best I've reviewed this year HTC has
clearly gone back to the drawing board
and has returned with a product that
points to a company that's obsessed with
quality for those of you that stayed
away from HTC products for the last few
years on the argument of compromise I'm
glad to report that those days are over
the HTC ten is a great smartphone and
one that I would highly recommend you
