on the edge with its launch of the Note
edge last year you're no longer
obligated to choose a family for this
added feature
I'm hematuria Valley with pocket now
here at MWC 2015 in Barcelona and let's
quickly compare the Galaxy s6 edge
versus the Galaxy Note edge the Galaxy
Note edge hasn't necessarily taken the
world by storm and that's probably
because a single edge on the display
doesn't necessarily make the phone look
any more elegant than its note 4
counterpart the galaxy s6 edge is
clearly samsung's way to prove that it's
technology has matured but that depends
on who you ask
visually these devices can be more
different the Note edge is Samsung's
best example of a device that's
transitioning the old with the new
for example the galaxy s6 edges design
actually makes it look thinner in the
hand that you think where the edge on
the note only makes it look like a beast
while we do have aluminum in the trim of
the Galaxy Note edge its back is still
plastic though that adds the benefit of
a replaceable battery in removable
storage this is more of a workhorse than
compared to the galaxy s6 edge which
drops power user features like these but
compensates with a more elegant glass
and aluminum construction wireless
charging and even a more reliable
fingerprint scanner when it comes to
hardware these devices are dramatically
different the galaxy s6 edge sports a
more modern 64-bit processor and even
though it has four inches less in its
display that actually accounts for more
pixel density compared to the note edge
you also have the option for 128 gigs of
storage here but the note edge even
though falling short at 64 gigs gives
you the option for expandable storage so
that's not really a story
the primary cameras are apparently the
same at 16 megapixels and optically
stabilized but the Galaxy s6 edge sports
a better F 1.9 aperture and the same can
be said about the front-facing camera
with some extra megapixels when it comes
to the six edge other than that the
galaxy s6 edge is eight millimeters
shorter 14 millimeters more narrow and
2.5 millimeters thinner than the note
edge and yes even 40 grams lighter now
since the edge is all about the enhanced
software we wonder why Samsung has
decided to scale down what the edge can
do with the galaxy s6 edge on the note
variant the edge is consistently
available for notifications app
shortcuts settings and a ton of other
options where on the galaxy s6 edge it
becomes more of a hidden feature that
only works with the displays off or in
certain usage scenarios like calling
favorite contacts or other gestures yes
you are running Android 5.0 lollipop on
the galaxy s6 edge compared to KitKat
but that should change soon even though
Samsung is not famous reporting newer
features on older devices it could be
that Samsung has learned that people
don't really care about the edge
features of the note but we'll learn
more when we get our full comparison
when our review unit arrives we're
especially curious on testing the added
durability of the galaxy s6 is aluminum
over time which was claimed in samsung's
event mainly because of the Shatford
edges on the note looked terrible right
now there's more to come from MWC 2015
so please follow us on social media
subscribe to youtube channel as well you
can follow us on Twitter in the links of
the description again I'm Jaime to be
better front pocket now thank you very
much for watching we've got more to come
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
