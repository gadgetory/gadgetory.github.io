pocketnow.com so I've gotten some files
that have allowed us to get a lot deeper
into the windows phone 7 series emulator
than we were able to get before so we're
going to have a series of videos here
that cover a variety of aspects of
Windows Phone 7 series to start we're
going to talk about some of the Pym
applications like outlook and the
calendar then we're going to dig into
the settings we're going to talk about
the multimedia and also go through
Office Mobile because on this emulator
there are versions of Word PowerPoint
Excel and one note that we haven't
really seen before in depth so let's get
started here we have just the basic
unlock screen it says film pocketnow.com
videos here because that is my next
calendar appointment so you get a little
bit of information here we can slide up
to unlock and I added a password here
just to show you that you can do that
1234 quite simply and now we are on our
Start screen which is of course very
customizable and we talked about this in
a previous video so if you want to move
something around you simply tap and hold
it and then you can move it around or
press the broken heart if you don't want
it anymore furthermore you can tap and
hold anywhere in the background on the
Start screen and be able to rearrange
really anything ok so let's go through
some of these things I set up my
microsoft exchange account on this
emulator but it doesn't work and i think
that will go for other email accounts as
well so i'm going to go into my email
just to show you the email application a
little bit more than we've seen it
before so to start we have this pivot
list at the top we can filter by urgent
or unread or all unread i'm really
looking forward to being able to quickly
filter by my unread messages only so i
can get everything out of the way that
I've seen before so we have a few
buttons along the bottom that we can
play around with we have plus to add a
new message we have the folder to look
at our folders and synchronize but I try
to sync my mail you can see at the top
is through that sort of pop down
notification the toaster notification it
says it cannot connect so we're not
going to try that again so I'm going to
press the plus button here to make a new
email I'm going to going to email myself
of course it won't work
because it's not set up properly put a
subject and say hey and then we can type
hey this is a test now there's a few
things we can do within an email we can
send it down here we can add an
attachment and take a look at this
Microsoft is working on a new attachment
manager which should make it easier to
add attachments it's being a little bit
slow right now but hopefully it'll come
up in a second we go back okay let me
try that again so it doesn't look like
the attachment picker is working but
what you get is a little dialog box that
says attachment picker coming soon so
presumably Microsoft is working on a
really easy way to add attachments we
can go down to the application bar and
hit these three buttons to get some more
options so we can show a carbon copy and
blind carbon copy quite simply and
easily and we can also change the
priority of a message to make it urgent
or normal and again some of these things
don't work all of the time this is an
emulator you saw sort of pop up for a
second I'm going to discard this message
and it's going to want to save it as
draft although again a lot of this isn't
working right now we can go to our
folder list and see sort of that we have
one draft waiting which is the email
message that we just started we can go
back to the inbox very nice way to look
at your email let's take a look at the
other settings we have here so we can go
to settings for this email and you can
see that it is using its using my email
account on my exchange server so if I
click server and sync settings it'll
show me all of my settings although
again it doesn't work from here we can
change our email signature and by
default it says sent from my windows
phone presumably there are going to be
more settings here hopefully once this
application gets finished so that was a
quick look at the the email application
we can also add a new email account from
here and here's a look at really what
Microsoft is working with out of the
gate for email so we can do facebook
yahoo other pop3 accounts and Windows
Live which includes you know Xbox Live
Messenger and hotmail so let's go back
to the start screen and take a look at
some other applications let's go into
messaging this is actually your text
messaging applique
and obviously we can't send a text
message to a real person but we can sort
of pretend so if i press the plus button
down here i can say i can type in a
phone number or i can just press the
plus button here which should query into
my address book although it doesn't seem
to be working right now and i could say
you know hey and press the send button
down here or i can attach a picture and
we get this very simple nice-looking
sort of bubbly like text message and
take a look at this this is a pop-up
notification that is a little bit
interruptive a little bit too much for
my taste and so you a calendar reminder
that you can either snooze or dismiss i
put something in the calendar earlier
before i made this video and that's why
it's doing that somebody hit dismiss and
we can clear the message from here now
the back button works really strangely
and we're going to talk more about that
in a future video sometimes it goes back
to a previous screen sometimes it jumps
back to a previous application so
something to get used to and here we can
actually go into text message settings
and it says SMS center number delivery
confirmation on or off so very simple
stuff let's go back to the start screen
and talk about the calendar before
wrapping up this video before we jump
into another one so let's go into the
calendar and i'm going to make a new
appointment at 11am and you can see the
out outlook and you can see sort of the
layout of this is very simplistic so we
can say film another video we can scroll
down account so you can switch between
my microsoft exchange account and the
device store meaning the actual data on
the device what this will allow you to
do is select which calendar this is
going to the calendar on Windows Phone 7
series is very good at managing multiple
multiple calendars so we can scroll down
we can click on more details and orange
there and we can change the reminder we
can change if we're busy add some notes
I'm going to click done because I want
to show you something to go back to the
start screen and now in the little
calendar tile we say we see it's been
updated to show me my next appointment
so very very handy there
let's quickly jump back into the
calendar to show you the other settings
so we can go into the different views by
swiping to the right up here we can go
into agenda view or debut and then we
can jump into the sort of zoomed out
nice-looking the month view and I think
you can sweat to the right to go to the
next month let's see whoops moved it off
the screen there doesn't look like that
is working so let's go to the back
button and we can click on here to
manage calendars where we can set the
color for different types of calendars
so if you have a facebook calendar and
exchange calendar and a calendar right
on your device can specify color for all
of these things so you don't get them
mixed up so that was a look at some of
the pim functions on windows phone 7
series I've got a lot more coverage
coming up a lot more video walkthroughs
of this new image that we have running
in our emulator so be sure to subscribe

the next one hits that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
