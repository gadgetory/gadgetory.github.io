market with full force of late I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
this is the LG optimus g pro versus the
google nexus for LG is dead settle
making a name for itself in the upper
end of the smartphone market winning
over the hearts of everyone and
replicating the success of a device like
the galaxy s3 by samsung it has created
high-end smartphones of its own such as
the optimus G and a high-end Nexus phone
to be sold and branded by Google and now
it's reaching into the phablet category
to give the Galaxy Note 2 some stiff
competition but side by side with its
relatively close sibling these two
devices have next to nothing in common
the google nexus 4 was a device built
upon the openness of android offering
the purest google experience in a
smartphone the LG optimus g pro is a
direct galaxy note 2 competitor and
shows how uninspired LG design can be at
times
although manufactured by the same
company the optimus g pro and the nexus
4 offered two totally different
experiences and target two totally
different types of consumers the first
of these major differences is design
when it was originally announced the
Nexus 4 was revealed to be a near Galaxy
Nexus look alike it features the same
shape about the same size and similar
button import placement it's 4.7 inch
display lends to its modest size and the
build quality for a $300 phone no less
is superb the soft touch plastic around
the edges gives it a grippy feel and the
glass slab around back gives it a touch
of premium quality in terms of design
and build quality there is little to
complain about with the Nexus 4 except
for maybe the fragile glass around back
which is pretty easily remedied the
optimus g pro is an entirely different
story think samsung build quality and
over use of cheap plastics didn't think
of a device filling even more cheap and
insubstantial its large stature is not
complimented by the expected heft its
back unlike the nexus 4 Optimus G is all
plastic the trim around the outer edge
is plastic a faux brushed metal asino
mini Samsung Galaxy devices and it
features a physical home button flanked
by two capacitive buttons for back and
menu another samsung feature with a
glass back on the Nexus 4 means the
battery is integrated non-removable the
plastic battery door in the optimus g
pro allows for popping in a spare
battery that is one of the few benefits
of a plastic device one feature that
cannot go unmentioned is the display the
optimus g pro features a giant 5.5 inch
display with a monster resolution of
1920 x 1080 pixels a density of 401
pixels per inch the display on the Nexus
4 is a 4.7 inch 720p panel the
difference is noticeable the picture on
the optimus g pro is noticeably sharper
and colors tend to pop a little more
which is likely due to the poor
calibration on the Nexus 4's display but
the differences in these panels are not
terribly dramatic considering the nexus
4 still has a relatively high pixel
density at 318 pixels per inch the true
reason why the display matters so much
on these devices is well sighs the 4.7
inch display on the nexus 4 makes it a
much more manageable device particularly
for one-handed use I can easily slip it
in and out of my pocket and use the
device with one hand without a problem
the 5.5 inch display on the optimus G
pro makes it noticeably more unwieldy
especially for anything but two-handed
use it's 69 aspect ratio makes the
display quite tall and narrow and it
forces the user to stretch their thumbs
and kills any hope of touching all four
corners without choking up an adjusting
grip this is one of the largest if not
the largest determining factors between
these two smartphones other than that
however we're left with a host of
specification differences the Nexus 4
comes with a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM either eight or 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage with no option for
expansion an 8 megapixel camera a 2100
milliamp hour battery and HSPA+
connectivity the optimus g pro features
a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core snapdragon 600
chipset 2 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes
of built-in storage a microSD card slot
for expansion 13.1 megapixel camera 30
140 million power battery and HSPA+ and
LTE connectivity so the band support is
quite limited on this korean model both
also feature Wi-Fi b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0
NFC and wireless charging strictly in
terms of build quality and design the
Nexus 4 wins hands down it's hard to
believe these two devices were
manufactured by the same company at
least on paper the optimus g pro has the
advantage in display density and
resolution horsepower storage and
connectivity there next to no
compromises with LG's phablet unless you
consider mediocre build quality a
compromise once you've dig into the
software the differences continue to
pile up Google's precious Nexus 4 is as
pure as fear gets updates come directly
from Google pure unadulterated Android
exactly as it was intended look and feel
the home screens settings application
notification shade and recent apps
function are all clean and unified the
software on the optimus g pro is
entirely the opposite of that it appears
to be inspired bred nature not unlike
Samsung's TouchWiz nature UX
incorporating nature wallpapers and even
nature inspired elements like a water
droplet lockscreen animation
every element from the home screen and
the icons to the settings application
has been heavily themed and customized
the Settings app for example is tabbed
and divided into four subsections
networks sound display and general and
the interface elements are pulled in all
different directions the notification
shade is various shades of grey with
light blue accents the tabs in the
Settings app or the same gray with the
same blue accent but the rest is white
unlike anything else in the UI and the
tabs within the application drawer are a
similar grey but they're textured on top
of all that the nexus 4 comes with only
the essentials pre-installed the
absolute bare minimum you will ever see
on any Android software excluding
customized roms the optimus g pro comes
with a staggering 83 applications
pre-installed that number of course
includes the essentials such as camera
the dialer contacts but those are only a
fraction of the preinstalled
applications LG has included practically
everything under the Sun out of the box
q translator me chat smart wallet and a
host of other applications and services
and only some of these can be
uninstalled the upside is that LG sulfur
does bring some benefits such as qslide
apps which are miniature applications or
calendar calculator memo internet etc
that hover atop other applications for
an extensive multitasking experience it
also has quiet time not unlike Samsung's
blocking mode if you're in search of a
nice solid consistent experience neither
phone will disappoint the Nexus 4 is
bare bones by nature and leaves the
customization entirely to the user the
optimus g pro on the other hand comes
with everything shy of the kitchen sink
preloaded with a few unique features
performance it's an area neither of
these two smartphone shy away from
although the Nexus 4 is sporting last
year's Qualcomm chipset the Snapdragon
s4 pro it's certainly more than capable
of handling the common everyday tasks
and even most of the more laborious ones
using synthetic benchmarks the optimus g
pro is the clear winner using n22 the
optimus g pro consistently scored around
20,000 though the nexus 4 still averaged
a respectable 17,000 and in the quadrant
standard test the optimus g pro managed
an impressive 12 thousand give or take
while the next is for averaged around
4500 but those are only benchmarks which
hardly translate to real world
performance the Nexus 4 in the optimus g
pro sliced through the normal workload
like butter and in most cases gaming is
a pleasure though there are some games
we found that slow the Nexus 4 down just
a bit
battery life is unfortunately still an
unknown on the optimus g pro as it just
arrived yesterday inside the Nexus 4 has
a 2100 milliamp hour battery that
usually lasts most a day but if you have
evening plans that's not a bad idea to
charge up before heading out the optimus
g pro has a monster thirty one hundred
million power battery inside and while
the stamina seems pretty great so far
it's too soon to tell for sure the
benefit however is the ability to swap
out batteries with the optimus g pro its
battery door is removable and the korean
model at least comes with a spare
battery in a battery charger effectively
doubling the battery life finally
cameras neither the optimus g pro or the
nexus 4 feature particularly amazing
cameras both tend to produce washed out
images that miss a ton of details the
optimus g pro has a clear advantage in
the terms of output size at 13
megapixels versus the nexus 4 is 8
megapixels and the optimus g pro manages
to produce more accurate images with
truer to life colors the nexus 4 tends
to overexpose more easily and creates
warmer images particularly light images
seem to have a pink cue to them while
the optimus g pro seems more balanced
although neither camera is incredibly
impressive but to get the job done
fairly well at the end of the day the
optimus g pro nexus 4 although both
manufactured by LG are starkly different
devices and design hardware use and as
overall products
optimus g pro is geared towards
consumers seeking a device that comes
with as few compromises as possible
while the Nexus 4 is meant for people
who are okay with making some sacrifices
for a price the nexus 4 was never the
best device on paper but it has always
been the best in terms of value the
optimus g pro will appeal to those
looking for an extra large device such
as the Galaxy Note 2 with 2013
specifications and the Nexus 4 will
continue to appeal to those looking to
save a buck while still getting a
fantastic device thanks for watching and
