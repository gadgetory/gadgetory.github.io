I kind of feel bad for Sony our coverage
of the Xperia line got crazy out of
order but now that we're back from the
excitement and the announcements over
the Galaxy Note 7 we're coming back to
spend a little time with the xperia x
performance this year for Sony really
has been an expanding conversation on
the lineup of phones that we're going to
be playing with we put out a full review
on that sort of mid point Xperia X but
we held off on a number of things that
we wanted to test with their
top-of-the-line device the X performance
namely our real camera review and those
speaker and headphone benchmarks and
we've been trying to incorporate in more
of our reviews along the way we're
really trying to make sure we do our due
diligence with this manufacturer Sony as
a brand kind of walked away from the
United States they kind of limping back
into this area of the world with
unlocked devices sold directly to
consumers no carrier relationships to
really make sure these things show up on
store shelves as I mentioned in our
first impressions video on the X
performance I was really expecting a few
more differences between this and the
regular Xperia AX
I've been using it for the last couple
days and it does feel like a very
similar phone there is a little extra
horsepower we move from a welcome 652 to
a welcome 820 so so that's nice that's
progress
the tiny little battery bump has been
non-existent in terms of real world
usage I see no benefits from that an
additional runtime during the day and I
was really hoping for an expanded
feature set out of this camera it's a
similar camera sensor but with the extra
horsepower from the Qualcomm 820 I was
thinking oh maybe we'll finally get UHD
video we're h.265 compression or
something that we would really identify
with Sony as a camera manufacturer
finally making its way into their phones
and no it's all pretty much the same
experience there to you max out at 1080p
60 frames per second for video you've
got that 23 megapixel sensor but it's
really designed to pump out eight
megapixel downsampled images to really
kind of mess with the the exposure and
noise reduction in the filtering that
goes into producing a nice crisp image
you get great shots out of it but that
doesn't feel like you're really getting
everything that that experience only
brand can bring to the table in the past
we've been able to celebrate the fit
finish of Sony devices and I just don't
have that same kind of love for the
Xperia X that I had for the Xperia Z
line of phones that came before it I
mean sure it's an attractive device
I think Sony style is on point I love
this sort of monolith slab of device
it's very angular it's very sharp it's
very precise and it is this brushed
metal exterior I think it looks cool it
feels nice in the hand like so many
other youtubers have generically
commented on a number of phones that
have come out recently but I don't feel
like there's that same attention to
detail that we've seen on previous Sony
devices there's there's a little bowing
on the side panel here by the SIM card a
SIM card tray mind you which ii you pull
it out because there's no pin tool door
you just stick a thumbnail in there the
phone automatically reboots which is
really frustrating if you have to swap
cards back and forth I'd love to be able
to hot swap a SIM card on a Sony phone
but the bowing here does actually pull
out with the SIM card tray that's a bit
uncommon for Sony and we would expect a
higher level of quality assurance in the
manufacturing on a phone which is priced
to go up against top-tier Android
manufacturers from around the world and
just generally with my tiny little
Hobbit hands I do like going back to a
5-inch screen but the way that the
borders and corners and angles are sort
of shaped on this phone it doesn't
really feel any smaller in the hand than
when I'm trying to go one-handed with a
galaxy s7 for example I think I have
about the same quality of reach even
with my little stumpy thumb here that's
ultimately where I end up in something
of a gadget fan quandary like I really
want to like this phone I really want to
like what Sony brings to the table
especially the success they've had with
the PlayStation brand there their line
of mirrorless cameras is phenomenal and
I think they are putting out some really
attractive phones but phones that are
struggling to compete with the other
devices out there in the ecosystem
especially at the price points at Sony's
commanding with every device we want to
find that one unique hook that the
manufacturer can supply that they can do
better than anybody else and you would
think it would be camera tech that every
phone out there has a Sony sensor in it
and Sony's own products don't seem to
benefit from that manufacturing prowess
but that leaves me with a question for
you out there in the audience now
normally for a real camera
review we shoot at the highest possible
video quality from the phone and then
try and mix that up with a you HD or 4k
quality video that gets blasted out to
YouTube so this phone maxes out at 1080p
at 60 frames per second so I'm throwing
it out there to the audience and how we
should wrap up the real camera review
for the Sony Xperia X performance should
we shoot 1080p at 60 frames per second
and put up a video at 1080p 60 frames
per second or should we maybe scale that
back to 1080p at 30 frames per second
knowing that the video quality is
probably not going to be radically
different there and then upload a UHD
quality video so that you can see better
the photo quality coming from these
eight megapixel downsampled images off
of the 23 megapixel camera sensor I have
a little viewer poll that just slid out
on the top of this video voting that I'm
going to look over the next couple days
see what you guys say and that's how
we'll finish up the real camera review
for the Sony Xperia X performance we'll
have more to report on the Xperia X
performance soon so be on the lookout
for that we've got some comparisons that
are going to come out alongside the full
review and the real camera review as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more fun tech diary video entries like
these we're trying to mix it up a little
have a little fun with how we talk about
our gadget feelings pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now you can catch me on
Twitter and Instagram has some gadget
guy and I will catch you all on the next
video
