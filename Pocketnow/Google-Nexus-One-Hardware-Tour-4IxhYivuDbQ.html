pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the Google Nexus One made by HTC
this is a Google Android device that's
running 2.1 which is Eclair in this
video we're going to talk about the
specifications of the Nexus One and also
compare the hardware to the iPhone and
the HTC hd2 so to start the device has a
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor running at
one gigahertz just like the HTC hd2 it's
got 512 megabytes of ROM for storage in
addition it comes with a class 2 4
gigabyte microSD card which is a lot of
memory and it's really great that they
throw that in of course that's
expandable it also is 512 megabytes of
RAM which is probably the most amount of
RAM that we've seen yet on a mobile
device the HTC hd2 had a tremendous 448
megabytes of RAM but it looks like the
Nexus One has even more it's got a 3.7
inch AMOLED display with 800 by 480
resolution that's the same resolution as
the HD 2 it's got bluetooth 2.0 Wi-Fi a
2 to 11 B and G it has 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack for audio so you don't
have to use any sort of converter it
also has a 5 megapixel camera on the
back with autofocus and it also has a
LED flash the battery is 1400 milliamp
hours which is pretty big for a device
of this type and also does a proximity
sensor a light sensor a G sensor and a
digital compass so let's take a look at
the hardware of the Nexus One it comes
in this pouch which isn't leather it's
kind of a vinyl material has a little
Android logo on the front
it adds considerably to the depth of the
device the device is quite thin at
eleven point five millimeters so let's
take out the device something that's
great about the Nexus One is that it is
not a fingerprint magnet the back is
covered with this sort of rubbery
coating and the front has what appears
to be an anti oil coating like you'll
find on the iPhone and on the hd2 so you
really don't get many fingerprints on
the display which is really fantastic so
as mentioned the displays 3.7 inches
diagonal compared to the iPhone that is
larger but compared to the HD 2 that is
obvious
the smaller the hd2 as a 4.3 inch screen
the resolution as mentioned is 800 down
and 480 across up here you can't really
see it behind the black but there's a
proximity sensor and a light sensor and
up here is the speaker grille going down
a little further we have a few buttons
typical of an Android device we have a
back button a menu button home and
search something I find a little bit
annoying is that when you're typing on
the keyboard oftentimes you may
accidentally press one of these buttons
because it uses capacity' a capacitive
screen sensor down here so you're
tapping lightly here and you may
accidentally press one of those just
something to watch out for down here we
have a little ball that work for kind of
like a multi-function d-pad that you can
press into select it also will glowed
various colors depending on which system
notifications are currently active you
can new email to one color if you have a
new SMS it's another color so it's very
helpful so you don't have to turn on
your device to sort of see what kind of
messages await you on this side of the
device we have a volume rocker which has
a little plus and a minus button while
we're on the side let's take a look at
the thickness of this device compared to
the iPhone it's thinner than the iPhone
but it's a little bit thicker than the
HD - only by 0.5 millimeters although
most people won't notice that difference
of thickness going over to the bottom we
have Micro USB so it'll work with all
your standard plugs then we have these
kind of it looks like a connector for
some sort of dot perhaps the dock that
will work for for the Nexus One that's
coming out soon here we have a
microphone it's one of two microphones
the other microphone helps to cut down
on noise I haven't tested that yet
nothing on the other side of the device
and on the top we have that 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a standby
button in the same location that you
find on a lot of the other HTC devices
like the the touch pro2 here which is a
really good location so tapping that
brings you to the unlock screen nice
little screen animation turning over to
the back as mentioned we have a five
megapixel camera with LED flash here's
the speaker for the speakerphone which I
found to be not too good it distorts
quite easily unfortunately even if you
put the volume down we've got some
branding back here that says Google and
HTC in this little strip when you order
the
the Nexus 1 off of the Google website
you can get a little engraving here
which I chose not to do here's the extra
microphone for the noise cancellation
and if we take off the back battery
cover we have the microSD slot and you
can't get the microSD card out without
removing the battery which is totally
annoying and over here is the slot for
the SIM card over all in hand the device
feels high-quality it feels like it's
not going to slip out of your hand
and as I mentioned earlier best of all
it doesn't feel like a fingerprint
magnet like you would find on some other
devices that have black shiny coatings
and lots of shiny surfaces galore this
is a very nice device a very nice form
factor and it feels very light in the
pocket it slips right in it feels a lot
smaller than the iPhone even though it's
really not and it's only 3 grams less
heavy than the iPhone but for some
reason perhaps because the edges are so
rounded or because the materials aren't
shiny or something like that it just
feels really lightweight and small in
the hand which is quite nice so we've
got a lot more coming up on the Nexus
One we're gonna talk about all the
software features and the applications
and the Android experience that Google
has brought on this really interesting
and nice-looking device from Google
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
