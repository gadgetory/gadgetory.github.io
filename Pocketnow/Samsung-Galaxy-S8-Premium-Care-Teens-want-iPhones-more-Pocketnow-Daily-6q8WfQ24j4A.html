company's way to make it right for
galaxy has eight customers they've been
already working on its first proper
SmartWatch even though after some
hurdles and according to teams the
iPhone continues to be their favorite
phone
I'm hi Mary that I am that know my full
name is not bar follow me and if you
don't understand what's on this t-shirt
you missed out on my favorite movie of
all time
this is pocket out daily it's
interesting I thought that the reason
why the iPhone was so popular among
teenagers was mainly because of snapchat
but it's either the fact that snapchat
is popular with almost all teenagers or
it's just the iPhone because according
to some recent studies the official is
that I have to do with the fact that the
iPhone continues to be the most popular
smartphone among teens up to the point
where it continues to grow in number
from 75 percent to 79 percent and it
seems that I don't know let me know in
the comments do you what do you think it
is is it really snapchat I also about
shall me we have been waiting for the
next me mix and pretty much every other
smartphone but the only device making
headlines right now was the me six the
reason why is because apparently this
phone will be out on the market on April
19 which is pretty much almost the same
time as the galaxy s 8 according to the
company wants to claim the snapdragon
835 and whatever other cases maybe
xiaomi has been really aggressive lately
and hey we cannot wait to see what the
company brings next how about if we talk
about fitbit many of us are not really
happy with the acquisition of fitbit
buying pebble but then again we hear the
company wants to build its own series
SmartWatch so it makes all the sense in
the world for the company to have it
quiet double for this the problem is
that we were expecting this watch to be
announced somewhere around the early
summer and apparently it's going to
happen until the fall because it seems
that the company is struggling with
production issues and we wonder what
kind of production issues it could have
it's the largest fitness wearable
manufacturer in the world but anyways
we'll see now let's talk about Samsung
the company has not provided official
numbers as to pre-orders for the United
States said that in Korea the only thing
that the company has said officially is
that
sold a lot of them as of today that's
rather interesting I know the company
would have met expectations it would
have already provided numbers or it
could be that it's just being held by
other reasons but yeah apparently the
Galaxy s8 has pre-sold well the United
States Samsung has also mentioned that
have sold 160,000 of its special edition
units in Korea we're talking about a six
gig 128 gig variant which is sad we
don't get it in the United States but
anyways it seems that everything is off
to a good start and finally the very
interesting news they have to do with
samsung premium care the company has
just announced the service and it's
interesting because it's not necessarily
great listen to this you pay eleven
ninety-nine a month and apparently it
only covers you for one year within that
year you get three screen replacements
and each screen replacement will be 99
dollars each and apparently there are
other fees in case you need your phone
replace for any particular reason and if
you want your phone replaced
there's service 24/7 you get your phone
replaced the next day or you can walk to
specific partners that the company has
and you can get your phone replaced
immediately that's all great the
problems when you compare it to services
like Apple Care Plus for example where
you pay a hundred and sixty dollars you
get two years of warranty covered within
those two years you will get two screen
replacements or two device swaps and
then these screen replacements are
device swaps can go from $29 depending
on the device or from anywhere from 70
to 100 dollars or I believe there are
cases for 120 dollars but it's not $100
for a screen replacement you just paid
29 if that's all you're going to replace
so it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think about Samsung's
premium care do you think it's worth the
money or not in my case I think it's
kind of expensive but hey replacing
Samsung Galaxy screens is a lot more
expensive than iPhone screens so it kind
of makes sense I'm trying to be nice
here but leave us a comment down below
your opinion is more important here
