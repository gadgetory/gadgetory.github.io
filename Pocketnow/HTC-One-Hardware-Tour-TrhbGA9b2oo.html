pocket now I'm looking at the HTC One
the greasy HTC one that has been touched
by a lot of people want to take a close
look at the hardware right now something
that I want to point out knives and I
have been thinking about this for a
while since we've seen leaked shots is
the chamfered edge look at the
difference in chamfered edges there a
little bit different and yet really
they're the same both the iphone and the
HTC One have this chamfered edge both on
the frontier and on z rear now we really
hope the chamfered edge on the one is
more adorable than the iphone 5s the
iphone 5s chamfered edge is getting
destroyed at least on my iphone from
just a little bit of use let's take a
closer look we've got a proximity sensor
up here got an LED notification light
which is probably too color I'm not
multicolor unfortunately we have a wide
angle front-facing camera here we've got
relatively thick bezels there is a low
ratio of screen to phone here unlike say
they can xperia ZL for example so it
does have some bezels on it which kind
of takes away i think from the design
aesthetic but really striking how we've
got a speaker on the front or on the top
and on the bottom we haven't seen any
phone to do this yet dual stereo sound
and these speakers are pretty loud so
we've got micro drilled holes hopefully
the camera can focus we've got an
off-center micro USB port which is kind
of interesting and check this out HTC is
putting their their power standby button
on the top left that's interesting on
the sides 40 millimeters although it's
thicker kind of giving the illusion of
thinness and it is quite then on the
back we've got the ultrapixel camera
which is basically for me to four
megapixel cameras in one
and on the other side we have volume up
and down rocker unfortunately no
dedicated camera button on this guy
we're gonna have to start a petition to
get OEM stood to put a dedicated camera
button we've got two buttons down here
which are back then as you can see and
that's kind of a quick look at the
hardware because I'm the one I'm most
interested in this chamfered edge and
guys have you noticed that this is one
of the first all-metal thorns they're
saying a big pay you to Samsung who's
doing the plastic cones totally
different direction than Samsung is
going after the galaxy s4 will be
plastic which makes it light but this
aluminum design is pretty badass helping
high-quality infinitus that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
