voice is monotonous and that's actually
not a bad idea hey Jaime you always come
out with the same polos only polos just
the polos well hi men not defying is it
a Tahoe and no not interested in your
bloopers just get on with the bleeping
news would you sheesh the tech nerd here
thinks he's a Hollywood actor now and
coming from Catwoman I'll take that as a
compliment that's right it's that time
of the week I am hi Natalie that I'm
this is pocket now and this is the
parking out daily recap for last week
some when they asked you if you care
about fingerprint scanners and why as a
one plus is teasing that a fingerprint
scanner is coming to the 1+2 we have 482
comments out of which severe says I like
them because one they're cool to
security and three they are practical
and that's the case for the iphone for
example and almost every galaxy the
fingerprint scanner makes things more
practical the lazy fat man says I don't
really care for fingerprint scanners I
don't even use lock screens on my phone
and that is the case for most people but
once somebody steals your phone you're
gonna change your mind immediately trust
me an Adam chase says after using it on
my iphone it's become second nature I
think typing password seems to be
tedious task I do agree with you up to
the point that I do believe that
fingerprints are safer than passwords
how about if somebody learns your
password and please do not say how about
if somebody cuts down your finger
because that's that's Hannibal stuff on
Tuesday ask you what do you think about
Samsung's success as the company is back
to being the top number one smartphone
seller in the United States we have 590
comments out of which is 'if it says as
of right now i think samsung has the
best phone of 2015 if it wasn't for the
battery life i could probably agree with
you and Peter Robson says galaxy s6 edge
has changed my mind on never to buy a
samsung phone again now I own one and
you know after handling it at mwc and
after see a couple of friends of mine
using it I am compelled to get me one as
well another commenter says I like
Samsung success in North America because
Android is a great operating system
however under the same roof I just like
it a bit because it proves that people
still only care about the brand name
apple or Samsung and don't even consider
other
the options like Sony HTC and LG and i
agree with you particularly sony they
make such great bones and such
underrated as well on ones they ask you
how much do you currently pay for music
streaming as well we learned that Apple
pay costs differently depending on which
country you're on we have 844 comments
out of which one of them says I use
YouTube it's free well Soto I have to
pay for my internet and yeah a lot of
people just go for the freemium model
which is great and not available for
Apple music and the name says I used
Spotify in Costa Rica and I pay 899 for
to users and yeah I actually got the US
version of Spotify so even if I'm in
Guatemala I pay ten dollars and it's 15
for the family pack so lucky you dude i
just find spotify to have more music in
the united states then JC says I you
Spotify but since Apple is only charging
only two dollars for Apple music and
India I am moving to India great comment
on Thursday asked you if you would like
a non-expandable galaxy note5 as most of
the leaks claim that that is going to be
the case we have 782 comments out of
which karthik says if there's no
expandability there is no note line and
people would say that about the S Pen
but then again there's a reason why I
stick to the note lineup and it's
because of expandability I agree with
you and Travis says note on the flat
galaxy note 5 the removable battery SD
card expansion is why i bought it in the
first place and that is exactly the same
reason why I put up with such a clunky
operating system in the case of the
galaxy note edge because of
expandability and then another commoner
says no no no the Galaxy Note lineup is
the best because i love removable
battery expandable storage if it gets
removed i would have to switch to other
android phones like LG and HTC and yeah
LG and HTC I figured it out I feel that
Samsung should step up its game and
finally on Friday ask you if you would
mind the thicker iphone as the rumors
are that it's going to get the point 01
millimeter thicker because of the for
such technology we have 481 comments out
of which 9 cinema down says better
battery life which worth it not bending
it's worth it for such not worth it and
yeah I agree and big am flawless says
it's 0.1 millimeters thicker that will
make a difference in your daily life at
all and yeah I guess that's going to be
the case and that's really sad I was
expecting more for that and raising
lover says i don't care if the phone is
10 millimeters thick i want better
battery life and i think that is the
case for everyone I don't understand
this trend of thin and light it's cool
true but if you're not able to handle
the basics like battery life then I
would rather you give me a thick phone
but that's my opinion in yours as well
that's it for the pocket out daily recap
