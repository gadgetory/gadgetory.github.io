first-ever selfie was taken by a
Hasselblad camera on the moon that's a
topic for debate what is it as the
quality of the brand and how it's
reached mobile I'm high memory with
pocket now and let's talk about the
Hasselblad through zoom moto mod all of
pocket now Ziva 2016 coverage is brought
to you by XCOM global the whole concept
of moto mods has given the Moto Z lineup
a clear line of differentiation the idea
of being able to add new modules without
affecting the phone's design is genius
and we're probably holding the coolest
one now thus climber folks our own pro
photographer / senior editor Adam Lane
has already reviewed this device and
this video is just to serve some added
context for the channel juan-carlos back
male will later follow up with this
video review our Hasselblad is known for
its high quality ten thousand plus
dollar lenses and yeah that ranges
almost fifty thousand dollars in some
cases but this is a very interesting
approach in essence we're looking at a
separate BSI CMOS camera sensor of 12
megapixels and the one and 2.3 inch
sensor and each pixel is of 1.5 5
microns in addition it provides 10x
optical zoom and optical image
stabilization its fortunes own xenon
flash and there's even a dedicated
camera and power button on the top have
a look in the feel are definitely not
what we call ergonomics by smartphone
standards but if you consider what
holding a point-and-shoot camera or
would feel like this is pretty much up
there connecting this moto mod to any
moto Z will provide a new user interface
that's specific to Hasselblad to enhance
your experience even though videos
really only top 1080p as we can tell now
whether this can replace your
point-and-shoot is still a topic for
debate but the idea of just snapping it
on the back of the moto z lineup is
genius
again bulk comes with the territory but
so would a regular camera if you would
have to carry it to know if the
Hasselblad moto mod is good enough don't
forget to check Adam lanes written
review in addition to one's real camera
review

horrible roaming fees when traveling
