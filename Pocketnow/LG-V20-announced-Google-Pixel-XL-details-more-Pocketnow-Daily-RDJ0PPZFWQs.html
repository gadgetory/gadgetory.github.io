went hands-on rumors of the iphone 7.2 a
beast of a camera for video recording
and a nexus tablet from huawei might be
in the works I'm hi Mary Vanna back in
the studio and no nobody told me I could
not board the plane with my galaxy note
7 this is parking out daily
the official news today start with deals
to a certain degree those of you in the
market for a moto G the Moto G play is
now available in the United States in
various stores you'll get it for $150 we
already know the specifications it's not
a phone that will drive anybody crazy
unless you notice the Moto G play deals
that are available on Amazon where you
get the phone for up to just a hundred
bucks if you accept them as on ads and I
would totally do that other official
news have to do with the Google pixel
and the Google pixel XL those of you
that are wondering what the final names
of the next nexus smartphones would be
since the Nexus name is going to be
dropped we've got trusted sources
claiming that these are the final names
pixel and pixel XL and the other thing
that makes this a lineup of smartphones
hot is it apparently they will be
launched with Android 7 dot 1 nougat and
we cannot wait to know exactly what are
we getting here that's different to what
we got on 7 dot 0 now speaking of Nexus
devices or should I say pixel devices
there are strong rumors right now that
Huawei might be the partner to build the
company's future Nexus 7 or the
successor to the Nexus 7 now for those
of you that have been following our
coverage of Aoife we've had the huawei
mediapad m3 for a while the speakers on
that thing are incredible a display on
that thing is incredible and the future
nexus is based on that tablet it's gonna
be hot let's hope that's the case as
will the spotlight over to Apple we are
just a couple of hours away from the
iphone 7 announcement and one of the
hottest rumours here is that apparently
this iphone 7 will be capable of
recording video at 4k at 60 frames per
second so just to give you an idea if
you want to buy a regular camera that
can do 4k at 60 frames per second right
now prepare a couple of thousand dollars
for you to be able to afford it I think
the only a few cameras can do that so
the fact that the iphone will be capable
or should be capable or it might be
capable will be interesting let's just
see if it happens and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
lgb 20 I actually held a daily a little
just to be able to wait for the
announcement of the b20 we already went
hands-on
actually we had an opportunity to hold
on to it and play a little with it at
fifa and berlin our hands-on videos are
live right now with a couple of
comparisons as well we've got the
full-blown powerhouse no more of the
modular design which was not a bad idea
just a bad implementation and we've got
something very cool a replaceable
battery and we still have a metallic
design actually that release hatch at
the back is actually to replace the back
hatch and you get R expandable storage
we've got the quad deck technology a lot
of great stuff i highly suggest you

the comments down below what you think

it I definitely am I no one is going
crazy over it but we'd love to know your
