in a short matter of time and this
product is a perfect indication of just
that I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is our unboxing of the Nvidia
shield so at CES this year Nvidia
announced a new gaming console a mobile
gaming console powered by Android and
we've got one right here it is called
the Nvidia shield and it just arrived so
let's get this thing out of the box we
haven't even opened the shipping box yet
so let's do that first this thing is the
first device powered by the Tegra 4
processor which was also announced at
the CES press event and let's just say
before we get this thing out of the box
it's heavy
the shipping weight for this was almost
4 pounds I believe so it's uh it's
definitely bulky big but it is also very
high powered take Android gaming to the
next level on the side here you've got
your Google Play so it has access to
Google Play it comes with all my almost
stock version of Android and this is
just some information you've got your
your specifications down here it has a
5-inch 720p display 16 gigabytes of
fixed storage has 2 gigs of RAM and of
course the Tegra 4 chipset it has you
know integrated speakers and everything
and I'm not even sure how to get into
this box there's some tape so let's cut
that this is a very very high quality
box it's solid and I imagine the device
is too let's see if we can get this
thing off and get in here and look at it
maybe this is not easy alright so now
that we have that off you can just lift
up and you can just see what's inside
we've got your AC adapter in your micro
USB cable nothing major
some reading materials which includes
just some papers we'll get to that later
you don't need to know about all that I
don't guess and the device and I think I
opened the box upside down
did because there is the Nvidia logo so
or the shield logo so I got this upside
down but that's all there is in the box
yeah it has instructions this has open
that way here is the device we have to
cut this off a lot of cutting if I
didn't have this knife I'd be out of
luck but this is the device it fills in
the hand it almost feels actually like a
360 controller which I'm sure other
people have said that but you can get
this plastic off I'm gonna move it to
the mic yeah we got a good good tear
sound I think that is the first unboxing
that I've got a nice positive feedback
from the plastic but the device is very
chunky bulky and it's heavy it feels
really sturdy though on the back we've
got a few you know your FCC branding and
everything for your IDs and it is
powered by nvidia tegra got another
Nvidia logo and shield and this is what
we've been waiting for just pop it right
open yeah that's awesome
I love it it does it feels like a 360
controller except for your joysticks are
in the middle instead of having the
alternated joystick in the d-pad and
below your left thumb but this is get
something on it but it says push the
Nvidia button so as this powers up
you've got your standard XY ba button
configuration a play/pause button volume
back home for your menus and for your
navigation on Android the joysticks
d-pad and that is your multifunction
Nvidia button so there's not a lot to
see here it's just standard game
controller your triggers and your
bumpers and if we get in right here on
this you've got an ant an HDMI port out
that is a micro SD card slot micro USB
and your headphone jack so not a lot
going on there in the hardware but this
is definitely something we've been
looking forward to seeing and playing
with so we're not going to go through
the whole setup process here but this is
the 5 inch 720p display it seems at
least
relatively clear and crisp from from
here this has been the unboxing of the
Nvidia shield stay tuned to pocket now
for the next over the next week to see
more content maybe some comparisons
definitely a review and other content so
stay tuned to pocket now I'm Taylor
Martin and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
