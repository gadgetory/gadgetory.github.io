editing I know like seriously the arrow
has proven to be significantly better
than I am at video editing cool
awesomely cool brilliant language use
cool cool cool cool
yeah magnificent the only Apple product
I can afford right now it's a bulge it's
alright who in the best comment of the
week that's right it's that time of the
week I am I'm editing it out this is
PocketNow and this is if I get out daily
recap your comments for last week
so on Monday of last week it was all
about the Apple event
I asked you what predictions you had
back then for what we were going to get
we had 298 comments waiting to see what
else they have left to remove oh my god
yes definitely Apple has proven that
they are removing things that don't make
sense in the past it made sense to say
goodbye to floppy drives and to the you
know to the disk drive to the cd-rom at
some point but the headphone jack you
know the funny part is that they bundle
headphones that don't work on anything
other than the iPhone which is I don't
know I don't know I'm still waiting for
Apple to announce their very own apples
each refinement serves to bring absolute
unity and efficiency to the design
MacBook Air or MacBook and iPad pro this
was what I was looking forward to the
most I was surprised in the end for the
Apple watch series for I like that which
is currently charging down there but ya
know for me I was looking forward to a
new iPad pro and some new iPad MacBook
Air but I guess we're gonna have to wait
so on Tuesday the whole topic was the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 which was
codenamed
DaVinci and I asked you what do you
think why would it be codename DaVinci
we had 324 comments I strongly feel that
Samsung is gonna work on AI in
photography I think this is why they are
still calling it the Vinci what does the
Vinci have to do with photography that
would be painting you know and
engineering and a couple of other things
but there was no photography back then
that's awesome because that means price
drops on the note 9 yeah but by the time
that happens we don't know the Vinci
stands for it'll cost as much as the
Mona Lisa painting which is currently
considered invaluable yes the galaxy
note 9 was expensive so yeah then on
Wednesday it was apples event obviously
the PocketNow daily was taken over by
everything that was announced we had 574
comments discussing what we thought
about the event Tim Cook gets the most
impressive iPhone we have ever created
definitely on iPhone terms I'm sure not
in smartphone terms the only interesting
thing from the keynote was the Apple
watch series for yes definitely I am
currently working on a video and I had
to discharge it fully as part of the
video so it's currently charging
I have so I I like the Samsung Galaxy
watch that would be my favorite watch
when it comes to the design but just oh
my god
you should see the features and how fast
this Apple watch series four works
definitely really liking that watch and
rip the home button forever yes I was
expecting that you can still buy the
iPhone 7 which I don't recommend that
you can buy the iPhone 8 which I do
recommend if you're still looking for a
home button it's there it's just
definitely not gonna come back for
iPhones later on Thursday after Apple's
event we had huawei CEO bragging over
the fact that they had surpassed Apple
in sales of smartphones I asked you what
do you think if Huawei deserved this we
had 548 comments
Huawei will eventually get its shine in
the US they're way too good to be denied
not only that it's not just about phones
I mean when it comes to spectrum Huawei
is significant its spectrum businesses a
lot bigger than their smartphone
business so yeah there's a lot of full
there I think while we are in the spot
they've been doing good things I have to
agree as well I can't deny that I'm
really looking forward to the may 20 Pro
what way deserves because they have
changed to better in a very small time
ever since the Google Nexus 6p I have to
agree like ever before that if they
would be like you know hey we're gonna
send you a huawei device for review I'd
be like no wow
ever since the Nexus 9 then the p9
everything has changed dramatically and
honestly I have to say Wow way deserves
the title
and then finally on Friday the topic was
the teasers that will sent out of what
to expect at the event there was a frame
with a G logo at the bottom I asked you
what do you think we were gonna get at
the event from Google I even speculated
that there probably wasn't an arch we
had 503 comments
there's no notch because it's a photo of
the back of the phones all right dude I
know that the Google logos at the back
and that's the reason why you think that
but that would be true if there would be
camera lenses being shown at some point
at the top of the phone they're not
being shown G you can't speculate that
that's the back of the phone either what
do I expect a cheaper Google pixel to no
need to spend so much on a phone I would
love it if Google went back to the nexus
days where they stopped charging so much
money for a phone as well that would be
me you're saying we'll run out of space
for camera lenses but I think you're
wrong you can always add another notch I
mean we love not just anyways I'd like a
phone with five maybe six notches all
around the screen do you mean bezels I
mean the sarcasm was very high on this
one but yeah I know it's it's God it's a
means to an end it's terrible that's it
