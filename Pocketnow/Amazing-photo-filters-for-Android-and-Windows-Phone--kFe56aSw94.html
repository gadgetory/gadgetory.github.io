pocketnow.com in this video I'm going to
show you how to look like a cartoon
let's get to it now I'm going to show
you how to do that both in Windows Phone
8 and an Android we'll start off with
Windows Phone 8 it's so cool
so the app is called cam Wow it's a
Windows Phone 8 camera lens so if you go
into the camera app and you click on the
lens button you get the cam wow this is
free by the way and then you'll get a
bunch of filters and you click this to
get the list of filters I think that's
the list no it's FX right there
and so you will bring that up we've got
a variety of filters and the one we want
to choose is the one down here that
makes you look like a cartoon and let's
look outside okay so check this out this
is just this is just awesome
let's look down we've got a first gen
Kindle there this is kind of difficult
to do on camera guys hopefully you can
see I've got a first gen Kindle there as
you can see a yo-yo and a ruler this is
just awesome and it's kind of like
augmented reality you can take cool
pictures of your friends it's totally
novelty but how cool is that and if I
switch it around you can see me behind
the camera that is so cool that is just
so cool anyway so let's check it out for
Android now for Android there's an app
called paper camera it's 2 bucks there
are apps that do it for free but paper
camera is insanely cool and let me show
you to you now so the interface looks
like a piece of paper what you can do is
mess with a variety of finer grain
controls than you can with Cam well
Windows Phone 8 so let's look out the
window ok hopefully you can see that it
shows up in the window but you can
change really fine grain and the camera
is really having trouble focusing here
sort of how thick the lines are and what
things look like let's look at those
objects on the table check them out that
is so cool
that does it in real time is really
what's impressive about these apps I
mean this takes a lot of CPU CPU usage
to be able to convert what the camera
sees into line art so again this is
called paper camera it's 2 bucks in
Android the other app is called cam
Wow and it's free as a Windows Phone 8
camera lens pretty cool stuff let us
know if you find any really cool camera
filters and maybe we'll do a video about
it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
