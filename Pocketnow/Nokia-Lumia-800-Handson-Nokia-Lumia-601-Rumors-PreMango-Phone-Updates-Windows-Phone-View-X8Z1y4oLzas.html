tell you all about it some pre mango
phones are getting a software update and
Nokia ads are leaking their own phones
in the future all this and more coming
up right now hello everyone I'm hi I'm
every battle with pocketnow.com and
welcome to Windows Phone you the show we
wrap up all this week's good and bad
inside the world of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform let's start this week up
with what's good as always the Nokia
Microsoft partnership takes the stage
first of all the Nokia Lumia 800 was
recently awarded editor's choice by
London's whiskey mist and while we don't
blame him so far the sales of the device
haven't been really crazy off-the-charts
but they are solidly growing as Nokia
continues to expand the sales of the
device currently has just went on sale
in the UK so so far so good Nokia also
updated their music application for
Windows Phones which allows you to
create personalized radio stations on
mix radio and well aside from other
reason changes so so far these changes
are really good and let's hope they
bring other things to the partnership
for other Windows Phone users speaking
of great devices let's go through our
weeks coverage first of all my cheek
catch Adam lanes recent unboxing and
other videos of the much expected Nokia
Lumia 800 so far the device has exceeded
all of our expectations even though we
already reviewed its older fraternal
twin the Nokia n9 and while there most
probably the same devices but there are
a lot of differences with Windows thrown
in the implementation also you make sure
you catch our full review of the samsung
focus s we have a link in the
description for it and we show you why
the device scored 4 stars out of 5 so
far our impressions are really good but
read the full review and tell us about
it 13 months after the original launch
of windows phone 7 and the marketplace
has now reached the milestone at 40,000
applications in the marketplace this
obviously doesn't match the current
numbers that we can see probably in the
android market but remember the windows
phone applications actually look
consistent and pretty good if you
compare it to the low curation that we
can find in the android market now
remember that the nokia microsoft
partnership has also promised free Lumia
phones for developers so this definitely
has just gotten started
speaking of Nokia let's go through an
interesting rumor have a look at this
image first of all I mean look at this
device that's right you've never seen
this device we have a link of device and
definitely Microsoft and Nokia haven't
even talked about the device so it's
interesting to see that no can use this
device image and a reason add that they
published and well you guess that they
eventually came up and swapped it with
this image after the vice being taken
out and they switching it for nokia
lumia 800 what can we tell about the
device well it seems to be having a
really interesting design in blue though
we can't really expect much from an
image just to know the fact that nokia
is working on more designs the device
look really cool so let's see what they
come up with next year and before we get
to the bad section let's go through some
phones that recently got a software
update first of all the t-mobile HTC hd7
the most hard the Titan and the Samsung
Focus have recently gotten a software
update though we're still not sure what
the update was for we're mostly assuming
that some of these were ironing some bug
fixes but first of all the t mobile hd7
and other phones have actually even
gotten internet sharing to be supported
on their devices now obviously not
everything is good here because we're
going through the bat section let's so
let's talk about the rest that does it
for the good let's continue while with
the bad and well you guessed it after
weeks of bashing Microsoft where device
is not offering internet sharing we
definitely have more devices to talk
about first of all the software update
apparently did not bring internet
sharing to the samsung focus and well
apparently other devices aren't getting
it and it's even unstable for devices
like the LG up in the seventh where they
promised that they were going to offer
internet sharing in the software update
did not bring anything now it's kind of
unclear which devices are getting it or
not so leave us a comment down below and
tell us which devices are getting it and
not and well before we leave this
segment all of us there are proud fans
of the dell venue pro known one well
we're beginning to get the xiv because
sadly well internet sharing is not being
offered to any of us bill is actually
even pushing these devices to substitute
blackberries for their current
executives in the company and well we
still haven't gotten any software
updates some of us are even having
problems with the digital compass and
well you'd wonder what those actually
doing with their phones and well truth
is don't send Delta to an HTC job
anyways that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching them hime
every veteran give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
