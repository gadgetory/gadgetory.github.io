pocketnow.com and this is the video test
for the LG spectrum from verizon and you
can see here we are looking at the sky
in the trees if I pan down to the trees
and let it try to focus their get a lot
of blow out down by the asphalt move it
further down it will slowly lock in with
enough I move it up this guy it takes a
long time for it to go back and and
properly expose the sky moving over to
bright sunlight area as it has a
tendency to really get blown out very
quickly it doesn't adjust your bright
sunlight very well at all as you can see
here really the detail level is pretty
decent we've got supposed to auto focus
the camera but
it's all right it's not anything that's
spectacular and there's a little bit of
tearing and wobble eNOS as you move it
shift the camera back and forth once
again because there's no there's no sort
of image stabilization built in to the
device in all it seems like a fairly
decent video camera the colors are
really muted in comparison to which the
real colors would be but otherwise for
what it is at IEM cell phone camera it
works out just fine and it does record
in 1080p thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
