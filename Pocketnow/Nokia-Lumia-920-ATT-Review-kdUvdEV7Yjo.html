packing.com and this is our full review
of the Nokia Lumia 920 haven't been this
excited about a phone since the Kaiser
from HTC back in that 2007 a lot of
innovation packed into this guy let's
check it out let's start with the specs
it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 8960
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor with
one gig of ram and 32 gigs of internal
storage the front-facing camera has a
resolution of 1.2 megapixels and the
rear camera has 8.7 megapixels with
1080p HD video recording and optical
image stabilization the 4.5 inch IPS TFT
screen features a 768 by 1280 pixel
resolution we've also got bluetooth 3.1
Wi-Fi so as the GPS and NFC the handsets
weight is 185 grams and thickness is ten
point seven millimeters powering it all
is a two thousand milliamp per hour
battery which is non-removable however
the built-in keys standard wireless
charging will make keeping that charged
up a lot easier let's take a closer look
at the hardware the design of the Nokia
Lumia 920 is clearly a minor progression
from the older Nokia Lumia 800 900 and
the n9 at the top you've got the handset
speaker along with some sensors a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera and some
logos then you've got a large 4.5 inch
IPS TFT screen with print-quality pixel
density that makes everything look very
smooth outdoor visibility is fantastic
and if you turn on the high sensitivity
option in the settings you can even use
the phone with gloves on at the bottom
either usual Windows Phone capacitive
buttons for search start screen and back
on the right side there's a series of
thin ceramic buttons protruding from the
edge for activating the camera power and
volume up or down the buttons are raised
just enough to be easy to feel for your
with your fingers and the placement
makes a lot of sense
when you're holding the phone with your
left hand on the bottom you'll see the
speaker grille too
crews hold everything together and a
microUSB port on the left side there's
just a smooth round edge on the top is
the 3.5 millimeter headset jack and a
flush little drawer for the micro SIM
card on the back is the eight point
seven megapixel camera with an F 2.0
aperture twenty six millimeter
equivalent wide angle lens and a dual
LED flash in the hand the Nokia Lumia
920 feels beautiful as long as you hold
it by the sides the corners are pretty
pointy so you'll want to avoid pressing
your palm against these too hard but
holding it by the sides has the
advantage of easy access to the hardware
buttons on the right edge now let's talk
about the software
most of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can
already be found in our full Windows
Phone 8 review on pocketnow.com that's
where you'll get the most meet about the
software on the Nokia Lumia 920 however
there are quite a few customizations the
Nokia is made which we'll look at here
first of all you'll find a whole slew of
special apps in the Nokia collection
section of the Windows Phone 8 Store
some of these are custom versions of
third-party apps that Nokia commissioned
for their phone specifically while
others were developed by Nokia for their
Lumia smartphones one of the best ones
is Nokia Drive plus beta this is your
free GPS navigation program for Nokia
Lumia phones but the plus doesn't mean
there's more features than the previous
version of Nokia Drive for Lumia phones
there's actually less since the my
commute feature is missing however now
the app works in the background and
we'll announce driving directions no
matter what another fantastic addition
from Nokia and Lumia 920 and all of
their Lumia windows phones for that
matter is the Nokia music app this lets
you stream or download automatically
generated mix playlists of all sorts of
music a few of the other nokia apps that
are really well done are the custom
Weather Channel app with special weather
alerts friends weather and augmented
reality CNN and Bloomberg are great news
apps that can add custom lockscreen
image options
ESPN lets you follow certain sports and
teams with custom lat tiles Nokia City
lens gives you a mint a'dreea views of
the points of interest around you
Nokia transit is Indus
vincible for navigating public
transportation subways buses and trains
and I like the no gate trailers app
which actually unless you download movie
trailers for offline viewing and can
even remind you of when specific movies
are coming out overall the amount of
innovative software and valuable
additions you get from Nokia in the
Lumia 920 is immensely better than other
windows phones and I would say other
smartphones in general next let's look
at the camera you probably already know
that Nokia is keen when it comes to
camera technology built into mobile
phones the Lumia 920 is another
indication of Nokia's superiority and
pushed towards advancing mobile camera
tech while the megapixel count is not
that great at 8.7 megapixels the huge
innovation here is the optically
stabilized camera component you can see
how the image stabilization is make
video recording movements much less
shaky and harsh it's not completely
smooth since big motions are still going
to be visible but it's noticeably
smoother you can see the exposure
changes are nice and quick and autofocus
works very well in the brighter areas
but understandably not as well in
low-light audio recording quality is
pretty impressive as well still shots
benefit the most from optical
stabilization in low-light handheld
scenarios bright light images are about
the same as other 8 megapixel cameras
but when it comes to low-light
situations
the advantage is clearer now what about
audio quality on the Lumia 920 we
thought the Windows Phone at 8x by HTC
had good audio with its dedicated
amplifier in Beats Audio support but it
turns out that the Nokia Lumia 920 has
some impressive sound as well not only
is there a Dolby switch when you plug in
headphones but there's actually an
equalizer in the settings so that you
can customize the sound to your
preference in terms of battery life I
found that Lumia 920 to be satisfactory
after about nine hours without a charge
the battery percentage was down to about
48% and indicated I had another nine
hours to go that should do just fine for
a device that doesn't have a removable
battery and wireless charging platforms
will help keep that going strong
our final rating is going to be an eight
point three out of ten the hardware of
the screen the camera the sound quality
the video stabilization and Nokia's
custom apps are all extremely impressive
as is the pricing the only negatives for
me are really the large size and lack of
user replaceable battery everything else
on this phone is top-notch be sure to
give this video a thumbs up and thanks
