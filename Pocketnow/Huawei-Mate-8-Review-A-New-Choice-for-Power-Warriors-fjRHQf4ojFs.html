burly battery but it's software and
price tag mean this is a smart phone for
a narrow class of us buyers I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
video review of the Huawei mate 8
brought to you by JD calm the may date
is probably the best-looking smartphone
who always built and that doesn't mean
it's terribly distinctive it's made of
aluminium with narrow radius corners and
chamfered edges which to put it mildly
is something we've seen before the
camera lens an excellent fingerprint
scanner are almost the only round things
on the device they don't really fit with
the boxy aesthetic but they don't look
bad either in the hand the phone feels
wide and weighty even in an age of
phablets the may date is a very large
device of course it has to be to
accommodate its display this is a 6 inch
IPS LCD with 1080p resolution and if you
think that's too low for 2016 we're
going to go ahead and disagree colors
pop as they should
we're hard-pressed to see the pixels
without a microscope and the lack of
quad HD means this is an easier panel to
power more on that in a second as with
most LCD screens blacks could be deeper
and we'd like to have seen a bit more
brightness for outdoor use but on the
whole this is a fine display elsewhere
the hardware bears Huawei hallmarks
we've seen before on the right edge a
combination dual sim and microSD card
slot gives them a date some versatility
and carriers and storage well on the
bottom lip and older USB port is flanked
by twin speaker grills don't let them
fool you only one of them actually
contains a speaker which is fairly
average in its output
the may dates software is probably the
phone's most polarizing aspect Huawei's
custom Android skin is called emui
and it combines the look and feel of iOS
with the overburdened feature load of
Samsung phones circa 2013 Huawei seems
to think that using knuckles on a
touchscreen is not only convenient but
also intuitive well it's not knocking on
your phone to get it to do something
looks and feels almost as ridiculous as
it sounds the may date is also a
notification nanny it tells you every
single time it thinks an app might be
using too much power in the background
even if you're actively using that app
when you update the software and then
try dismissing that update notification
it'll warn you that that's not a good
idea for some reason some windows like
the volume settings pop-up scroll even
though they don't need to and that makes
for a frustrating one-handed experience
and unless you're a fan of swipe you'll
probably want to change the laggy stock
keyboard whose sound effects sounds
straight off a smith-corona from 1988
fortunately this is still Android
marshmallow to boot and that means you
can change pretty much anything you want
by installing a different launcher and
if you decide to keep emui you might
actually like it we like the recurring
use of the circle as a progress
indicator and while the smoked
translucent overlays aren't always great
for readability they sure do look nice
emui also provides plenty of ways to use
that big display intelligently there's a
multi window function for running two
apps side by side and you can change the
displays dpi value right in the settings
menu to fit more on the screen the new
multitasking view lets you prevent apps
from automatically closing by dragging
down on their card and new features like
this scrolling screenshot function are
also nice to see here even if it's not
the first time we've seen them
the may dates camera is a new 16
megapixel Sony sensor with an F 2.0
aperture and optical image stabilization
good for one and a half degrees of
motion the software behind it is feature
packed you can launch the camera with a
quick DoubleTap of the volume button and
the viewfinder gives you everything from
full manual controls to automatic object
tracking it's really cool it means you
can tap a subject and the camera will
hold focus on that subject even as you
Pan the shot when you do take a picture
the gallery application gives you much
more information than most phones
there's even a histogram the photos
themselves are usually pretty nice like
many phone cameras this one sometimes
has trouble obtaining and maintaining
focus particularly with the moving
subject but even shooting alongside a
galaxy s6 edge+ the may date keeps up
with the Samsung phone more often than
not the super night mode is basically a
shortcut to a long exposure setting and
it allows up to 32 second exposures if
you don't have a tripod you can balance
the phone on its side it'll stand up by
itself with enough coaxing the rest of
the camera settings do what they're
supposed to whether you're brightening
the shadows with HDR trying out the skin
smoothing Beauty mode on the front
firing 8 megapixel camera or just
snapping sunset shots on a winter
afternoon the made 8 keeps up the camera
is at its lowest when it comes to video
because of the CPU limitations you can
find a 1080p resolution and while the
autofocus and stabilization are fine
there's plenty of digital noise as I
said you do have the option for 60fps if
you want
the made eight runs on huawei zone Kirin
950 silicon backed up by either three or
four gigs of ram and internal storage
ranging from 32 to 128 gigs we've used
the lower end model on t-mobile us for
about a week in Greater Boston and the
may date has proved itself a beast in
more ways than one
we already mentioned the zippy interface
responsiveness and that translates to
games - the phone made short work of our
usual suite of asphalt 8 sky gamblers
air supremacy killshot Bravo and extreme
landings and it ran dead trigger - with
no problem as well
graphics settings on these were all
maxed out by the way on the more mundane
side it's so nice to see a manufacturer
thinking about things like audio and
phone calls being able to steer the mic
input when taking a speaker phone call
is something you'll appreciate if you've
ever tried to take a call in a loud
Airport more impressive than anything
else though is the may dates endurance
with a four thousand milliamp hour power
pack the phone lasts so long on a charge
that we wrote an entire editorial about
it earlier this week even with heavy use
you'll absolutely get through a full day
on the may date and if you're more
careful and use some of the many power
saving features that Huawei has baked in
it's even possible to get through a
whole weekend on one charge our personal
record is over 7 hours of screen on time
over two days for a phone with this kind
of feature set that's pretty remarkable
we're not sure what price the mate eight
will carry if and when it comes to the
US but right now it's steep to import
between 600 and 700 euro depending on
trim you can get a lot of other Android
phones for much less good ones too like
Huawei's own Nexus 6p or Motorola's Moto
X for most folks we think smartphones
like those will be the wiser cheaper
choice but that's not saying the Mayday
doesn't have a place in the world for
those who value big screens and big
processors behind them this phone is
bound to impress and those are the kind
of people who can easily get around the
software shortcomings of emui when you
factor in the staggering battery life
the mate aid becomes the new import
alternative for a new kind of customer
the road warrior power user combo power
warrior yeah that's a little much but
then so is the made 8 + 4 power warriors
