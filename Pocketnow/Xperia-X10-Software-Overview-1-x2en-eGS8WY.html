pocketnow.com and recently you saw our
unboxing of the sony ericsson xperia x10
android device well it's time to go
ahead and take a look at some of these
software that Sony has implemented on
this device of course one of the great
things about android is the
manufacturers ability to customize the
UI as they see fit so let's take a look
alrighty we're back and we're going to
dive right in and give you a look at the
software that sony has incorporated into
the sony ericsson xperia x10 android
device as you can see here they have a
custom lock screen that has actually a
different swipe method instead you're
going to swipe the unlock triangle
actually in a semi-circle or a quarter
circle motion as you just saw there now
immediately we're greeted by your
typical home screen layout with the Sony
version you get you just three home
screens you get one to the left one to
the right and of course your Center home
screen now what we have here is what's
called Timescape and that is a widget
that actually will use Twitter Facebook
your email applications basically your
social networking sites and incorporate
them all into one theme as you see here
you can actually scroll through these
little tiles and actually see everything
down here at the bottom we have our
different icons for the corresponding
social network so for example this is
more or less all of them believe it or
not we have the phone we have your text
messaging emails music it actually will
corporate everything but then you're
also going to have your Twitter as well
as your Facebook and you can just scroll
through these as you see fit so this
really incorporates a great experience
into the device itself and it really
brings Twitter and some of these social
networking aspects to the forefront now
as you just saw there when I press the
home button and asked me if I want to
default to a certain launch here instead
of going to the default home screen
that's only includes and I'll go into
that a little bit later when I talk
about some of the alternatives I'm not a
huge fan of the Sony you I hear it's
very different it's not like sense at
all or any of the other Android skins
for that matter you know TouchWiz from
the Samsung as well as the vanilla this
is very different in most cases it may
not be the most efficient once again
though it is all personal preference now
as you see here we have the app drawer
that just slides straight up we can go
through all of our apps and of course
this is android 1.6 so any app in the
market that requires two point or higher
will not be compatible here we've talked
about this numerous times in the past
with applications such as the official
twitter application it seems that
launcher pro which is an alternative to
your home screen skin as well as just
the overall skin of the device all
requires two point oh so in this case we
press the home button you'll see that
we've instead decided to use ADW
launcher and that's simply because of
the fact that launcher pro will requires
two point O in order to run now because
this device is off on AT&amp;amp;T and it's
locked down to the 18-team network by
AT&amp;amp;T your of course going to have some
18c applications as you can see here we
have the family manager as well as the
ett hotspots 18 team map navigator and
radio there's also a few other choices
that you'll see as you go through such
as the mobi TV etc that are included by
AT&amp;amp;T there now this is something that is
open to your own interpretation some
people call these applications bloatware
others think that they serve a purpose
now the apt Navigator is definitely
somewhat useful however the other ones
may not be useful to you such as the
family manager if you don't plan on
giving this device to someone in your
family or have a family for that matter
that you want to use the device with
that may not be usable to you so overall
your mileage may vary in terms if you
find a use for the ATT applications that
are pre-installed on this device when it
comes to posting simple updates on
facebook and tweets on Twitter the
device loads them extremely quickly just
navigating through the device pulling up
your email your text messages are very
snappy however it almost seems like when
you go into the browser at times it is a
little slower than some of the devices
in the next video the next software
overview video will actually give you a
comparison next to the Samsung Galaxy S
and will test the speed of the browser
on these two different devices here to
show you which one actually comes up
first right now will actually go ahead
and will open up pocketnow com on the
browser you can just give yourself a
rough idea here by seeing this now you
actually have to press the soft button
here the soft menu button to bring up
the ability to type in a web site let me
go ahead and type in pocket now now
we've already loaded it once before as
you'll see here it cues up the site
quickly however when it comes to
actually loading the site it takes a
little bit longer than most and it will
actually hang on a very small percentage
that is left now the Wi-Fi is very fast
we do have a full signal with the Wi-Fi
so it's nothing to do with that data
rate there it just almost seems like the
devices
processing a page there's so much going
on and again we will show you that in
better detail when we compare it next to
the galaxy s in our next video now with
the stock browser that is included on
the device by default you're not going
to have the multi-touch support
unfortunately you can't always of course
download a third-party browser to get
the support but right off the bat you
will not have as you can see here we
don't have the ability to pinch to zoom
we can of course navigate with our
finger and as you just saw there it was
actually selecting some links but you're
going to have to use these magnifying
glass icons here in order to actually
zoom in and zoom out on the desired text
which is kind of a downfall of course
you can always download a third party
but a lot of times now these first party
browsers that the manufacturers are
including button on the device are
capable of doing multi-touch so Sony
definitely needs to make up some time or
some slack on that end right there so as
always thank you very much for watching
everyone please give us a thumbs up and
stay tuned for our next video in this
series which would be our hardware
review will give you a more in-depth
look at the hardware of this device here
as well as what is running under the
hood to power such snappy program
