electronic devices are an integral part
of our everyday lives what's inside of
them that makes them do everything that
we need them to do I'm Joe Levi and on
this episode of pocket now power user
we're going to talk about another very
important component Ram when talking
about the memory that goes into our
smartphones tablets wearables and even
our computers and routers and other
stuff than enable our digital life there
are essentially two kinds of memory that
we want to talk about there's long-term
storage sometimes called non-volatile
storage sometimes erroneously called ROM
and then there's RAM or random access
memory or just memory these two things
that's all so volatile by the way these
two things are really what gets us all
of our data that stores it and lets us
use it the CPU that we talked about last
week processes it and makes that data do
stuff so what is data data is
information it's bits it's ones and
zeros it's your usernames and passwords
stored in a secure location it's your
configurations it's the orientation of
the icons on your home screen it's the
apps that you have installed it's the
information that you've created the
documents that you've created the cached
files it's it's a lot of stuff so don't
just think when i say data i'm thinking
about documents because data is ones and
zeros and it's everything that you need
to make your device do what you need it
to do well you don't want to have to
worry about losing that data when you
lose your power so let's jump in the
Wayback Machine and I've got an example
to share with you way back in the window
siiii days this predates windows mobile
pocket pc and all that stuff hey the
palm top pc days microsoft did something
weird they had a good reason for it you
see back in those days non-volatile
memory non-volatile storage was
relatively slow
not quite as slow as a hard drive with
its rotational media or maybe slower
depending on who you asked but slow now
for a PDA something you carry it around
in your hand too slow lamb on the other
hand was quite a bit faster but it's
volatile when you turn the power off to
it all the information in it goes away
just as simple as that what you do you'd
get your brand new device you charge up
the battery you turn it on and start
setting things up you'd put a new user
names your passwords you configure it
you'd start installing apps onto it and
hopefully you wouldn't forget to charge
it up or somehow run out of battery
because if you did you had a coin cell
battery as a backup that coin cell was
there just to keep all of the data in
RAM which remember that's all of your
apps all of your data all of your
configurations everything it had to keep
that alive and if that coin cell went
out you've got to set your device up all
over again luckily that's not the world
that we live in today technology has
increased and improved but one thing has
stayed the same running apps out of ram
instead of out of long-term or
non-volatile memory is a lot faster so
you need a lot of RAM apps are getting
bigger every day more features more
resolution remember those 2k screens and
4k screens and 28.8 k screens that we're
talking it ok we're not talking about
those the more bits that you have the
higher resolution imagery you need to
support those colors and those pixels on
your screens that takes up a lot more
storage space takes more processing
power yeah you see how it's all
interconnected here basically you want
as much RAM as you can have so when you
go down the spec list and you're looking
at all of the things on there if you see
two gigabytes of RAM you're good if
you're a really really power user you
see three gig of
Ram you're golden that's where we are
today that's what you need to know about
the RAM line on the spec sheet when
you're considering your next smartphone
or tablet if you like the information
that you saw here and give the video a
thumbs up and make sure that you've
subscribed so that you don't miss out on
the next episode of the pocket now power
user don't forget to share it with your
friends and for pocket now i'm joe levi
i'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
