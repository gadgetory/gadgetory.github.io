your time outdoors the Kyocera
brigadiere is probably one of your
better options but besides being scratch
proof drop proof and waterproof what
else can it do I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and here are three things you
didn't know about the Kyocera brigadiere
it has a mintue long since our own
michael fisher put the Kyocera
brigadiere through some pretty nasty
torture only to find you can scratch
it's synthetic sapphire display still
it's an incredibly rugged smartphone
that should be able to withstand a
beating from the roughest kind of user
but what else can the Brigadier do for
those who work in extreme conditions or
spend much of their time outdoors gloves
are a necessary item but yanking off a
glove just to type a message or answer a
call is tedious and annoying with what
Kyocera calls glove and wet touchscreen
operation you can use the Brigadier
without taking your gloves off the
Brigadier may not be the first to work
with gloves on and it may not be perfect
100% of the time but it does in fact
work
Kyocera claims gloves up to three
millimeters thick will work with the
Brigadier I tried to very thick pairs of
gloves and both worked but the thicker
pair was noticeably less reliable
Michael also showed us that rubber
gloves paired with a wet phone still
work in that same vein part of what
makes the gloved operation of the
Brigadier so much easier are the
physical buttons it has Hardware
navigation buttons on the front a power
and speakerphone key up top camera
shutter button on the right edge and a
volume rocker on the left it also has
one extra button below the volume rocker
this key is programmable you can select
what it does from launching Google now
pulling down the notification shade
which was difficult to do with gloves on
to launching your favorite app one of
the most useful functions we found was
the torch function long press the key to
launch the flashlight app the LED
automatically turns on and pressing the
key with the app open will toggle the
light off and on as fast as you can push
the button
finally the Brigadier has one feature
all rugged smartphones should have
wireless charging while there are still
many non-believers in the technology
wireless charging has its place and
serves a great purpose especially on a
phone like the Brigadier but so many
flaps and ports that must remain closed
to maintain the integrity of the phone's
ingress protection keeping the flaps
closed as much as possible is probably a
good idea not needing to fumble around
with the flaps and cables and simply
popping this phone down on a charging
mat just makes sense be sure to check
out our other video on the Brigadier
showing just how resilient the phone is
and more videos on other rugged phones
