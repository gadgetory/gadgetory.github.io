we're going to take a look at another
new xbox live game for windows phone
this week's game is called orbital so
let's check it out it's a puzzle game
and there's a few different modes let's
start with single-player say that
supernova of gravity and pure supernova
so this wit we have a laser there we can
aim it to where we want to shoot and
that's going to make an orb and the
object is to get the number to count
down to zero so the norm horrible go
away another one it's now it's down to
four but now there's another one over
there oops so you want to kill all these
orbs and bounce some let's try that
again and what you don't want to do is
get it down below your line because
that'll be the end of the game see like
this
so your points all right here's another
version gravity mode I see the gun is
moving so i have to tap it to shoot and
the bigger orbs are going to get
themselves a gravity field and you'll
see my gun shooting little kind of a
track to the larger works let's try that
getting them to close to this line is
going to be difficult for me to shoot
the others trying to get the gravity
thing work there we go to sell that
curve all right I'll give up a nice
little robot voice and pure mode it's no
gravity or anything so you just gotta
shoot stuff there you go prequel
graphics and there's also multiplayer
mode however this is not a online
multiplayer I'll just do best of 1 and
gravity see I'm this player 1 so I got
to shoot something out there and then
that's player too so somebody else can
go over there and what you want to do is
make it difficult for the other person
to shoot so that they they get their
bullet bouncing back into their own base
so let's see that's going to be
difficult for me and now if player 2 can
shoot one down there that's going to
make it even more difficult oh now here
we go oh and I lost nice and achievement
whoo all right so that's a pretty cool
game here's some options it's nothing
nothing special just zoom robot voice
sound that kind of thing leaderboards of
course you get those and we've got some
cool graphics this doesn't come out
until tomorrow so I'm the only person
that has it this is why I'm the only
person here and we have achievements of
course that precedent there we go some
of them are pretty easy so right away
you can get some gamers gamerscore
add-ons anyway that's it for orbital
pretty cool game give us a thumbs up if
you liked it and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
