pocketnow.com and this is the software
review of the HTC Thunderbolt on Verizon
Wireless let's get to it now for those
of you that already know HTC Sense and
all of its inner workings and its
widgets and its design elements this is
going to be kind of review for you but
those of you looking at the HTC
Thunderbolt kinda for the first time for
those but don't really know the Sense
interface that well this video should be
helpful in kind of helping to navigate
that for you because the truth is that
this device is basically the same when
you get down to the software as the
inspire 4G and the Desire HD and the
legend and and lots of other phones that
have come out recently which isn't such
a bad thing
the HTC Sense interface has won awards
it is won acclaim it is one of the best
Android interfaces if not the best
Android interface and what that means is
that HTC has sort of put something on
top of the stock Android experience to
make it look a lot better there's a lot
of eye candy that goes on here and it
starts here on the home screen you get
seven of them and you can do a little
leap they call it the leap feature and
you get to see all seven home screens
you still can't add or remove them
there's no menu option to do anything
like that but you can rearrange them
which is nice so we can move one over
here move that one over here it's kind
of a cool and easy way to manage your
home screens and when you're ready to go
to one in particular you tap on it just
a quick gesture does that and that
gesture also works in the browser it's a
really cool gesture you pinch and you're
taken out to the tab view a lot of
people don't know about this gesture
because it's kind of hidden but it's one
of the ways that the Sense interface
makes your experience on an Android
phone a lot better now there are a ton
of widgets that come with the HTC Sense
phones and we can click this
personalized button to see all of them
if we go to widgets and browse all HTC
widgets and we're not going to go
through all 66 of them but we're just
going to kind of scan through quickly
we've got bookmarks I mean really good
looking widgets that help to really make
your home screens dynamic unfortunately
you can't resize these widgets if you
get launcher Pro you can get widgets
that look like these but they're
resizable so you could take something
that
except a full homescreen like this and
shrink it down to be half the height
which is always quite nice so a lot of
different calendar widgets you get a
wide variety of clocks there's the sort
of quintessential weather clock that
everyone thinks about when they think of
HTC Sense and we've got more and more
clocks tons of clocks actually FM radio
you can play right from your homescreen
footprints friends stream and you can
pick whether you're streaming from
Twitter or Facebook or both a smaller
friend stream so you can fit more icons
on the screen at one time we've got mail
flip through your mail here's another
mail widget I mean the list goes on and
on they give you just such a big suite
of of widgets here's a news widget for
feeding news favorite people different
favorite people yet another different
favorite people but this one's really
cool it integrates social networking
into it so you can see people's feeds as
they update again these widgets will
take up CPU cycles and battery life so
you got to ask yourself is it really
worth having these widgets on your
homescreen if that means that you know
they're gonna take up or use our battery
life so let's take this one and I'll
take select my group I'm just going to
do HTC favorites and it's going to pull
up this widget with some people that
I've added before to an HTC widget and
the pictures are high quality and from
here you can you can action on different
people and after you tap on their face
it will take you into the contacts
screen so we're going to leave that off
the screen so you get a lot of choices
with widgets again what a lot of people
do in this case they think the HTC Sense
homescreen experience is a little bit
too heavy it's very beautiful but it's
heavy so they put on ADW launcher or
launcher pro launcher pro happens to be
my favorite and in fact if you want to
see what launcher pro looks like this is
how I have my launcher Pro set up here
on the inspire 4G I mean at the end of
the day they're very similar but we've
got a cool dock along the bottom it's a
little bit faster we've got these
resizable widgets but this is not an
advertisement for launcher Pro just
giving you some ideas on how to
customize your home screens so let's
move that aside and talk about some of
the other built-in application
so if we go into settings we can see
that this phone is running on Android
2.2
point one this is likely to be upgraded
to Gingerbread in the near future
probably late spring to early summer
obviously two point two is not the
newest version of Android so it would
make sense that HTC would update that on
their high-end device this is one of
their most high-end devices right now
another thing we want to talk about
we're going to go into the browser and
some other applications is the speed of
this device this is a 4G LTE phone right
now at this location right here there's
no 4G but it's very funny if you go
outside my apartment and walk to the
left about 50 feet you suddenly get 4G
so I've been all around town anywhere
that there's 4G running benchmarks my
friends think I'm crazy but I've run
probably two dozen benchmarks here you
can see the speeds that you're getting
about 13 at the most seven six and a lot
of these were under full bar conditions
if you're over 3G you'll do what tells
you the date and everything you're over
3G you'll do about 1.3 megabits per
second on their Rev a network generally
speaking you're gonna get about 6 to 7
megabits per second down we're not
really sure on the upload speeds yet
because this app can't take advantage or
really understand process the fast 4G
speeds and we also get really good pings
about 50 milliseconds which means the
time it takes for the server to respond
so you get really good latency on 4G
which we're really excited about another
thing you can do with the 4G is of
course use the mobile hotspot app which
is somewhere around here and tether up
to 8 devices now this is going to cost
you about 20 dollars per month to use
but considering that you got a 4G modem
in your pocket it's just such a
compelling feature to use ok let's go
back to the home screen if we go into
the app tray and we talked about this in
one of the comparison videos there are
there's a lot of junk here on the on the
in the application trade that Verizon
has thrown in what we have here is
listed the apps that I've downloaded and
then after Adobe Reader those are the
apps that have come on the Thunderbolt
and we already talked about this we've
got bit bop and city ID the list goes on
and on
and these built-in apps you cannot
remove so it's super annoying having to
always see these applications that you
may never use or want to use because
Verizon thinks that they should be on
the device so kind of a downside there
the HTC Sense interface can be found in
so many applications including the
browser so we'll start there and you saw
this is an HTC Sense edition the brow
the the browser bar up here is an HTC
Sense Edition it's kind of the kind of a
slate like looking address bar which
matches the skin that you've set for the
operating system and I'll show you the
skin command in a moment now if we go
down here to menu and settings there's a
lot of settings you can change here one
that people will probably care most
about is the enable plugins area
wherever that might be
what that will do it will determine if
flash elements load on a site so if we
put always-on and let's go back and load
PocketNow desktop view because there are
some flash ads on on that site that will
take advantage of the thunderbolts
ability to show you flesh so it's good
the desktop version and by the way the
Thunderbolt has beaten all other devices
that we've compared against in terms of
web browsing over Wi-Fi it's got a very
very fast engine to pull down the pages
and render them as quickly as possible
so what you're gonna see now are some
our glasses show up where the flash
elements want to load and there they're
loaded so here is Flash content it's
pretty smooth it's a little bit choppy
which is like why I like to leave
plugins turn to on-demand because I only
want the flash stuff to load when I'm
ready to see it not when the browser
decides that there is flash stuff so
that's a good setting to leave on now I
alluded to these skins so if you go to
the personalize menu you can go to the
skins section and from here you can kind
of change the look and feel of the HTC
Sense interface this is kind of the
default look and we can swipe and go to
metal this one's pretty cool so let's
click apply takes a sec changes in the
background
it changes the notification shade it
changes the highlighting color and a lot
of other stuff even if we tap the
weather clock we get sort of that
metal theme down here on the slider if
you see that pretty cool stuff now
something that this device is lacking
that the inspire 4G does have is the HTC
hub which allows you to use htcsense.com
to remotely manage your phone a really
great service it allows you to remotely
wipe your phone to put a lock screen on
to put a password on it in case you lose
it but for some reason it's not included
here on the the HTC thunderbolt it just
it doesn't work with it
and you would know that because there
would be the HTC hub feature but it's
not it's not here ugly performance is
very good we will go into a YouTube
video and see how long it takes to to
bring up a video so we'll search for
pocket now and we'll pull up a video and
within you know two or three seconds it
loads very good performance of course
you've got this awesome kickstand to
watch videos with so kind of picture
this right got it up on a table you're
studying or having lunch or hopefully
not studying because you should be
paying attention to not the phone you
can really use this kickstand to to make
a better viewing angle for you when
you're watching videos or you're
checking email or what-have-you it's a
really good addition to have there now a
thunderbolt does have DLNA support so if
you go to the connected media
application this is where you go to set
up the DLNA so if you have a TV that has
support for this technology you can
actually flick a picture or a video onto
the screen it's really awesome
wirelessly but of course you have to
have the equipment that works with it
more and more devices are coming with
DLNA I think in the future it's going to
be a pretty big deal because people have
this problem where the content kind of
lives on your phone right and you want
to get it onto the big screen to show
friends or family or whatnot and DLNA is
the technology to do so let's take a
look at the camera application here
we've got camcorder and camera and if we
turn on just the camera application
obviously it's going to be blank but we
can switch to the front-facing camera
and you can say I to me hey how you
doing and it's got this really cool
real-time effect thing so I can make my
face look really weird
hopefully the cameras picking
up I can move this dot around the screen
that's the weirdest face I've ever seen
we can change that around to vignette we
can change it I mean this is these are
really cool real-time effects grayscale
kind of like an old-fashioned movie
negative
well that is creepy aqua all of the
newer HTC devices have this and this is
a really fun feature it's kind of like
photobooth on the Mac and it's just it's
a lot of fun and you can take pictures
like this you can take full videos like
this so watch this I can actually film a
video with my face well they actually
limit the number of features you can do
when you do video so if I say record the
video hey everybody I am recording a
video and negative and then we go back
we click play so you can add a lot of
fun with the cameras on the HTC
Thunderbolt certainly has the graphic
power and the CPU to be able to do these
effects in real time and as you're gonna
see in the full review of the photo
quality's really really good on the HTC
Thunderbolt both in terms of 720p video
recording and also taking photos eight
megapixels close-up bright light it just
does it all really really well now in
terms of battery life battery life isn't
so great on the Thunderbolt it's
probably about what you would get on the
Evo maybe a little bit better since
certainly Android has evolved since then
and usually with every incremental
upgrade an HTC sends and Android you get
better battery life so we're gonna say
you can get through about a day with
heavy use if you're using it a ton you
probably won't get through the day you
want to keep a charger around in terms
of moderate use you'll go a little bit
more than a day a day and a half a day
and a quarter and light use you'll get
about two days of usage out of the HTC
Thunderbolt so coming up soon on
pocketnow.com we're gonna have the full
review with sample pictures more notes
on performance and overall impressions
there's a lot of interesting nuances
about this device that we're going to
talk about in the review we hope you
enjoyed our video coverage of the HTC
Thunderbolt if there's anything you
still want to see drop us a comment and
we'll try to get to it
please thumbs up this video if you liked
it and thank
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
