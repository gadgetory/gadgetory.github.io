actually looking at three high phones
this year Samsung stands behind its
rating for the galaxy s7 active and
Netflix just realized that making things
more expensive doesn't always pay off
I'm hi Mary vera and today I do agree
with Murphy if something can go wrong
trust me it will this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you want to call it that way as
AT&amp;amp;T has just become some vocal deals
with its prepaid services and plans now
the funny part of the reason why I say
sort of is because the amount of
restrictions for to be able to get a buy
one get one free phone or just so crazy
that I would just rather you read the
link of the description but it's not
necessarily bad it's just too damn
complicated I one company that is not
celebrating today is Netflix became
extremely unpopular for raising its
prices to 999 ensuring markets and that
the company was expecting that they were
gonna land I don't know two million
customers internationally 500,000 the
United States and that then really
happened more or less 1.5 million in
quarter results in a hundred and fifty
thousand new users in the United States
terrible numbers Netflix you're the only
company that actually expects to get
more out of charging people more money
how about if we could at least have more
than two TVs at the same time some very
interesting news or the fact that
Softbank that completely pretty much
owned sprint just acquired arm for a
couple of billion dollars and this is
big deal because for those of you that
didn't know smartphone mobile processor
pretty much based on ARM architecture
with the exception of certain Intel
processors out there pretty much all the
others are based on arm designs so yeah
even though it took this company forever
to take off until the smartphone
revolution it now takes off and we
wonder exactly why it got sold let's see
what we get in the future if you
remember the Consumer Reports pretty
much pan the galaxy s have an active
over its emerging rating claiming that
IP 68 is not necessarily accurate the
company tested two different galaxy s7
actives
these did not pass the submersion tests
so Samsung just came on record and
decided to claim that the company made
all the testing they had to end of the
galaxy s7 is definitely ip68 water and
dust-resistant whether that's true or
not is just a topic for debate I really
like the Galaxy s7 active I don't know
your mileage may vary I guess and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus
iphone 7 pro we've got some leaked
images that show less three phones not
too it seems that there is a plus
variant in the middle that's pretty much
just like the iphone 7 and then there's
the pro variant with dual cameras and
the smart connector at the bottom this
would be the first time that Apple
pretty much launches three phones at the
same time that don't have one of these
being pretty much a mid-ranger and it's
extremely interesting we cannot wait to
see what the plan is it makes all the
sense in the world don't get me wrong
but it leads me to the question of the
day do you think that it's a smart idea
for Apple to have the 4.7 inch to 5.5
inch and then the iphone 7 pro on the
side in my case i think that it is a
smart idea a lot of people really will
want to spend a lot of money on the plus
variant then again the reason why i'm
skeptical now is because i really want
the pro and i know it's gonna be crazy
expensive now because these are going to
be catering to the pro market i wonder
if that Apple pencil ego works on that
thing leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
