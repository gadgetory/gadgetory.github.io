they were a disaster the LG G flex 2
rumors claim that will see a smaller and
better display and google has already
begun testing android apps on Chrome OS
I'm high metal iveta and I am just on
the verge of starting to hibernate for
my weekend and i know you are too this
is parking out daily let's begin today
with what's official as Apple's iPhone 6
pre-orders we're supposed to begin at
3am eastern time which is midnight
pacific time and my god some people they
begun three hours later some of us
wanted to pre-order the phone for the
longest time it didn't work and we had
to wait and then refresh and try
different browsers and it was just a
disaster the internet was on fire last
night with people complaining about
apples way of handling pre-orders it
just gets terrible by the year now the
very interesting part and probably the
most annoying is that you can still
pre-order the phone right now and get it
on September 19th as of the time of the
recording of this video and so far AT&amp;amp;T
is saying that these are unprecedented
sales for the iphone 6 so far so it's
not that Apple has not sold enough it's
just that they probably figured out the
man this time now one of the biggest
questions that a lot of people ask this
why did we not get sapphire on the
iphone 6 and yes rumors claim that
according to chinese suppliers they were
not able to meet the demand of the
iphone 6 manufacturing by as much as 75
percent meaning they were only able to
build twenty-five percent of the iphone
demand if they were to build sapphire
because of so many manufacturing
difficulties so clearly sapphire is
going to be held for the Apple watch by
the start of next year and the same
thing can be said about the iphone 6s in
the future I guess and for those of you
are wondering exactly what HTC is
planning with this whole double exposure
event at the beginning of October it
turns out that apparently the company
wants to launch its for its camera its
first GoPro competitor camera and even
though we still don't have any specifics
on what we're getting it seems that yes
the company wants to work on doing this
optics and sort of branch out from their
current market which is great I mean
companies that have done this like Apple
have survived this way
they just figure something better than
four alter pixels another rumor that we
have for the end of this year is the LG
G flex 2 the g flex was decent we
reviewed it we torture tested it and we
liked everything about the phone except
the size and the display at 720p and
terrible color accuracy and rumors have
it that LG will bring us a much better
display but this time it'll be a smaller
one which is great it's great that we
get both problems solved it's apparently
not going to be 2k they don't confirm
that but apparently they say that it
will be better than 1080p so this is
something that we would lift a test and
finally for the very very interesting
news of the day it seems that google is
already testing android applications on
Chrome OS though it is kind of limited
at the moment only Evernote and another
four titles are being tested on Chrome
OS but yes whatever they promised the
google i/o that was going to happen is
now happening we now have to promise
that we can buy a Chrome OS computer or
buy an android tablet or buy an android
smartphone and actually be able to use
the same applications from the google
play store which is great it's finally
happening finally you get an extra value
for being in the Android ecosystem that
is not getting Twitter in a bloated
fashion and a tablet that's definitely
not getting value now hopefully Google
is going to figure out a way to not
stretch things on a computer screen and
do things better but that leads you to
the question of the day would you buy a
Chrome OS computer if you got good
applications working on it meaning the
full google play store working on Chrome
OS because in my case for two hundred
and fifty dollars that the average
Chrome OS computer costs yes I would
definitely buy in and it would make
things much more compelling but leave us
a comment down below what's your case
