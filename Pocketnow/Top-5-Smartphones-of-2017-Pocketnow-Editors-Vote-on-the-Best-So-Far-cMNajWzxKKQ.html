batch of major smartphone announcements
are just around the corner it's the
perfect time to check in with the
current crop of phones for a quick
ranking using a secret ballot the entire
team at PocketNow voted on their
favorite phones released so far in 2017
the numbers have been tallied and it's
time to share the results in 5th place
we have a tie between 1 plus 5 and the
Huawei p10 it's fitting that these two
share two spot dual cameras screaming
performance though each offers some
outsider cred for the phone enthusiasts
looking to stand out from the crowd
though personally I maybe prefer one
design over the other the oneplus 5
release wasn't without some controversy
but this phone continues to deliver near
flagship grade hardware at a more
affordable price and the p10 is a little
less well known to North Americans but
Huawei's partnership with Leica produces
formidable camera performance and the
carand chipset is a handy competitor to
the mostly qualcomm LED market HTC lands
4th place with the u 11 HTC has a long
road to walk in winning back hearts and
minds but this beauty in blue is a step
in the right direction a liquid mirror
finish helps catch the eye and that's
backed up by fantastic performance a
competitive price and some of the
coolest ear scanning audio technology
we've ever heard we still wish HTC and
Android could benefit from true USB
audio support as these peripherals are
proprietary but the U 11 is one of the
most polished phones figuratively and
literally of the sixteen by nine screen
era moving in the third is the
blackberry key one another story of
rebuilding a brand blackberry partnering
with TCL would seem to be a match made
in heaven you'd have to have a heart of
stone to not find this throwback
charming nicely updated for modern
smartphone users the key one blends
old-school hardware tricks with current
Android software wrapped up in a shell
designed for grown-ups
the keyboard is terrific but our
favorite throwback to classic
blackberries is how you'll get battery
for days it's an interesting device
folks might dismiss it as being old
fashioned but
wins a lot of people over once you put
it in their hands the second place in
our roundup LG scores big with the g6
the first fun this year to stretch the
screen dual cameras with the industry's
only ultra wide sensor a new metal and
glass build and enhanced lifestyle
durability rated for both water and drop
resistance one of the most praised by
reviewers but likely to be the most
underrated by consumers after some
disappointing missteps in the past LG is
on a much better track with a design and
feature set we'll be excited to see
evolve over future phones in first place
is anyone surprised to see the Galaxy s8
no no one is surprised without question
the most stunning example of design
produced this year and the second phone
to arrive with an extreme screen the
body ratio the s8 is an exceptional
rebound from the issues this company
faced last year samsung has worked hard
to become more of a lifestyle brand but
the SH shows they can deliver a gorgeous
device which still packs a ton of tech
the off-center fingerprint sensor was a
common gripe in our notes and we hope to
see Samsung try something more daring
with the camera on future phones but at
the time this video was produced you
won't find a more complete premium
consumer all-rounder there's literally
something here for everyone and that
wraps up our list maybe most exciting
and counting up these votes the spread
from third place to first was only three
points we had a really close ballot 2017
is already another great year for phones
and consumers will certainly benefit
from some terrific competition did your
phone make the list
