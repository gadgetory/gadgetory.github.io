processor that will power the galaxy s7
ipad sales are on the Klein and have
reportedly left suppliers in dire stress
and Samsung has just announced that
humongous tablet for those of you in
need I'm Hyneman ravenna wondering why
would anybody ever call a non-portable
computer a tablet this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
the Samsung Galaxy view we've been
covering a couple of these rumors over
the last few days on the website but
well this is one of those products
that's just weird it's an 18.4 inch
1080p display tablet with a 2 gigs of
ram and just meet your specific ations
all around it's really a product for
content consumption but it reminds us
more of a portable television or should
I say it looks more like affordable
television than a tablet even though
it's being considered and sold as a
tablet for those of you interested licks
in this for full details hopefully we
get a price tag at some point and let's
continue what Samsung we do know that
the company is working hard on getting
the Snapdragon 820 to power its Galaxy
s7 but we also know that's not the only
processor there's also the Exynos 88-90
codenamed Mongoose for those of you that
remember which is this processor that's
supposedly going to be much faster than
the Apple a 9 great but even more
interesting apparently it will be ready
for mass production a sub december
meaning that the whole rumor of a
possible launch of the galaxy s7 in
early january or februari is actually
doable let's just see if it happens now
one of the most anticipated product
launches that most of us are waiting for
our Nintendo games on mobile the
company's new CEO is recently on record
teasing that we should expect news on
the company's first mobile game as of
tomorrow and even though we're still
skeptical as to how Nintendo plans to
sell this product but what the whole
concept will be it's great to see that
we will finally get a Nintendo game on
mobile let's just hope that it works
across platform number one number two
it's not too expensive and number three
but it has to do with any of its popular
titles because true we would like a new
Nintendo game but we would also like it
to be based on the products that we grew
up with
and then another anticipated product has
just found delays let's talk about the
Nexus 6p people are already complaining
number one that their Nexus 6p that was
supposed to arrive either today or
tomorrow won't because apparently
they're getting notify that it will
happen until early to mid November
because apparently google is struggling
to produce the 128 gigabyte aluminum
variants of the Nexus 6p and it seems
that it's also struggling with the 64
gig burien now we don't have any
official news we just know that Google
is going to give these people a
consolation $25 prize a refund whenever
the phone arrives and if you match that
with the fifty-dollar google play credit
that you're getting it's actually a
sweet deal but waiting for a phone isn't
sadly finally the rather interesting
news of the day have to do with the ipad
for those of you that remember
yesterday's news ipad sales are on the
client and significantly down by two
million units compared to the same
quarter last year and we've already got
trusted sources claiming that the ipad
that's actually struggling the most are
the many ipads you know that 7.9 inch
variants of either the ipad mini 2 or
the ipad mini 4 that are currently on
sale and it's up to the point where
these suppliers have actually had to let
go of facilities and are actually laying
people off while apple figures something
out but it does lead me to the question
of the day why do you think the ipad
mini is selling less when compared to
the larger ipads in my case i find it
actually weird because this is a the
best product for playing games in my
opinion but then again it's cumbersome
for everything else leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know what you
think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the rose
