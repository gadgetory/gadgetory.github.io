Google Nexus tablet rumors start getting
strong and the HTC one x and s is closer
to a store near you all this and more
coming up right now hello everyone I'm
hi Emma with pocket now and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off what's hot
even if you were to launch as many
versions of the Galaxy Nexus as you want
it sadly none of these smartphones can
beat the samsung galaxy s2 and
performance the Exynos processor is the
benchmark processor to beat and we've
got images of the road back coming up so
far to informations here are very
important first of all is the
possibility the mix LTE and quad-core
processors together any of you that know
the story of the HTC One X bringing
quad-core to Europe and sadly not the
same for the United States because it
can mix LTE with quad-core we'll be
happy to know that probably the next
generation samsung galaxy s3 could
probably bring it and saying it is the
fact that it will support DirectX 11
with the GPU so really good information
coming from Samsung and other than that
we've also got leaked renders of what to
expect from the samsung galaxy s3 now
the renders look a lot like the galaxy
s2 not that it was ugly anyways it's a
very beautiful phone so this design
could probably just get better materials
for the future because the current
Galaxy Nexus in galaxy s2 are a little
bit too plasticky let's see what happens
the only thing better than getting in a
sous transformer prime infinity 700 is
having issues manufacture the next
Google Nexus tablet rumors are strong
that we will be getting a nexus tablet
eventually and apparently issues is
going to be the manufacturer now let's
hope it's not going to be the same deal
we got with the motorola xoom in the
past with honeycomb because that was
apparently the Nexus stock Android
tablet but still it seems that we will
be having that Nexus tablet but that's
not really the most important news here
apparently it seems that google plans to
bring you the cheapest tablet in the
market with their nexus tablet hopefully
that doesn't mean cheap specs hopefully
we will be getting great specs like the
quad core processor that we already know
them too
and hopefully again we will be getting
this nexus tablet eventually soon no
matter the price now imagine the assu
spat phone being transformed into the
next Nexus device that's also the next
Nexus tablet that'll be my device out of
this week's coverage make sure you catch
Michael Fisher's recent round of videos
on how to get android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich to run on another than your HP
TouchPad so far so good even though we
thought the thing was dead other than
that also catch Joe Levi's recent round
of videos of his android guy weekly
editorial this time he's talking about
why should root your phone or why you
should not root your phone to root or
not to root that is the question aside
from that also catch Nicky Adams recent
review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
from Verizon you remember in the past
Brandon went through the Wi-Fi model and
so far well deke gave it 3.5 stars out
of 5 catch the link in the description
to see why and finally make sure you
catch the Sony Xperia S review which
also made 4 stars out of 5 even though
is a really good phone catch the link in
the description to see why now let's
talk about roms we recently heard that
HTC released their full source code for
their recent flagship devices at least
the ones that are still in the market
the sensation the succession XC and the
vivid and we also know that Sampson came
up and said okay here's the source code
for the samsung galaxy s2 for android
4.2 i scream sandwich also now one other
interesting thing is the fact that well
we don't have the HTC One X on the
market yet but we recently got a leaked
full version of the ROM and we also got
a rooted thing so we all know that the
chips are going to be busy from now on
so stay tuned for xda-developers for
that aside from that and now talking
about HTC is the fact that they recently
sent out invitations for a sprint HTC
event to happen on April fourth and
guess what their CEO and HTC president
are going to be there so could this be
the launch of the HTC official devices
for the United States bringing either
the 1x or the 1s hopefully that's going
to be the case so stay tuned for our
full coverage on the event and hey
speaking of Sprint we also have new
rumors that sprint plans to finally
bring their LTE version of the galaxy
nexus to the market now obviously what's
first the chicken or the egg obviously
we need LTE
from sprint to be launched for whenever
we're going to get the LTE variant of
the galaxy nexus for sprint but
apparently it seems that they're all
planning to have everything launched in
mid-april interesting enough is to see
that we have an HTC event being launched
on early April and then we have
apparently another event to launch their
Galaxy Nexus so hopefully these would
happen at the same time we're also going
to be getting the LG viper which barely
made some news at CES so stay tuned to
see what happens with sprint because
obviously they've been a little quiet
this year hopefully they will be working
on bringing something component to the
market all right so that does it for
what's hot let's continue on with what's
not and tell me what's the only reason
why you would pay the full unsubsidized
price for a nexus smartphone well on my
list the only reason is because i want
android to be pushed to me whenever it
comes out and i have to wait for
carriers and manufacturers to decide
when they want to do it sadly it seems
that the nexus s didn't get that memo
because it was months ago that Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich was launched it
was also months ago then we came out
with our video of the leaked version
coming to the Nexus S but sadly the
official rom is not out there either for
the Nexus S or the nexus s 4g the
questions why I mean the Galaxy Nexus is
the only device right now well that got
pushed android 4.0 ice cream sandwich
out of the box but then eventually we're
still waiting for the update to be
official for the nexus s there's no
point in having to rule your device to
be able to do this if google's promises
that this is the real android smartphone
you have to wait for anything so not
sure what's going on with the nexus s
google came on record to say that we
were going to get it in the next coming
rate weeks it's coming real soon sadly i
mean what's the point might as well just
go for anything else i mean right now
we've got what HTC devices and samsung
device is already getting ice cream
sandwich and the Nexus S hasn't what's
going on that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm hi

up if you liked what you saw that's it

round of videos on how to root Android
