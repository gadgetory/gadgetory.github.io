directed to case makers tell us what to
expect Verizon and Samsung Mar both
admitting that the galaxy s5 has camera
issues and Microsoft finally completes
the Nokia acquisition I'm hiding that I
am forgive me if I celebrate the thank
God it's Friday but I've been waiting
all week for this day this is parking
out daily let's begin today with the
official news as Microsoft has finalized
its acquisition of Nokia it is now
official though there is no word of
Microsoft mobile anywhere all we know
now is that Nokia will continue Stephen
Elop will be the new VP of devices and
services and he will be in charge of
Nokia and also of the service lineup
which is really interesting let's see
what we get from these products in the
future as we can't calm companies
anymore now let's talk about HTC we
continue covering official news and
these are actually sad ones as Scott
crow which is the lead designer from HTC
has decided to leave the company and
even though he's not being specific as
to why he's leaving the company or do we
know where he's going yes this is the
guy that designed the HTC One the One X
the One m8 and pretty much every hot HTC
phone out there this guy is one of the
geniuses behind this and obviously we
can't wait to see what HTC is planning
next as yeah he will be missed that's
how about Google we know that the
company is planning to revamp all of its
services with new designs and everything
we've got some leaks of that we talked
about yesterday but interesting we get
some weights of Google now and there is
no home button at the bottom anymore
there is this big Google logo so
apparently there are rumors that google
is planning to get rid of the home
button this is really interesting as the
company is planning to make this a ok
Google everywhere service available and
we wonder if that'll mean that will get
the same Motorola always on services
even though phones aren't really
optimized for that let's see what we get
now let's talk about Apple we get some
leaked renders that were actually Dustin
to a case maker and these renders show
us what to expect of the 4.7 inch iPhone
this device will be just point 6
millimeters thick but even hotter we get
confirmation that there is a side power
button instead up at the top there is
confirmation that for some reason there
is no dual LED here in the flash
apparently there's just a single LED
and yeah this phone is thinner it's 4.7
inch or it'll look a lot like the galaxy
s5 in size only a little smaller which
is interesting as the galaxy s5 has a
5-inch display and you know it's not
that big but anyways let's see what we
get as yes case makers have a way of
getting their own things but they had
been wrong remember the iphone 4s and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day verizon is just admitted that
the galaxy s5 on their network has
camera issues we've been talking about
this and yes Samsung has ended up
admitting it as well but apparently this
is only exclusive to verizon smartphones
it's really hard to tell but verizon is
willing to swap your phone if you have
the issue link solution for the full
procedure of what you have to do but you
get a new phone which is great but that
is you to the question of the day don't
you find it interesting that they're not
calling all this camera gate I mean
every time that Apple has a problem
whatever problem they call it
antennagate skup gate scratch gate and
it's interesting how Samsung has been
able to control what is happening with
its galaxy s5 though it could just be
that Samsung was boasting the other ones
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think about this and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming she follow us on parking out our
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
