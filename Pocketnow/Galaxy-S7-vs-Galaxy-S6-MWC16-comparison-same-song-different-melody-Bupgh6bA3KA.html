like every year for the latest Samsung
Galaxy this year is the Samsung Galaxy
s7 and it's so different than the galaxy
s6 we're here to take a look at the
differences and a lot of similarities
among the two so let's go check it out
the galaxy s7 and the galaxy s6 might
look a lot alike but there are
differences under the glass so to speak
the most important one is that Samsung
is making the galaxy s7 and the Galaxy
s7 edge but for the sake of this
particular video we're going to refer
only to the galaxy s7 they made it
waterproof so now you can go for a swim
with your Galaxy s7 it's rated ip68 for
immersion for up to 30 minutes in fresh
water the other differences which
Samsung has been calling an innovation
others have innovated like years before
this they finally added back the microSD
card support a lot of people passed on
the galaxy s6 because of the fact that
it did not support expandable storage
what you were watching bought was what
you got was much you needed to live with
right now
you can expand beyond work 32 gigs of
storage with a micro SD card of up to 2
terabytes other changes under the hood
are referring to specifications the
galaxy s6 has a slower processor because
galaxy s7 has been upgraded to the
Exynos 88-90 which is the latest
octa-core processor from Samsung not all
galaxy s7 s will be powered by the
section whose processor depending on the
region some will get the Snapdragon 820
same processor which is currently
powering the LG g5 memory has been
bumped to 4 gigabytes vs. 3 gigabytes
and that's pretty much everything in
terms of performance you can look up the
specifications of PocketNow or anywhere
on the web camera has been reduced to 12
megapixels versus the 16 megapixels on
the last year's model because they're
now using a different sensor which is
more sensitive to light better low-light
photography will be possible also
because the new
is a breyer lens at f 1.7 vs f 1.9 but
let's talk about the in hand feel
something you cannot read on the
Internet the galaxy s7 from this year
feels a lot better in the hand while
maintaining that feel of being
substantial it is slightly curved on the
back and I can only make this analogy
imagine the note 5 but in a smaller form
factor the curvature of the galaxy s6
edge and of the s7 edge is found on the
bottom of the s7 it feels really really
good there are no sharp corners it feels
like a nicely polished pebble and that's
also valid for the galaxy s7 edge as
well the new devices come with android
marshmallow out of the box
same Samsung user interface on top of it
which some of you might applaud some of
you might frown upon but it's been
optimized and from our brief hands-on
experience we can tell you that it's
snappy it was snappy on the s6 and his
ass snappy on the s7 as it was and as it
can possibly yet
fingerprint scanner has been maintained
for your on locking Solutions or Samsung
pay or any other biometrical
identification which you might set up in
your accounts
and the battery has been upgraded to
3000 milliamp hours over 25 50 million
powers from last year and this was the
second thing people had in mind when
they passed on the yellow cs6 in
addition to the lack of microSD card
expansion solutions it was the poor
battery life now Samsung has fixed that
we have an additional 450 million powers
which will hopefully help you get
throughout a medium to average high
average usage day there's a lot more to
talk about in terms of software in terms
of camera features and it's just so many
information we can pack into a short and
dirty comparison we'll go in that once
we have all these in our labs for a
proper comparison but until then this
will have to do it
I have an aunt in the United market now
thank you very much for watching this
was a quick comparison of the galaxy s7
and the galaxy s6 we'll be back with
more pocket now's MWC 2016 coverage is
