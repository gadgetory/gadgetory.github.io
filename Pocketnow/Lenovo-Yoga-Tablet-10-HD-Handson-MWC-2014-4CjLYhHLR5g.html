yoga tablet 8 but we got something you
are for you
which is the Lenovo yoga tablet 10 full
HP plus I meant on Hana behind the
camera and this is our hands on of the
new tablet it's called the Lenovo yoga
tablet an HD Plus because opposed to the
previous versions the 8 and the 10
ensures this has bumped specifications
especially in the screen we have a
10-inch screen here which is one of 1920
by 1080 in resolution and before we talk
about specs let's go through the tablet
itself which can be propped up easily
using this aluminum thing on the back if
you close it you can always use your
tablet either like this or the other way
around and when you want to prop it it's
going to go into demo mode most probably
when you open this up it will turn on
automatically so you can lay it down on
the table watch a movie and while we're
talking about this you can notice the
two front firing speakers which are
always front firing regardless if it's
propped up or you're holding it in your
hands while stood on the front we have a
front pacer which is one of 1.6
megapixels and not much else it is very
very thin as you can see and that is
most definitely because all of the
important things like the battery and
everything taking up a space is in this
bottom plate right here let's close this
flap and take a look at the back there
is one single camera without flash which
is one of eight megapixels right here
and the entire battery is within this
rounded bug here
that's your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack your volume rockers for volume up
and volume down of course with a
microphone for noise cancellation I'm
guessing that is flipping it to the
other side there's nothing you can see
here so we'll just take a look at the
software so unlocking this as you can
see
is very nice colorful wallpaper which
really pops the colors out the screen
appears to me under these circumstances
to be a high quality display this is
Android 4.3 and it's got Lenovo's own
user interface on top of it and we are
being told that this is a single layer
user interface pretty much like what
Huawei and ZTE do meaning you don't have
an actual application tray but you will
be able to constantly and continuously
scroll and whenever you install a new
application it will add it to either an
existent or create a new home screen
flipping up from the top will see your
usual notifications and from the other
side you have quick access to brightness
settings let's go real quick into the
settings and see if we can find out more
about the tablet for that free Android
as we mentioned before and if we go into
hardware information no there's no other
information here is the model is B 8080
H so this was a quick look at the yoga
tablet 10 HD plus we're gonna have more
from Lenovo as we are here at their
booth and we're planning on showing what
Lenovo is to you guys now with the
motorola acquisition and all so stay
tuned to pocket now Thank You Jaime for
shooting I've been Anton if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
