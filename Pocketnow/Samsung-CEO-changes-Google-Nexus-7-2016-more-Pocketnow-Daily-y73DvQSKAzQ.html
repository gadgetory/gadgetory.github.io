of Google Nexus 7 show as a new OEM and
we'll watch sales estimates continue to
point to it selling more than its
competitors combined and Samsung has
just made some major changes to its
mobile leadership
I'm Hani Medina and the sleep was a
requirement to make these videos I would
definitely get an F every single time
this is PocketNow azalea officially lose
today are rather weird as oneplus was
teasing a product to be announced today
and it's actually not a smartphone it's
a $25 iPhone case no I didn't get that
wrong it's an iPhone case and that
brings the sandstone back that's famous
for oneplus devices but that's not the
end of the story you're actually also
buying an invite for a oneplus 2 or a 1
+ X depending on whatever it is you want
which is rather interesting
so yeah you buy an iPhone case for 25
bucks which is cheaper than Apple's
cases and then you also get an invite
rather weird and for those of you
wondering exactly how well is the
SmartWatch market doing we've got
analysts already predicting that the
Apple watch will actually grow in sales
for the holiday season stead of selling
just 6 billion units within six months
apparently analysts are predicting from
five to six million units being sold
over the next holiday season or the one
that's happening right now which is a
rather good it's far better than its
competitors combined even though those
figures weren't exactly provided yeah
the Apple watch continues to sell but
it's not a zillion does watch out there
even though we all know that Nokia cant
really launch any smartphone until late
next year or after the season and well
we've got more rumors of the Nokia c1 we
actually covered these rumors early in
September and now it seems that even
though those rumors claim that Nokia
killed the project and other prototypes
see does the c1 is still going to make
it we're not exactly sure if it's just
the product that will be teased all a
Nokia you know the previous Microsoft
company that would announce a product
early in the year and then launch it
until the end of the year that could be
the case and it wouldn't be actually a
bad idea for the mindshare let's just
see if it happens we've already got
trusted
she's talking about a future Nexus 7 and
obviously by this time of the year it
just won't happen now the sources claim
it'll happen sometime within 2016 but it
seems that a soos will not be the OEM
and this can be good or bad a shoes was
definitely famous for launching the
first two Nexus 7's because wow they
were able to keep that tablet on a
budget the first one was not that good
but the second was an amazing tablet and
still lives one of the best 7-inch
tablets out there right now after so
many years but apparently the next OEM
will be Huawei we're not exactly sure
what innovations we'll be getting here
but yeah sometime within 2016 let's hope
the price tag remains the same and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with Samsung's replacement of
JK Shin or should we say some very
interesting leadership changes like for
example JK Shin will remain in charge of
the mobile division but it seems that he
won't be in charge of day-to-day
operations which is usually what a CEO
does this will now be handled by dungeon
Co which means that this is the person
that will be responsible for whatever
Samsung Galaxy smartphones we get in the
future Shin will apparently be working
on the long term but it's really hard to
predict exactly what is this change
going to imply if this is just a very
nice way to say goodbye Shin in the very
close future not exactly sure about that
but it does lead me to the question of
the day even with Samsung's success this
here what wouldn't you change from the
current Galaxy lineup that you would
love to see in next year's flagships in
my case don't get rid of the IR scanner
please that you did it with the note 5
and please PLEASE include some
expandable storage at least that leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your case friends as always you
