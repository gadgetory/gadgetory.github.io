of Google Nexus 7 show is a new OEM
apple watch sales estimates continued to
point to it selling more than its
competitors combined and Samsung has
just made some major changes to its
mobile leadership I'm hi meri behna and
the sleep was a requirement to make
these videos I would definitely get an F
every single time this is parking out
daily official lose today are rather
weird as 1 plus was teasing a product to
be announced today and it's actually not
a smartphone it's a $25 iphone case no I
didn't get that wrong it's an iphone
case and that brings the sandstone back
that's famous for 1 plus devices but
that's not the end of the story you're
actually also buying an invite for a 1 +
2 or 1 plus sex depending on whatever it
is you want which is rather interesting
so yeah you buy an iphone case for 25
bucks which is cheaper than apples cases
and then you also get an invite rather
weird and for those of you wondering
exactly how well is the SmartWatch
market doing we've got analysts already
predicting that the apple watch will
actually grow in sales for the holiday
season instead of selling just 6 billion
units within six months apparently
analysts are predicting from five to six
million units being sold over the next
holiday season or the one that's
happening right now which is a rather
good it's far better than its
competitors combined even though those
figures weren't exactly provided yeah
the Apple watch continues to sell but
it's not a zillion does watch out there
even though we all know that Nokia can't
really launch any smartphone until late
next year or after the season well we've
got more rumors of the nokia c1 we
actually covered these rumors early in
September and now it seems that even
though those rumors claim that Nokia
killed the project and other prototypes
see that the c1 is still going to make
it we're not exactly sure if it's just
the product that will be teased all a
Nokia you know the previous Microsoft
company that would announce a product
early in the year and then launch it
until the end of the year that could be
the case and it wouldn't be actually a
bad idea for the mindshare let's just
see if it happens we've already got
trusted
sources talking about a future Nexus 7
and obviously by this time of the year
just won't happen now the sources claim
it'll happen sometime within twenty
sixteen but it seems that a sous will
not be the OEM and this can be good or
bad a shoes was definitely famous for
launching the first two Nexus 7's
because wow they were able to keep that
tablet on a budget the first one was not
that good but the second was an amazing
tablet it still is one of the best
7-inch tablets out there right now after
so many years but apparently the next
OEM will be huawei we're not exactly
sure what innovations will be getting
here but yeah sometime within 2016 let's
hope the price tag remains the same and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with Samsung's replacement of
JK shin or should we say some very
interesting leadership changes like for
example JK Shin will remain in charge of
the mobile division but it seems that he
won't be in charge of day-to-day
operations which is usually what a CEO
does this will now be handled by Don
Janko which means that this is the
person that will be responsible for
whatever Samsung Galaxy smartphones we
get in the future Shin will apparently
be working on the long term but it's
really hard to predict exactly what is a
this change going to implyer this is
just a very nice way to say goodbye shin
and the very close future not exactly
sure about that but it does lead me to
the question of the day even when Sam
sings success this here what would you
change from the current galaxy lineup
that you would love to see in next
year's flagships in my case don't get
rid of the IR scanner please that you
did it with the note 5 and please please
include some expandable storage at least
that there was a comment down below we'd
love to know your case friends as always
you know the drill if he want to get it
