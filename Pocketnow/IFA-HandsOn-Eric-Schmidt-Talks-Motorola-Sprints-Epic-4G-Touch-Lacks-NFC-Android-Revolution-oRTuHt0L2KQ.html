show you what's hot in android Eric
Schmidt goes on record to talk about the
motorola deal and the sprint galaxy s2
already disappoints all this and more
coming up right now
hello everyone I'm high never be better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android Revolution the shore we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off with what's
hot after a crazy week full of Samsung
releases that even made us put android
revolution a couple of days just to be
able to cover them let's go through
what's going to happen with these
devices first of all let's talk about
the samsung galaxy s know which is that
5-inch display stylist face device sammy
is going to be pushed till twenty-twelve
in the UK and there's no defined date
for the United States whenever it
happens first of all just know that
Samsung just released their galaxy s2 in
white for Vodafone UK so hopefully it's
not going to take much time now the
risin finally and I mean finally has
launched their droid bionic and it's
going to be available for orders as of
September 8 so be ready for it because
everybody's been waiting for it and
while talking about AT&amp;amp;T now the LG
thrill 4g and the HTC jetstream have
just begun being sold in AT&amp;amp;T and while
the throw 4G brings the 3d love that
AT&amp;amp;T has been missing and the HTC
jetstream brings HTC Sense on a tablet
android tablet honeycomb for ATT though
sadly that's the only common sense it
makes because it's a seven hundred
dollar price tag for a fully subsidized
tablet I think they're crazy but anyways
AT&amp;amp;T is also offering their mid-range
highway impulse 4g so if you're looking
out for a mid-range device that's also
available now talking about the UK again
sony ericsson xperia arc s got priced in
europe but it's going to cost you around
600 bucks after you after the exchange
rates so if they're already receiving to
pre-orders ass up September 26 so make
sure you're looking around for that
though we still don't have a clear
picture on one that's making it to the
United States and well aside from that
the other xperia ray has also been
released in the UK for pre-orders as of
September 5th which was a couple of days
ago so make sure you look out for that
too and while by the way if you're
looking for that samsung epic 4g touch
which is the variant of the galaxy s2
that's being sold in Sprint's make sure
you look around for Wirefly because they
currently have it fifty dollars off on
pre-order really good device is really
good deals hopefully we get some more
concrete dates for other devices
that we've been waiting for very soon
and well our man Evan Blass expert in
all leagues foreign domestic just hooked
us up with some more leaks and well
first of all one disappointing note
Samson pretty much confirmed that they
will be doing the nexus prime and then
it'll carry Ice Cream Sandwich as we all
know but the sad news here is that
apparently it will bring a wvga screen
and wvga I mean I remember when my old
HTC touch pro2 was hot last decade with
a screen resolution that was that but
there's really bad I mean this is the
time of qhd and even 720p is what we
were expecting but sadly that apparently
is not going to be the case now the good
news is that it's been confirmed that
ice cream sandwiches on scheduled to be
released around October November so
hopefully my advice to you hold onto
your wallets because most probably this
will be the hottest device of the year
on a good note the samsung stratosphere
just hit the FCC with some verizon LTE
love and it seems that it will bring the
sliding keyboard soon to your verizon
network hopefully somewhere around
September the HTC rhyme was also leaked
as an Android offering for verizon as
early as September also and apparently
it already got certified for dland a
support so it does seem to be a very hot
device to on AT&amp;amp;T the HTC holiday
already proved to have some AT&amp;amp;T LTE
love it has a qHD display and apparently
it's going to be the hot topic for ATT
eventually and finally LG is already
talking about an optimist 3d too for
next year and apparently it's going to
be just 7 millimeters thin you imagine
that well according to them it's even
going to bring enhancements in 3d
technology for you to not get any eye
strain so hopefully these leaks and
rumors will be better for next year or
probably sooner this year let's see what
happens and while out of our own
coverage this week our men and tandy
naggy was at Berlin for our IFA event
and was nice enough to film some
hands-on videos of the samsung galaxy s
note the lg optimus sol the sony
ericsson xperia arc s and the neo v
which you can find on our youtube
channel and our posts within the website
sadly Anton was nice enough to also get
beer but not send us any so shame on you
man and while Joe Levi's currently also
posted an article
a samsung pure breeze app launcher which
we do recommend you have a look at on
our website and while Adam lines
currently already reviewing the LG
thrill 4g though sadly he's not too
thrilled about the device according to
him on twitter well he gets to see
android crash on 3d which is not really
good news but make sure you look at the
review most probably there will be some
good things about the device you
probably can look at if you're
interested in buying Eric Schmidt
Google's former CEO and current
executive chairman on the board just
came on record to state that they didn't
really buy motorola only for the pens
according to him he's really confident
on the future roadmap up device is
coming from motorola and he's also
confident on the team that's working
there and that's probably one of the
main reasons why they didn't really
absorb the company completely they're
letting it work on its own now well
let's talk about it i mean motorola did
a really good job in putting android on
the map they weren't the first to
release an android device but they did a
really good job in marketing and in the
vise quality and well android pretty
much got motorola add a chapter 11
whenever they were almost going to fall
there so that's really good but let's be
honest i mean the only flop there was
blur but still it is working in well
google is not really losing here it's
25,000 pens that are currently held by
motorola even if devices sucked those
pens really make android future be you
know promising because obviously there
are other patent trolls with the size of
the fruit that we all know about that
are really making things hard for
Android manufacturers so hopefully this
will really help android rome app for
the future i consider a smart move
okay so that does it for what's hot
let's continue on with what's not and
let me get this straight sprint samsung
and google were the ones that pretty
much pioneered NFC technology in the
United States with Google Wallet on
sprint on the sprint Nexus S that came
from Samsung so why is it that the AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile variants of the samsung
galaxy s2 do bring NFC technology but
then the Sprint's epic 4g touch i think
that's the name it's a long name variant
galaxy s2 is not bringing it I mean
what's going on here is it is this
showing that NFC did not work on sprint
as well as they expected could this be
that Google Wallet actually flopped that
they don't want to prove it or at least
tell about it I mean that's really a
flop by our standards I mean not really
understanding why a Samsung device and
all the three players that are working
here that not bring this technology but
then it came to other devices other
variants and other networks what's going
on here now what's this rumor about
Samson dropping Android for their own
proprietary Linux based OS I mean are
they crazy first of all remember that
Android was really what puts a me on the
map again for smartphones after windows
mobile and those omnia devices there
were good but not great and well Android
was really being benefited by Samsung's
sexiness in design with their Galaxy S
line now these are really bad news first
of all for everybody because Sam's legs
not really going to win here first of
all developers don't really have the
energy of pushing applications to more
operating systems just think about
what's happening to Honeycomb right now
I mean honeycomb is Android but
developers are not really doing a good
job in quickly porting their
applications because it's more work
first of all and will imagine an echo
system of devices from Samsung that
won't really have applications I really
see a flop there and well androids going
to be losing their most famous designer
as of now not really good news but and
you know obviously Samson could probably
think of a way to bring Android
applications to work on this Linux based
OS hopefully that's going to be the case
but not really sure what to expect I
don't really think it's beneficial for
anybody in
Samson were first talking about webos
then windows phone 7 and what about this
I mean you already got bought and it's
you know it's doing well but it's not
really doing perfectly so let's see what
happens that's it for today show thank
you very much for watching I'm High
Middle you better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
