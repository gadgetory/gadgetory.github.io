hydrogen infused water this is like h8
Oh
tastes like water can the razor phone to
proved to be an even sharper phone than
before and then after that we get into a
heated discussion regarding the Google
pixel 3 which of course we have reviews
coming in the coming days hello
everybody and welcome to this episode of
the weekly it is episode number 327 on
this day it is what day is it guys
it is technically October 12 right now
because we were recording this podcast
very late at night here in Los Angeles
these guys are finally in my neck of the
woods so I'm really excited for that so
from Razer hats to pixel phones to razor
phones and tablets and peripherals we're
talking about all the things you wish
you had when you were a kid let's get
started and let's have a chat welcome to
the PocketNow weekly weekly I just went
to an official intro because he didn't
do what well I would do it after the
fact
oh it's a podcast bro he put my podcasts
I don't mind show apologize that's what
happens when you are tired across the
country and you've had you know what it
for once you guys are in my neck of the
woods because I'm always coming out to
see you I'm at first yeah I've seen this
is actually the first time we come to an
event in LA yeah like seriously everyone
everyone well I mean this is this is
razors backyard so of course it would be
here yeah they're in Irvine which you
know it's a little far then I got make
everyone go to Irvine Orange County so
you know we brought that up already
you're gonna set up here I wanted to set
up my razor while we were here I already
said yes so you've been using it yeah so
Anna bong is basically going to be doing
yeah he's basically gonna be doing an
unboxing of that day do it yeah
Oh stock go for it
so some thoughts on the some thoughts on
the event cuz have you guys ever been to
a gaming first time I ever am in a
gaming ok so I have yeah you definitely
have yeah I did razor was raised her at
PAX when you were there
oh yeah I'd they were so razor as is
nice sheet on every single razors device
telling you that you're welcome to the
cult of razor course you are for the
price you paid you should be there is an
entrance fee and that's what it is
of course isn't this the cheapest like
computing device that they have though
pretty much yeah Oh computing yes yeah
computer by net peripheral services
pretty much uh like a sharp dude I I
really want those like razor-mouth mice
and keyboards man the reason the reason
makes okay look I've been doing gaming
gear for a while the two that I
gravitate to our razor and auto said
yeah
parisa stuff is great and Sam Sam is all
razor I cannot convince him to go
anywhere else as he has a keyboard
mechanical keyboard I think that's the
Huntsman he has the mama Mouse he's got
he's got nothing Firefly he's got cuz
use of the wildest pad as well they have
a solution where is truly wireless
interesting um any charge it recharges
on the map for you so you don't have to
plug it in at all what's the what's the
keyboard named remember this is a
huntsman no the huntsman is a nothing
okay that's one thing razor does they
have way too many like accessories and I
keep I started which for me is admirable
yeah I mean they started making a mouse
and then they became the monster that
they are
oh there's Larry let me hold it my green
yeah encased in encased in glass it's
carpet guys it's carpet it's fine Q in
the video of that guy that makes fun of
unboxings there is a video I'll show it
to you okay the guy so class yeah look
it is a it's a pretty opulent like
unboxing it this is very it's very razor
like there's actually not much green on
the box no no reason it's not because
most of the new boxes now are black
especially even on the laptops yeah so
just just show you guys again it's black
the lettering is black even though races
color of preference is green like this
right oh that so there's no there's
nothing that says it's very nondescript
image tag sponsored I knew I would
eventually wish we do wish but at the
same time I have to say when the when
the swag bag came and the phone was in
in a couple of other accessories for us
to review I have to admit when I took
the hat out I was like this is actually
a really nice looking hat I could do
with a smaller logo cuz this this does
look like I got branded but yeah
so that they've got some Razer stickers
inside there's sentiment there sim
ejector is actually really cool stupid
things
quick charge for Plus how many people
that is the only that is the only
charger unless you get it from Qualcomm
which are the ones we got in Hawaii yeah
there is no quick charge for plus and I
don't think there's another phone that's
compatible you know what it is I feel
like quick okay quick charge for I
remember we were asking them this at
that tech summit last year asking
Qualcomm that is isn't quick charge for
basically just a co-opting of PD it's
basically the same thing
so because it's it's easy to use be seen
honorable yeah it is but this four plus
is different from four just apparently
it is the speed of four without the
overheating it's what they told me I got
I hope so yeah it does a better job at
handling and handling just to continue
we have here the US by BSB type C 2
headphone jack with a built-in DAC so
technically 24-bit by the way even
though they provided the hammerheads
right those are you know the hat but the
hammerheads they provide it to so huh
come in the blocks just because you got
it in there oh no what I'm saying is
like what I'm saying is like even though
our heads are the headphones well
exactly the Hammerhead headphones are
USBC enabled so you kind of you're
skirting the deck that's included in the
adapter so I I don't know if they have
my heads have Dax is that so that's the
thing about it just to give you a quick
educational standpoint on audio if your
USB type-c headphones do not have a
built-in DAC in there the audio sucks
just put it that way which is why stuff
like this especially that they have one
built in and supposedly this is tuned by
thx yep yeah he's also owned by Razer I
found that to be fascinating yeah but
the own thx like really it's like wow so
my introduction to Razer was literally
last year with the first Razer phone
like yeah I had seen the razor blade but
I you know for me it was like I was not
a gamer back then I guess I guess it's
the best way to the blade when it came
out and it was that compact form factor
to me it looked like it should have been
called the macbook killer on I was about
to say it's just one thing that I admire
about Razer is they make really good
looking products like that mercury
finish on the laptop no they said the
mercury finish is high made reactions
this one here was oozing like I would
have it I gotta have it like I will
actually I I am willing its I'm willing
to pay for it what a beautiful computer
the base level laptop I was I actually
had the listing on my phone as they were
announcing it I was so close to getting
because I've been in the market for a
new laptop for the longest time I'm
using a very old laptop not very old
it's like two years but still when that
is very old well what the it's almost
two years I think but you know once the
8th gen Intel's came out I was like I'm
outdated like crazy yeah yeah so I'm
sorry by the way we are now onto braided
cables USB type-c litter boxes would be
really boring dude kernel style well you
know what this is like this is super
super comedic effect
Scott is ejecting timing exactly and and
as you can see if you can see here
clearly it's got green colors in the USB
type-c cables so oh my god that's true
oh my god you know what these are so
that unboxing video like the Verity is
like oh we've got a little paper 20
things yes and then he keeps going we've
got another paperclip again we've got oh
we've got this amazing so I move with
2x4 three-pound style paper paper
covering I'm trying to find a seam
removal tool once I find it that would
be next
Oh what is it is it the snakes so it no
no no no it's it's it's a sim removal
tool that is lettered with razor there I
don't know if you can bring that closer
so there you can see I'll do a be rolled
shot that is kind of nice actually yeah
it looks like a paddle dude look at the
stickers man Oh Oh was that my phone
that was that was your pixel like try
and I trashed my my razor phone really
nice stickers here I mean this is pretty
awesome and of course chroma stickers
because of the fact that well we'll get
to it so it lights up okay so yeah so
and among he's gonna set his up I kind
of wanted to set mine up this snake logo
is multicolored 16.1 million dollars I
was a cult what do you call this a
holographic it's a little hologram those
are only me the actual oh yeah this
sticker I want to say but chroma like
weren't there people in the in the
gaming / computing industry who are kind
of sick of RGB everything at this point
I hear it from a lot of people but now
okay gay that as a gamer they all lying
if you're gonna build a gaming PC this
dnh your motherboard hmm you're cooling
your RAM ya know my father my oh my my
Falcon Northwest Ikki is red AF oh wow
fucking north why haven't heard that in
a while
oh dude that thing screams oh sorry by
the way welcome yes
already lit will it there you go
everybody start installing but once I
saw that there were fans with RGB built
in I was like are we really getting this
far so my like my graphics card on that
ticky is it's huge
I forget the spec on it and it's just
God just the way it glows and everything
I'm like alright I can deal with this
like I know I like it it's cool I'll
admit it's cool but it's just kind of
funny that they're injecting into so
many oh let's let's think about this
what other gadget has the amount of
coloring and just no style so-and-so is
super corny so so I find it to be
fascinating the gaming products have
adopted this mentality that they have to
be colorful yeah and you know just
opulent I like it and I like it even
more when they don't look like
Tyrannosaurus Rex in the case of certain
brands like what's the one that Dell
does so those those are pretty but but
but here's the thing then I get it
because you just need the thermals the
computer needs to be large because you
need the thermals if not the performance
it's just not going to be the same
so whereas razor razor has proven
innovation when it comes to thermals
particularly and compact form factors
are really near specialty at this point
yeah but also I think you have to look
at the fact that if you're gonna build
out right you build out a PC if you guys
are builders out there you know quite
well is that you okay sixes second side
certain size you've got a see-through
window at night if your lights are off
or even if it's not well lit you can't
see anything
if you spend time building something
right you want to show it all exact it's
one of the biggest things you want to
make it and like for me this is gonna
sound stupid but one of the reasons I
bought my first ever MacBook Pro was
because the keyboard was backlit people
don't remember like today it's like
common ground for all keyboards to be
backlit but people don't remember that
was like one of the coolest things that
Mac started doing first I guess I just
live a rather solitary work life when
I'm the only one in my office and the
only one who's gonna enjoy it is me and
I agree that that's cool there's nobody
who lives in my apartment that works
with me okay
they only do other things we are
drinking here only and so recently when
Danny and I have been crashing here oh
yeah that's right that's right yeah yeah
I've seen your desktop it looks dope
like it has great bouquet in the
background when I was making my videos
at your place it's just you know I
probably the only light up thing that I
feel like I would really enjoy are the
keyboards where they light up as you
press the keys so you can actually see
yourself I love that that's great you
know and then the RGB chroma on certain
keyboards that's great and I guess what
I'm trying to get out here is I find it
a little bit ridiculous that even the
smallest things are getting injected
with chroma I'm not saying it's not cool
I just think it's funny so have you done
so one thing I'll say I know we're kind
of spending some time here on this is
that it's it's a key feature of this
phone no it is is is and I want to see
this here so one thing about chroma
lighting as well as RGB lighting across
gaming is is how it's synced so
different companies SteelSeries has
chroma on I'm not gonna so the RGB
lighting on keyboards where they work
they've worked with different gaming
developers so your health bar is the
very your f keys right and then you're
also when you start playing a game and
you get damaged or your key starts
turning red and it just graduates all
the cream and then not your keys now
Razer does open all your RGB effects
plus Philips you
so if you go free loops you lights on
your tables in your apartment if your
character is getting shot everything
turns red if you want to set it up that
way see the usefulness behind that I
love that that's great so if it's if
it's being useful then that's great so
think about it just with this even if
you've never used all that you never had
anything just hide maybe your keyboard
we have a razor fold and it's it's
sitting there charging with the chroma
doc yeah and then the chroma dog that's
going red red red blinking red light you
came in and maybe you not paying
attention because some you do something
else is omission at you you got oh okay
shit I need to do this that's the whole
light but it's the whole I immersive
idea of saying you've got more senses
than just your fingers on a keyboard
and by the way this is straight Michael
Fisher territory he's like oh this is an
LED indicator and that's the other thing
yeah yeah which is the point I was the
overarching point that I was making
about the Chrome on the phone is that
they made it useful so I'm I'm all in
it's great it's a notification I'm not
gonna lie like I'm sure that that met
that that set might look cool I I don't
think I have ever liked black glass Oh
as much as I like this okay it's a slab
of Onyx man it looks so I didn't look so
okay as long as your fingerprint you
know show you know okay Barrett no but
it does a really good job like the
oleophobic coating is really good so
here's a bear in mind you know I got the
razor phone one really late for due to
certain issues I did not like razor
phone one at all like at all I did not
like that matte aluminum I don't like
how it aged I just don't like how the
phone looked at all it looked like this
clunky thing I didn't consider it to be
cool I obviously I come from the time of
next bit so I'm like this is just a
blown up next next bit Robin made in
different materials and then the back is
now aluminum and it looks really bad
because it scratches really well really
easily and so I remember when they when
they showed me this in the briefing I
was like alright this is a mo and then
they flipped it over and it was just
pitch black with the chroma and I was
like oh
okay I want that yeah and they were like
yeah but but there's gonna be another
version that's gonna have more source of
one than another you give me more
storage on that one yeah first time I
ever want a glossy black back on a phone
and you know what like you know just the
final point on the chroma I know we've
spent a lot of time on it but this this
camera hub if it's ever so slightly
raised off the table one is like this
and it pulsates it's like having an LED
underneath I know and I'm so glad that's
kind of heavy notice but it's well
balanced yes yeah like the iPhone right
[Laughter]
so if you get if you get an under glow
off the phone I mean that's kind of cool
too but the problem is the for the
screen needs to be on for the chroma to
work unless you have it on high power
unless you have it on so there are
settings for the chroma you can set it
to whatever color you want and then it's
also a notification light or you can
just have it on spectrum which just
cycles through all the different colors
look can't you add it to for a
notification with different apps right
yeah so let's talk a little bit more
about these other respects song here
because I think that we all kind of
agreed that this phone has a lot to
offer despite the fact that you know we
have a lot of really high powered phones
out right now and this one is really
trying to push the envelope in terms of
all of the power and all of the specs
four thousand milliamp power battery
like really loud and clear front-facing
speakers yes can you demo a little bit
um you know so for the price we're
looking at what $7.99 yeah okay for
$7.99 you're getting maybe up to two to
five hundred dollars less for this phone
that has all the same if not better
specifications than some flagships out
there so here's the thing this phone is
sadly not for everyone at least these
are my first impressions
why not because my god this thing is not
small it is unapologetically large and
designed for a specific user in mind
true sorry
I've got an update oh yeah immediately
it'll it's got a software update
immediately
this phone is not for everyone there but
there's this is not what they're trying
to do like they were clear this is
flagship gaming so it's a phone that
appeals to the flagship masses because
it's got new cameras and it's got things
that people look for Anna flexure phone
but it's also a gaming phone I get all
these things the problem is it's not
easy to handle it's not like I'm like
like these are the moments where I'm
like alright fine now I understand that
whole purpose of iPhones having this
like curve in the you know and the
borders you know galaxy s 9 and that's
night let's do the same this phone does
not is not gonna be easy to carry in a
pocket it's just not a practical phone
to handle that being said I've heard no
better speakers on a phone that being
said a hundred and twenty Hertz true 120
Hertz on a display it's gotten over
prime so you're not dealing with any BS
like so when you have great speakers
that are also water-resistant when you
have a good battery when you have a good
camera which in theory is what they're
offering and I've already made some test
and test came out really good um and you
price it for three hundred dollars less
than most than this
ah so by the way I'm like okay - still
worth $1,000 I know okay anyone knows I
don't care what anybody sees closest
phone worth a thousand dollars is the
Galaxy Note I agreed like so that's the
thing I mean if you give me a galaxy no
9 I'm willing to put up with the size
for the benefits that you get with the
phone yeah it offers a lot more but then
if you got a phone that'll give you that
pretty much all that with better
speakers with a better display in when
it comes to refresh rate and gaming and
all this for $300 less $200 that's
pretty much uh it's it's really hard to
compete with this it really is and I'm
just gonna throw it in there and then
you can get all that with less size and
more sleekness with the 1 plus 60
whatever it comes ever it might be at
high for even $200 so it's a really hard
problem no no I disagree and I'll tell
you why tell me what so here's the thing
that we all do as tech reviewers right
we forget what the market really is it's
called a market for reason and this
reason why I like the razor phone one
last year and it had issues is because
when men went on stage he realized that
there's a certain market for this phone
which is reason why a soos yeah every
time and whether it will gaming and even
Samsung had to get fortnight yeah to say
we have gaming cuz me knew that thing
about it when he like if you if you
remember the press conference for last
year anyone watched it he talks about a
game that had a hundred million users on
a mobile game this is China
now vainglory right yeah thing Louis
yeah
now think about it if you can only just
NAB 1 million I'm not talking about like
samsung numbers for razor you have 1
million if you eat into that market you
become a mainstay yeah it's such a great
business model and saying it's a great
idea and and the reason I like razor is
this if you if you've known razor as
much as I've done is one of the things
the razor does a VR CES yeah and you
know this quite well come up we say is
crazy stuff I want Prime I want project
Linda and every year every other year
one of those projects usually comes to
life right in a sense this is kind of
like one of their crazy project if you
think about it yeah they are the first
ones for sure yeah they're not a phone
company but it also said we're not gonna
skimp out they made mistakes they had
issues but the second year began they
said we're still not having to skimp out
and here's the price you know and one of
the things I liked that he said in the
press conference was you want a notch
you don't do that shit because you know
what pixel three garbage and that notch
well get there later we're gonna get
there but he also talked about other
things is like you know we got big
businesses in size he said it yeah I
like when you take what you have and you
say you know what this it is what it is
but because also the speakers are there
for visas so it's not an engineering
problem it's not that they don't have
the engineering capability so what off
they just they're not out for that yeah
exactly you know and and I do like that
then I think and you're right though it
is for a certain market right it's not
it's not the best phone to handle it's
not the most economic but it's for a
certain market that goes look I'm gonna
watch my content I'm gonna game and I
want the speakers to be nice and crisp
all those speakers those workers and get
it done and that's look if that's you
that's you get what you want but I also
think that this phone is it's the
perfect phone for the moment because I
think you can give some insight on this
because I mean I were talking about
earlier that the razor phone one came
out it was a proof of concept let's
let's put in those terms at least for
now
and it was a way for them to say like
you know we can make this happen we can
make a gaming phone happen it may or may
not fit all users but you know people
who really want to get into gaming this
could be the phone for you and then
since that phone came out gaming on
mobile has blown up there's so many
great games like Nintendo started making
mobile games and it's obvious that there
is a market here that people want to
start getting into developers and
consumers are like I'm one of those
consumers I love I one of the only
reasons I actually go for the bigger
phones now is because I consume that
much media and because I game that much
so say here's the thing right and I've
been waiting for this for a long time
it's not the mobile games that I I
really care about I'm a I'm a you know I
was a PC gamer first yeah I have
consoles and then this week even though
this is not directly related but
Microsoft announced X cloud
now imagine for me as someone who enjoys
PC games X cloud is basically the
ability stream your Xbox level games on
any device now we all know how good this
because they pay for itself
so you already on raise a phone you
streaming now your halo all that stuff
on here it doesn't feel like you've
cheating the experience in some of the
devices you've got better audio you've
got 120 her display that is that's why
it like for me I went
okay as a gamer this is cool because now
not just what they do somebody else has
validated it even though they didn't
think about validating it entirely and
and also this goes to the point and in
our in my own weekly podcast we talked
about this myself Sam by the way it's
also called the weekly the weekly I know
yeah we talked about how there is a need
for niche devices absolutely because I
was a very good point because the idea
of all-around premium does not make
sense
this is a gaming phone right now so some
would would say the LG V V Series is the
greedier phone greater for fair phone
and everybody would say the note 9 is
the the workers you know professional
phone key to you know workers phone
exactly yeah so yeah the there are many
different devices out there that follow
these I see your face that I mean let me
give you the reason why that's true
Michael Fisher brings a key to with him
everywhere just because when he decides
he wants to type something he takes it
out to do it so hey it's a workers I
still type faster on absolutely any
virtual keyboard comfor dude it's not
about fast talking about so a comfort
what is uncomfortable about tapping
glass you do it for absolutely
everything else it's way more
comfortable on a physical cue what are
you talking about dude I started using
tile feedback is somebody using physical
keyboards when you were still so uh
somebody's just trying to age himself
here yeah no let's let's face it I grew
up with physical keyboard yeah like I'm
generally sure gotten how how
comfortable no I'm not I was saying that
they were uncomfortable I'm saying god I
feel it the implementation so you can't
expect to bring the the way software the
way hardware keyboards wore ten years
ago
and just add a couple of gestures to it
and expect like there can be better
things done it's been 10 years it's been
10 years and I find SwiftKey to be far
more practical I'm drinking hydrogen
water he doesn't want any part of this
car no but and I and I and I do get that
but back to the point of niche devices I
completely agree with that end you know
what to add one more to that list the
pixel is the Android users phone it's
the purest the Android purest phone no
that would be the one plus six yeah I
would agree it's on there too it's the
artistry Android phone no BS like stock
Android pure as it is I think I think so
much the launcher is a launcher it's not
start yeah I would I gonna have a lot of
comparisons but I think I think it's
very Fred to say that it should be noted
our comparison granted I have I didn't
go to the pixel events as Google doesn't
like me so maybe that's why you keep
calling them out
I Google actually stuff is pretty great
by the way no but it would be nice to
see the comparison between this and the
60 because the comparison reading this
in the galaxy is actually to me
personally is not a fair comparison to
this device I mean a camera is solid
they had many fits all things but
there's one thing that I've always said
Samsung has done wrong is that they
always add things to Android that oh you
know Sam but I think to the 660 and what
oneplus is done with that device is is
showcase the simplicity of what Android
is they provide we're fine and still
have a lot of things especially the
price difference so um I mean I would
call it out now that probably the camera
on this is better succeed
before we even get the device but I
think it's a matter of usability
function because this the thing we do as
reviewers all the time we take one
feature and we try to make that future
king over everything else so I would
love to see a lot of we're gonna do this
comparison I probably won't but it's
just one of the things I would like to
see other people I don't watch it see
how they view this against the 60
because it's a very interesting argument
yeah that can be made right there okay
well we're gonna get into this one right
here they had the pixel in a second
first let's get a few words in about our
sponsor one of two this episode so look
forward to that but let's talk about one
of our sponsors all right so while
they're loitering in the background
there this episode of the pocket not
weekly is brought to you by casita
by Lutron today I want to talk to you
about these guys they have smart
lighting control brought to you by
Lutron pioneers in smart home technology
with caseta you can schedule your lights
to come on at dusk so your family always
comes back to a weld at home now these
aren't just light bulbs that you buy
their actual dimmer switches you take
out the ones in your walls and you
replace them with these all it takes is
a screwdriver in 15 minutes
you can use them with the bulbs you
already have because you're replacing
the electrics you probably have twice as
many bulbs as you do switches so casita
would be a handy purchase and the best
thing of all you can connect your phones
or your smart speakers to the switches
and control them from pretty much
anywhere you'd like you can trust casita
works because it's from Lutron a company
that's behind the first electronic
dimmer with nearly 60 years of
experience and our producer Jules has
actually been sent some switches and he
likes how the lights turned on when he
comes home once his phone was within the
geo-fenced
zone that he set up the dimmer actually
brings his lights to the brightness that
he wants maybe I should ask if he can
send me one of those also it'd be nice
to have smart lighting pretty much
everywhere in my home and in my office
so get smart lighting and get it the
smart way with caseta by Lutron you can
search CAS ETA or hit a blue Tron comm
for more information
casita by Lutron welcome home to peace
of mind
also the PocketNow weekly is sponsored
by one plus on October 30th one plus
will unveil its new flagship the one
plus sixty leaks and rumors say that it
will have an in display fingerprint
sensor a much smaller notch with a
slightly bigger screen and perhaps a
bigger battery is it all true well we're
all gonna have to find out for ourselves
you'll be able to watch the launch event
live on one plus's website and on its
youtube channel or if you want to see
the event in person and get free bullets
Wireless plus other swag you can buy
tickets to the event for just 20 bucks
just head on over to pocketnow.com / 1 +
60 for more information and stay tuned
or the announcement all right we're back
in and I'm gonna do the reads after so
just so you know it yeah you gave me
this look like what happened ok alright
so I know that this day I don't think
there has been a more contested device
so far this year than this one right
here in your hands and I would know
because I did my own video on the pixel
on my channel and I was very surprised
at just how many people were upset at me
for liking it yeah you did a great video
man oh thank you I I just the way that I
thought about it was like there are a
lot of hands-on videos out there there's
nothing wrong with them I suggest they
all go through the spec sheets and stuff
like that why would I do the exact same
thing just you know on a different
Channel I thought you know what there
are a few things about this phone I
really like it makes me like the phone
as a whole you know the ester flaws and
maybe I was a little bit flowery in the
way that I said what was wrong with the
phone and that I didn't want it to
straight up say eff this at that but
that's not who I am
and if you've never seen me on my
channel before I'm sorry I'm getting
this off my chest right now if you've
never seen my chin I'll say it you have
to know that I'm not I'm not a cynic and
I'm also not a pessimist when it comes
to tech I'm the I love everything guy so
I accept when he's off camera though
that's right you know he breaks things
all the time I'm joking but like when it
comes to the pixel 3xl I'm just like you
know I get it I get why people hate
certain things about this I agree in a
lot of ways but you know just to give a
shoutout to marques Brownlee who did a
video today about it he's yeah as the
video is really good
in his case he said he's kind of numb to
the knotch
like it doesn't mean that it's not there
and doesn't have to say it I'm gonna
have to say it yeah right so
pixal one was the most horrible phone
that I like holding there was a thing
about the aluminum finish and own and
and it was just it felt really well in
the hand and felt utilitarian and my
case off yeah do it and I I just I hated
those huge Chin's on the phone
unnecessary they served no purpose the
speaker on that phone it was horrible
so here comes pixel to pixel to excel is
what I did yeah
and I had one without a problem without
problems on the display pixel to excel I
like for a couple of reasons the first
one it was the lightest phone that had
that size and so the weight distribution
was just so well done it was so well
executed
that I could care less about the bezels
at a time when bezels were starting to
disappear on phones I could care less
because it felt great
all right pixel three Excel I've said it
in all my I've said it all my reviews I
don't mind notches I prefer not just
over bezels I'm gonna say one quick
thing I'm like I don't I don't like
notches but I don't mind them okay
there's a different thing alright here's
the thing here's the thing finish
because I will just tell all of you
you're completely wrong and foolish
well I knew you're gonna say that the
problem is when you launch a phone I did
scratch the damn thing damn it
ouch oh well this is very raw podcast
right you're unboxing his big Jan where
is it it's at the top and I think it's
like well figure that out I'm straight
I'm sorry so this this screen is
literally a design aberration and here's
why so in the case of the iPhone for
example no yes you've got that notch but
let's just let's face it if you compare
it like this not just like half the size
of that one
and then but then at least you've got
the curves all around the screen being
symmetrical there is literally like no
chin there's nothing it's just that
notch at the top so I'm cool with that
I'm cool with the one plus six for
example where the notch is smaller and
then it's got a minimal chin at the
bottom this
thing has got a chin the size of Texas
which I I am okay with it because it's
got a speaker I was just about to say
like I it's totally fine for you not to
like wear those bezels are but when I
state that there is a speaker there and
in the knotch you have two cameras a
sensor and a speaker that somehow I'm a
terrible person because I'm stating
facts that's a fact
I'm not making an apology for it I'm
saying it's there okay so here you're
dizzy and here I go here I go okay so
you've got a chin you've got a chin the
size of Texas I'm just waiting for you
to never said I never said it was yous
got a knotch the size of Long Island
yeah and then you've got two borders of
bezels at the top with curves and then
sharper curves at the bottom and then
you've got one speaker that's larger
than the other with a pair of cameras
that it's like if they're looking at me
with a smile and I'm like alright there
is too much on the screen yeah I've
never disagreed with that
let him talk he's about to go off I know
I just wanna say I've never disagreed
with any point you're making and always
I was just stating facts about what is
that you in the bitter new in the visual
effects no okay look notches are poor
design
right here very simple yeah support
design I don't take that from you charge
me $1,000 800 bucks
to give me a poor design first of all if
you're charging me $500 $600 I get it
that is a market equivalent of saying
common denominator when you charge me a
thousand bucks when you try give me
money give me design give me
that's why look as you call Porsche
design exactly like yeah so so what
happens out what Apple did was poor
design what they have done is laziness
and where ever is that Google sees this
will see this laziness because it is the
same phone design from last year
literally they just cut out exactly
nothing truly and then you made your
launch bigger for a reason right they
look if you even made the excuse that
there was facial recognition similar to
what you have in the iPhone yeah with
more senses I would take that as okay
fine I agree but you didn't do it no
wide-angle though fuck that shit because
it's the same sensor size and I said it
I'm sorry
no no no but it's still another thing
and it's actually it's not another thing
it is just a camera hole that is the
same size that you could have caught it
down that's the thing it's not I get it
but you just basically put two lenses on
something that everybody has shown you
can make it small and then you've got
and then you've got the galaxy s 9 and
note 9 whoo that I've had wide-angle
selfies like forever ever that like you
yeah you know you have just give me one
selfie camera that's why did pop said
agree with ya I do agree with that give
me one selfie camera that's wide and
we're fine I mean it'll make me look
thinner we didn't everybody want but but
this is what it looks like and then
remember last year they took out
headphone jack because they told us it
was to make thinner bezels on what do I
have look at that look at that stuff
right there yeah so so I don't let see
which is no this is the last design
average just to go back to Razer right
again I'm not disagreeing with I'm not
disagreeing with anyone in the
either so but this is why I would say to
you I get why the people who got angry
because if you look at if you look at
razor razor said this is why we are
doing it and then Google can't even
answer that question you can't tell me
that you cannot design you you bought up
HCC's design apparatus and then you give
me this hog partial shit and I'm calling
that because the hardware is standard
across leisure time where look you
always go and we'll get to hardware in a
second but everyone's gonna have a 45 or
ladies welcome
so we know that aspect about it they've
done wrong via software that's why
they're good at AI technology and stuff
like that but for crying out loud
if you're going to mesmerize people it's
gotta look good this reason the galaxy
is good there's a reason the elite one
plus six is everybody's going gaga
because little oh yeah right that's what
happen you saw the links of the opal or
the 18 yeah your drop no it's not even a
teardrop it's literally just a camera
oh-ho exactly that's it and then and
then and then this room of the as tab
which is basically under the screen so
when you give me this you don't you
don't know Google marketing when you
want to sell something fast your fanboy
base you've got to give people the even
even Apple understands that as much as I
don't like that that not that he did but
they gave I mean they give no but they
also gave me an aesthetic there was the
oh we have all these sensors for face
idea and all that when you use face idea
you're good if I'm fine you did that
right and it makes sense but then they
also said this is the aesthetic value of
it you look make some bullshit up that
actually makes sense not run a pest
conference and you cannot even state why
you have stupidity with a unibrow that
is what worse than dead bird
on Sesame Street like that to me is and
some people will watch this and go why
is he fretting about it it's a not it
doesn't matter it's because it is lazy
it takes away your screw real estate and
go watch my gaming video and see how
much your screen shrinks when you
actually play a game because there are a
lot of apps that haven't been updated to
fit this but you know they haven't they
they haven't been updated thirty fitted
knotch this large no these haven't bolts
again it doesn't even matter even if it
does because I was doing the math and
going it was still even if you expanded
it out just like with the iPhone there's
still part of your screen real estate
that just disappears no matter how you
look at it yeah now it's just deeper
longer and super like you know you need
to go get you know your brows done type
type of stuff all right
I I'm out now tell me what this looks
like super thick bezels no what do you
look at it what are you looking at now
I mean look at that phone you're looking
at pixel to excel you're looking up yeah
so if you do the hide the knotch thing I
was on the developers ooh I don't know
man I mean as I said make the pixel
three pixel two again so I was
regretting I was design though yes so I
was regretting grabbing the large one
instead of a small one I think that fish
will grab the small one right Fisher
grab the smaller one and I was like
shoot I should have grabbed it because I
okay so the point that I was trying to
make is I don't think I've ever been
annoyed by a notch in my life until now
because just it's not just the notch
it's the whole bottom chin so badly done
like the combination of everything and
then the user interface like that that
make notification it just it looks
terrible it just it looks really bad but
looks very badly designed it serves no
purpose well let me tell you so here's
the thing and and I love that that David
went to that whole Bron thing with
dieter Rams so with dieter Ram is Peter
Rams is one of the fathers of modern
design admired by Jonathan Ive and you
know a lot of the current incumbent
designers and dieter Rams he's got a
couple of like principles for design
literally design has to disappear thank
you
design has to disappear it has to almost
feel undesigned
it has to look so logical so practical
but you'd even question why it would be
design any other way and so this is this
is obtrusive this is it serves no that
and then the other thing is design has
to serve a purpose
can somebody give me a purpose for this
damn thing super dodge and and I just
want
I just want to reiterate that obviously
the way that you use something is going
to color the way that you feel about it
overall yeah when I see that knotch I
did I see
I do see ugliness I'll say it it is ugly
it I I like with it I'm okay hiding the
knotch
but also let me tell you something about
this hiding the notched okay this when I
was with Michael yesterday and I hit my
knotch
and I put it up next to his smaller
pixel three it's the same exact phone
this one's just bigger bigger so if
you're okay with the small phone then
you're okay with the big bezels just say
okay just say anyway
I when I see the notch I'm like okay
could be better but you know what that
wide-angle camera that is right there at
the top I'm using it all the time and
that's the reason why I like this one
yeah so me liking the wide-angle camera
somehow made it so that me liking this
one because of that very specific thing
all of a sudden I'm a notch lover no no
question not a question I'm sorry I have
to really get out I've been dealing with
this for two days I have to say for
example that somehow there's OLED panels
really good because that it's blacked
out it's it slacked out to the point
where you have you cannot tell that it's
a screen and not a bezel sorry that it's
a right that mmm but has anybody noticed
is LG still manufacturing the XL variant
or is it now just the Google apparatus
with HTC have you guys noticed that the
curves on the screen are gone there's LG
yeah but have you noticed that the
curves on the screen are completely gone
when compared to the flash I don't miss
our ice we compress to the pixel to
excel you remember those on the okay
they're gone oh my god it's just sad
it's just a different design just a
glass on top yeah it's just not yeah
yeah so I mean yeah no I mean I I just I
personally do think that the phone is
still priced lower than a lot of
thousand-dollar variants out there by
phone 10s how much again 800 it's eight
yeah
it's so it's 800 which still makes it a
little bit less than the other ones and
it could be lat
it could be lesser than that I agree but
still less then you know and if anybody
out there is that mad at the knotch the
note 9 exists enjoy yeah okay no listen
I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop throwing
trash at this phone and say the things I
like about it order it in white
in white so it's got this like panda
effect would like the black USBC port
and then the black screen the black
bezels is there supposed to be it feels
it looks really good it feels like
ceramic like first polish like the
polish that they did on the aluminum is
really good and I love the finish at the
back of the glass I - yeah listen III
looks really it not it doesn't not look
cheap it does not look cheap I bet the
screen is badly designed but then
everything else about the phone looks
really good it looks like everything
else looks cohesive it looks as it's
where it's supposed to be those things
are good the speakers are great they
okay the speakers are great the screen
is really good says the guy who's tested
every speaker okay look look I'm just
gonna I'm sorry I just have a caught you
there they had nice speakers but pixel
speakers have never been looked do you
12 speakers you 12-plus yes much better
yeah the eraser oh no no notice not as
loud still better Galaxy iPhone no this
is not as bad okay your compared to the
pixel to excel no no no no I'm just
saying the current phones I really I
phoned you 12 plus zz3
again
uh v40 oh yeah yeah yeah g7 g 7z louder
I will necessary
okay it's louder we say that it's not a
bad speaker just not the hyper well so
let me ask you this though $800 is that
$800 basically paying for a plane shoot
camera no is no but here's the thing
like remember that we're still we owe it
to Google to run this phone through the
whole process of a review and you know
part of our commitment is we have to you
know we right now we could only provide
first impressions which is what they are
yeah I can answer this question no like
we can't provide like our final opinion
over the whole experience and if it's
well yeah I know that's which is why we
can't go there yet yeah which is why
we're expounding on no no I don't so I
think I'll add this to this is that I
think the problem we face not not the
device and with all the device because
we just talked about the razor phone
right and we just talked about we've
talked about the galaxy and stuff it's
it's a we live in a very weird time
because if you were to do the one-to-one
calculation right and I would say this
this does not compare to the razor for
just on the pure one-to-one what do you
add cuz you know we can argue there's a
chroma lighting these days you know I'm
just saying that features right but that
doesn't make a phone really for any
specific individual because it's it's
very different true that's why I say we
live in the way we're time because we
passed the time where before it was if
you threw the kitchen sink and it was a
thousand nothing was before but say was
a thousand with kitchen sink you go yes
is a thousand kitchen sink in white
please say thank you but we don't live
in that time anymore because um there's
preference and there's also certain
things right you've got an experience
here that is close to stock Android you
know and you've got the AI additives
which not I would say most people dust
don't have
and then you've got a camera like you
said a point-and-shoot it you mentioned
yeah right that is because because with
other phones if the camera is let's say
subpar or not amazing it's something we
could look past but when it comes to the
pixels it's called a pixel for crying
out loud when the camera makes the
experience so obviously when I pick up a
pixel just like I did with the pixel 1 a
pixel to that camera makes the
experience yeah that's the reason why I
feel the way I feel so I can look past
the other so questions cuz I haven't
seen anyone and maybe it's just reviews
or whatever how is video on this because
it speaks of to video was trash
I didn't think pixel to video was trash
I didn't think pixel to eyes only on the
front facing cameras I think it was like
hey not great pieces of video for me
audio was not good it was better for me
than most other phones the only one who
didn't stand up to was a Samsung inside
of Samsung or LG I did have an OD at the
time and the video quality for me was
not good I haven't tested video yet just
asking what I find is that the features
of video on a phone because I already
have slightly lower expectations for
smartphone video compared to my DSLR
compared to even let's say a GoPro 7
yeah so if the features are usable to
the sense that they're reliable then I
like that so if I have a niche or a
specific shot I want to get I'll pull
out the phone because I know it'll do it
well yeah slow-mo on the pixel to more
reliable than any other slim theories
are that for example reason I ask is
because my mindset is always is like as
we asked me anything else this is the
camera everybody has you know whatever
you hold you in your hands camera so for
me when when using the pixel to my issue
was the OASDI ass were not talking
Turner they're not yeah they were never
talking to even there's more shakiness
on the pixel to than I remember but then
I then I wanted the pixel yeah I did and
then the cuz there was no is on the
pixel 1 it was only working alone and
then the the when I was recording in
low-light
the amount of grain in the video was
just no but you have to understand like
because of the size of the sensor to it
it's physically it's
nearly impossible to get better video in
low-light get that's the right problem
you put one and ask you for one you did
it yourself
no it's it's no no but that's what it is
he doesn't I don't literally literally
no smartphone can can can account for
that no no no no I grade you on what you
did and and where you price if you
wanted to get better you can change the
sensor it's not me I'm not the one
fortunately I know but the thing is
literally no smartphone can account for
the noise that happens no matter how
many cameras oh no I know I know I'm
just saying that compared to its
competitors with its pricing was and who
was going against like even the iPhone
as much as even I know like iPhone is
that is that the iPhone just did better
in video okay so that what I've seen
it's like I'm looking at are going I
hope being proved I would my missions
just from 2 to 3 I want to just listen
we wrap we can't really dive into that
because you grab grab my Galaxy S 9 plus
video my review um what other review
know I have I have like two or three
reviews he's million the words that
people cannot tell that part of the
footage was filmed on an iPhone 10 on
again oh I see what you mean yeah on a
gimbal no no I have to say this like
king of photography well we still need
more time with the pixel 3 excel we
still I still need more time
definitely but king of video I mean give
me all the arguments you want about LG
they've done a better job with their
sharpening on the v40
the sharpening on the V 30 and every
previous one I don't care how much of a
pundit or an expert you consider
yourself to be the video was trash the
video was trash on LGB 30 LG be 20 LG be
40 got better the the processing
processing yeah
no no that is like for me I don't I
could give to three rats you know what
if you've got manual controls or great
audio those things are great those
things are secondary of the quality of
the video is trash then so vana said he
did a special one I shut an HDR oh yeah
it's really bad and so V 40 is
significantly better than V third
but I still give the crown in video
recording to the iPhone sorry wrong
wrong wrong I'd the iPhone does a really
good job what would be your favorite the
galaxy I'll take them the s9 bus or the
note night it did do a pretty good job
you did the Milan videos in in the
galaxy s night and I remember I did well
then you say the b-24 I did because I
was what we were using yeah yeah see the
peach what no how was your experience I
have it I have honestly no I have to say
I've used the galaxy for comparison
purposes and stabilization and this and
that but I've never really used it as a
as a vlog the reason I liked it is
because also the audio and you've got
quartered you've got yeah that died yet
front 4k hey primary for the way that I
vlog in the way that I it's the only fun
it does this by then yeah
for the Hawaii that I've vlog in the way
that I record a video I actually put the
note 9 in the pixel to kind of kind of
neck and neck to be honest because the
galaxy the galaxy note 9 does have
better audio and it provides more
options but the pixel 2 is literally
they take it out hit record and I'm good
finally which is what I always enjoyed
about it but it had like I don't know if
we're still missing a software update on
this phone or what but you've noticed
that it's just 1080p it would like 4k at
30 yeah
yeah yeah no 4k at 60 no no even if
we've got the snapdragon 845 which is
capable of providing not enable there's
probably gonna be an update that's
that's why I was asking like obvious you
know what they did the other thing that
I was saying earlier that's nothing was
I don't use like we don't have enough
special spec sheet yet exactly there are
still some things I have to be ironed
out here with my abilities like the
capability the kid the chip has the
capability it does the chip has just
have to enable it they just have to
enable it for hey at 60 is not there
it's not there it is it is missing I
mean the it can do focused CC can do for
cage TR it just depends on what you want
to actually exactly perhaps maybe
third-party apps from the Play Store
would be able to tap into that yeah
probably not
yeah you have to actually exam us be
enabled first and which I think that I
saw some sort of update will will be
happening later on but but the thing is
like I don't use 4k 60 so I upon amuse
4k 60 like it it provides like so long
as you've got enough light because
obviously it's the reason why I don't
use it because obviously it kills it
like you need more shutter speed eh
phones are really bad at like a 4k at 60
at daylight like for handheld shots it
provides so much smoothness like it is
so good like and and one of the reasons
why even if you've got like for example
things that disappoint me about the v40
you've got four kids 60 no stabilization
no civilization and the video and then
when you do have 4k at 30 wit
stabilisation there is so much war penis
while you walk that it's like God guys
you had one job and that's the thing
about the v40 that I've been learning
after using again thank you for letting
me use your yeah unit by the way is that
each lens has a purpose but everything
else is turned off like the whiting goes
fixed focus be zoom is fixed focus the
front facing camera the 90 that the 10
extra degrees which i think is
ridiculous is only really for photos so
there's no way you're gonna use it for
video so this is to be it works in video
it does but i don't like it with the v4
this one's much wider let me just say
that yeah do you fare with the v40
and I'm not going to mud dissing
Qualcomm here but I think this is just
me speculate there's no pure scientific
inside is that I don't think the SOC is
ready for it can do three lenses I don't
think it's ready for three lenses may be
some difference see because if you think
about say funny yes that it's true so I
remember the 820 was the first one that
allowed dual cameras yeah but it wasn't
fully yeah because you think about even
like while we 70 which the p20 Pro runs
and has three lenses what about that
necessarily one runs is monochrome and
strictly more so basically it's it's not
all working yeah exactly switches to do
monochrome and because it tells these
monochrome mental you know done and the
other two lenses are doing what it's
then two lenses so and we also know with
a lease with we don't with the rumors
referred from 980 greater performance
there which means it should land to be
lenses as the rumors up sure yeah no so
that's why I am going maybe LG in a
sense is to the detriment is like you
try to jump ahead but the SOC is just
not ready just like in the case of Sony
where they do that play with RAM to be
able to give you 960 yeah totally you
know they mean like so she's not capable
but they push it through RAM Samsung
does the same only and you know what
we're getting there and obviously we
thought that the smartphone industry was
like stagnating and it really was a year
or two ago but now we're getting to a
place where things are happening that
make me excited for what's coming next
no and and I think well who was I
talking to about this I was like we got
whiting on the front finally now the
next frontier is OAS on the front that's
why what we had well may we had it would
be HTC we had it wasn't white no no it
was the HTC One which one sure am not
the previous pretend on before
the intent and yeah PA did but it wasn't
why they were going with beer ultrapixel
en yeah I was the problem I was a
problem at that one yeah no not not that
wasn't wide I mean wasn't as wide as you
would probably like which is what I mean
this is why button but it was the
problem with the quality there was the
fact that was ultra pixel not it wasn't
look if they went with this wide Europe
probably going like okay this is you
know would have been so into a complete
bro be like okay maybe well but it's the
same company its HTC better direction
with better direct and I think that I
think honestly there are growing pains
obviously I mean we we had a whole
heated discussion about earlier like
there are growing pains but we're
getting there and again I'm excited so
let me let me continue praising the
pixel stupid little things
what look at this so like when you
that's right and so when you press the
power button the clock automatically
lives so it looks like if there were
like it looks like if it the you notice
how always on this place are like you
turn the screen off it's completely
black and then boom it seems up the
always-on display it's seen this is like
seamless like it looks like if it it
looks like if the screen never really
turns off yeah it's nice actually it is
sweet like the user interface I I like
it like I have no complaints over
Android P and just the the whole
approach that Google does so okay so
here's the thing we render it be that I
have liked it still needs some tuning
done it so I'm not a fan of new OS okay
this is interesting so nine to five
Google published the dirty word Android
wasn't set a single time during the
Google pixel three of them interesting
well that lends to the whole that might
lend to the whole rumor or not remotely
some of the prominent of be the next
version of OS that Andromeda Drummond is
madness all right
fuchsia fuchsia so it might be the first
it doesn't roll off the tongue as well
hmm it doesn't roll up it's it's a drama
fuchsia fuchsia might be still internal
name but it's the a way of going so
remember so this was happened with
Google right ah Android as soon as a
name was owned by Samsung this time when
people bought an Android phone
Allah go you got a Samsung you know you
see that he had a Samsung before that I
was bought a roll oh you've got a droid
right yeah he's refused yet he had a
droid and then something to go over
because he had an iPhone or droid iPhone
or Samsung yeah and but the one with
Samsung lasted for quite a while and
they had to try and get that name back
yeah so the pixel brand comes into play
yeah but I think that because of fuchsia
coming in they're probably vocally
trying to take away that naming process
so that they can switch over which is
something Google tends to do okay they
tend to leave things that they create
and move on to the next one
nothing that they are not focusing on
developing this but maybe on their own
the PR side on the name inside of the
device it going okay might be a little
bit different yeah might be time for us
to move away from this all right well my
it might be time for us to move away
from this guys we've gone for a solid
hour I think we've done it and you know
heated discussion do we provide a final
verdict on the razor phone no I mean we
can't no no not a review verdict but I
like it I mean I I down for gaming man
that's why one for the Exxon when I look
I want that controller razor was the
name of that
right you right you put a ride you ride
you that yes to ride you it's a play on
the word no it's not as you hide you
thank you and what said something else I
would bite you was that's a that's a
drink right so hide you yes yes I I'm
looking forward to gaming on it but
razor you need you need you need to make
sure this controller gets in the hands
of as many people as possible so that
developers can start making games that
are geared towards the controller and we
can start getting games like
first-person shooters on the on Android
and iOS yeah has to happen because as of
right now we don't have certain game
genres that are prevalent in in in
mobile gaming because the controls suck
that's one thing and then the second
thing is like I get it fortnight is
awesome like all these games are great I
need one of these games that I don't
need to be playing like I want to play
on a plane and single-player games need
to start becoming more prevalent yeah
yeah I mean I there's enough storage on
the damn phone for me to not have to be
permanently connected no I I do agree
with you guys I think I think it's it
has to be a balance of both be better
got the single-player games I am just
excited to see more chroma no I mean
more yes all right I did joke around em
I said you guys were pretty tame you
didn't put chroma lighting around the
whole of the device
but you just put it there these are
smiled and said you know what we thought
about it but it's okay
you know III want to see that make sure
of gaming where because like I said I'm
really excited about X cloud from
Microsoft
well NVIDIA has their own cloud services
and the fact that like a device like
this the the razor phone and I have a
ride you with me right whether it's on
the plane and I'm playing the
single-player game you know I'm good or
the fact that I've got fast internet
with gigabit LTE and I can play a
first-person shooter I can play Halo I
can play you know Tomb Raider whatever
the game is off my phone and I think
that's the thing that I think
the next key factor that this device so
you know we've always said that we've
got computers in the hands but let's be
honest right we don't treat it as
computers in children has high level
personal devices that have great
performance
yeah not computers the fact that I think
when we get to that point where gaming
Plus even VR like those kind of things
where you know what you can either buy a
VR headset or you know what your
snapdragon powered device or whether
it's your carrying power device it's
powerful enough to give you that VR
experience you always know that's where
you go I truly have it in my pocket and
I can actually but and I think what is
the devices like razor because they've
gone to add you know the display the
audio or even even our special devices
like the iPhone or the galaxy where we
know okay fine it's preview yeah you're
spending the most amount of money I
think that's when the justification of
some of these prices where just because
an iPhone is a thousand but I know that
iPhone can do all these X things for me
then I go it's worth my time
alright fair enough now for the last
five minutes there are a few other
products that we did see at the pixel
event in particular we were talking a
little bit about the accessories at the
razor event so we kind of covered all of
those the the chroma wireless dock we're
all looking forward to messing with that
I'll tell you that much yeah but
speaking of wireless chargers there is a
new wireless charger that is supposed to
go with the pixel it's a companies the
pixel the pixels stand
oh I haven't haven't pulled it out of
them neither have I and but this is the
whole idea that Google home is supposed
to be prevalent across all possible
products so what you're basically doing
is converting your pixel 3 into a smart
display of sorts and of course talking
about smart displace there's also the
Google Home Hub so I thought that maybe
for the last five minutes of the show we
could just give some hot takes on the
other products no the home hub for me
was particularly I thought it was bigger
like it it's yeah all of you away he's
tiny I think you know what happy no when
I looked at it I was expecting something
like the Lenovo one and then when I saw
it I was like that's cute okay so here's
the thing I small it is I think Google
just didn't
say it but they wanted to at the Google
home ad the old version is dead and this
is the new Google home 145 bucks it's
very easy to get it's literally the
price of a Google home now you've got a
screen you've got everything no no I I
mean look I ordered my big soul yeah but
I I am very disappointed in the screen
size though I don't know how BIG's asked
me know it's like a 7-inch tablet would
like a doc in the back yes I mean I
don't know what the I don't know what
the screen size is and I didn't do no is
it small it's all in the lenovo is
definitely smaller and I'm disappointed
well cuz you use the lenovo as a literal
secondary screen yeah yeah and they're
whole the whole idea behind the
presentation was that you're using the
hub to activate other things like
chromecast yeah what's kind of their
main thing yeah um you can play YouTube
on it no no I know I get it
I just just put a Crean in your kitchen
and cast to it and that's it no exactly
no no I'm thinking let's see this is the
problem we need to have a show about
techies and consumers and why we don't
think like that I tried not to think
like myself because what I can do I
don't need any of that shit for me
that's how you can convert into the
kernel no I totally agree with you just
saying that's what they were saying I do
get I just don't I personally don't even
need a screen I just need this you know
I love it I really bought it but but
when I put the speaker I mean the nofa
one in the house I'd go oh great cuz I
did a video in my video was all about
being making french scrambled eggs and
watching the step-by-step process
you needed that no it was it scrambled
eggs II know it's very different but
we're just watching the process right is
it's an from 7 inch or whatever the
screen size for home up to this one is
is it different thing and for the
consumer that's my own concern usually
if you have a bigger size the problem
but also it is it is just big enough
that you can still do those things
comfortably yeah no I like it I want one
I didn't order it but I I'm gonna order
it definitely did you open your
chromecast of course I did okay it's in
the back so what's what's the update on
this one cuz I didn't pitch I had no
idea
fabric like the the design no idea yeah
they really didn't give a whole lot of a
whole lot like refresh we've updated to
match everybody else kind of I now
remember what you wanted to talk about
the buds that came in the box with the
pixel so look forward to an actual
review of the buds that come in the box
because I was excited when I saw the
league cuz I feel like the only person
that actually liked the pixel buds when
they came out yes yes I think you like
him more than even the Google employees
yeah I actually like them now again
again the usage of a product colors the
way that I view the entire thing were
they comfortable no after about an hour
I wanted to take them out every single
time they would never stayed in my ears
tomorrow but let me say that the way
Google assistant was implemented in
those is the way it should be in every
single headphone that has Google
assistant in it well but now they're
doing it like you have that integration
and for example the LG tones like you
didn't you don't need wires for the bows
so I was gonna ask you so but it doesn't
have that integration I don't know it
doesn't have that integration and so a
question do the Sony's the Mark threes
have it its job those triggers it okay
so literally when you press it becomes
like a walkie talkie to the Google
assistant it you don't have to wait for
King yeah the reason why I don't know
this is because when I got the the buds
last year I tried to send it out myself
Zack David and Fisher tried to set it up
with three phones and it didn't work and
I could only completely trashed
eventually recent I set it up and with
the pixel - yeah oh really
many imagine set up with you with the
the galaxy so you should try and the
audio have everything was or have they
sent you the LG tones the new platinum
the new platinum is easy yeah okay try
the Google assistant on that I it's so
cool like it's little it's probably what
I was like wait a second so I thought it
was just the button where you call on
the Google assistant and that's it and
I'm like well we've been able to just
press and hold on the icon X 2018 then
just call on Bixby or whatever but this
is an intersectional intuitive way of
doing it's a different approach can you
explain it
yeah basically whenever you get some
sort of notification on your phone you
can set up which apps it gets it that
that trigger it yeah Google assistant
will chime immediately and read to you
immediately what it is that you got a
notification also so basically it's
closer to her right the movie a little
bit yeah all right all right yeah and so
for example if I get a message from one
of you guys on messenger it'll go
notification from messenger in a bomb
Baba okay and if you wish to respond
press the button and I go boom and it
goes would you like to say and I go
nobody goes got it this is what you want
to say bubble but would you like to
press the button boom it's not this
whole voice-activated Android auto
typing that I despise yeah where it's
like do you want to send it or change it
and I'm like send it what would you like
to say send it it's so it type scented
and it ask again would you like to send
it or change it I get that they wanted
use that as a different station point
and Google if you're watching this you
probably are because you're watching
don't pocket now know my channel
don't make it a differentiation point on
your product
this has to be standard but it is so
here's a thing I don't know I know I use
and that scones you said on the tones
but wait JBL cheap yeah yeah but I'm
saying it like I don't know about the
mark 3 so I'm gonna test it when I get
to the when I get to the hotel because I
brought my mark threes yeah but like if
you get those LG tones platinum se yeah
so I tested them on the gallon though I
didn't test them on the Galaxy Note 9 I
tested them on the v40 work just fine
pixel to XO work just fine because this
is a back-end that's built into Google
exactly and so actually okay okay so you
have to download a version of the Google
assistant to the tones so it's got like
its own chip
it's crazy SH musician devices exactly
so it requires certain hardware from the
device also it shouldn't probably have
at least two buttons to to make those
yeah definitely but no like it was I
also I I was like so first I remember
when I activate him for the first time
and they're like you need to activate
the cool assistant thingy and so I'm
like yeah so I went through the process
and then it's like updating firmware for
your tones and so you had to keep them
connected and keep them closed and then
boom it threw it in and then it reset at
the tones that it started in boom like
immediately I was like I just genius I
should give you one more user I should
give you one more usability feature is
the volume up button when you hold it it
will read out every notification you
have okay and then you let go whenever
you want to stop listening to it
don't ask is this bad news do you guys
think that Google I think oh I
personally think but what do you guys
think about this but should Google take
especially with assistant because I
think that's their best operating system
right now Chrome no I think that's their
best under system do you do you think
they should take the same approach as
Microsoft in making sure that it
delineates across it so EMS Windows does
it perfectly Windows on om especially
now is the same across the board and I I
think this is the best operating system
because Alexa is coming for them really
bad it's coming really strong pressure
really Reba because because I was on
those we don't have a traditional ways
or we have a future OS trend and they
are making sure is everywhere so if
Google goes look we've got a phone OMS
and the phone is in every hand we gotta
make sure that yeah that's a good way
that's a good point
wait wait a second since you mentioned
Chrome OS lots on the pixel slate hot
takes cuz we got a yeah I love it
that's a big old screen it is a big
screen I can lay this the back is
terrible it is so fingerprint prone oh
really it is bad I heard that the folio
case it's not completely flush like it's
got this weird sort of like give to it
when you close it it was okay it was
okay like it was like the Galaxy Tab s
for okay unless less bulky I can't
really give an opinion on it because I
actually have never used chrome OS
extensive know so I've been using the
pixel book lately thank you whomever
sent me the tip on Twitter whoever you
are you're you're sent from God to
remember a name by the to to remember
how to figure out how to remove the caps
lock from being the launcher that's
right I mean I've said that literally
broke that literally fix my experience
with Lois ever since then because I was
like it's a frickin caps lock key board
how is that the launcher don't reinvent
the wheel
they did that's what they did I mean
you've got the dysfunction fees I was
like why this is why I don't use
grab-ass uh so okay so the whole locate
so I am NOT a fan of Chrome OS I love
that you've got a desktop browser on it
i I just I I really wanted a good iPad
alternative I feel that Windows 10 is is
great it's just I don't know it wasn't
really even if it was they say that it
was design it wasn't
I feel Chrome OS with this update that's
coming on the slate
it looks more like a tap friendly
operating system that can still do
multitasking that can still do Android
applications um I liked it I really do
like I just can't say much about using
Chrome OS honestly that's all really
hasn't take a look at it I just think
the pricing is - I what was the price
again look if you want to get the i7 you
spend a thousand bucks yeah no no and
that's the problem like Google you
really haven't under ball port so I can
put my GPU I know it's got its good but
it's got some but it's not Windows it's
got two USB C port switch is a first on
a tablet it was got more more than the
surface one more than two more two more
two more than the surface pro that has
none because it's a USB a yeah so I
don't write myself right come on no no I
I I have to say I'm not I'm we need good
competitors to the iPad we just do
hundred percent we do I mean I can't
believe that the iPad still continues to
be the tablet I drift to simply because
it's the most well executed tablet there
is I mean I mean III do hear you coming
from somebody and I'm from that segment
that doesn't give a shit about tablets
iiep rely on tablets and everyday I know
that's you know but like I I know and I
and I do agree with you I do
I do hate the fact that Google slept on
and also just and our towers it died
that I grew gray windows was never
really meant to windows were meant for
touch not tablet functionality but just
touch
and and that's fine with me like I think
that's fine I think that was it I do
agree with that aspect that Android
tablets if he just needed one solid fine
tuning and then moving and they just
never in true Google fashion just let it
die and but I but I am I the only the
only thing I have to say Google um I am
expecting my my pixel slate and I will
plan to use it just do yourself a favor
just you know you your feet just set
them on the floor this is not a $1000
product it's not mm-hm
Chrome OS it's not a $1000 product and
on that note as the camera runs out of
SD card space you're seeing some black
