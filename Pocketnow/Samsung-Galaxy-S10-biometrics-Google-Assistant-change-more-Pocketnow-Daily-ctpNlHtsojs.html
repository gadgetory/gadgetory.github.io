scanner and join the 3d sensing Club
with the Galaxy S 10 the Google
assistant continued conversation is
already available so no need to repeat
the phrase I can't say right now and if
you want to get your hands on the
BlackBerry he to pre-orders start very
soon I'm Jaime Rivera and if you haven't
been catching the World Cup I just begun
a few days ago this has been the
weirdest time ever but it's awesome and
it's Friday we got to celebrate the
sprocket out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for a Samsung Galaxy head on over
to target this is really cool you get
$500 off in a gift card if you buy the
Galaxy Note 8 for example which is still
a great phone but there are deals I mean
this gift card continues to other Galaxy
smartphones full list in the description
oh yeah it is that compelling now let's
talk about processors I'm gonna actually
make this conversation interesting not
boring 7 nanometre is the next process
that's in the pipeline tsmc is
apparently going to be the pioneer of
this technology and believe it or not
Qualcomm is apparently already gearing
up for that 7 nanometer process to come
in their next flagship processor meaning
whenever we get the Qualcomm Snapdragon
855 which we assume is going to be the
naming scheme apparently the seven
nanometer process is going to be the
thing right now we're at n an ohmmeter
by the way with the 845 obviously there
are other processors are out there in
the market but 7 an ohmmeter is gonna
bring a lot more power efficiency and a
ton of things that might even enable 5g
to be as great as the companies have
been teasing for to be stay tuned for
that I can't wait to hear more in the
Snapdragon summit which usually happens
in December in Hawaii I know now let's
talk about the BlackBerry key to
definitely one of my favorite phones
right now our review is going to come
very soon I need to test it some more
but for those of you wondering
pre-orders begin on the 29th sale begins
on the 13th same price tag 650 I know
it's crazy but it might just be a great
phone for some of you some of you not
all of you I'll let you know more in our
review and we'll definitely discuss it
further in the pocket
weally as well now let's talk about the
Google assistance
I cannot say a phrase right now because
I have a Google home in this room but
yeah those of you that love that whole
feature at Google IO where you didn't
have to repeat the same catchphrase to
start you know the assistant you could
just say to once and then start a
conversation apparently that is rolling
out today so stay tuned for that
apparently the speakers will even leave
the microphone on for bits while you're
talking and you can have a continued
conversation I will be trying that out
and I will be reporting on it because
this is one of the things that I've
criticized about assistants the most
apparently it's finally happening and
finally the most interesting news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
apparently one of the things that the
company is going to do now is ditch
things like the ire scanner we saw it be
launched with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7
that phone exploded and then we saw it
further with other phones but the
biggest problem is that the iris scanner
is not necessarily the best way to
unlock your phone apparently what Korea
is going to do is bring us a 3d sensor
and also the fingerprint scanner
somewhere we don't know exactly where
that 3d sensor will bring us facial
recognition that apparently will do a
better job than the iris scanner and
definitely you know there are products
out there that have proven that the
thing about it in today's question let
us know how do you feel do you feel this
is a smart approach or do you feel that
sticking with the iris scanner would be
the best part because in my case I don't
really trust the 3d sensor I've seen it
be fooled and our scanners are extremely
secure I wish that at least the camera
was there you could just pick I mean Sam
saying that's what you usually do but in
the comments let us know what you think
we can't wait to hear and by the way I
am teasing this in behind the scenes at
IG TV pretty much what we're covering
and everything there is a lot of content
coming over there so join us there in
the conversation as well friends again
