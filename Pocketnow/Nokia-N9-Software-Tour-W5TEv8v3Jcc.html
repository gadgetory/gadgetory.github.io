from pocketnow.com and today we're gonna
take a look at the software on the Nokia
n9 which runs Mikko version 1.2 Harman
10 now this version of me go and MeeGo
in general is nothing like Windows Phone
iOS or Android but you will see lots of
similarities with all of these free
platforms so without any further ado
let's get to the software tour of the
Nokia n9
the Nokia n9 is a pure touch device as
Nokia likes to call it and they have
managed to build the smartphone without
any need for a hardware or capacitive
button to operate the phone instead
nokia has built it together with the the
platform ego so that the single gesture
which is most common for most people or
for every people the swipe is at the
center of operating the phone so
basically you will only need to swipe
your fingers on the screen to operate it
now what you see here is the home screen
of MIGO 1.2 Harmattan and as you can see
it's a list of icons and it might
resemble the application tray of Android
or even the icons on iOS now in terms of
similarities you will find the first
similarity here on the home screen with
the icons this is a similarity with iOS
and Android but Nakia managed to
introduce not one but three home screens
which they call panels and this is
resembling Windows Phone 7 so we got one
panel here swiping to the left will take
you to the second panel which is for
multitasking and swiping again to the
left will take you to your newsfeed
where you will see your current date the
day your location as well as the weather
any notification which you might receive
right here regarding new email messages
missed calls or text messages and right
below this part right here features your
newsfeed which aggregates your news feed
from Facebook from link them from
Twitter from Skype even which is
scrollable and of course updates at a
certain interval and swiping left once
again will take you to panel number one
or two because we have one on the right
and one on the left but you just can go
forever like this tapping at the very
top of the screen right here on the date
will bring you a shortcut notification
like screen where you can
quickly let me just zoom in for you to
see where you can quickly switch your
profile to silent beep you can of course
play with the volume controls and the
volume for the media playback you will
have a notification whether you are
connected to the internet or not we are
currently in airplane mode but connected
via wireless to our router and you can
quickly toggle your online availability
for the accounts which are set up on the
phone in our case we have Facebook and
Skype so you can bring them all online
all offline or you can toggle them one
by one now here's where the swipe comes
in wherever you are
and whichever application is on your
screen swiping from either side will
take you to your home screen let's make
a swipe from down towards up and here we
go
swiping once again to the left will take
you to your application screen which is
your multitasking screen
where all applications which are open
will have a dedicated card which is very
webOS like or Windows Phone 7 like but
it's pretty pretty good so you can
whatever jump back to the application
you are previously in this is a setting
which you can enable in inside the
settings of the phone by default when
you swipe from the top towards the
bottom you will get back to your home
screen but if you activate the setting
swiping from up to down will close the
actual application and unload it from
memory so instead of just taking us back
to the home screen it just closed the
application and it disappeared from the
multitasking screen let's get back home
and let's take a look at the
applications which come with the Nokia
n9 of course you'll find your typical
applications like your phone contacts
search Internet Explorer but what's cool
with Nokia devices is that the s2 based
company always backs navigation and maps
so what's really cool about this phone
is that it has Nakia maps which were
previous
known as avi maps but Nakia rebranded
them and the maps and the mapping data
is really really good and we should say
that the GPS part of the phone is also
great in finding GPS signal and having a
quick fix as you can see it will load
our current position in just a couple of
seconds tapping on that little icon and
we are right here where we are currently
situated and since we're talking about
the maps let's take a look at the
navigation which is called Nokia Drive
it takes a little bit of time launching
but there we go it's currently looking
for a GPS signal but it's the typical
macchia GPS navigation application which
we are glad that macchia brings also to
Windows Phone 7 as it brings it to me go
and to Symbian devices too now let's
just get back and see what else is here
we got of course email application
calendar clock the clock has a new LED
segment about the minimalistic towards
futuristic look to it you can set your
alarms as you would with any other
platform actually I should tap on the
plus and you just drag the minutes and
the hour to your desired position and
you have your alarm set we have camera
application gallery application and
let's just take a look for just a small
period of time at the gallery
application as you can see all your
pictures and videos taken with the phone
are represented here while opening a
certain picture let's just take this
actually this is the video is just white
back go back to the gallery application
back
here we go this should do just fine
nokia managed to introduce a very neat
way of editing your pictures while being
on the phone and this is a
non-destructive editing which means that
whatever changes you do and you make and
apply to your pictures will be saved as
a new file and the original will be kept
so you should go to this menu button
right here and edit and here's a list of
all of the actions you can take upon
this picture you can quickly auto fix
everything to rotate the picture and has
brightness or contrast crop resize
reduce red eyes if you have shot a
person and the red-eye secured into
flash straightening picture flip it
horizontally or vertically and that's
just it and whatever changes you make it
will save it as a new file so your
original capture will be untouched let's
just go back to the home screen and see
what else we have here
now the Facebook application was
pre-installed on the Nokia n9 but you
can also find applications in the Nokia
Store for Foursquare for Twitter and you
can also install Skype now what's
particularly interesting and annoying
about this phone is that despite the
fact that it sports a front-facing
camera there is no way in actually using
the camera so you cannot video call
somebody neither through your normal
regular phone calling procedure or or
your data connection or Wireless and you
can't even make a Skype video call so
the first and probably one of the few
applications which use the front-facing
camera on the end line is a mirror
application which is rather strange it
will start the camera and as you can see
we are here filming and that's pretty
much it
we hope Nakia fixes this with a new
software update which is coming soon
real quick we have also
applications we have a weather
application we have your documents
application we have YouTube which
unfortunately only takes you to the
mobile webpage which is by the way html5
but it's not a dedicated YouTube
application playback is OK it's smooth
but it's just the website and of course
we have some games pre-installed like
Angry Birds like real golf
Need for Speed Shift so on and so forth
we have Wi-Fi hotspot functionality and
let me tell you that this works very
very well
you have lots of settings to tweak and
the range on the Nokia n9 is
surprisingly good so while your iPhone 4
might get out of range when its emitting
and it's functioning in Wi-Fi hotspot
mode the Nokia n9 still is in range ok
let's just get back here and take a look
at something else the internet browser
and let's just close it all together and
fire up a new one first of all most
annoying is that it's not supporting
multiple tabs instead if you want to
open a link in a new tab it will
actually open a new browser for you and
switching among the two will require you
to go to the multitasking screen and
switch as you will see right now so
let's just go to pocketnow.com the
browser is actually really really good
it's fast but we have one problem with
it it often brings up the checkerboard
effect now as you can see we have a huge
checkerboard but you might say the page
is not yet loaded let's just wait for it
to fully load go back to the top and
give it a second there we go
it's fully loaded and now let's try to
swipe you see you got a checkerboard
swiping back and still it tries to catch
up so you will have to put up with this
double-tapping - zoom works just fine it
takes just a second to render
pinch-to-zoom
also works fine else it's very very
fluid and switching to landscape is
quick and we have a Windows Phone 7 like
animation which is good but also the
checkerboard will be present and
landscape too if you once you scroll
faster than the foam itself wants you to
let's just close this and get back to
the main screen of applications and take
a look at the music player now the music
player is something I like on the Nokia
n9 because it has this great
representation of all your albums and
going into one particular album will
bring you the huge album art which
really pops up the deep blacks on the
AMOLED screen nothing to mention here
let's just close it like this and get
back to the homescreen
let's take a quick look at the settings
but it's built right here and you will
see that you have several regions of the
screen you have the top region where he
can flip the switch on flight mode you
have a quick menu to your internet
connection
whether you are on wireless or on data
connection you have your mobile network
settings you have general settings for
the brightness and as you will notice
there is no way in turning off the
ambient light sensor so we are currently
maxed out with the settings then you
have the bottom part of the screen which
is your default settings menu with
device Bluetooth sounds and vibration
wallpaper and so on and so forth you
can't really have anything out of the
ordinary is just your typical settings
which you might expect from a phone lets
just swipe back and let's take a look
for a second at the multitasking screen
this screen shows you the cards of the
applications which are currently open
and pinching and zooming will change the
display from a
to buy to representation to a 3x3
representation which is good if you have
many applications tapping any one of the
screens will take you to the application
itself switching between them is really
really quick but if you want to close an
application you will tap and hold on one
and tap the X or if you want to close
everything you just step on close all
and you will have a clean fresh start
while still at the application screen
there is an easy way to rearrange the
icons you just tap and hold and you drag
the icon wherever you want but you
cannot drag it to another screen the
screens are fixed and there are no
widgets so if you are a widget guy you
will not like the Nokia n9 let's just
say we're done here
and that's pretty much it we have the
three panels we have the application
list and one of the main problems with
the Nokia n9 will actually stop with the
device it's with the ecosystem itself is
that MIGO doesn't have that much
applications probably it has the least
applications among all the mobile
platforms currently so if you go to
store and try to find an application
like Spotify for instance you will not
find it well you will say that I'm wrong
because but if I just recently launched
the Amigo application but believe me I
cannot find it and I will demonstrate it
let's just taps but if I and we have a
third-party application now this might
depend on the actual location of the
phone of your account your geographical
location for the account itself but
going back home and going to categories
let's say you want to go to applications
you have all your categories let's go
into business and well as you can see
the scroll bar there are really not that
much applications installed so probably
or available so probably you will go
through them
then a couple of days hopefully this
will be fixed in the future when
probably mEagle will become a little bit
more popular even though with nakiye
maintaining it that's a very thin chance
for it
of course it's with any Nokia device it
comes also with the early music which
will soon be rebranded to Nakia music
it's basically your marketplace for
music where you can purchase songs
albums and so on and so forth if you are
into music and purchasing music from
your phone this is the place where you
will go on your Nokia and nine last but
not least let's take a look at the the
gaming performance and the gaming
experience at the Nokia n9 and let's try
to launch Angry Birds and see how it
goes
there we go so as you can see the
scrolling is fluid and so is the
pinching and zooming so we really don't
have anything bad to say here in terms
of framerate performance let's try Need
for Speed Shift which is more demanding
just zoom in a little bit
but those were real real quick
take a look at all those smudges on the
screen this is one of the best points of
the Nokia n9
as you can see it's buttery smooth
and it's very very responsive except for
my driving skills
it's very playable it's enjoyable so
nothing bad again to say here just jump
back and take the application first and
there we go we just close the
application altogether so this was a
short brief look at the software on the
Nokia n9 the same phone well
approximately the same phone will come
with Windows Phone 7 it will be called
Nokia Lumia 800 now is it better than me
go of course it's better because it's
one of the top three platforms currently
available but me go really has some
potential and it's really really
unfortunate that Nokia abandoned the
platform I'm sure that with the proper
support both from manufacturers and
developers it will become a pretty neat
little platform but at the moment it's
not something you might want to switch
to if you are an Android iOS or Windows
Phone user if you've liked this video
please give us a thumbs up this was

look at the software on the Nokia n9
