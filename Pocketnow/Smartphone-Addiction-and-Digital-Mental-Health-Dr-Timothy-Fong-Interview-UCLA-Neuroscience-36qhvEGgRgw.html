several months ago talking about
technology addiction and my own attempts
at adjusting my smartphone behavior by
switching my phone screen over into a
grayscale black and white mode we got a
number of questions from people asking
about the actual science behind making a
move like that
if removing color from a screen really
would reduce those dopamine reward hits
our brains get whenever we pick up our
smartphones taking a look at the science
digging deeper to see if there's any
research to support this internet
hypothesis I figured what better way to
examine this question than to drive down
to UCLA and have a sit-down conversation
with dr. Timothy Fong a psychiatrist in
the neurology department of UCLA and he
was kind enough to spend some time
explaining where we're at in terms of
technology research were on the bleeding
edge of digital mental health and he
shared his thoughts on the effectiveness
of my grayscale screen smartphone
experiment dr. Baum um thank you so much
for joining us this is a topic I've been
really excited to follow up on just
based on my own experiences tinkering
with my own brain um would you do you
mind briefly describing some of the
research you've been doing here at UCLA
absolutely thanks for having me let me
turn my phone off notes up it's not that
I'm checking Twitter or anything like
that why I'm a diction psychiatrist here
at UCLA I'm the co-director of our UC a
gambling studies program as well as our
addiction psychiatry fellowship and
clinics at over the last 15 years as
I've been seeing patients one of the new
things that has evolved is people who
call with questions about do I have an
addiction to video games gambling and
pornography and in the last couple years
we've seen more and more people calling
say I have trouble regulating my cell
phone usage and with that it's things
like news aggregation sites it's acting
like social media opportunities so and
then addiction psychiatrist we've been
gathering more clinical information
stories about men and women who develop
pathological and unhealthy relationships
with their phones I call it an addictive
sorter we're not quite sure what exactly
is going on with their brains and their
minds but at the end of the day when
they tell us their stories they're
struggling with depression sleep
deprivation anxiety low self-esteem and
the cellphone
are making their lives better so that's
some of the work that we're doing this
is so raw that we're still even trying
to find the terminology absolutely
absolutely very new leading-edge and if
there's something even leading edge
about a leading edge of wood would be it
so if you have insurance agencies they
have a patient with cellphone addiction
will you reimburse me for service
they'll say no such disease exists
gotcha inside our handbook that we
diagnose me and women with mental
illnesses there is the term internet use
disorder okay that's in the appendix
it's really talking about using the
Internet to play video games not talking
about cell phone usage and social media
and apps and things like that so much
has to be score there are very few
research centers I am aware of that are
actually looking at the issue of digital
health and digital mental health but
there will be more and more folks
looking at this this is as we see more
and more interested in society where we
need to figure out what exactly is going
on and I think particularly as society
says we need to disturb lished some
basic guidelines and rules and etiquette
or standards or prevention techniques I
mean there's not a household in America
that doesn't have this conversation turn
that phone off okay they can get obvi
back right now will you and what's
happened in the last five years I notice
is not just parents to children now its
children saying that the parents
children saying to grandparents it's
cross generational I think that's a
really important thing to talk about
don't real quick just to kind of show
you what I was working with this is what
my phone screen looks like small online
is Blaine onion and so um oh yeah he got
it out bigger yeah bigger a super
American few days but one of the most
immediate things that took me by
surprise wasn't at all my phone so much
more boring yeah it was how little
iconography meant to me mm-hmm
like swirling circles didn't mean as
much as yellow swatch red splotch blue
swatch but this is this is how I
normally use my phone throughout the day
now unless I'm trying to show something
off and how long have you done it this
way about five months now and it has a
cut down on the amount of time you use
it
down on the kind of wasted time where
you start searching and messing around
with so I so there's I mean obviously
this looks a lot less interesting so if
I pull up Instagram black and white is
stunning for photography and then
someone takes a good color in photo it's
going to be a good looking photo in
black and white
yeah that's the thing where I used to
reply to one notification on my phone
and then an hour later I'd find myself
like deep dive on Twitter right you know
this is still in the realm of bro
science ya internet song right and I'm
not sure whether or not it's because I'm
actually willing myself like I have a
desire to change my behavior is this
really contributing to that desire or is
this more of a placebo and it's a
reminder to me that I'm you know kind of
like rubber bands you out of years
alright well go back to the beginning
when you did this what was the intent
were you saying I need to cut down on
like cell phone news or you saying I
want a healthier relationship with my
phone and it's out definitely the second
one you know I'm recently the father of
a young child my wife and I just had our
first kid and I was looking for I want
more meaningful interactions with my
gadgets noticing where I'll be on the
couch in two hours I've just evaporated
right we're up sending on my laptop yeah
I go to do one thing and then I have a
black outfit right and kind of wake up
later having exhausted right so I mean
it's interesting because you know I have
a similar one and obviously mine all in
color what you're talking about is a
brand new area of neuroscience
psychology psychiatry it's an area that
we call digital health or digital mental
health if you will for thousands of
years we as humans have had
relationships with inanimate objects you
know actual personal feelings to call it
clothes we wear the story we play with
everything from from the time we were
cavemen no other time in human history I
think we've created such a device that
has such intense emotional feeling good
bad ugly everything in between and I
think about my own experiences growing
up as a child in the 80s my generation
addicts compared to Millennials it's
totally different
and so as we were reflecting before
or you know some of the concerns of our
parents growing up with your brains
gonna turn to mush you're going to be
wasting away your grades are going to go
bad or even just like a let concern over
using the brain I know you like it I was
sitting too close to the TV you know you
don't want you know why yeah but it was
very concrete spheres what's different
now I think is because these are
indispensable tools in our lives never
going away
right and because how fast technology
advances and we don't know how to brain
respond to those advances in technology
we don't know what the next 15 20 years
when I look at it from my standpoint as
an addiction psychiatrist pretty simple
when people's relationship with objects
or behaviors or activities goes into the
zone of unhealthy harmful destructive
that's an addiction when it makes their
life better when they have a better
quality of life when they do things
quicker faster that's not an addiction
that's a hobby that's a passion that's
increased productivity right that's the
difference between someone saying oMG I
check my phone all the time I was
addicted exactly versus someone who's
displaying in your opinion
self-destructive behavior exactly so
giving example so we saw someone in our
clinic last week a you see a student who
chief complaint was that I'm on too many
social media devices and I can't get
anything done
well his GPA had really sank his
friendships human relationships were
very very minimal a lot of time spent on
the Internet and he basically said I
couldn't stop looking I kept looking for
the last page of the Internet
right so not exercising Horsley console
version craving in a negative way this
is not healthy right they're not
normative sign what you've done is an
interesting tactic is modified behavior
to you began to recognize something I
don't really like I don't like my life
being consumed by an activity right call
it drugs alcohol gambling sex video
games internet information I'm going to
modify it in a way that's going to keep
my relationship boundaries of day that
hasn't been tested we don't know that
words I wanted works for you right is
for you for what
reason it shuts off the noise I think it
probably serves as a clear reminder very
quickly this is just a phone right this
is just a vessel for information what
I'm reminded every interesting Leno is
the Sunday newspaper so growing up I
remember exactly the exciting thing
about a Sunday newspaper was that it was
in color and a comics were in color and
you actually spent more time going
through each thing right kind of what
you've done is that you haven't changed
the information available with speed of
which you can get you change the
formatting which not that has made it
less interesting but it made it less
automatic less reflexive like oh my gosh
well what's this what seemingly big so
but what you're getting through this is
a larger discussion that we're not
having as a society about digital
etiquette digital health where does it
end
because what's different is the amount
of information you can get on that phone
the entire human experience right it's
incredible compared to when I was a kid
64k computer nothing exactly we're
married I grew up on an old Don backer
and so the thing that people are
addicted to information just like you
think about what are people addicted to
when it comes to alcohol or drugs or
gambling they're addicted to the process
they're addicted to how that behavior
makes them feel and they're addicted to
the access so it's less the delivery or
is the delivery mechanism now why we're
starting to see more discussion lab
civilly the delivery how fast it is the
innovations and novelties those are all
what's compelling people would be
constantly on the hunt so example you
know I see my friends or when I go out
with my family I watch people constantly
checking and you ask them what's the
reason you're checking it so often they
can't articulate they say well I don't
want to miss anything
FOMO you know I don't I feel like you
know I need to be part of it I feel like
I need to be connected those are not
signs of addiction those are signs of
false idea what a relationship really is
okay as I did I constantly have to be
right there in the moment that I'm not
part of the leading edge or the most
relevant news at the time somehow I'm a
and important or somehow I will miss out
which means that my life was something
I'll be no good right another
fascinating story and there's a great
story it's worth the time I was in the
UCLA gym in a sauna a couple months ago
and used to undergrad guys were there
you're talking about how they're using
Instagram and having that a woman class
and he's like oh and she was really
great and I got her I invited her on
Instagram and she took so long to get
back what's up with this girl what does
it matter with you and the other guy
said hey how long did she get back to
you
twelve hours so he said twelve hours was
too long to run a twitch connection
whereas you know when when I was going
to college and be like swinger to be
like I don't want to call her back for
at least two days that's right exactly
alright so the idea that we've also
created these new rules right aren't
written down that in some ways are
absolutely not attainable well and you
find that it's not even so much that we
can create a rule because I know in our
coverage recently it's been the rule is
this behavior will change when the next
hot new app or service comes out and
then we kind of throw out you know what
Twitter at it was so that we can now
talk about snapchat exactly under people
are starting to evade some of the
communication aspects of Facebook
writing to look at more short form and
disposable right entertainment or
communication my big concern as again as
an addiction psychiatrist is that we
know that there's going to be a
significant number of people in the
population we don't know what that
number but Kali around 1 to 2 percent
where there lies because of cell phone
because of Technology will become very
very much harm just like the folks when
video games came out or when pornography
turned into VCRs right anything that
could be potentially highly rewarding
and it's highly available highly
accessible does have the potential to
become addictive to some so the
questions that we get a lot are from
parents to say well how do I manage this
for my kids or from kids umbilical how
do I manage my parents so I think it
goes back to the sim
but difficult idea realize that this is
still ultimately a utility tool like a
screwdriver it's like a vacuum cleaner
right it's like a foam it is a motor but
we have part of it is been
mostly in our lives easier better and
more enjoyable and it does for the vast
majority of time the battle comes in
when you have such constant flow of
information is that paradox of choice
you have too much to look at and then
you end up drifting into dissatisfaction
I think that's why some of the academic
studies that looked at Facebook users
who use way more is they're depressed or
anxious
yeah they don't sleep well and that's
true for in any social media app and
that's also true for any video game so
what's interesting is that with the bone
we can access not just any addiction but
the holidays right drugs alcohol
gambling hyper sexual behavior all via
the phone so the phone is both not only
the thing that you become addicted to
what's also a vessel that lead you to
other addiction I'm glad you brought up
just the notion of other addictions
being sort of influenced by
accessibility is there a component to
some mobile addiction or Internet
addiction which you know someone might
be trying to treat something else going
on in their life that may be the tether
to their phone isn't necessarily the
actual problem there from the self
medicate up to it absolutely so again
it's the vessels so imagine someone with
a gambling problem you just use their
phone to access casinos employee bets
whereas the ten years ago get too dry
for hours in casino now I can do a lot
at work and gambled my entire life Satan
so the technology is allowed access to
that world of addiction so much quicker
one of the real challenging parts is and
how do you tell patients to get rid of
their phones or to limit their access so
that they can't have to live the rest of
their natural lives so an example I have
a patient who you know relies on her
phone because she's a traveling
salesperson right and she needs maps and
calling people but she's also a
pathological gambler
and she's constantly on the phone
placing bets and you know doing this
online game so it's a real challenge but
what's fascinating would be the way we
have our phones right now is not only
are they potentially an addictive source
they're potentially also the treatment
for addiction okay so we have actually
several really interesting apps that are
in development or things out there right
now
that brings treatment and recovery into
the film so as an example I only do
patience you know what's a way to go
once a month but the fact that the phone
could be your guide your ego if you will
with your treatment source your sponsor
in some ways to really help manage your
your health and behavior that's an
amazing thing that's why so many people
are using fitness apps and I know things
like that in the recovery world of
addiction these are now apps are
starting to come true so for instance if
you go by a bar and the phone will
notify you you're too close to alcohol
or go today you're not traveling a new
city here the meetings that are open
available for you the way I think about
it we really we haven't studied the
untapped potential of cell phone
technology and abilities that improve
our lives and that is going to be just
so quick every every week new thing to
coming out right but at the same time we
also haven't really studied very well
what is doing the first physical nature
of our brain and number two what is it
doing to our psychological makeup to our
minds and how we view people I have an
11 year old we have an 11 year old son
and he's in 6th grade a big debate over
the last year was shouldn't he get a
phone right and my daughter just turned
one we're having on the phone oh yeah
and rounded my glowing rectangle with
the other one wearing which I won all
the time and I don't have a good
explanation part some may say safety
tracking you can participate in social
experiences when you don't have a phone
people kind of laugh at you yeah I have
two phones this and I have an old flip
phone every time I bring out the flip
phone people laugh at me and they kind
of say that's why you interview that and
it doesn't feel good right on the flip
side exposing a young brain is not fully
developed it's just infinite information
right stimulating that's confusing
that's no idea where it's coming from
what does that do to brain development
right so think back to
why when we were kids again there's a
reason why we didn't watch r-rated
movies there's a reason we were allowed
into adult theaters because we knew
information like that before you were
mature really warp how you view the
world it would warp your morality and
your judgments that's what's really
fascinating the idea that your daughter
can now access really really
unbelievable images that you never would
ever want her to see in your entire
lifetime right and get it pretty easily
we love to have NIH or other folks
provide funding to study this on a
research and level it's just not there
yet this is a brand new field inside
mental health
we're coining digital health digital
mental health and I think very very very
simply that cell phones offer both
incredible promise to help improve our
lives but there's also a small part of
it I could for those who are genetically
vulnerable and psychologically
vulnerable really develop a this dark
side of addiction behavior are there
resources that people can have to start
meeting up more if they were wanting to
have a conversation with their physician
or with their medical team not anything
that I would call scientifically
credible or scientifically validated I
would fold all this under the rubric of
just central mental health okay and so
my general rule of thumb is if you are
struggling with what you believe to do
behavior or your loved one is and it's
causing stress dismay harm arguments
tension and that's worth an issue to
talk to mental health professionals on
any regardless of what's going on your
stress you're not sleeping your mood is
low if you're anxious you need to talk
to somebody about that to figure out do
I have an addiction to cellphone so I
have depression during an ADHD do I have
just a poor relationship with my family
lots of possibilities there
so my anecdotal experiences we can kind
of firmly put into the bucket of
Internet bro science for now there's
nothing to really suggest that like it
really did tinker with my brain
chemistry more than just my own desire
to change my behavior I think so as an
example what they would be fascinating
to image your brain both on cell phones
and off cell phones or on certain apps
when you're engaging with other apps as
you're engaging or very simply in your
case taking your phone
first in color and contain what happens
to your brain inside a brain scanner
versus when you're using that stone in
grayscale so then you not to be able to
see how much damage I've done to my
brain by doing if that brain is actually
still inside thank you so much David
same time I really appreciate you having
the conversation with us appreciate it
thank you once again I want to thank dr.
Fong for taking the time to speak with
us this is a topic I think is
fascinating as technology rapidly
outpaces our society's ability to come
up with new etiquette to address these
new methods of communication and it
should be reiterated that if you feel
you have any issues with any kind of
addictive behavior that you seek out the
advice of a trained medical professional
this is absolutely a topic I'll be
looking to revisit in the near future
and if you've had any experiences that
you'd like to share and managing your
own internet consumption definitely drop
