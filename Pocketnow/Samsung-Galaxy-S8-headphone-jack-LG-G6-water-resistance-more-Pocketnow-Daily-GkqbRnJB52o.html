another Apple with the galaxy s 8 the
feature LG g 6 might bring some sort of
water resistance to the table and amazon
has successfully reinvented the wheel on
how regular retail store should work I'm
hi Mary vetta and can you imagine if
Amazon would pull that same strategy
with bars they would be amazing this is
parking out daily the official loose
today begin with Amazon go the company
wants to reinvent the way retail stores
would work though this time it's going
to be with groceries and it's going to
begin in 2017 in select areas starting
with Seattle I believe the way this is
going to work is that instead of
checking out your items when you select
them this is actually backwards you
check in your phone the smartphone will
be able to geo locate where you are know
what items you picked and you simply
leave the store and Amazon will bill
your Amazon account this is genius we
wanted and bars we want it in retail
stores that sell you close hopefully
companies pick on this is awesome now
let's talk about wearable market share
for those of you that are wondering
which is the company that reigns supreme
it is Fitbit still 23 points six percent
of the market followed by shallow me and
then Apple is fourth four point nine
percent of the market followed by
Samsung at 4.6 obviously we're talking
about all wearables here not just
smartwatches we know that Apple
currently wins in the SmartWatch market
sad to see that Fitbit which is the
company that provides the most closed
ecosystem and most limited products is
actually the king hopefully that changes
other very interesting statistics are
rather shameful for Android which tells
us which of the versions of the
operating system is the ocean covered
right now being lollipop at thirty-four
percent followed by marshmallow at 26
we've got Kit Kat at a close 20 and then
we've even got froyo on the list being
nougat the worst one Google really needs
to go back to the drawing board with
this now some of the spotlight over to
the smartphones that we can expect for
2017 the LG G 6 being the company's new
haven are hopefully the one that's going
to fix all the problems that LG
been dealing with because the v20 hasn't
really been it not because the v 20 is a
bad product but because LG does terrible
marketing with it right now when it
comes to the g6 apparently we're getting
ip67 water and dust resistance those of
you that are wanting a removable battery
apparently that is going to die it seems
that LG hasn't really followed on the
lessons that Samsung is learning right
now and in addition to that apparently
we are getting that new selfie camera
that includes an iris scanner that is
going to be cool we can't wait to see
what we get and finally a very
interesting news that they have to do
with the samsung galaxy s 8 we've got
rumors over what to expect on its design
rather polarizing first of all
apparently the home button is dying it's
going to be part of the display
following what kind of Apple does with
the iphone 7 with the force touch home
button and the rumors that the iphone 8
will include the home button within the
display as well apparently we are also
getting speakers from harman as part of
the acquisition that is great samsung
really needs to do this the Harman
speakers on the huawei mediapad m3 are
awesome they are really awesome but
probably the worst part is that
apparently the headphone jack is dying
and this is terrible like seriously I
mean let's talk about this on the
question today do you think that company
should start killing the headphone jack
because in my case I think the companies
should not or if anything fine give me
two USB seaports and let's be done with
it but not just one port and make things
more complicated leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
