pocketnow.com and this is Vista Mobile
sort of on an HTC Titan 2 or 18 detail
so here it is I'm gonna log on
okay here we are and we have a lot of
different elements of Mistah that are
actually integrated so we have the Vista
Start menu which actually looks pretty
good we can go to all programs to see
sort of the files on the device if we go
to computer we get an actual listing of
the capacity that's currently being
taken up so that's really cool we can
just heard the sound from Outlook that I
have a new message the same Windows
sound we can actually add widgets over
here so if we press the plus button we
can add a calendar widget meters and a
pictures widget we could do other things
like we can go to the tray and expand
the tray to see the the widgets icon we
also have the actual time in the bottom
right corner we have links to things
like Windows Media Player messaging
camera phones so clicking on any of
these will actually take you to
literally the application it's really
just an application launcher but it's a
really nice looking application launcher
kind of a novelty and this will work on
any QVGA device like the 18t tilt HTC
Titan - HTC Touch unfortunately I don't
think it's available for v-j devices and
what i'm doing here is i'm running y's
bar advanced - and i'll post links on
PocketNow on how to do this and it's
basically a skin for wise bar advanced
and the program cost 15 dollars after 15
day trial so for most people it won't be
worth it but to show your friends it may
be kind of cool let me see if I can
there it is the well went off I see I
hit the the lock button so here's the
standard Vista logoff restart power off
and sleep button so a lot of elements
coming from Vista just something kind of
cool to mess around with so that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
