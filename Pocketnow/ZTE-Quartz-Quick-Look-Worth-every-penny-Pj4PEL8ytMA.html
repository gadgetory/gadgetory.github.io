today is not just convincing new users
that they should try one but also they
should do so at the hefty price tag
involved I mean like seriously four
hundred dollars will buy you not just
any smartphone today now what if a
company decided to build something
really good all the while making the
entry less dramatic on the wallet I'm
how you may believe at it with pocket
now and this is our quick look at the
ZTE quartz yes this is very late
coverage but it was very important for
us to visit this particular watch
because the ZTE quartz has one purpose
and it's to break the price barrier that
stands between first-time users and
Android wear this watch is just the
crazy $192 at the time of this video and
really that's a great way to start one
thing I've learned is that once you
start using a SmartWatch it's really
hard to go back so less than $200 buys
you a strong aluminum body at ip67 water
in this resistance there's a 1.4 inch
AMOLED display with the same Snapdragon
wear 2100 processor found in high-end
Android wear smartwatches and then the
same 768 megabytes of RAM and 4 gigs of
storage and yeah you know me I remove
these ugly rubber straps in favor of a
more stainless steel look from Amazon
even at this price tag there are some
things that make this watch unique it's
500 milliamp hour battery addresses one
of the biggest complaints of Android
wear tirado which is the fact that it's
able to reach the end of the day just
fine it also permanently connects the
t-mobile's network up to the point where
you can't really remove the SIM card so
yeah you can use it for phone calls too
and the speaker is rather loud oh and
yes we're running Android wear tirado
with the same user interface and the
same performance as if you're buying a
more expensive watch so what's the catch
well it cuts a few corners here and
there like for starters it is a very
thick watch making it look odd even with
fancy straps on it there is no heart
rate sensor on the watch either so even
if you can use the GPS for a run
calculating other fitness
tivities will sadly be limited I also
wish there was a little better taste
with the watch phases there are a few
that actually looked better and they're
always on mode then when the watch turns
on and last but not least there is no
ambient light sensor so you will have to
be controlling the brightness manually
bottom line I still consider this to be
a lot of watch for less than $200 it's
fancy enough to be worn for day to day
and if you do limited fitness activities
you'll be just fine after testing the
ZTE quartz for more than two weeks I
have to say that this is actually a very
good product definitely a good way to
start of your new and Android wear folks
