called why I'm buying a Nokia Lumia 920
instead of an iPhone 5 well there's
nothing else I am a man of my word I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow dot-com
and this is the Nokia Lumia 920 that I
just bought at the AT&amp;amp;T store let's pop
open the box see what it has to offer
so before we pop open the box just a few
words on that AT&amp;amp;T in story experience
there was a long line outside the Apple
Store for the iPad Mini but there was
also a line outside the AT&amp;amp;T store for
the Lumia 920 not just for service and
repair or the other things that retail
stores normally take care of a lot of
people were there specifically to buy
the 920 so that was good to see when we
got in there things were a little bit
disappointing there were no demo units
of the 920 or any of the new Windows
Phone 8 on the floor there was a ton of
stuff for the Lumia 900 the existing
Windows Phone 7 line nothing for Windows
Phone 8 on the floor additionally there
were owned the only colors that were
available were white black and red not
the cyan I wanted nor the gray I wanted
as a backup and they only had the JBL
powerup speaker dock in black they
didn't have that in cyan or white
finally the wireless charging plate that
AT&amp;amp;T is offering for free when you buy a
Lumia 920 on a contract was also not in
stock but 218 T's credit they did offer
to ship it to me and I took them up on
that so that should be arriving in three
to five days I kind of a mixed bag on
the in-store experience certainly a
pleasant one but didn't exactly feel
complete so AT&amp;amp;T hasn't gone out of its
way to impress anybody with its recent
packaging design and that holds true for
the box on the Lumia 920 visually it's
fine but it's made out of very very
cheap flimsy feeling cardboard and it's
just it's it's not a premium unboxing
experience but that holds true for
pretty much everything from AT&amp;amp;T these
days as I said with the exception of the
iPhone this is the the product pictured
on the back it looks like the black one
is there on
of these boxes but on the side here you
can see the device color is called out
readily let's enough of checking out
this unimpressive box just pull the flap
open we have a Quick Start Guide here
put that off to the side texting and
driving it can wait good advice as
always on the screen protector there
this is the 9:20 itself as you can see I
got the gloss white version because the
cyan and gray were not available as I
mentioned before let's put that aside
see what else in the box here is your
SIM door key pop open the rest of the
box oh very nice little NFC tag here
it's very very nice what do you want to
learn more about this is a what is this
I don't know what this is this is just a
postcard that's all this is there are no
NFC tags and like this I thought maybe
you could tap the phone into each one of
these tiles but maybe I'm just crazy
product and safety information and a
wall charger USB cable Wow nothing else
going on here no headphones nothing
extra this could just as easily be a box
for a mid-range or low-end product
really nothing special about the
packaging but thankfully we're not here
to look at just the packaging we're here
to look at the Lumia 920 once again in
gloss white screen protector on the
front back protector on the back with
call-outs for the phone's various
features here obviously calling out the
USB port calls out the camera power and
volume keys good response on these as we
remember from our hands-on time in New
York City really really good feedback
and the buttons are cool to the touch
very nice you can see the Nokia smile
design here with the speaker grilles in
USB port on the bottom as long as some
as well as some the Torx screws there
here's that 8.7 megapixel camera nokia
informs us that they have changed the
metal on this to prevent the easy
scratching that was happening on the
Lumia 800 and 900 SIM tray up here my
sim has already been installed by AT&amp;amp;T
thank you guys
headphone jack up top obviously as well
and we're back to the front so let's go
ahead and take the screen protector off
my favorite part of on
boxing a device listen to that that's
break sound
and while we're doing that when we go
ahead and take it off on the back here
and the last thing we'll do in this
unboxing is do our first boot obviously
the phone came from the AT&amp;amp;T store we
decided to go a little bit different we
are we do have another review unit that
we're doing the full review on but this
is a retail demo three two one this is
one I bought at the 18 t retail store so
it is running final presumably final
AT&amp;amp;T software so this is a boot time
test for the production version so I had
a little bit of a problem there the SIM
card was not seated properly in the sim
tray so I had to use the included sim
key to pop that tray out receipt the SIM
card and for those of you who like your
boot times to be timed accurately with
final software we're just going to do
this again one two three there's a
little vibration buzz we'll see the 18 t
splash screen again and I noticed in my
several attempts when I was kind of
fiddling with the SIM card using the the
Quick Start Guide and things like that
to make sure it was facing the right
direction that the boot time is
considerably faster when the SIM card is
seated properly so this should be coming
right up here still not a speed demon on
the boot time as you can see we're
coming up on it feels like about 15 15
seconds or so I think I've read
elsewhere and I've heard from other
members of our team the total boot time
is hanging somewhere between 20 and 30
seconds so obviously not the fastest
phone to boot ever but that is a trivial
concern for most folks welcome to your
Windows Phone I have signal bars and
thankfully the SIM card looks seated
properly looks like I can get started
setting up my new Nokia Lumia 920 guys
