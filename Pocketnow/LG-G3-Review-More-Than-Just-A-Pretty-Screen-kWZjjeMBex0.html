LG's brand was kind of a punch line or
an afterthought at best but then came
the Optimus G in 2012 a pleasant
surprise with its elegant hardware and
responsive software that was followed by
last year's g2 an aesthetic wash but a
powerful contender and then the curved
self-healing G flex a device we called
the smartphone of the future the message
was clear
LG was no longer content simply to keep
up it wanted to astound with its latest
flagship the company looks to achieve
that through the power of simplicity
paired with super specifications I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and let's
see if LG succeeded with our video
review of the LG g3 here's what
everyone's talking about when it comes
to the g3 the earth-shatteringly sharp
5.5 inch quad HD display here's what
everyone should be talking about
everything else look it's not that the
screen isn't impressive it is it
stretches across nearly the whole face
of the phone there's almost no bezels
it's amazing and with 538 pixels every
inch you can fit an awful lot of sharp
text onto the canvas and the colors are
beautiful but you can say the same about
a lot of screens on the market these
days 1080p screens that don't require as
much power to operate and which shine a
lot brighter in broad daylight
the g3 screen isn't unusable in the Sun
but it definitely wouldn't be our first
choice for outdoors people and we don't
think the bump to 2k will be noticeable
for the majority of buyers out there so
let's call it what it is a speck stunted
the thing is once you take your focus
off the display you start to see what
else is great about this build its
wing-like chassis is angular in a very
sleek very modern way but it's also very
comfortable to hold it's lightweight but
not too lightweight it's thin enough to
slide easily into a pocket and thick
enough in the middle that it's
comfortable to type on the rear keys
have been re-engineered
there now click ear and easier to find
by feel and the back covers matte finish
protects the faux metallic layer from
fingerprints even if it offers no such
protection from scratches dents and wear
and tear
it's a shame LG couldn't incorporate the
self-healing coating from the G flex
here as this is a slippery phone that's
pretty easy to drop you'll almost
certainly need a case to protect this
soft plastic or you can just stock up on
back covers because the stock one is
removable along with the battery kudos
LG the hardware powering the g3 software
experience is not soft it's top of the
line on our 32 gig South Korean version
here that means the software is fluid
even though the phone has to push a lot
of pixels and even though LG still
allows more customization than anyone
else in terms of animations fonts and
effects but thankfully that kind of
tweaking isn't as necessary on the g3
because LG has finally built an
interface that's both attractive and
easy to use you can still wake the phone
up with a double tap on the screen and
knock code is a fun way to provide a
modicum of security the LG health suite
stands ready to help you track your
activity the settings menu is as dense
as it is on other phones but LG has
arranged its tabs intelligently which is
nice and the ability to define your own
home keys down below including a toggle
for the notification shade so you don't
have to reach up to the top of the
screen all the time is just brilliant
you can also install a shortcut to
trigger the split-screen multitasking to
make the most of the big display even
the new color scheme which we thought
dingy and dull at LG's announcement
looks pretty good in person
now all the cruft and chrome that we
complained about last year is still here
it's just been rearranged the
multitasking screen is crowded and
swiping cards off to the side to close
them is not as intuitive custom LG
shortcuts now reside in the Google now
swipe up and while queue memo actually
does come in handy sometimes
we don't see why LG is pushing its own
voice assistant when Google's excellent
voice interface is a
available through the same gesture and
we have the same question about the
smart notice feature which has a lot of
theoretical functionality but in
practice it usually doesn't do much more
than give us a verbose weather report
who which is usually wrong
fortunately for LG the good more than
outweighs the bad here typing on the new
keyboard is a real pleasure
it's resizable intelligent and it's one
of the only stock keyboards we don't
immediately want to replace out of the
box
we've also warmed up to LG's floating
window notifications for SMS sometimes
it's even more convenient than the
notification shade because you can reply
faster with fewer taps this is just a
taste of the smart cool stuff you can
find scattered throughout the UI it's
also gotten much easier to take a photo
on the g3 instead of the big thumbnail
grid of yesteryear the g3 s viewfinder
is Spartan almost bare-bones a lot of
faith is placed in the automatic mode
there is no dedicated night setting or
anything like that really the fancy
stuff is confined to a voice-activated
shutter which is supposed to have a few
trigger words but which we could only
get to respond to one kimchee and a hand
recognizer that snaps a shot when you
make a fist all things being equal we'd
rather have a hardware shutter key you
can long press the volume button to
launch the camera from standby but it's
slow and it doesn't work if you're
listening to audio while you're trying
to take a picture the camera
fortunately doesn't seem to need much
manual optimization at least not in
favourable lighting even shooting in the
default 10 megapixel setting resolution
is sharp enough to give you room to zoom
and the software seems to favor vibrance
and saturation / authenticity now listen
that's not a complaint for one that
added bit of pop makes for a very pretty
photo but also it's quite common many
modern smartphones do exactly the same
thing that added color is particularly
welcomed within LG's HDR mode which does
a good job of bringing out the detail in
the shadows without applying much
artificial halo
or imparting graininess the cameras new
hardware works well
the laser usually does a good job of
quickly setting a focus point and the
hardware stabilization provides a steady
viewfinder image the optical image
stabilization also helps out in video
which we tested in 1080p it's fine in
daylight with great color and smooth
shooting even while walking and even
while walking backwards for that matter
or being jostled around by the wind and
the waves it's in low-light where
performance suffers and you'll notice
this follows through two still shots as
well anywhere there's a bright light in
a low-light scene the g3 tends to
overexpose and also while color is
exaggerated in daylight settings it's
washed out in low-light and of course
there's a lot of digital noise as well
none of this is unique to the g3 but
this average low-light performance is
disappointing considering some of the
great night shooting abilities we've
seen from Sony HTC and Nokia among
others also typical of other smart
phones on the market is the g3 s rear
mounted speaker but LG is quick to point
out its 1 watt power output with a
dedicated amplifier whose added oomph is
welcomed and the phone is just as loud
lying on its back as on its front voice
calls and loudspeaker mode would be
easier with a front firing speaker but
the earpiece is plenty loud for private
calls and reception has been solid on
AT&amp;amp;T in the week that we've tested the
device this being the Korean version not
optimized for American carriers we're
withholding judgment on network
performance and battery life until we
can test a US carrier version none of
that
effects gaming though which the g3
sample Hardware handles with a plum even
if it does heat up a bit more than we're
used to
the g3 is the perfect example of what's
possible with clever iteration it
combines the best elements of each of
its predecessors into one very
compelling device it's not likely to
redefine the way people think about
smart phones and once again we're not
convinced that the sacrifice is made to
accommodate the 2k display will turn out
to be worth it in the long run but the
g3 does serve as a more intriguing
alternative than ever to the same old
contenders if there's something you
think we missed before you leave a

review available June 14th and linked in
