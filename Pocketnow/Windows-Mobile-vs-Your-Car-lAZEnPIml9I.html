we're going to look at Windows Mobile
versus your car so this is a 18 to fuse
and it's in in the car and it is plugged
in with one wire which is an adapter
that connects to the stereo and the
charging so that means just one wire to
plug in when I get in car really great
and we're looking at tomtom right now
which is running on the 18 views it also
comes with another 18 navigation Program
and you have plenty of choices when it
comes to navigation programs that will
tell you where to go which is one things
that's pretty important for a in car
computer to do now seeing that about
Windows Mobile is it also syncs with
your contact list and exchange so it's
very easy to find an address without
having to you you know enter it with a
little scroll ething or whatnot that
some of these other car computers have
so this is really great now some of the
other things that you want to do in the
car is listen to music and maybe make
phone calls that kind of thing now
another thing that the 18th views does
is we have voice recognition built and
we have microsoft voice command comes
with it now if you pair of bluetooth
headset with it you can activate voice
command from the bluetooth headset fine
so let's see how that works in my ear
play kalaeloa
and you can see right away it brings up
that artist playlist so you can easily
play any kind of music that's in your
memory card on your device without
touching anything without taking your
eyes off the road very good stop
now of course you can do other things
with microsoft force and we can make
phone calls at the time you can receive
emails and text messages and it will
read them aloud as well as your
appointment reminders so let's try it
message I'm just going to send one with
another phone right now we'll see what
happens there
what are you left please so there you go
really advanced stuff here I'll show you
what voice command looks like for the
settings so we have plenty of options
here calendar contacts media and
messaging phone Start menus status you
can actually start applications with
voice recognition make any kind of phone
calls messaging is for incoming emails
and text messages it will read out the
subject and mediate is what we just did
for play music so this really makes it
an easy to use in car computers and you
don't have to purchase a huge fancy car
to have a computer just a little cheap
rack and adapter and you have a really
great computer it does many more things
than what you're in car computer would
do this will sync with exchange and it
allows your calendars it will get your
emails really really great little aim
car computer so there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
