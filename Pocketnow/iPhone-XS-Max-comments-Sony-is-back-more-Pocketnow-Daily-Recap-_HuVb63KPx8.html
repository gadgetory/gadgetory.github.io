small um these are actually mediums dude
it's it's not my fault I mean how many
times you have to say your name what do
you mean I'm Jaime Rivera's I'm Hina
River I'm Jaime Rivera I'm Jaime Rivera
I'm Jaime Rivera I think their nose
could send a half of the universe which
he destroyed inside of the pixel 3x
cells not oh man
all right fine that was a good one
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hiding that oh this is PocketNow
your comments one more time the pocket
now daily recap for last week on Monday
the topic was the final name of the next
generation iPhones we heard that it was
iPhone X s I asked you what you thought
about the names we had 705 comments I'm
still waiting for the iPhone 7s and you
will continue waiting because oh my god
out of all iPhones I think that was the
worst one and it had everything to do
with the modems and how bad that battery
performed
it should be called the iPhone XS think
you xl+
oh my god bring back the times of 2013
when you had the galaxy s edge touch 4g
anyways iPhone iPhone pro iPhone plus
okay I think that definitely the rumors
are gonna be pointed more to iPhone in
the case of the most affordable one
iPhone X or iPhone 10 s for the other
one I doubt that the Mac's name is gonna
happen but that's another segment but on
Tuesday the topic was one more time the
iPhone because that's the hottest news
lately as we get closer to the event we
have 355 comments about Apple strategy
and specs and color options I think
people will still buy iPhone no matter
what strategy Apple applies I wish that
weren't true but believe it or not I
know people particularly the person
that's editing this video I know people
that could have a better phone in their
hands and they will still drift to an
iPhone q in the joke making fun of me
back I'm hey Mary that I will look to
address practical problems like better
battery life and a reasonable price tag
instead of hiking prices or features
they think might be new here's the thing
it's not that they think that features
might be new I just have to acknowledge
that Apple is really good about getting
things right I'm not saying they always
get things right but when they do God
like they make a lot of OEMs look bad
and I have to say in this particular
business it doesn't really matter whose
first most cases it matters who does it
better and hey I mean that's the thing
but I do agree with you in the case of
the price tags Apple will continue to do
the same thing year after year people
will still line up year after year it's
insanity I do have to agree with this I
you know there are so many great phones
in 2018 I had a recent comparison
between the note 9 and the iPhone 10
just to show the differences in data
speeds right here in my apartment I have
issues getting Wi-Fi on the iPhone from
the router that's in the living room I
don't have those problems with any
device with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
and so clearly Apple really needs to
step their game up or I should just buy
a better router I think it's the second
one and yes one more time that it is on
Wednesday I
really need to work on these scripts we
had 628 comments about the rumors that
Apple will outsell its record-breaking
iPhone 6 sales and I asked you what you
thought about that Apple don't even know
the market right now with so many
options they won't have record sales oh
man I wish you were right again there
are superior phones out there but for
some reason you know people like iPhones
and you know don't get me wrong I don't
like the iPhones hence photography I
don't like the iPhone 10th design but I
do like iOS a lot I I rely on it heavily
for a lot of what I do the fact that
there are accessories like this that
allow this microphone to sound the way
it does for the price and using the iPad
as it is and this is the reason why
Apple products are so popular it's not
just the fan based thing it's about how
much is built around iPhones from cases
to accessories to apps every iPhone has
the possibility to break sales records
why is this any different the fact that
for the longest time after the iPhone 6
Apple hasn't broken any record so that's
the reason why they're making a big deal
out of it for those of you that don't
remember apples valuation actually even
slumped after that even if they're now
worth a trillion bucks I really don't
think that they will sell more over
three models I do however think that the
larger model will make up for the
majority of their sales you know Apple
doesn't build a phone for every
demographic and this is the most
interesting part this is like saying
that Lexus makes better cars and
therefore people will go crazy and buy
Lexus instead of Toyota when they're
pretty much mostly the same car think
about it is for some reason in the
smartphone business we're not talking
about 30 $40,000 cars we're talking
about a price difference of three to
four hundred dollars between one phone
and the other it's not an arm and leg
for certain markets like the United
States it's very different another
country so at least in the United States
that's the reason why people would
rather you know subsidize the iPhone and
you know still buy it so I think that's
the reason why it's so easy for these
folks to sell then on Thursday we were
very surprised Sony announced their
xperia x z 3 a Tifa we weren't really
expecting any sort of a launch because
they had just launched the XZ 2 I'd
barely just reviewed it they had the XZ
2 premium I asked you what you thought
about the strategy and we had 254
comments
great that we have news about Sony Sony
deserves more attention from youtubers
all right let me tell you a fun story
it's not us that don't want to talk
about Sony the problem is the way
they've handled PR over the last couple
of years where they've been changing
agencies and it's not until now that
their agency is really awesome that we
have great communication with them and
that we're now accessing review devices
free if you didn't know this in the past
we would have to buy the phones to get
the reviews and the problem was that
these weren't really popular phones
sadly for the US market which is our
biggest market and so does it really
make sense to invest in Sony phones to
make reviews if they're not going to get
much attention so it's it's not just us
dude
X III is what the exits who should have
been that apart their design is unique
there's and that's a good thing in my
opinion
all right so yes and no the design looks
like if the Google pixel to excel and
the Xperia z2 had a baby but then they
fix the ergonomics of the buttons and to
be fully honest with you after playing
with it a Tifa I actually like this
phone I really like it I can't wait to
try it out whenever they send us the
review unit because again our
relationship is back to the way it
should have been
finally Sony heard all of our complaints
the Sony Xperia e3 is here specially
with that a notch and a curved screen oh
man all right I think it's only a matter
of time before that continues extending
itself the bezels on that phone are
significant and I don't think that's
better than having a notch honestly how
are larger vessels and a smaller screen
better than a larger screen with a notch
dude and finally on Friday Apple
announced their event for September 12 I
asked you what you thought that the
company was going to bring we had 323
comments
we're expecting everything but the
kitchen sink plot twist Apple announces
the Apple sink like seriously could you
imagine that
an aluminium body and formed sheet of
glass described a singular shape one
made with very few very precisely
engineered parts our obsession remains
to continuously simplify and improve
there's no way appala reveals three
phones a watch Mac's new iPad in one
event along with highlighting iOS 12
you're going to be disappointed if these
are your hopes it wouldn't be the first
time the company does it and I believe
that it's possible though it does make
sense that the company could have an
event later for those of you that don't
remember the September events
historically was their music event and
then eventually in October we had
another event so it could just be that
we only get iPhones in the Apple watch
on this event which has been that and
then eventually we get the rest of the
hardware possible gather round round
Apple watch maybe oh that would be so
cool alright we if you weren't at the
podcast yesterday please do so we talked
significantly about smartwatches
I love the Galaxy watch for its design I
just don't like the software
implementation a lot of things that
we're gonna discuss in our review it's
not bad but it could be so much better
and the problem is Apple has proven that
the benchmark is the Apple watch when it
comes to software services in the way
they interact with the user sadly it's
the worst design ever so if they ever
came out with a wround Apple watch that
was made of better materials because
aluminium and composite glass Apple I'm
sorry it's not better than stainless
steel even if not everything your
stainless steel friends again thank you

comments to be featured keep them short
