Samsung Galaxy s5 active Facebook's new
application update proves to be kind of
creepy and as a relevant this HP has
been they've just launched a $99 tablet
I'm hi Mary meta and I'm sure that all
of us are waiting for that day when
tablets become free right amazon this is
barking out daily there was a time when
HP dominated the mobile space and then
they killed the ipaq lineup and then
they killed Paul the rest is history but
the company has kept trying they've
tried with Android and it hasn't really
been that great but the company has now
launched a new 7 plus tablet the design
is really interesting it looks really
elegant but even cooler is the fact that
the tab will only cost 99 bucks and the
specs aren't that bad so links in
description for details on what you're
getting and speaking of tablets the
product we were waiting for yesterday
that did not get launched with a surface
mini we got the surface pro 3 which
actually was late to the rumors and the
the question is why and rumors habit the
Satya Nadella and the Stephen Elop
decided to ditch the whole concept the
surface mini not because the product
wasn't ready but apparently because it
wasn't able to compete it was diluted in
a whole sea of small windows 8 tablets
so apparently the company is waiting to
see how they can differentiate this
tablet and hopefully we will see in the
future now it's all about the samsung
galaxy s5 active the s4 active was
really cool last year it was a version
of the galaxy s4 that was waterproof
dust resistant and everything and even
though we do get these ratings with the
galaxy s5 right now out of the box
apparently there will be an active sport
version and the design is really
interesting it's kind of a cornered and
different and apparently it'll bring the
same specs as the galaxy s5 so we don't
really know what is the difference here
aside from the design but stay tuned uh
some people might want the sport phone
let's see how Samsung plans to innovate
SP of Samson we have been hearing that
the company is working on new wearables
and new technology that should come soon
and interesting we have a new trademark
for the Samsung gear blank and yeah
blink as an eye as the company is
planning to bring us something that
competes with Google glass
and we've heard about the whole
augmented reality project the samsung
has and how they plan to allow you to
write using your for example your arm
and as a keyboard and stuff and we have
seen Samson working towards this
obviously we didn't know about the
product just yet so hopefully we'll see
something soon and Valley for the very
creepy news of the day Facebook has just
launched an update to its iOS and
Android application that listens to what
you're doing and it listens attentively
not just if you opt in or opt out for
this the company is still grabbing your
data and apparently what it listens to
is what you're watching on TV and what
music you're hearing so if you opt into
the service what it'll allow you to do
is tell people what's your listening
tour watching at the moment and there
are deals with TV stations and Spotify
and everything to grab this information
in 15 seconds but apparently if you opt
out it'll still pull your data because
apparently facebook wants to be the new
rating service or it brings reliable
information of what you're doing as if
everybody was using facebook but at
least we see the question of the day
what do you think about this new
facebook feature where it plans to allow
you to share additional information in
our particular case I hate the way that
Facebook finds ways to sell your data
because apparently the company is
looking for more ways for you to share
stuff which will bring more ads and I do
find the surface creepy but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming she follow us on
