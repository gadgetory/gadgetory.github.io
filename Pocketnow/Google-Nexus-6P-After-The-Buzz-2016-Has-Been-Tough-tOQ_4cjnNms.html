every single time the media goes crazy
over every hot new device and after that
review period wears off so does the buzz
behind that new toy you might still want
to buy but that now faces new
competition in the real world things
shouldn't be that way
for most of us aging is just as
important as the moment you unbox your
product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
extensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's take a second look at Google's top
of the line smartphone and see if it's
still worth buying today I'm high memory
that I with pocket now when this is our
google nexus 6p
after the buzz the Nexus 6p has marked
my return to a pure Android phone ever
since my beloved Galaxy Nexus Google got
kind of lost and it's planned to defy
technology through a pure Android
experience with either phones that were
too cheap or too expensive and large
2015 has been the year of choice for
Nexus devices and before our crazy
review season of this year the Nexus 6p
was my phone of choice I was really glad
to feel right at home with using it on
my recent trip to China
Google's project files not only the
least expensive way to go prepaid in the
United States but also an amazing
roaming tool for just $10 a gigabyte
abroad I actually encountered trouble in
my return flight from Shenzhen and
project flies saved my butt and here's
the thing about Google's approach the
Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x for the first time
in a while this phone has gone beyond
the ideal of pure Google and has focused
on being useful to the user in ways that
go beyond just launching a smart phone
in the looks department the front of the
phone continues to be as average a
smartphone as can be but when seen from
the back I still get asked what phone
this is thanks to its uniqueness that
Hardware hasn't aged perfectly though
this gold variant has fallen off my
hands a couple of times and the chamfer
did not really survive that well respect
heads out there the internals could also
spell dated flagship given how well 2016
has been in this department
about the only thing where the Nexus 6p
beats others is thin the speed of its
fingerprint scanner and how complete
it's always on display is whenever it
decides to work now we have to remember
that a Nexus smartphone is really
designed to showcase Google software and
even here it's aged in a mix way the
scourges 5.7 inch AMOLED panel continues
to compete with others very well and
elements like the front firing speakers
contribute in to making this a very
immersive phone for content consumption
sizes easy to train and genuinely quick
and unlocking your phone even from funky
angles the juice and the power pack is
also proven to be quite enough to have
peace of mind when consuming that
content as well
software elements like Google now on tap
keep getting more useful and reliable as
time goes by and Google's stock
applications have also received major
updates and functionality since we
reviewed it the thing about this phone
is that it's unapologetically large for
day-to-day use we've seen displays this
large with more efficient bezels for
added organ omits I'm sure the added
heft is fine for some of you but as it
stands stock Android is the least
friendly of skins to help you use this
phone with one hand and also the one
that least takes advantage of quad HD
resolution again these are not really
reasons to complain but just keep in
mind that there is a lot of finger
travel involved in using this phone as
your daily driver true a benefit is that
this device is bloat free which should
result in unparalleled performance but
even though games perform great it isn't
the best in day-to-day usage where we
do c-minor stutters here and there in
previous software versions we even had
cases where the device would slow down
to a crawl but software updates have
helped them prove that and that's really
the cool thing about the smartphone
overall we know that if things don't
work well right now Google will update
the software soon and the promise of
Android n is also coming up as well one
department where I continue to be
delighted by the Nexus 6p is with its
camera this is actually the first Nexus
I've ever used it takes photos
comparable to its competition
sure recent comparisons with the galaxy
s7 have proven that photos on the 6p are
somewhat darker and regular lighting
that being said the F 2.0 aperture and
1.5 5 microns on this twelve point three
megapixel shooter do an amazing job at
night there are cases where the 6p
produces better photos than competitors
in that particular scenario though keep
in mind that this camera is much slower
at taking the shot and especially if
you're using HDR plus the 8 megapixel
selfie camera can also delight in most
cases and we love that we don't need to
fumble with switching off beautifying
modes because this is Google there's no
need for that
probably the only case where this
phone's camera doesn't really compare
with others is with video stabilization
because well there is no optical image
stabilization in the sensor and you can
clearly tell it the phone jitters a lot
once you pull the footage into a
computer overall I'd say that this is a
great camera for day to day photos but
only above-average when it comes to
video
in the words above-average are probably
the best segue to end our second look at
this device the Google Nexus 6p may not
be the most advanced Android smartphone
you can buy in 2016 but most of the
things that it does it can do almost as
well as flagships today it's hard to
call this phone future proof in the
hardware department but when it comes to
software even today this continues to be
the best phone for those of you that
want to try android and early or the
next version that comes after that i do
believe that this device could benefit
from a little of a discount from that
$4.99 price tag at 32 gigabytes of
non-expandable storage but it's not like
if you're buying a regular phone either
the Google Nexus 6p continues to be a
unique offering that stands out and
looks and what it can do overall the
only question left is if you're willing
to grab this one now or wait for it
successor later this year folks just
like in the case of the Google Nexus 6p
