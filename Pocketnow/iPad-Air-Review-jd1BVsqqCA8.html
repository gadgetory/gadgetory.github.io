Apple has effectively been the tablet
King last week the latest addition to
its iPad lineup the iPad air was
released I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our full review of
the Apple iPad air next to older
versions of the iPad it isn't difficult
to see where the biggest changes and
improvements are with the new iPad air
well a new design for the full sized
iPad lineup no longer does it have
tapered edges a rear facing speaker or
the connected volume rocker instead it
looks virtually identical to the
scaled-down iPad Mini the edges are
rounded the speakers are located along
the bottom edge on each side of the
Lightning port and the side bezels have
been dramatically trimmed away instead
of the traditional squared nature of the
four three iPads the iPad air is
actually shaped more like a 16:9 Android
tablet further Apple implemented
dramatic weight reduction at 469 grams
it's 28% lighter than the iPad three and
four and at only 7.5 millimeters thick
it's nearly two millimeters thinner as
well
these changes are impossible to overlook
the iPad air is unbelievably lightweight
so much so it almost makes previous
models feel crude and inexact a power
tool instead of a scalpel as minor as
weight and size reduction may seem the
importance of each can not be
understated particularly for a device
built for little more than Portability
and convenience Apple also took the past
year to upgrade the iPads internals and
specs like the iPad 4 the air comes
equipped with one gigabyte of RAM
storage capacities ranging from 16 to
128 gigabytes a 5 megapixel camera and
of course the nine point seven inch
Retina display at 2048 by 1536 pixel
resolution it's incredibly sharp 264
pixels per inch and like the two models
before it the display is absolutely
gorgeous preventing great colors and
saturation viewing angles contrast and
black levels the air also trades up the
a6 X chipset for the newer 64-bit a7 and
it's battery is rated at 32 point 4 watt
hours frankly this is the best iPad
hardware to date build quality design
specifications and
in hand field the level of fit and
finish of this specific tablet is second
to none when it comes to software it's
either love or hate the iPad air
unsurprisingly runs iOS 7 with 64-bit
support and for iOS fans there's little
to complain about all the new features
are present the fresh UI control center
the refined Notification Center Siri
task switcher and airdrop we've
extensively covered iOS 7 already so for
a more detailed look at that check out
our other iOS 7 videos the sheer amount
of quality multimedia and content
available to the iPad air from App Store
and iTunes alone is enough to sell the
tablet the digital libraries are
virtually endless some of the best
applications period are exclusively
available for the iPad and they're
certainly much to be said for that but
in the day and age where Android and
Windows tablets have the ability to run
multiple applications side by side we
can't help but feel the functionality
and utility of the iPad are limited
despite the fresh appearance the
software is still quite long in the
tooth
that said the multi-touch gestures
definitely add some polish to the
experience there's nothing quite like
forefinger swiping between recent apps
and pinching with five fingers to return
home one area we have literally no
complaints however is performance the a7
chip set in the iPad air is an absolute
monster ready to rip and tear through
the most intense tests you can possibly
throw at it we've been using the iPad
air since Friday morning and we have yet
to slow it down even for an instant it
loads and switches between applications
more quickly than previous models it
handles some of the more graphic
intensive games such as asphalt 8 and
Infinity Blade 3 with utter ease put
simply the iPad air was built for
extreme performance and it puts the
numbers up where it counts it provided
one of the quickest scores we've ever
seen from a mobile device in the
SunSpider javascript test Apple claims
the iPad air can survive 10 full hours
of usage on a single charge just as all
iPads before it through our usage we can
confirm the battery life is fantastic as
great if not better than those before it
even through heavy usage including
gaming watching videos and even
benchmarking we were unable to fully
deplete the battery in a single day
you'll probably only need to charge the
iPad every two days or even
often if you're lighter on usage the
speakers on the iPad air aren't the best
we've ever heard but they're definitely
not bad they have a fairly full balanced
sound and are great for practically all
multimedia purposes the main problem is
their location along the bottom edge
they're quite easy to obstruct with your
hand in landscape mode the camera is
something we don't harp on too much when
it comes to tablets but the iPad air is
5 megapixel camera isn't terrible it
doesn't provide a ton of detail but some
images in proper lighting offer balanced
true to life color reproduction decent
contrast and great white balance it has
the tendency to overexpose and miss on
autofocus but it should suffice for many
scenarios for both steals and 1080p
video if we take all of this and add it
up what are we left with well between
the spectacular performance top-notch
build quality and design and the endless
amount of content the iPad air is one of
the most well rounded tablets money can
buy
starting at 499 and scaling up to a
staggering 929 the iPad air isn't
exactly the cheapest option but if
you're in need of an endless supply of
multimedia games apps and one of the
best portable productivity devices the
iPad air is a no brainer frankly it's
one of the best tablets we've ever laid
hands on and that's why we give the iPad
air and nine point two out of ten that's
