I'm a little bit concerned about ice
cream sandwich to be frank we should be
seeing a lot more ice cream sandwich
devices out there than we are and
there's also some other stuff that's
playing into it that's got me well just
a little bit concerned let's go find out
why in this week's edition of the
android guy weekly so let's jump into
some history android was doing pretty
good with smartphones and they came up
from version 1.5 1.6 and we got all the
way up to version two point i was track
but it was gingerbread and gingerbread
was doing good in fact Froyo and
gingerbread were pretty good operating
systems for smartphones where Google got
into some trouble was when they started
doing well they didn't start doing
tablets but other people did and they
were using these smartphone operating
systems that just really couldn't handle
it they weren't designed for it and they
didn't work all that well now since then
time has progressed and there are
actually some pretty decent Android
tablets out there running either Froyo
or gingerbread rather than a tablet
centric operating system now what do I
mean by tablet centric well Google
wanted some time so that they could
recoup they could just kind of go all
the way back to to home base and figure
out how they needed to make this work on
tablets and honeycomb was what they came
up with honeycomb like we'd mentioned in
previous episodes it's kind of the
necessary evil it had to be done to kind
of push the platform forward and there
were a lot of changes an awful lot of
changes some of them not that Pleasant
very similar to windows vista compared
to windows 7 vista had to be done and it
helped usher in windows 7 well the same
thing honeycomb had to be done to usher
in Ice Cream Sandwich how ice cream
sandwich is supposed to be the unifying
operating system that brings together
tablets and phones and theoretically TVs
as well though we haven't seen that yet
Google TV just got updated
with honeycomb rather than ice cream
sandwich just kind of odd and
interesting but it's probably more about
timelines than anything else so why am i
concerned about ice cream sandwich I
love it I've got it on my motorola xoom
it works so much nicer then well honey
comb did on it and let's face it that
was the honeycomb launch device of all
the tablets out there the zoom should be
the one that runs honeycomb the best and
it's not that bad I really can't say
that with a straight face cuz okay it
was bad for a tablet I liked it but
compared to what ice cream sandwiches on
the same device Wow night and day well
I've also got a Galaxy Nexus in the
Galaxy Nexus was the launch device for
ice cream sandwich and it runs it great
it runs it just fine I love it in fact
it's hard for me to go back to say my
galaxy tab 77 that's running honeycomb
just because it's such a step back
running some of the other phones that I
have in my house gingerbread just seems
so old it seems so clergy compared to
ice cream sandwich well and a lot of the
major manufacturers out there said not a
problem we're going to update our most
recent phones to run Ice Cream Sandwich
we've seen some release date sins but
other than a few tablets maybe one or
two smartphones we really haven't seen
much happening as far as updating those
phones to run Ice Cream Sandwich that
may or may not be too concerning I
thought we'd see a more rapid adoption
than what we've seen but what's starting
to concern me is we're seeing brand-new
phones like the motorola droid for that
we just reviewed it's a great phone it's
got to slide out keyboard which well
that's I hold that near and dear to my
heart because I started out with a g1
and I went on to a g2 and I just kind of
like devices that have physical
keyboards even though that Galaxy Nexus
I to just fine with and I kind of like
having the smaller phone but i really
like phones with keyboards on them well
except this is a brand new flagship
device and it doesn't have ice cream
sandwich on it which was released back
in November we're talking what three
months now that's an awful long time and
we still don't have that a lot of the
other devices smartphones especially
aren't coming out with Gingerbread not
ice cream sandwich one of the tablets
the tablets are coming along with ice
cream sandwich not quite as rapidly as I
would have expected there either which
kind of makes me think you know what's
wrong with ice cream sandwich is it
really that much bigger so that much
more difficult to develop for what's
wrong with it is there something wrong
with it that led me to something
relatively concerning Galaxy Nexus again
it's the flagship device you remember
back when we announced the the nexus one
way back when almost immediately after
we released that video on you know the
unboxing of that phone and we were
showing how awesome it was back then we
showed off the accessories the desktop
dock with its pogo pins the car dock
with its pogo pins oh man this was great
it was kind of frustrating because the
accessories took a month or so to come
out after the phone came out but that
was it now we're on another flagship
device of the Galaxy Nexus and where the
accessories well we've got an
announcement or we had an announcement
just recently that hey they're starting
to roll out starting to roll out three
months after the release of the flagship
device whoa what's going on here in fact
I've had on order to car docs from the
first day that they showed up over at
expanses that's been a long time that
I've had that order open and they're
still not here in fact they were
supposed to be released to the most
recent update said februari 15th you
betcha so I showed up you know februari
14th
not a problem the date was still the
same the next day februari 15th I went
and what on earth now they're delayed
till februari 28th why is this well
expanses allegedly will throw that word
around a lot talk to their supplier who
allegedly reported that Samsung is
having a problem with them or more
specifically Samsung's having a problem
with some of the stuff Google did in Ice
Cream Sandwich and the docs aren't
working right does that mean if you're
going to run this doc you've got to have
a software update to your phone maybe
like a four-point-oh point what are we
up to now 5 yeah is something wrong with
ice cream sandwich is that like
developers you know the the big
developers Samsung HTC all those folks
is that why they're not adopting ice
cream sandwich in their new phones I
hope not I really hope not or is it just
because it takes six to eight months to
get a device from specification to
release to qualify it for well the major
carriers for one but also for general
release so they don't tarnish the name
brand of HTC or of Samsung or some of
the others is that it does it really
take that long did it take that long
with Gingerbread and with Froyo or is
this something where it's taking longer
with ice cream sandwich and if it is
taking longer with ice cream sandwich is
the next version going to be faster to
market because they've already overcome
the hurdles that were introduced with
honeycomb and ice cream sandwich I hope
so and then we've got jelly bean jelly
bean which we kind of expected would be
a little bit further out than well june
or july of this year we're going from a
release date sure the release date was
november but now we're fast forwarding
to now and it's just februari granted
near the end and we've got jelly bean
coming out in just a couple more months
okay first of all I hope this jelly bean
announcement in a couple months means
that we're probably maybe going to get a
launch device then and it'll be another
couple months before we see any actual
real devices kind of like last time and
if so that's probably okay or is jelly
bean Google going back to the drawing
board and kind of in panic mode coming
out with a fixed operating system that
has all these problems taken care of and
then we'll be able to see more rapid
development and more rapid releases of
the Android operating system for our
tablets or phones and maybe even our TVs
I don't know but putting all the
pictures together all the pieces
together the picture that I'm seeing is
I think there might be something wrong
with ice cream sandwich that's what it
looks like from my perspective but now
i'm interested in your perspective what
do you think do you think this is
something that's just growing pains
getting from a less mature gingerbread
and into a more mature honeycomb Ice
Cream Sandwich and that's why it's
taking so long or is it really that it
just takes six to eight months to get a
device from spec to market and we're
just right now getting rid of all of the
other you know gingerbread and before
phones that that were already kind of in
the queue waiting for release or is it
something else let us know in the
comments down below share your thoughts
and in the past videos we've done oh my
goodness guys you're just freaking
amazing at all the comments and the
perspectives that you're bringing to
this in fact some of the comments that
you've mentioned before especially in
the honeycomb the necessary evil the
video that we did way back then a lot of
that was kind of formative for this
video and kind of got the juices flowing
so everyone who participated in that
conversation thank you so much it's just
amazing what can happen when a whole
bunch of diverse people like you and I
get together and think freely and put
all of our thoughts into this
and and just come up with ideas and
maybe even some conspiracy theories
they're always fun right that may or may
not turn out to be true in this one I
hope it's not true and I hope it's just
you know Google hurrying and pushing out
a new version of the operating system
and maybe the whole accessory thing for
the Galaxy Nexus was all kind of blown
out of proportion we can hope but keep
the conversation going use the comments
down below and of course big thumbs up
if you liked this video and the topics
that we're talking about four pocket now
pushing the envelope with some of the
stuff that we're thinking about i'm jody
