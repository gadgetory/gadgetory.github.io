series of smartphones nokia's october
twenty second event could bring more
than just one Lumia and Amazon keeps the
faith and they're launching even more
kindle fire tablets I'm Hina primera and
guys just be patient at this rate amazon
tablets are probably going to be free
next year this is out daily
let's just say off with some official
news as amazon has now announced more
kindle fire tablets and these are
actually kind of special because for
example in the case of the HDX tablets
which are two they started two hundred
thirty bucks and they have a snapdragon
800 processor better displays just about
everything of this tablets is better
except for the operating system
obviously but even more compelling is
the fact that we've got a new 7-inch HD
tablet which is like the HD tablets of
last year but it starts at one hundred
and thirty nine dollars that is a kind
of incredible they've got a new
operating system beamed up the fire
three-point o mojito yeah mojito and as
it turns out this makes it special
because they can even fix your tablet
remotely with a new feature called
Mayday among other things you get
multitasking now etc you can pre-order
these tablets today if you're interested
in get them in the next coming months so
links down below for details and if
you're among all nine people that are
interested in getting a smaller version
of the surface too because the bigger
one was probably not good enough for you
well Microsoft has already placed orders
for a 7.5 inch display that keeps the
aspect ratio of the iPad so it could be
that we will be getting a smaller
version of the surface very soon
probably this year I mean Microsoft did
not say that they ended everything with
the service too so let's see what they
call this thing probably surface mini
and let's see if it's better than the
surface to which we honestly doubt sorry
yesterday we talked about how Nokia is
hard at work at easing their October
22nd nokia world event but apparently we
won't be getting just the Lumia 1520
phablet it seems that well trusted
sources predict that the company is
actually building as many as six devices
and notice I didn't say phones i said
devices because apparently they're
bringing out tablets they are apparently
we get more than one tablet
announced at this event and we just kind
of wonder if microsoft plans to compete
against their own surface to and just
kill it so anyways let's see how that
goes october twenty second set your
calendars another company that's hard at
work as school as they're updating
almost every single one of their
applications for android and I mean
gmail for example Google Voice hangouts
and just about every other application
out there at least for Android and
apparently some of the more interesting
updates aside from the aesthetics that
we get on the other apps is the case of
for example hangouts where in the past
you can really see when you were typing
to somebody of that person was online
and now you will so you can now stalk
people if they don't answer you back
immediately but obviously the problem
with these Google applications is that
we never know when we're getting the
update so just stay tuned then hit
refresh on your apps on the Play Store
let's see how that goes and finally for
the interesting news of the day we've
got samsung with three different reports
first of all we thought that they would
pretty much end their new smartphone
flagships by the galaxy note 3 but as it
turns out apparently the company is
working on building their flexible
display smartphone to be launched next
month so stay tuned for press invites
and we'll keep you posted on that but if
you were expecting fingerprint scanning
technology on the next galaxy lineup
well apparently samsung is ditching that
old plan for some reason which we can
understand census apple just figure that
one out it should be that Samsung is
next but well finally because of that it
seems that the galaxy series is growing
up and by that I mean that we currently
have the galaxy s lineup and pally
Samsung is working on a new Galaxy S
series and this f series will bring
metal bodies and better specifications
better cameras then even the galaxy s
lineup which is kind of interesting
apparently these phones will be launched
by may of next year when the galaxy s
lineup is refreshed so anyways that
leads me to the question of the day do
you feel that the galaxy s lineup is
dated I mean do you think that they
should move on to a new letter in my
particular case honestly I feel that
it's not dated I mean galaxy s5 still
sounds good and it took sam took so long
to make one line of popular that I you
know I wouldn't like for them to ditch
the whole project and I don't like the
letter F
I mean hey you got an F that doesn't
sound right but anyways he was a comment
down below what do you feel about these
news friends is always fern earlier

the smartphone and taco machine follow
