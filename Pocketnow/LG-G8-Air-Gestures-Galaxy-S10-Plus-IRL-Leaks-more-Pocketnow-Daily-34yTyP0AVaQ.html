assume for the g8 and it seems there's a
new way to interact with your phone
another galaxy s 10 plus was spotted in
the wild and it's dual front cameras
include a bunny and that show-me
smartphone we saw earlier is real we
just hope we get to see it actually soon
I'm Jaime Rivera and have you joined my
colleagues Sam and assuming that today
is Friday bless your heart
this is parking out daily the official
dish today begin with a very interesting
concept that was recently shown off by a
company called Mizzou I haven't really
covered meizu phones in a while and yet
okay look at this we've got a ceramic
phone with no ports whatsoever that
includes no way to change the SIM card
it actually is waiting for Isom
certification in China to launch
it's got no USB see it's got nothing
wireless charging for everything it
actually looks pretty gorgeous but let
us know in the comments I mean do you
think the world is ready for a phone
with no ports because of course that
includes no headphone jack now let's
talk about Spotify as the company has
just rolled out a new feature where you
can actually mute artists of music you
don't like and well there are tons of
taste for music my taste is rather broad
but there are some specific ones I
really do not want to appear in my feed
even if I'm Latino so I'm actually happy
for that you can learn more in the
description how about if we talk about
Xiaomi recently we saw the company sort
of showing off a foldable product that
made a lot of sense but well now we have
a full video with the company's head
showing off the phone that folds to the
back and then folds to become a full
tablet it looks like a working unit that
doesn't mean we're gonna get it any time
soon but I feel that this is probably
like the smartest concept for a foldable
product where it turns into more like a
tall phone and that extends to a full
tablet let us know in the comments what
you think now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus as it continues
to be leaked obviously these are just
gonna get more intense as we get close
to the event that's happening next month
now we see it that well there's a bunny
design covering something we have no
clue what it's covering but at least
we're able to see that infinity Oh
that's larger because it houses two
cameras sadly we weren't able to see
that LED ring that's apparently coming
in that infinity oh but yeah just to be
where there are more leaks coming and
finally the hottest news today I have to
do with LG believe it or not this is
interesting the company has just sent
out press invitations for what's
happening at MWC in Barcelona no teaser
asked to if this is the g8 or not the
only thing that the company is saying is
goodbye - goodbye - touch in the video
and the question is why what exactly is
the company bringing are we're gonna go
back to the times of the galaxy s4 where
there were these gesture controls that
were total gimmicks that were terrible
or do you think the technology has
evolved over time that's actually the
question today I mean what exactly do
you think it is and do you think it's
gonna be worth it because in my case I'm
like well LG surprised me I mean you
haven't really surprised me in a while
so why not now leave us a comment down
