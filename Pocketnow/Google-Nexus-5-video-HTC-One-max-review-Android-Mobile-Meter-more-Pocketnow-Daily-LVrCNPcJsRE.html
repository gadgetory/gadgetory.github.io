though we really don't know who's at for
some LG flex press render surface and
man this phone is really curved and
could it be that we really are getting
the nexus 5 tomorrow I'm hi mera neta
and if phones keep getting bigger by
this time in two years you'll probably
have to buying a trolley along for it
this is parking out daily plus which day
off with some interesting news as
Microsoft has even brought us more
details of Windows Phone 8 gdr3 as it
turns out we get some car settings for
driving we get the added live tile
settings and layouts for 1080p displays
and we also get the obvious support to
the snapdragon 800 processor finally an
awesome processor being supported from
windows phone out of the box but even
more interesting that if you can't later
you want to try it on your current
device right now there's a link in the
description for a full tutorial from our
own Adam laying on how to get it done
now so I'll link it go to try now let's
talk about some more interesting news
from google as the company's apparently
working on this mobile metering tool
with the idea of giving you points the
more you share with them from your phone
and even though we still don't know
exactly what the incentive is here we
don't know what they're planning to give
you wit just next to wonder I mean
exactly what would you like to share
with Google and exactly what would you
like to get as a prize it was a comment
I would love a free Nexus device
speaking of Google we get the first link
video of Android 4.4 KitKat running on a
nexus 5 even though it says key lime pie
on the settings we know what the name is
gonna be but still we know what features
were getting on KitKat you know there's
no need to mention them again on this
video we've talked about it before but
you know it just looks so aesthetically
like jelly bean that it's hard to
actually tell that it's different except
for the wallpaper actually but anyways
apparently rumors have it that Google is
going to silently launch 4.4 and the
Nexus 5 tomorrow as we talked about in a
couple of videos ago so we're still not
sure we can confirm this but obviously
we will be having an editorial round
table whenever this news becomes
official so stay tuned till tomorrow
even though we really think it's going
to happen by end of month LG is up next
with the rumors is with
the first press renders of the LG flex
and man this is the most flexible thing
I've ever seen up to the point where I
can't really get the point of this
flexible phone but still at least this
is more of a traditional flex foam like
the Nexus 5 or the Galaxy Nexus words
from top to bottom and not from side to
side like the galaxy round and obviously
we are expecting to get this phone by
the end of this month probably early
next month with the same specifications
of the g2 so stay tuned and finally for
the hot yeah all right the interesting
news of the day be HTC One max has just
been announced and yes we've been under
embargo for the last seven days and our
review is already live make sure you
watch it from Michael Fisher but you
know interesting this is a 5.9 inch HTC
One pretty much in everything in the
internals except that it's got the
camera of the one mini meaning this is
really not a better phone like the
galaxy note 3 is compared to the galaxy
s4 this is just the bigger HTC One with
some lukewarm specs of the one mini
which we really cannot understand what
the point of this spoon is it is a good
phone it performs great and all but you
know this is probably the biggest bone
I've ever seen if we move away the ultra
from Sony you know the Xperia ultra but
anyways that leads me to the question of
the day you know watch Michaels video
and tell us would you buy the HTC One
max in my particular case you know I
don't mind putting up with a big phone
as long as I get some added benefits I
hate TouchWiz don't get me wrong I don't
like the Galaxy Note 3 but i love the
multi-window support and i love all the
multitasking features but if the only
thing that the phone does is be big that
there's really no point in having it but
leave us a comment would you buy the one
max friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video gets filled make sure you follow
us on talking out comment subscribe to
youtube channel as well you can also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
