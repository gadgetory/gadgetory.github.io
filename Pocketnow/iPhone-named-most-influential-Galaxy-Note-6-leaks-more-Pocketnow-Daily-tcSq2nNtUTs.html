influential gadget of all time leaguers
continue to provide details on the
samsung galaxy note 6 and some new deals
reach the LG g5 that you might want to
consider I'm hi Mary vera and according
to everybody today is star wars day so
we should all dress accordingly this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with deals as we always try
to provide this time with the LG g5
those of you interested in an unlocked
version that also has a dual SIM module
it's currently for 575 dollars on ebay
from a top ebay seller so hey that's two
hundred dollars off the retail price of
the regular 1i think it's a good deal
and then when it comes to official news
garmin has just decided to join the
SmartWatch game in another way the
company has been doing smartwatches for
a while actually the Phoenix 3 is one of
my favorites it's not Android wear but
it does notifications better than a ton
of smartwatches that I've seen but now
we have a new vivo move and it looks
like a conventional watch only it's
mostly designed to be a fitness tracker
it's got a very good design and it
starts at 195 bucks it's got a year of
battery life so I think that it's far
better than the average fitness tracker
out there it connects the Garmin Connect
so you could use your Garmin for running
and then use the bevo move for
everything else makes a lot of sense now
listen to the new rumors of the galaxy
note 6 somebody in Weibo is just
providing some new probable
specifications that are crazy five point
eight inch display we're talking about a
snapdragon a 236 gigs of ram a possible
option for 256 gigs of storage in
addition to a 4200 milliamp hour battery
and apparently there's also an edge
variant as a partridge in a pear tree
it's crazy if this phone actually does
exist you could sign me up like now now
some interesting developments for Apple
we see that there is a patent being
awarded to Apple for new tips for the
Apple pencil I will be the first to tell
you that even though the Apple pencil is
nice to use the biggest problem about it
is that it doesn't feel like if you're
writing on
anything other than a display pretty
much the problems we had with the early
galaxies notes and hey if they come up
with new tips and they don't charge a
hundred dollars for them they might make
a lot of sense we will see and finally
the very hot news today have to do with
a recent article from Time magazine that
defines the most influential gadgets of
all time and it starts with the iphone
at number one and we have the mac at
number three we have the ipad at 25 I
don't even know why the Apple watch made
the list at 42 probably because it's the
best selling SmartWatch of all time but
after that we have influential products
like the sony walkman for example in
addition to others the list is very
large I'm not going to go crazy telling
you the details lynx-o description for
more but hey it leads me to the question
of today do you believe that the iphone
is the most influential product of all
time because in my case I rather mix I
do believe it is because it changed
applications communications it changed a
lot of things in mobile true but without
the Mac the iphone would have never
existed without the concept of a
graphics user interface it would have
never happened true this is something
that was invented by xerox parc but it
was never sold to the market the Mac was
the first or should I say the Lisa it's
a crazy amount of history here yes I do
agree that the iphone is probably the
most mainstream one but we would love to
know your opinion in the comments down
