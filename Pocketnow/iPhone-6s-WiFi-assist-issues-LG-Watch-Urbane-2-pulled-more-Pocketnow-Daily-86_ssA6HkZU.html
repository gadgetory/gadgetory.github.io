crazy $2,000 phone bill LG abruptly
canceled the watch urbane second edition
for some odd reasons and Apple seems to
already gear up for the next Apple watch
I'm hi I'm Adam Iveta and how often do
you guys cut your hair I do so every
week so you can bet I'm already crazy
right now this is PocketNow daily the
official news today being with Google as
the company has just rolled out a new
update to Google Fitz and it now allows
you to integrate dieting applications in
addition to actually serving as some
sort of a personal trainer by giving you
workouts that you can also follow so
that you can get boost your fitness
activity we will definitely be testing
it out over the next few weeks and tell
you all about it other official news
come from Microsoft as that Lumia 950 is
now official you can pick it up from the
Microsoft Store at AT&amp;amp;T there are 18 X
plans for it it doesn't seem to be a
two-year contract option which is rather
weird but so far so good our coverage
has already begun and Michael actually
made an extensive video of Microsoft
continuum which has proven to be rather
cool you can also learn more about it at
the park our weekly podcast as well
and even though Apple was late to the
game of Wi-Fi assist we've seen on some
Android phones for a while now well the
service is now available but the problem
is when you have families from San
Francisco complaining of a $2,000 phone
bill because their Wi-Fi sucked and the
iPhone just kept guzzling on data and
it's just crazy we're not really sure if
this family is gonna sue Apple or what's
gonna happen here but hey you can
actually just turn that off family and
speaking of Apple those of you in the
market for an Apple watch we think you
should rather wait for the Apple watch -
it wasn't that great in our review so
far even though the product is not
really that bad but the Apple is
apparently already working on the Apple
watch - up to the point where it's
already approached boxed on another
suppliers in order to start building it
not really sure what's gonna change here
but the fact that the company is already
looking for suppliers is important we
should learn more rumors going forward
and finally the very disappointing news
of the day have to do with the LG watch
urbane second edition which the company
has just decided to pull from the market
this is the LTE variant that was going
to be the first Android wear SmartWatch
with LTE but
for some reason just out of the blue LT
says that it's pulling it back through
hardware issues they're not citing which
ones and they are saying that they can't
promise it'll come back at any time
which is rather weird its first time
that LG has ever done something like
this and it just proves that there must
be some really major flaw with this
product
and it doesn't lead me to the question
of the day do you actually care about
smart watches that have LTE capabilities
because in my case I actually don't I
find them to be weird they're cool for
fitness and stuff but not necessarily
for everything because a comment down
below would love to know what you think

you want to get those earlier before
