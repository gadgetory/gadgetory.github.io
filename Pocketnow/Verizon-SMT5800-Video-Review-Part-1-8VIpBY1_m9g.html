pocketnow.com and here is part one of my
video review of verizon's smt 5800
windows mobile 6 standard smartphone
let's take a tour of the device the smt
5800 is based on the HTC s7 30 but was
specifically designed to run on
verizon's cdma ev-do network this is a
windows mobile 6 standard edition so it
means it has no touch screen it has a
numeric keypad here the home screen
button back button make call answer call
button and call you can also use the end
call button to lock the phone and then
we have the two windows mobile soft keys
here as well as the d-pad on the side we
have a power button which brings up a
menu option to either turn the phone off
or change profiles so if i unlock the
phone here you can see the different
options that are available when you
press this button right now i'm on the
normal profile you can also access the
comm manager through here or lock the
phone then we have the slider button and
the slider button manipulates the volume
up or down or when you're on a web page
or an email or a document use you use
that to page down or page up on the top
of the phone we have nothing on this
side of the phone we have the camera
button which activates the 2 megapixel
camera on the bottom of the phone we
have a latch for the battery cover the
mini USB connector and a strap hook the
mini USB connector on this phone is also
used
for headphones and verizon has included
an adapter for headphones you also have
the microphone inlet there on the back
of the phone you've got a speaker for
the speakerphone and listening to music
as well as the 2 megapixel camera this
phone also has a slideout keyboard which
is a full qwerty keyboard and the
spacing on the keyboard is actually
fairly comfortable to be able to thumb
messages at a reasonable pace the one
thing that's missing from this phone
from a hardware standpoint is Wi-Fi but
since I've been using it over the last
few days I haven't had the need to use
Wi-Fi because of verizon's evdo
broadband network which is actually been
quite speedy in terms of browsing and
retrieving emails it is rumored that
this phone is upgradable to a video
revision a which will allow for faster
uploads the screen size on this phone is
2.4 inches it is a qvga screen 240 x 320
pixel and the entire device weighs four
point two ounces and feels quite
comfortable in my hand the smt 5800 has
128 megabytes of ROM in 64 megabytes of
RAM which these days is a little weak
but up to now I haven't had a problem
with that amount of memory it also has a
microSD slot and i'm using a two mega a
2 gigabyte microSD slot and i believe
you can go
up from there at least with four
gigabytes well this about does it for
today's tour of the SMT 5800 and I'll be
back soon with some information on its
Bluetooth connectivity options bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
