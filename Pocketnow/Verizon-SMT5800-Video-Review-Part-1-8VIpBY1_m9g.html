pocketnow.com
and here is part one of my video review
of Verizon's SMT 5800 Windows Mobile 6
standard smartphone let's take a tour of
the device the SMT 5800 is based on the
HTC s7 30 but was specifically designed
to run on Verizon's cdma/evdo network
this is a Windows Mobile 6 standard
edition so it means it has no
touchscreen it has a numeric keypad here
the home screen button back button make
call answer call button and call you can
also use the end call button to lock the
phone and then we have the 2 Windows
Mobile soft keys here as well as the
d-pad on the side we have a power button
which brings up a menu option to either
turn the phone off or change profiles so
if i unlock the phone here you can see
the different options that are available
when you press this button right now I'm
on the normal profile you can also
access the com manager through here or
lock the phone then we have the slider
button and the slider button manipulates
the volume up or down or when you're on
a web page or an email or a document use
you use that to page down or page up on
the top of the phone we have nothing on
this side of the phone we have the
camera button which activates the 2
megapixel camera on the bottom of the
phone we have a latch for the battery
cover the mini USB connector and a strap
hook the mini USB connector on this
phone is also used
for headphones and Verizon has included
an adapter for headphones you also have
the microphone inlet there on the back
of the phone you've got a speaker for
the speakerphone and listening to music
as well as the 2 megapixel camera this
phone also has a slide-out keyboard
which is a full QWERTY keyboard and the
spacing on the keyboard is actually
fairly comfortable to be able to thumb
messages at a reasonable pace the one
thing that's missing from this phone
from a hardware standpoint is Wi-Fi but
since I've been using it over the last
few days I haven't had the need to use
Wi-Fi because of Verizon's EVDO
broadband network which has actually
been quite speedy in terms of browsing
and retrieving emails it is rumored that
this phone is upgradable to a video
revision a which will allow for faster
uploads the screen size on this phone is
2.4 inches it is a QVGA screen 240 by
320 pixel and the entire device weighs
4.2 ounces and feels quite comfortable
in my hand the SMT 5800 has 128
megabytes
of ROM in 64 megabytes of RAM which
these days is a little weak but up to
now I haven't had a problem with that
amount of memory it also has a microSD
slot and I'm using a 2 mega a 2 gigabyte
microSD slot and I believe you can go
up from there at least with four
gigabytes
well this about does it for today's tour
of the SMT 5800 and I'll be back soon
with some information on its Bluetooth
connectivity options bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
