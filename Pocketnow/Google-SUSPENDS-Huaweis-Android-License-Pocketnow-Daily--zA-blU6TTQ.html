with Huawei and we don't know what to
expect for the future some Google pixel
3a owners are having issues and their
phone randomly is shutting down and we
have some leaks of the design
improvements of the Galaxy Note n em
hanging out of it and the easiest way to
know when you're in a UK hotel room is
because you can barely cross to the
other side of the room
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for an old iPhone let's just
say Amazon's whoot currently has the
iPhone 720 eight gigabytes for two
hundred and thirty-eight dollars and if
you remember the retail price was pretty
much like like 750 bucks you can learn
more in the description again these are
refurbished products but it seems quite
good now let's talk about the samsung
galaxy s xi believe it or not we've got
some trusted sources already claiming
that the codename for this phone is a
Picasso and judging by the fact that the
Galaxy Note 10 to 2 stick with the
future and according to the source that
has a lot to do with design we should
expect some changes there obviously
we're kind of early for that we'll keep
you posted and speaking of design
changes what should we expect for the
Galaxy Note 10 according to that same
source we should expect changes in the
camera design we should expect the punch
hole design for the Galaxy Note n s
display but apparently it's gonna be
different to the galaxy s 10 in a way
not exactly sure what to expect there
and then the back camera apparently will
also change the sign and we're not
exactly sure if that's gonna be a
horizontal design since we currently
already have that with the galaxy s 10
whatever the case may be stay tuned as a
22 the source there will be changes that
are significant and for those of you
that are rockin the goal pixel 383 a
excel and you're having issues with your
phone just out of the blue going blank
and not working apparently you're not
alone we're not having issues with our
devices here in the labs but apparently
yeah it seems that when phones are
connected to specific Wi-Fi connections
that could even be the ones in your home
the phone just does not respond and some
users have had to revert to pretty much
Hardware setting the phone again that
hasn't happened to us our experience has
been very positive
but we will be reporting in case we
learn more for more cases and finally
the I don't know most interesting news
today bs we read your comments in the
recap yesterday's sadly the news broke
after we have recorded and I was getting
on a plane yes Google is no longer
conducting business with Huawei
according to a report from Reuters we're
waiting for something more official from
Huawei and from Google S at the time of
this recording but yeah this is getting
weird as think about it surely the
Huawei has access to AOSP it's an open
source platform so surely they do have
access to Android they won't have access
to the store they won't have access to
so many things and we're already
wondering exactly what to expect now
this wouldn't be the first company that
is in a situation like this to a certain
degree view think about it the way that
Amazon handles their Kindle tablets it's
a fork version of Android and they have
their own app store so that could be a
solution not exactly sure what to expect
and specially right now that we're
currently in London for an event that
has to do with honor we'll keep you
posted as to what happens tomorrow at
the event definitely but listen with the
comments down below what do you think
what should you make of this because I
mean obviously I'm concerned for
consumers all the people that we've been
recommending Huawei phones like what can
you expect for the future we don't know
right now
I had a p30 Pro review coming up and I
don't even know if I should complete the
review anymore or not leave us a comment
down below let us know what you think

news earlier follow us I'm out
