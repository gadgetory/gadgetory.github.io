pocketnow.com
we're looking at the samsung kies or
Kies software this installs on your
desktop for Windows and it lets you
connect to your Android Samsung Vibrant
or captivate Galaxy S phones you can see
over here I have mine connected one
thing you have to know is that on your
phone you have to set the USB connection
settings to the samsung kies mode there
also won't work so I have to do that and
you launch this program it should show
up here and you see you have your mouse
over and you get some menus over here
and you can see your external memory so
I click on that it's going to bring up a
file manager and browse through what's
on there
just pretty easy and you can also click
on the phone to get your internal memory
so you can see how much is space is
available over there and when we mouse
over you can see your contacts you can
save them to your PC or set up Outlook
sync same with your calendar outlook
sync save to PC multimedia this will let
you copy everything
music photo video wives off of your
device onto your computer into these
locations I don't want to do that
and down here while we have this a
little help window that comes up at
first down here we have a bunch of other
applications that launch within the
samson software i solicit you check out
this one contents manager you think this
would be like a file manager but it
turns out it's just a music and images
and video manager for your desktop with
just a
Herot is just a export to device button
so I'm not sure how that how much useful
that is
doesn't you can't set up on mag sing
sing or anything like that contacts
this lets us see
which contacts are saved on the phone
these are not the contacts that are
synced with Gmail or Exchange or
Facebook or any of that these are just
the ones that are only on the phone and
we can set up outlook sync there as well
and it freezes often so I think we are
frozen again let me restart the program
okay I've restarted the program and
we're back here next is the calendar
again this is only loading calendar
events on the phone not the ones they're
synched with exchange or whatnot
so you see I don't have anything here
but you can you know set up Outlook sync
and same as everything
message viewer I real like this is a
little widget program that will let you
see your text messages on the phone
it's gonna load it
and you can print them
as well as archived them to your PC
so that's really nice really useful one
of the one of the things that I love uh
from Windows Mobile
it's your ability to
you know archived text messages and use
them elsewhere so it's really great that
that's on the samsung galaxy s phones
next is a memo
this also connects the phone I guess
that lets you see memos
photo viewer
just lets you uh see pictures copying
them to your device nothing exciting
and a video converter
this is really good because it will
convert
video files into a format that is
appropriate for your phone you just
select the options up here and then do
start conversion you still have to copy
the file manually to your phone because
it's gonna be saving it into this folder
a couple other things you got dissed
burnin dis gripping not really related
to the phone but here's a good one
tethering
so that's that's the phone setup the
connection settings
find my country there we go
and then
and that populates all my settings
- okay and you see it there and then I
press this button
do you want to proceed
and it is trying to connect
let's just wait a minute
doing its thing come on
yeah connecting to advice here we go
happening
registering
Internet is connected and if I look
at my network settings
we can see it is connected and it is
identifying let's see if it gets
Internet access
well it worked before
okay
anyway theoretically that is how it was
it would work supposedly but uh
not working here and if I had disconnect
that button
the software might crash
and it appears to be frozen no no okay
and we have error
but everything seems to be okay
let me just show you some settings
if I click it if it opens
here we are nothing special here you can
change colors change background image
choose which widgets to show on the dock
and you can set up your accounts for
YouTube and Flickr so if you drag
pictures or videos to these icons down
here it will upload to those
automatically and there's update so
that's pretty much it pretty buggy
but some very useful features in here so
it might be worth your time to try it
anyway
that's the Samsung Kies software and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
