widget is even better Nokia response to
recent tablet rumors we show you just
how to get wireless charging on your
Galaxy s3 I'm high Nevada with enough
wires to light up my neighbor's house
and this is out daily Google now
is probably one of the most ingenious to
reach smartphone land in the past half
decade and Google has just made it
better in the past you had to access the
menu in order to be able to see your
cards but now you can actually just load
the widget that was recently made
available as of a recent update to
Google search as an application so make
sure that all of you using jellybean
right now get the update and enjoy the
new service and for those of you
cheering over the nokia tablet rumors
that we saw yesterday in their pakistan
presentation well no he just came clear
to state that it's not really something
that's going to happen apparently those
were just markups of new products that
microsoft could probably do in the
future with nokia branding and we do
know that nokia has been working hard on
a tablet but the problem is that it
seems that nokia is still uncertain
about their future with Windows Phone 8
or even windows 8 for the matter is they
apparently have stated to some source
that they will not be building these
unless windows phone 8 takes off
interesting also for those of you
waiting on that 5.5 inch LG optimus g
pro that's been rumored recently well LG
was nice enough to provide some renders
and no that's not a galaxy note 2 that's
actually the device and well they've
also been nice enough to provide some
specs on the device it's really cool hit
the legs of the description for details
and so far well it's just the big knock
off I wonder why and for those of you
big fans of wireless charging out there
well Michael Fisher wasn't planning on
waiting for samsung to bring the
functionality to the galaxy s3 he just
filmed the full video walkthrough on how
to get it done using a palm pixi back
and well links in the description for
full details on the video and make sure
you watch because it's kind of
interesting how you can just get that
done just out of the blue and finally
for the interesting news of the day it
seems to that Motorola X phone that's
been rumored for the last couple of
weeks is more than just a new phone
that's coming we heard that Motorola was
working on compelling hardware but
apparently it does seem that Google is
also working on some compelling software
to this device uniquely and apparently
this will be even better than what we
get a nexus devices and it does makes a
lot of sense because we do know that
Google pretty much owns Motorola anyway
so it's just a matter of time before
they figure out how to make the company
differentiate itself but that easy to
the question of the day do you still
consider Motorola to be a good
smartphone maker in the past that used
to be my favorite smartphone company but
sadly they lost their edge recently so
leave us a comment down below what do
you think about the company and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet rubbishy follow us on Parker now
calm and subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Mary venom thanks for watching see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
