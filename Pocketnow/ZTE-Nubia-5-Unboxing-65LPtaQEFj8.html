T nubia 5 because well it took a long
time to get here and second boxes
usually look like this and that's
extremely boring but when your box looks
like is this you really want to take a
look so I'm ready metadata this is
pocket now and this is our unboxing of
the ZTE nubia 5 there is a marching band
practicing outside my office I apologize
for the noise if you can hear any but
this is the shipping box for the ZTE
nubia and usually this is just a
shipping box it has nothing to do with
the energy but when I opened this at
customs just to check that the phone
arrived ok because I'm obviously not in
the United States I was surprised to see
that this is pretty much part of the
retail packaging I don't think I've ever
seen a shipping box that's prettier than
this and I work for UPS at the past so
this is really interesting for me to see
I mean when was the last time that you
unbox the phone that looked this good
usually companies have lost touch on how
unboxing experiences are so important
for customers and look you open this
flap it says thank you for choosing
Nubia it seems that they don't plan on
having you say ZTE and what we get here
is the headphones which look really
interesting they are in ear headphones
kind of high-end and the design wall
wart USB cable but when you pull the
phone the box of the phone this feels
plastic I'm not really sure if it is
plastic or if it is some sort of like
really tough cardboard but it feels
really high-end guys I don't know how
the unboxings of their high-end phones
are but this phone which is not really
that high end Snapdragon s4 pro
processor nothing really big here looks
really really nice and so here's the
phone this is the Houston Rockets
variant thank you Michael Fisher for
that even though I'm not a fan but hey
that's great and then inside I guess we
get literature here and this is the
phone it is extremely lightweight um
probably lighter than I was expecting
there's not non-removable battery again
the specifications are not great on this
phone but I'm going to be testing this
phone for the next couple of weeks so
far my unboxing experience has been so
positive that I'm really looking forward
to testing this phone out even though it
arrived here late and so let's just try
the
boot here it says novia in a way that I
really cannot read but i guess it was
intuitive in a way and so again i'm
gonna be testing this phone for a week
and then we're gonna give you our sort
of mini review of this phone so far
again my experience has been wow and wow
we get photos apparently this phone has
a really good 13 megapixel camera which
I will be testing and they're touting
that and the initial boot of the phone
we get this little ring here at the
bottom which is really interesting
personality and attitude for life mmm
interesting that's an interesting quote
and so again we're gonna be testing this
phone for now see how it is but so far
again I'm every veteran parga now calm
really impressed by this box HTC and
everybody else please write this down
that's it for boxing of the ZTE nubia 5
