same question does HDR video matter and
well let's compare it I'm primarily
better this is PocketNow
and this is the Xperia Z L versus the
iPhone 5 HDR video on and no HDR video
on the iPhone 5 so it is currently a
bright sunny day in san pedro sula on
dudas i am comparing side by side the
Xperia Z L with the iPhone 5 to show you
just what the difference is between
using HDR video and not using HDR video
so far obviously I can only notice this
from the displays when I pull this to
the video editor is gonna probably be
different on the computer than on the
display but I can tell you off the bat
the Xperia Z L is doing a far better job
at showing the color with this amount of
sunlight in this amount of shadow then
the iPhone 5 can and this tells me that
HDR video does matter
it's doing a better job it's showing the
color reproduction I don't know the the
screen on the iPhone 5 looks just dull
and everything looks vibrant on the
display of the Xperia Z out and bear in
mind the display on the Xperia Z Alice
is not the best one on the planet so let
me try to zoom in to something see which
phone does a better job it's zooming in
it took a little while for the
experience the L the iPhone 5 that it
faster but I don't know about you guys I
noticed that the the experience doing a
far better job it's showing me color
everything looks greener on this display
than on the iPhone
even though I do consider the display on
the iPhone to be superior than the one
on the experience try to walk see how
video stabilization is handled see try
to zoom into this tree the iPhone is
having trouble zooming in the Xperia
already zoomed in interesting touch the
display the good thing about the iPhone
is I can touch the display in zoom which
I cannot do on the Xperia Z yellow
ironically it was one of my complaints
with the experience and it is still
happening with the Xperia Z l I try to
zoom in and out quickly and on the
iPhone all I have to do is touch the
display you'll notice it's quickly zooms
now when it comes to the Xperia
it doesn't but it for some reason it's
not having as much trouble as last year
zooming in with previous camera
technology so again this is a quick
video some fellow sulla on dudas for
those of you that have not met this this
is a park close to my house very
beautiful park and again I feel that HDR
video does matter it's doing a better
job on the Xperia a better job obviously
once I pull this into the video editor
it's gonna be a whole different ballgame
and I will keep you posted so far so
good so thank you very much for watching
hi never be better from Parga now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
