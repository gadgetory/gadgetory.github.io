you know I told you in my last video one
of the things that really like about
Android is the ability to customize that
you can't get much more custom than
getting rid of the ROM the actual
operating system and all the programs
and everything that came with your phone
and replacing it with something
completely custom something built by the
developer community customized tweaked
and deployed so that you can easily put
that onto your phone see
but there's the trick easily for one
person isn't easy for someone else and
I've kind of shown you that with you
know going into ADB and flashing over
roms and using fastboot and blah blah
blah you know it's not easy going into
the recovery console and flashing a ROM
that way a little bit easier but still
kind of complex so what can you guys do
that either don't like get in your hands
that dirty or maybe guys like me who
just like being able to flash stuff all
the time
one after another really fast succession
without having to remember all of these
command prompts and being able to to
plug into a laptop whenever you need to
do it well in that case there's rum
manager there are two versions a free
version and a paid version and if you
like to flash roms this is really really
going to help you let's go take a look
all right so ROM manager let's do some
vocabulary first all right a rom in this
context is basically the collection of
stuff that makes your phone work now
that stuff is your kernel it's the
operating system which is Android itself
its drivers its configuration files and
whatever whatever other apps are
included by the rom developer themselves
most of the time roms come from the
hardware manufacturer in this case HTC
and their customized by t-mobile now
that's usually at least in this case
yours might be Sprint or orange or
Rogers or something else
so all these carriers will tell the
manufacturer hey we want to have this
stuff you know we don't want to have
Wi-Fi tethering we want to have all this
bloatware yadda yadda yadda and all of
that is rolled up into the ROM now most
of you already knew that but for those
of you who didn't now you do there are
some custom roms out there like we've
talked about many times in the past my
favorite is CyanogenMod rom and before
to be able to flash those that's the
process of installing them on your
device basically overwriting what you
currently have then replacing it with
what you want you had to boot up into
recovery mode and then from a recovery
mode you had to go in and flash the the
rom file if you had a custom recovery
like almond Raw's recovery or like
clockwork mod it was very very easy
whereas if you didn't have one of those
and you were just doing one of the stock
ones it was more difficult for reasons
we're not going to go into so what we're
here to talk about today is ROM manager
rom manager is by Koosh and it's
actually the same guy who has written
clockworkmod for us so while we fire
that up what this lets you do is a whole
bunch of things we'll talk about some of
the stuff and we'll just breeze over
some of the other stuff so I'm going to
go through everything kind of really
fast up front and then we'll come back
and do some of the funner things first
and foremost this lets you flash
clockworkmod recovery if you don't
already have it or if you're running
some other recovery rom you can do this
right here even if this is your stock
recovery ROM if you are running on
routed phone you can go through and
flash recovery this recovery image right
here it's a piece of cake it's pretty
much one touch follow the prompts and
you're done you don't have to worry
about naming it putting out on the root
of your SD card doing it through through
fastboot piece of cake this this is
almost too easy
next one down and now you need to get
into recovery so tap that reboot into
recovery mode it'll ask you if you're
sure you want to you go ahead and do it
and what do you know your phone boots up
you're in recovery mode and you can do
all of your recovery tasks and processes
from there so really cool next section
down is ROM management you can install
any ROM from the SD card doesn't matter
what the location is on that SD card you
can pick it from here which is a huge
improvement over the stock recovery ROM
where it has to be at the root of the SD
card and it has to be named update zip
not update zip zip which that just made
it about half of you laugh out there
next one
download ROM we're going to come back to
that check for a rom update and it shows
you that my current ROM is CyanogenMod
6.1 point 0 for the vision which is the
code name for this device I can go in
and check for an update to that and it
will go out and see if there's a newer
version of CyanogenMod and do it
relatively quickly of course it also
does that in the background as well
intermittently so I'll be notified of an
update every couple days if there is an
update it'll check for me so really cool
what if I have a theme for example now a
theme is a customized ROM file it
basically sits on top of your existing
ROM and it replaces key things like
config files prop files icons you know
stuff like that and what you do is you
just flash it like you would a normal
rum it has to be compatible with the ROM
that you already have and you just load
it on top of it well most of those are
distributed you know on the web XDA
developers or the themers website but a
lot of times they have a QR code a
two-dimensional barcode that says hey
you know flash this on your phone well
you fire up rom manager tap that it
opens up barcode scanner you scan that
that barcode essentially and it will
start downloading that really really
fast so you don't have to go hunting
around you don't have to type in the URL
you don't have to navigate to it on your
your mobile browser and then try and get
that URL in here so it makes it very
easy and convenient to do so really cool
next section down is backup and restore
now that's pretty self-explanatory you
can manage and restore your backups and
backup your current ROM which is
something I always recommend you do
before you make a major leap or even a
significant leap in your roms so back it
up the backup files are somewhat big but
you know that nothing to be worried
about and there are definitely good
insurance for you
utilities fixed permissions if you have
flashed something and installed some
some apps and all of a sudden you know
things aren't working right you're
getting forced closes and whatnot it may
be a permissions mismatch tap on that
run it it takes sometimes five ten
minutes depending on how much stuff
you've got on your phone then it's just
going to go through and make sure that
all the permissions are set properly now
of course we're talking you know Unix
Linux type permissions stuff that you'd
go through and do a change mod at a
command level change mods zero six four
four change mod 0 7 5 5 etc etc I don't
know what all those are and I definitely
don't want to go through and make sure
that I've run a change mod on you know
four or five thousand files or even four
five hundred or even 40 or 50 files this
does it all for you
it's relatively fast painless if you're
running into force close problems you
run that reboot your phone your Forks
closes if it was a permissions that you
are going to go away next partition SD
card okay way back in the early days of
CyanogenMod you wanted to partition your
SD card that was a pain in the neck you
wanted to have your basically your data
partition which was still fat32 so it
could be read across desktop computers
everywhere and you wanted to have a swap
partition or optionally have a swap
partition which held your swap file or
held a a swap file because you've
already got some swapping going on on
the device but you also have this ext
partition that you could install apps in
- and now you know that's kind of gone
away with the way Froyo does apps to sd
but it's still kind of there and it's
still very convenient because the ext
partition and the swap partition kind of
speed things up and they kind of free up
your space on your phone which is
another way to speed up your phone so
all in all it's a good a good way to add
a little bit more speed to your device
however you want to make sure you do
this on a brand new SD card not on one
that has all your stuff on it otherwise
you're going to erase everything so if
you want to partition your SD card which
I have and I do on all my SD cards you
want to make sure that you back up
everything from that SD card before you
go through and do this and then it's
just a very fast process because that is
a destructive process I am NOT going to
show you that today but just know that
you can do it if you have questions on
how to do that or want me to run a video
on that go ahead and contact me from the
the post over pocketnow.com that's going
to associate with this video so moving
right along
more Recovery's if you don't like the
the clockworkmod recovery and want to
put almond on there you can do that
right now I don't have that available to
me to install but I've done it many
times in the past and then of course
there's older and experimental versions
of clockwork recovery that I could go
ahead and put on there so let's go back
to the good stuff with me so far
so with ROM manager you're pretty much
going to do two things you're going to
download a rom so we'll do this let's go
into CyanogenMod is that's what I'm
running and this is all personalized
customized for the device it detects
what device you're running and it only
shows you stuff that's relevant to this
device so you're not going to
accidentally install a nexus one image
for example on on your g2 so I can come
in here and at tap on CyanogenMod 6.1
which it says is a stable release and I
have done all of these release
candidates in the past which it says a
release candidate so I can tell very
quickly very easily which one I want to
get to download I simply tap on it and
it downloads now obviously I'm not going
to do that today because that's you know
60 70 megabytes but I am going to show
you the process of flashing it I've
already got it downloaded so from here
let's go ahead and install a rom or you
know what let's go ahead and try that
because it should be already downloaded
and it shouldn't download again so let's
see if that's the case shows me a
screenshot to show me what it's going to
look like which isn't really all that
helpful for for just roms but it is when
you get into themes go ahead and
download that it asks me if I want to
also install Google Apps because we know
that CyanogenMod got a cease and desist
letter from Google saying he can't
distribute them so these are mirrored
from somebody else who shouldn't be
distributing them and you can just pull
them in and install in here so it out
it'll actually flash the CyanogenMod rom
and then it will flash google acts apps
right after that so very nice and I have
options to back up my existing ROM and
wipe data and cache if I'm going from
say CyanogenMod 6.0 to 6.1 I might want
to do the wipe data and cache definitely
if I'm going from a 5 to a 6 or any any
kind of major jump in this case since
I'm just over writing I don't have to do
that and then if I want to back up my
existing ROM I can do that as well as
part of the process I know this process
is going to be ok so I'm not going to do
either one of those we'll just say ok
tells me to press ok to reboot into
clockworkmod recovery and continue the
installation now normally at this point
it would download the rom but like I
said I've already done this you know for
the sake of time so it says all you've
already got these on here you don't have
to download them but normally we would
do that it would take you know half an
hour or however long it takes depending
on your internet speed and all of the
the traffic that's bogging down between
here and there so what's going to happen
now it's booting up into that recovery
mode so I've got my htc screen this
should stay here for about 15-20 seconds
and then there I am right into at the
clockworkmod recovery this by the way is
version 2.5 point 1 point 3 it's waiting
for my SD card to mount and after that
it is going through and installing the
you can see the name of it right there
the really big long name of CyanogenMod
6.1 point 0 that I'm writing now tells
me welcome to it and this is just the
the regular flashing process you can see
my status bar down here
hasn't gotten anywhere this will take
you know as maybe up to five minutes
sometimes a little bit more than that
sometimes a little bit less I'm not
going to make you suffer through that
I'll pick back up here in a few minutes
so you can see the next step in the
process all right now that process just
finished up here and now we're going
through the the google apps hdpi this
one's the 2010 November 11th it goes
through and it flashes those very
quickly and then at that point it
reboots the phone this is a first boot
into that new custom ROM or in this case
flashing the existing custom ROM over
itself so this boot usually takes a
little bit of time while it goes through
and sets everything up just like every
first boot does but you can see just
right there how fast and easy it was to
download well first of all to find a rom
a custom rom to update to download it to
reboot into recovery mode flash it flash
the Google Apps and reboot just right
they're super super fast
very nice if you want to do any any rom
flashing at all this is really the way
to do it now there are two versions of
of the rom manager now they are both
available in the market you go ahead and
go back over there this is the first
boot of course so things take a while as
it's launching the SD card and we'll
just move back over here okay so row
manager two versions there is the
standard version which will let you do
almost everything that you saw me do
there are some things some menu items
that are still in place but aren't
aren't available for you and it'll
prompt you to nag you and say hey this
is only available to premium users if
you want this go ahead and purchase it
which I have done for the purpose of
this video and I'm really glad I did
it's going to run you five six seven
bucks I forget which but it's well worth
it and it does come with ads both
versions of course they're turned off in
the premium version but still there if
you want to support the developer then
then they are turned on and you can't
turn them off in the standard version
but the standard version lets you do
most of the stuff it doesn't let you
automatically check to see if there is
an updated ROM you have to go out and
manually
for it but very very cool very nice
especially if you if you're like me and
you want to keep up to date on the
latest stuff like I said I went through
bacon bits I went through CyanogenMod at
six point oh six point one release
candidate all of them so that was four
four release candidates and then finally
the stable release which would take an
awful lot of time to find download we
didn't rename boot up into recovery and
just tedious this makes it fast easy and
I'm really glad I got it it's something
that's going to live on all of my phones
from here on out I'd recommend that you
do the same if you want to do any kind
of this stuff it is very dangerous if
you don't know what you're doing you
know just especially that partition SD
card you want to kill everything on your
card that's how you do it so kind of
avoid that but really cool kind of high
end but a way to to make really
technical complex stuff easier for just
the normal kind of geeky person which it
probably represents the majority of you
out there in our audience you know
otherwise you wouldn't be here you'd be
at one of those other frou-frou websites
you know Apple or something so really
cool really fun rum manager premium go
out download it from the market if you
