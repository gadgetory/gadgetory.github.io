pocketnow.com michael behind the camera
we are in barcelona 40 2013 mwc samsung
showing off the galaxy note 8.0 we're
taking a look at it right now so what we
want to do is just take you on a quick
comparison between the Galaxy Note 8.0
the iPad Mini which is upside down and
the Nexus 7 from google and we just want
to show you a quick hardware charges we
actually don't have that much time we're
being thrown out samsung has given us
plenty of time so far but you can notice
right away if we're just looking at
hardware the Nexus 7 the ipad mini they
both have this kind of sheer sided
rectangular unapologetically square
approach Samsung has definitely rounded
the corners of it you can see these much
wider radius corners from the galaxy s3
you can see as far as the back goes once
again apple and and sous have done the
kind of matte finish one metal one in
rubber and here we have Samsung's hyper
glaze coating on top of whatever
material they're using on the back of
course we've got the s pen down below as
far as cameras go this is a 5 megapixel
camera on the iPad Mini matched on the
note 80 no camera of course on the nexus
7 front-facing cameras on all of them
you can see they've all got their volume
controls in the same place ir blaster on
the note 80 which is not present on
either of the other units flipping
around to the other side we can see
another significant difference the
Galaxy Note 80 the only one not with a
sim card but with a micro SD card slot
so that is definitely worth noting we
hop around to the front here for the
displays the Nexus 7's display is a 1280
by 800 display at 216 PPI the iPad Mini
is a 1024 x 768 display at seven point
nine inches kicking out 163 PPI and the
new Galaxy Note 80 is a 1280 by 800
display at eight inches kicking out 189
PPI so both the note 8.0 and the ipad
mini feature IPS displays just at
different sizes here difficult to
compare in the kind of lighting
conditions we've got and this is just a
quick comparison but you can see similar
tolerances as far as edge visibility and
of course in size they're in basically
the same neighborhood
and hopping over to the Nexus 7 for a
quick display comparison difficult to do
of course because TouchWiz throws up the
wallpaper behind there so we have
exposure variances here but the
differences in pixel density while they
are definitely notable are not instantly
noticeable when you happen here we're
not looking at these pixels here and
saying well this is crazy jagged we're
going to have a little more detailed
look at that in the future but right now
all three of these panels offer their
ups their downs and we're not seeing
clear winners in any of them and just to
wrap it up on the processor side the
iPad Mini is of course rocking that a 5
processor with one gig of ram the Nexus
7 has the the Tegra 3 and the Galaxy
Note 8.0 the newest of the bunch is
bringing an ex knows quad-core at 1.6
gig ER it's backed up by two gigs of RAM
so once again that is just a quick
comparison between the Nexus 7 the ipad
mini and the Galaxy Note 8 point we're
gonna have a lot more on this device as
Samsung brings it to us Michael Fisher
with pocket now stay tuned for more
