special device yesterday at PocketNow
and in the past 24 hours we've buried
ourselves in all things Yola we've moved
into the device we've snapped some
photos around town and we've even had a
chat with Yola head of software mark
dylan and while our intention of having
a full review ready in just a three day
demo period might have been a little
ambitious we do have some first
impressions to share after our first 24
hours with the device so let's get to
them so that you can get a feel for what
it's like to carry the new Sailfish
flagship I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and these are our first
impressions after a day spent with Yola
yola's whole pitch as a company is that
it's the alternative to the entrenched
brands out there the company's slogan or
one of them is we are unlike and that
translates directly to the hardware here
the division between the front half and
the so-called other half the back side
is stark in color and it's exaggerated
by the deliberately offset curves
reminding us that the whole phone
actually splits in two and can
accommodate specially made modules on
the back side snapping one of those
modules into the front half will prompt
the device to install a special ambiance
mode matching the color of the other
half a very nice touch that reminds us
of what we might see from Motorola's
project ara some day but this of course
is here now Yola got the jump on
everyone now it sounds like EULA is
going to encourage outside development
so private parties can build their own
other half modules on our call mark
Dylan told me one of the company's
software developers whipped up an
extended battery other half in his spare
time not a hardware developer a software
developer did this in his spare time so
hopefully those will prove easy to
manufacture and we'll see them hit the
open market soon yola's going as fast as
they can on that with the standard
configuration shown here the device
feels interesting in the hand the
corners are sharp and the aluminum front
contrasts with the plastic back in
temperature and tactility making the
whole thing well very unlike
the branding is very understated with a
tiny Yolo logo up top and also a very
subtle one on the other half which we
missed in our initial unboxing otherwise
the device is profound in its minimalism
not so minimal yola's operating system
sailfish OS is still technically in beta
and the company is not in any rush to
take that tag off just yet the software
has come a long way since our first
hands-on at MWC 2013 but the central
concept is still the same a vertically
oriented series of screens spanning from
notifications to active apps to the app
library that's pretty easy to get used
to and it results in some pretty cool
shortcuts like pulling down on the
lockscreen to launch the camera or
silence the ringer for instance you can
also trigger some app functions just by
sliding across their cards which is a
clever way of getting functionality out
of those apps without having to open
them but the whole thing is navigated by
gestures and while I'm usually all for
buttonless control these moves are
taking me some time to get used to
there's a tutorial to help out of course
and I've been back to it a few times but
it's gonna take me and I think it would
take most people more than 24 hours to
master sailfish of course that was the
case for webOS and it was the case for
BlackBerry 10 and hey this may look a
lot like the BlackBerry OS but my
initial take is that while it's probably
more powerful selfish is less intuitive
at least to start with mark Dillon made
a pretty good analogy in this respect he
said using Yola instead of another smart
phone is like driving a manual
transmission car instead of an automatic
and that's exactly right you feel much
more involved with the moment-to-moment
operation of Yola but you really do need
to pay attention to what you're doing
for everything to go smoothly we're
going to keep testing our demo unit as
extensively as we can but here in the
states it's hard to get a good idea of
what this phone is really capable of
there's almost no local network support
on our test unit save for voice and the
Yola store isn't exactly bursting with
apps yet while the Yandex store has a
much broader selection of Android apps
which can run on yola's Android runtime
it's not the most stable market out
there the app tends to crash and so do
some of the titles we've downloaded from
it the combination of these factors
makes it pretty hard to use Yola to its
full potential here in America but not
all that is the phone's fault and we've
got a few more angles to check out
before we wrap up the week check back
tomorrow for a voice quality reports
camera samples and some early thoughts
on battery life and thanks for your
patience folks as we try to figure out
in this very very tight review period
whether we will actually be able to
generate an official review or whether
it will be more like an in-depth feature
and less like a reviewable we'll figure
it out we will have more Yola coverage
for you tomorrow and hopefully some more
after that we'll see how long we can
hold on to this demo unit this has been
michael fisher with PocketNow please
drop us a like if you liked the video
and leave us a comment below let us know
what you want us to cover in what might
be our last 24 hours with our review
device thanks for watching in the mean
time and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
