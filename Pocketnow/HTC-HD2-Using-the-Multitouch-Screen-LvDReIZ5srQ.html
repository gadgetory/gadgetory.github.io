pocketnow.com
and in this video we're going to talk
about the multi-touch capability of the
HTC hd2 we're also going to talk about
how the capacitive screen works in
Windows Mobile an operating system that
wasn't designed for use with a
capacitive screen it was made for use
with a stylus so let's go through a few
programs and sort of talk about the
implementation of multi-touch and the
capacitive the screen as mentioned in
previous videos the screen sensitivity
is very high it's definitely higher than
the touch pro2 not as high as the iPhone
which is okay it still is very very
sensitive so let's go into the notes
application the real difference here is
that the screen is made out of glass so
it has a very firm feel to it which is
much better than the squishy kind of
feel that you get on a resistive
touchscreen display so let's go to new
we still have the capability to write on
the screen so I can say hello but
because you're not using a stylus
because capacitive screens don't respond
to us a stylus you can't be very precise
in writing so you don't have the
capability now for handwriting
recognition throughout the entire
operating system HTC has stripped this
out and it makes sense but it's nice
that you can still write on the screen
and the notes application and other
programs if you're doing some artwork or
some drafting or something like that
let's go into another program that you
probably know very well File Explorer ok
and what's interesting is that
everything just works even though it was
made for a resistive screen so if we tap
on this down arrow we can switch between
my device and windows very easily as if
we had our finger was a stylus so it
works very well a few modifications have
been made so the side scroll bar is now
thinner but what's kind of cool and what
HTC has done is if you want to grab the
scroll bar it's kind of difficult
because it's so small but if you take
your thumb and bring it to the side you
get this thumb sized scroll bar that you
can grab on to to go faster down the
page which is great if you have a really
long screen like this instead of having
them you know do 10 flicks you can just
kind of tap and hold on the side grab
the little handle and go all the way
down to the bottom of the screen so this
works in all programs
let's talk about the on-screen keyboard
so we're gonna go into a new email
message okay so here we are in a new
email message and of course we get this
great HTC onscreen keyboard very
familiar it's from all of the other HTC
devices but it feels a lot better
because you have more room to work with
and the sensitivity of the screen is so
great that it's really easy to to type
so of course we can have this landscape
keyboard or actually this is portrait
and we can flip over and we can bring up
this larger landscape keyboard frankly I
prefer the portrait keyboard because
this requires a lot of thumb travel this
will probably good for people with large
hands let me just show you a little test
right now we're on t9 so so still pretty
good and I spelled that wrong but of
course I like this keyboard better this
is a test and of course it takes a
little practice like any on-screen
keyboard but after some practice it
feels quite good by default there's
haptic feedback so you get a little bit
of a buzz of vibration when you use the
keyboard I turn that off to save a
little bit on battery life and I don't
really find it necessary to have that
vibration feedback if we tap and hold on
the keyboard options we don't have that
many choices we have the phone keypad
which is sort of the t9 style which is
back we thought that this may not be
present on HD 2 so we can kind of do
some people are really good at t9 so
this would be good for them we can tap
and hold and go to sort of the compact
QWERTY which is a shirt type keyword
that you would get let's say blackberry
pearl that may also save on finger
travel a little bit but we don't get is
the transcriber which is the option that
lets you write on the screen and have it
recognize your your handwriting because
obviously this device doesn't use a
stylus and you would need one to get
that to work so that the on-screen
keyboard options are fantastic you can
really type fast
I'd say it's as good as the on-screen
keyboard on the iPhone possibly better
because it's larger and people with
larger hands may really appreciate
having that so let's go through some
other programs that you may be familiar
with to see how they interact with the
capacitive display so I'm gonna hit No
and let's go into
four-player which is of course a one of
the best video players for Windows
Mobile plays a variety of formats right
now we are looking at an episode of The
Office but let me just show you what
kind of the the interface is like so I
am going through this interface as if I
had a stylus but I don't need a stylus
cuz the screen knows where I'm tapping
it's very it's very smart and almost all
of the time I don't have to tap twice
when you get to a little small area on
the screen once in a while you have to
tap twice to get it to recognize and
video quality is amazing so this is a
high definition episode of the office
and the whole interface works well now
the pinch to zoom works in a lot of
different applications which is pretty
great so Adobe Reader or Microsoft Excel
or Microsoft Word really the whole
Microsoft Office suite works with
multi-touch I'll show you a few areas
and I'll put a whole list up on
pocketnow.com of where they work so if
we're an Excel spreadsheet and we want
to zoom out a little bit we pinch it
does kind of a weird animation but it's
it's quite helpful to be able to do this
typically if you want to change the view
and zoom out a little bit you've got to
go into view and zoom and and something
like that but now you can just pinch to
zoom it's much more much more easy to
sort of navigate through an Excel
spreadsheet and then if we go into word
mobile you'll see that that will also
work to adjust the text size so go into
this is a test and if I pinch to zoom
the text gets bigger it zooms in it
magnifies really great and we get the
same functionality in Outlook Mobile so
let's get into that okay so here we are
in an email and we can pinch to zoom to
make the text bigger it will reflow this
is really great if you're walking down
the street for example and you want to
have the text bigger so you can kind of
keep the device a few feet away from
your face then when you get back to the
office you want to see more on the
screen at one time you can zoom back out
and have it be
once again so very handy feature and
this works in all the messaging
applications also the pinch-to-zoom will
work in Google Maps mobile so let's go
to that and by the way there's a really
interesting way the Google Maps mobile
interfaces with the digital compass and
we're going to talk about that in a
future video okay so here we are in
Google Maps mobile and we can pinch to
zoom and it's very precise which is
great right now we're over edged so it's
a little bit slow to rerender the screen
but it works a lot better I think then
pressing the plus button on the bottom
of the screen this way you can pinpoint
a specific area on the screen and sort
sort of pinch right in to zoom and to
get there
so that was a look at the capacitive
multi-touch capability of the hd2 if you
have a lot of third-party apps that you
use you can rest assured that the
capacitive screen and almost all cases
works flawlessly as if you are using a
resistive touchscreen the only times
when you have some trouble is when
you're trying to check off very small
items I'll give you an example so let's
go into the set the settings menu we're
going to go into the standard windows
mobile settings and let's go to let's go
to today so for example if you had a
stylus to tap on this button that says
items down here would be very easy you'd
be able to tap it and it's very precise
but because you're using your finger
which is a little bit thicker sometimes
you may have to tap a few times to be a
little bit more careful to get in that
area but it's well optimized beyond that
to let you sort of tap along so a lot
more coming up on the HTC hd2 be sure to
