availability for the Galaxy fold which
just started mass production the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 5g is already out and having
issues in Korea and we just see a new
interesting patent for foldable from LG
and this one is transparent I'm Jaime
Rivera back in New York where the cold
doesn't go but where all the products
get announced this is PocketNow daily
sponsored by brave the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for a pixel 3 or pixel 3 XL
currently amazon has deals on the
refurbish variant meaning if you go for
the refurbished pixel 3 64 gigs
it'll cost you around 450 bucks and then
if you go for the pixel 3 XL it's 520
obviously you know these are refurbished
but still it's a definitely a good deal
now let's talk about YouTube TV I'm
actually a subscriber and I just got an
email that I don't like today I was
paying 35 bucks for the service now
pricing is going to change new
subscribers are going to see a different
price as of next month and my billing is
gonna be updated in June so no more 35
now it's 49 bucks and you get more
channels which I wish I could opt out
from because I really don't care about
them
but you still get the other perks that
you have with YouTube TV in the past so
yeah it's going to get more expensive
sadly now let's talk about LG as well
we've got this new pan that just emerged
it's rather interesting at CES we saw
transparent OLED technology which the
company showcased in some of their TVs
so that's all fine and dandy but now it
seems that there's a patent for this
same transparent OLED technology to make
it 2 foldable smartphones that become
tablets when are we getting this I don't
exactly know but this is actually a
really cool idea if it goes through now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10
5g as of it launched a couple of days
ago in Korea and apparently consumers
already having issues either there is no
5g connectivity or you have to do
certain reboots to the phone for 5g to
connect or if you're already in 5g and
then it drops into 4G it takes forever
for it to do that and then it just
doesn't jump back to 5g or does but
there's a blackout where you just don't
have connected
obviously 5g is a new thing guys so I do
get that there will be some quirks which
I don't know it's the curse of the early
adopter I guess
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy fold and
t-mobile which pretty much just
confirmed that we should expect the fold
to reach the carrier on April 26 we
don't have a price but we do know that
Samsung is going to be selling the
unlocked variant for $2000 and
apparently they will have limited
supplies and there will be limited
stores having this device in today's
question I mean are you going to adopt
the Galaxy fold early for $2,000 if
that's the price or are you going to
wait for the next generation cuz in my
case I'm happy that I'm gonna give it a
try because I have to review it and
that's all great but oh my god I don't
know if I'd pay for it but that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
