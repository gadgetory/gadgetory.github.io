a month away the Sony Honami is rumored
to bring more than just a 20 megapixel
camera and believe it or not google has
blocked the windows phone a youtube app
once again I'm high Meadow iveta and
every time I feel like pulling out my
windows phone from the drawer or
something goes wrong this is parking out
daily let starts today off with the
official news Windows Phone 8 gb r 2 is
an update that a lot of people are
waiting for it brings a lot of added
functionality to the platform and we
know that it's being dubbed the Nokia
amber update that came with the Lumia
925 when it was launched but for the
other rest of you that don't have the
Lumia 925 this update is now available
to almost all of you links in the
description for the full list of phones
that get it and also for the full list
of benefits that you get when you update
to Amber or gdr2 and speaking of Windows
Phone 8 you're not gonna believe this i
mean i was supposed to report today that
microsoft and google had now come to
truths with their YouTube application
and they even posted this lengthy
document stating how well their
partnership worked but guess what well
they published the application and now
it's being blocked again by Google and
now we've got another lengthy document
from Microsoft stating how bad this
relationship is so let's hit the
description for the document and so
sorry and if you're interested in an HTC
One and read in the United States well
you better be on sprint as the carrier
has now confirmed that it will be an
exclusive to the carrier and they're
also going to be selling it in part of
their buy one get one free deal you know
those BOGO deals so that's actually a
good thing if you are on sprint
obviously and speaking of that I mean if
you thought that the Moto X was the only
smartphone app there that you could
customize well actually HTC was planning
on bringing a similar project and they
ditched it for some reason in the past
looks in the description for the full
story on what happened and why HTC
decided the digit now let's talk about
Sony we finally get some leaked
photographs of the Sony Honami and white
even being compared to the iphone 5 and
yes this thing is big but even bigger is
the fact that apparently this phone is
not only bringing a 20 megapixel camera
if you remember the past we were
reporting that this phone was supposed
to be recording video
in 4k and apparently these trusted
sources now confirm that it's coming so
imagine 4k video how big is your as d
car gonna have to be and finally for the
hot news of the day those will be
waiting for iOS 7 while there is this
official source that has this unofficial
timetable stating that it will be
launched in the first couple of weeks of
September which matches the previous
rumors of the next generation iphones
being launched during the first weeks of
September you know it kind of makes that
match but aside from that there is also
this new pen from Apple that is finally
adopting NFC you know that Apple fans a
lot of stuff they don't really do
eventually but stay tuned for that
though that leads me to the question of
the day I mean seriously it's been a
couple of years since NFC is in the
market it's kind of hard to see Apple
doing it now so the question is do you
really use NFC do you see it as a worthy
feature of your phone in my particular
case honestly I'm rarely ever if every
use NFC and I have tech tiles from
Samsung almost everywhere in the house
so leave us a comment down below is NFC
something you'd be looking forward to in
your next smartphone especially your
next iPhone friends as always you know
the drill if you want earlier news of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone a tough world make sure you
