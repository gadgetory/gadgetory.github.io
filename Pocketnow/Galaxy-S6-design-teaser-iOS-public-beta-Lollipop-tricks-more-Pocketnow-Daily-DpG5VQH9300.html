used to build the galaxy s6 ghoul has
also begun to bring some much-needed
voice updates to google now and that was
rumored to start allowing public betas
for Iowa's very soon I'm hymen Ravana
and this video will self-destruct at
about four minutes and by then i'll
probably be at the local bar this is
pocket out daily brought to you by
Squarespace let's begin today with
what's official as google has brought
some much-needed updates to Google now
if you're currently running an Android
5.0 lollipop device and the current
Google Search application it turns out
in the past if you wanted to toggle
Wi-Fi for example you would say enable
Wi-Fi it'll give you a screen but you
still have to press the button to enable
Wi-Fi that feature is now active on
lollipop devices meaning you just say
enable Wi-Fi and it'll actually activate
Wi-Fi NFC bluetooth in addition to even
the flash from your smartphone for
flashlights these things are probably
not going to work for everybody just yet
but so far I've tested it with the LG g3
what I made and so far so good let us
know your experience in the comments
down below another official news that
suck about t-mobile and Sprint
particularly t-mobile the company's a
CEO John ledger just came on record to
state that t-mobile is the third largest
carrier in the United States now these
are not official numbers by somebody
that can prove that but according to
legend ledger yeah ledger according to
him they reached 55 million subscribers
in the United States which is pretty
much would sprint had water ago but
apparently Sprint's number has gone down
you don't have official confirmation
just yet but Michael Fisher's been
testing t-mobile so far and he's really
happy with it it seems that things are
proving to be going in the right
direction how about Apple the company is
not really famous for public betas in
any of its platforms but it did so with
OS 10 Yosemite and reports claim that
Apple is apparently going to try it with
iOS 83 in the past if you wanted a beta
you had to get a developer account $300
or so many other things you can even get
those on ebay paying some money but it
was a really edgy way to do it and
apparently now you'll be able to do so
publicly there's still no confirmation
but iOS 8 top three is just a couple of
weeks away
after a thought to obviously which still
hasn't hired so we'll keep you posted on
how that goes now song about HTC the
company is a rumored to bring as many as
three smartphones at an event by some
HTC One m8 im9 and m 9 + and the company
is now tweeting that there is something
big coming from HTC or should I say
something huge and then there is this
whole math equation at the bottom that
they don't obviously want confirm now
the most interesting part is that an HTC
is advertisement everything says that
the new HTC One is coming it doesn't
mention three phones or a bigger phone
or anything so it begs to wonder what
exactly are we getting on march first we
will keep you posted as we cover it live
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day same things also teasing
what to expect from the galaxy s6 and
according to its new Twitter ad for
today the company is teasing that its
device is going to be made by the
materials that are surrounding it which
is really interesting because it could
be all-natural materials meaning
aluminum glass and stuff like that it
could also be that this will be
samplings first-class darme glass phone
because that's the only way you can
reflect whatever is around you but again
that's just me speculating here it can
be so many things but it does lead me to
the question of the day what is your
favorite smartphone design material
which has always been your favorite in
my case I'll be honest with you my
favorite smartphone design materials
were the stainless steel and glass on
glass design of the iphone 4 iphone for
us but leave us a comment down below
