colors two names one phone
I'm he med leave it up a pocket now with
Jules Wong on camera and this is our
hands-on of the azuz zenfone 5 light
sponsored by invisible shield the
zenfone 5 light which was announced at a
Souza's MWC party will come to the
United States soon as the zenfone 5 Q we
think it's a pretty good idea because
the word light doesn't describe much of
the changes between this device and the
regular zenfone 5 or 10 phone 5z for
example there's actually one more camera
in the five light than on the five the
company decided to give each side's main
camera 6 megapixel wide-angle companion
sensor to grab 120 degrees of landscape
and group selfies or right for it we
fees but at least you do have four other
selfie modes that adjust to when you're
solo shooting 20 megapixel pictures in
front of landscapes and such the camera
is also enhanced with AI scene detection
automatically triggering presence from
up to 16 scenes and changing those
settings over time to suit your tastes
oh and just like every other focus here
it'll also have face unlock to the 5
light that has a 6 inch 2 by 1 LCD at
1080p resolution covering more than 80%
of the fascia the 3300 milliamp hour
battery should last users long enough as
in the u.s. it will also come with a
Snapdragon 630 three gigs of ram 32 gigs
of storage Android oh is on board with
Zen UI 5 it's not at all a stock
experience but there are fewer duplicate
basic apps pretty much only Facebook and
Instagram for third parties expect this
phone to launch around late spring or
early summer until then catch up with
the rest of house and WC reports
on YouTube in on pocketnow.com and while
you're at that award from our sponsor
