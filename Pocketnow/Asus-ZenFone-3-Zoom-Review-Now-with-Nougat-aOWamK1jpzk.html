horse in our phone coverage but this
review was something of a homecoming for
me one of my first reviews for this
channel and our very first real camera
review was on the original zenfone zoom
trading a moving lens for a more current
dual camera setup is this a better
solution to get you closer to your
subject how does the rest of the phone
compared to the competition Asus zenfone
3 zoom here's our full review I always
like to start off with design as we look
at various phones incorporating similar
features a 5.5 inch display dual cameras
are rounded rectangular aesthetic there
are only so many ways we can assemble
these pieces Asus manages to walk a fine
line between derivative design and
maintaining some sense of formers and
phone aesthetics the rear fingerprint
sensor nicely centered the flash and
focus assist organized in a unique way
it's a nicely built device though it
won't win over any bezel heaters for the
capacitive chin controls and border
around the screen our navy black review
unit is an interesting color option
though mostly black hints of blue subtle
company branding it's a nice looking
phone but it's unlikely to turn many
heads the tech inside also might be a
bit controversial in our comments it's
another phone released in 2017 using the
Qualcomm six-to-five chipset released
late last year this might bother some
folks but the updated chip for this tier
was announced back in May and there are
only early rumors pointing to which
phones might start shipping with a
snapdragon 630 the 6:25 still delivers a
terrific balance between horsepower and
fuel efficiency and in daily use it's a
plenty capable chipset for getting your
work done the unlocked USA version comes
with three gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage normal if
uninspired specs for a phone in this
price bracket everything here is good
like the 1080p AMOLED display which has
great contrast nice saturation and
respectable outdoor brightness all
things we've come to expect but nothing
which truly redefines this experience or
this tier of the market that story
continues with software as we get
another iteration of the asus zenui i
skin
happily this is still organized more
like Android than some manufacturers
which try to ape iOS where this is one
of the heavier skins for changing up the
look of a phone it's completely
serviceable I don't hate it I do have to
look for things more often simply for it
being different but everything is pretty
much here one of my nitpicky er gripes
are these kinds of additional
notifications we have a solution for
this in the notification shade so
docking this at the bottom of the screen
is different just for the sake of being
different and it kind of makes the phone
feel naggy we are happy to see some
updates though we're reviewing this
phone now largely because of the update
to nougat which includes enhanced
functionality for the camera that's a
long lead time from the phone's original
announcement back in January but we're
hoping this means a soos will at least
keep up with security patches we've got
a current operating system on a 1080p
display and on a mid-range chipset so
this performs about how we would expect
it to this is another piece of evidence
pointing to how even mid-range hardware
is pretty much good enough users are
unlikely to see significant stumbles and
daily interactions covering the basics
interacting on social media this is a
solid combo as we've showcased on other
phones you're going to be fine until you
start taxing the zenfone with more
graphics intense gaming now moving to
one of the signature features of this
phone dual rear shooters the main camera
pairs Hardware stabilization with a fast
aperture when looking at zoom sensor
phones this is a capable option but one
still facing some teething pains photos
are nicely exposed with even-handed
color saturation though maybe a touch
heavy on the sharpening white balance
err slightly on the cool side but we're
still playing nicely with warm
California afternoon light HDR is just
another brightness mode and even in
daylight it's not difficult to get some
ghosting from minor handshake as the
phone stitches together multiple
exposures low-light shots are tricky to
pin down between various auto and HDR
modes but if you can hold steady for
just a second to let the processing do
its trick you can achieve some
wonderfully clean photos the second
sensor also allows for a software depth
of field blur like the iPhone using the
zoom sensor for the main portrait but I
am happy to see some control
/ this effect dialing in how much blur
you want like a proper camera's aperture
the zenfone produces fairly nice UHD
video in daylight that Hardware
stabilization really comes in handy
smoothing out handshake but the zoom
sensor gets a bit funky the zenfone
won't switch sensors while filming if
you start on the main sensor and zoom
it'll just continue to crop the main
sensor the zoom sensor doesn't have any
stabilization when shooting UHD so maybe
it's better to only use it when you
really need it the overall app layout is
fine if a bit disorganized photography
settings and one menu lumped in with app
control settings a separate menu for
different shooting modes
everything is here it's just really busy
and the user needs to take time to
memorize how to get around if you want
exposure control when shooting video
first open the manual camera mode then
shoot video and then you can adjust the
exposure unfortunately there are still a
ton of gremlins in the software we got
some funky creepy image degradation when
shooting raw like this image see those
lens flares that comes from the tunnel
shot we usually test in low-light the
phone stacked an image shot minutes
before I'm still not entirely sure how
that happened the camera also uses one
of my biggest pet peeves when shooting
video variable frame rate at night we
saw framerate drop to as low as 10
frames per second which produces an
intolerable slideshow even during bright
day shots occasionally the metering
would cause the framerate to drop like
here at 20 frames per second we used to
drop the frame rate so each frame could
be longer and each frame can then soak
up more light there's really no need to
do this anymore the zenfone has a large
sensor with large pixels a large
aperture and Hardware stabilization
instead this makes it really difficult
to predict what the camera might do and
this footage is extremely unreliable
especially if you ever need to combine
clips or edit this is very disappointing
now taking a listen to the audio
playback the mono bottom firing speaker
is perfectly acceptable for daily
interactions nice clarity and just a
touch
wider than say an LG g6
headphone playback is also mid-pack the
zenfone does seem capable of properly
playing 32-bit audio files we're seeing
more distortion at the high end of the
frequency spectrum overall quality
numbers for noise and dynamic range are
in line with other mid-range errs though
still a touch lower than we'd like to
see the amp on board is decently loud
however so driving headphones with some
mp3's should be right in this phone's
wheelhouse and what do you get when you
have a 1080p display with a low powered
chipset and a monster-sized battery epic
grunt are you're looking at the
undisputed champ of our media bench
besting even the iPhone 7 plus in
percentage of battery use this easily
accomplishes multi-day use like other
625 phones we've reviewed we're seeing
two horrific run time in the zenfone
made it through a three-day weekend with
juice to spare recharge numbers don't
look particularly impressive but a
half-hour stint on the included charger
should easily juice you up enough for a
day so let's wrap this up where does
that leave us with the Asus zenfone 3
zoom the major issue faced when
reviewing Asus hardware it's always good
I really don't see any major
deal-breakers here I liked using the
phone the battery life is epic and the
cameras well are an improvement over its
predecessor even for some of the issues
we faced this is all progress after
using the phone for a week though I
still have to confess that I miss some
of the wow factor some difficulty in
really pinning down who I know would be
the right fit for this device there are
a ton of good solutions near this price
point more powerful phones or better
audio or more unique features the
takeaway here I suppose while using the
phone might not be the most exciting
there really aren't many phones
available in North America with this
kind of stamina for the price that's the
Wow not the signature feature alluded to
in the phone's name but battery for days
