google nexus 7 emerge the samsung galaxy
s4 zoom seems closer that you think and
imagine an 8 megapixel front-facing
camera I'm hi Mary Vanna and the only
thing i hate about weekends is the fact
that they're shorter than weekdays and
this is out daily let's look
they off with the odd but cool news of
the day we've got this company called I
mobile and I know you've never heard of
them and this company has just launched
two phones and I know you'll never see
them or buy them but the interesting
point about these phones that are most
likely going to be launched in China is
that you get an 18 megapixel main camera
and an eight megapixel front-facing
camera so it does prove to the point
that this technology is coming soon to
smartphones most probably will be seeing
the good companies that we know about
having this technology next year to stay
tuned and let's continue on with Nokia
the company has silently announced their
Nokia Lumia 928 after so many comparison
ads out there showing just how great
this camera is the phone's going to
retail for a hundred dollars after a
two-year contract and you'll also be
getting 25 bucks as a coupon for the
Windows Phone store for you to buy
something it's honestly a very good deal
it's a good phone on Verizon and yeah
it's got the Xenon flash the great
camera so just stay tuned it's going to
be launching on May sixteenth you can
obviously most likely pre-order at some
point we still don't have a specific
date and speaking of a groundbreaking
camera you know that samsung galaxy s4
zoom you know the version of the galaxy
s4 it's also a good camera which
apparently will be just the new
follow-up to the galaxy camera well the
device is already getting Bluetooth
certified and according to the documents
apparently the device will be launched
or announced this month sorry for it to
be launched in July so we could be
getting this interesting new camera out
there but it's interesting because the
galaxy camera it's not even a year old
yet let's see how that goes now let's
talk about Google for a minutes and
please tell me any of you have ever used
the NFC portion of your phone to make a
payment anybody up nobody actually has
or very few people and well Google was
planning to launch their own credit card
at some point where at least it was
mentioned at Google i/o last year that
never happened but apparently the
but he is ditching the whole clans of
the credit card and now they're going to
bring enhanced services for payments
over NFC that are going to be announced
at Google i/o but then again the biggest
question is who's gonna care if nobody
actually uses the service yet we'll see
and finally for the hot news of the day
we've now got some leaked specifications
of the follow-up to the google nexus 7
which we still don't know if it'll be
called the Nexus 7 hopefully that'll be
the case but apparently it'll be made by
a sous again it'll have an interesting
resolution in 1920 x 1200 which is
better than 1080p I just can't imagine
the form factor for that resolution but
aside from that we're also getting a 5
megapixel back camera that wasn't
available before it'll have wireless
charging which also was an available
before but even better apparently this
will be the first device out there to
rock the Snapdragon 800 processor or at
least the first tablet I just think
about it the Tegra 3 was really the only
bad part of the original Nexus 7 aside
from the display but that leads you to
the question of the day what would be
your wish list what features would you
like to the next Google Nexus 7 to
include in my particular case I'll be
very honest with you i love the tablet i
have it there and i love it but i hate a
display so as long as they give me a
great display meaning good color
reproduction on this thing i don't care
what else they bring but yeah the
Snapdragon 800 would also be a good
given but the Snapdragon 600 would also
be good so leave us a comment down below
what do you want on the next Nexus 7 and
of course for an earlier school of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet road mckee follow
