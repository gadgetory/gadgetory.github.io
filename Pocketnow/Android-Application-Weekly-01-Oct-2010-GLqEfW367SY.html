park now calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started this application is called
craigsnotifica and it is free on the
android market but it is also an adware
program to disable the ads it does cost
nine dollars and ninety-nine cents so
the cool thing about this is it's like a
craigslist notification that sent
directly to your android device so let's
say i was searching for a washing
machine i can click on here and get all
the up to date information of the
washing machines in my area you can also
change the region's and make
customizable searches so that they
update periodically on your android
device cool thing about this is you are
always up to date with your craigslist
this application is called any spot and
it is free on the android market what
are the legend to do is to share your
music from your desktop or Mac directly
onto your android device so the cool
thing on this is you don't have to store
any music on your phone all you have to
do is sync up with your mspot server and
then you can download and play your
music by a stream or you can download
directly to your SD card coconut this is
it orders all your songs by either
playlist album or artist and if I want
to play a song here I like to just click
on here it'll begin playing radar now is
a free application on the android market
and it's a pretty simple program all it
does is show you the radar in your area
so if you want a more advanced weather
program i recommend downloading the
weather channel or something like
weather bug but this program is pretty
simple it shows you the radar in your
area so you can see if there's
precipitation or cloud cover snow or
whatever is in your specific area so the
cool come out this is it shows you your
cell phone proximity as well as your gps
proximity if you have these satellites
turned on this application is called TV
Guide mobile and it is free on the
android market if you're like me you're
quite the channel surfer unfortunately i
miss quite a bit because I'm always
searching in the menus on my cable box
so cool about this program is it gives
you a breakdown of every channel in your
area so it's specific for your area and
gives you the exact listing of channels
by a number and by of course broadcaster
so let's say I want to do look at king 5
news I can just click on here and get
the time slot it says it's from 12 to
1pm this application is called TV calm
and it's a free application on the
android market cool thing about this is
they're partnered with CBS CW show time
cnet and many other sort of channels
some of them are news channels in other
stupid videos comm channel can play full
episodes over a Wi-Fi connection or you
can play bits and pieces of a specific
show so let's say I wanted to watch late
night show with craig ferguson i just
click on here okay so here we are on the
TV program and the quality is pretty
good over a 3g connection this has been
another episode of the android
application weekly in which we review
five applications in 30 seconds each so
