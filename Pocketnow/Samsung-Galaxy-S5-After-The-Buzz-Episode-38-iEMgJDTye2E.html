new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's take a second
look at Samsung's 2014 flagship which is
water-resistant sensor packed and so
glam I'm Taylor Martin with pocket now
this is the Samsung Galaxy s5 and this
is episode 38 of after the buzz
to date we here at PocketNow have given
the Galaxy s5 to full review treatments
one for the AT&amp;amp;T model and another for
the Verizon unit but if you count the
handful of other galaxy s5 models we've
reviewed like the prime active and sport
that number jumps into five her usual
Samsung has deluded its hero brand with
more specific targeted versions of
hardware the question is are these
different models evidence from Samsung
itself that the galaxy s5 isn't the
glamorous high-end smartphone for
everyone and have Samsung's competitors
leapfrog the Android giant four months
later has our opinion changed is the
galaxy s5 still worth buying let's find
out when Michael first reviewed the AT&amp;amp;T
galaxy s5 he noted that yes the hardware
does in fact look and feel a lot like
the galaxy s4 it's larger and heavier
which are both welcome changes but it
feels familiar as he calls it after a
few hours it feels like you've been
using it for months he noted that for
many that will be a good thing and for
those looking to change things up you'd
probably want to look elsewhere in the
four months since its release our view
of the hardware hasn't really changed at
all Samsung did a wonderful job in
cramming a whole lot of screen in a
reasonably sized smartphone it added a
host of new features and specifications
over last year's Galaxy S model and
we're happy it finally updated the
button configuration with a dedicated
tests which are button over the
antiquated Menu key but for those
complaining about Samsung's use of cheap
plastics the s5 will not impress the
design has hardly changed in two years
even if Samsung introduced a faux
perforated texture to the backside and
changed the appearance of the chrome
plastic trim it sharpened up the corners
a bit and made it look a little more
mature than previous models but all
visual changes tend to quickly fade into
the background for those fitness mavens
outdoorsy folk and sensor buffs out
there the s5 has it all it's impossible
to overlook the fact that the s5 comes
with ip67 certification for dust and
water resistance
despite the precision software problems
telling you to ensure the battery door
and power port are securely sealed the
fingerprint scanner as a new layer of
security not many phones have even if
it's frustrating at times and usually
requires two hands or multiple swipes or
both just to get into your phone and the
insides are just as impressive as most
other smartphone
on the market it includes an IR blaster
heart rate sensor Bluetooth 4.0 LTE NFC
and Wi-Fi AC the Snapdragon 801 is still
just as impressive and no displays pop
quite like Samsung Super AMOLED panels
despite the ample add-on storage we
wouldn't mind some more on-board storage
or Ram
but if design and what materials a phone
is made of are near the bottom of your
priorities the Galaxy s5 is still a very
good phone particularly in terms of what
it packs under the hood software on the
galaxy s5 hasn't changed much since our
initial reviews and neither has our
opinion of it the AT&amp;amp;T model we have on
hand is still running the same version
of Android it shipped with Android 4.4.2
beneath Samsung's updated TouchWiz in
touch with this year Samsung introduced
a toned-down UI with soft matte colors
and lots of circles it's noticeably more
minimal less cluttered and less
in-your-face but it still comes with
more than a few heavy contrasts and
accent colors meant to show off the
super saturation of the s5s display we
were having to learn the tabbed settings
application was traded in favor of a
grid or list view though you can still
get the taps back if you missed them
what we really love about TouchWiz are
the value-add Samsung brings such as the
multi window feature that lets you watch
a YouTube video while browsing the web
or toolbox a user customizable floating
bubble that expands showing shortcuts to
some of your favorite apps or tools
however there are far more software
features from Samsung that we never
touch like s-health s-voice Samsung Apps
smart stay smart Paul's Quick Connect
and my magazines a baked in Flipboard
feed TouchWiz has some nice touches and
it's definitely improving but this
particular version feels rushed and
unfinished mostly we feel indifferent
towards the software experience on the
galaxy s5 Samsung's competitors made
large leaps with their custom versions
of Android this year specifically HTC
with since 6 and LG with its new UI on
the g3
performance was always a high point of
the s5 the Snapdragon 801 is no slouch
it posts great numbers in synthetic
benchmarks and slices through heavy
gaming or everyday tasks without a hitch
we're happy to report that it's still
just as snappy and powerful today
battery life on the other hand isn't the
best we've seen on most days it should
manage to last a full day or about four
hours of screen on time that is unless
you're a heavy gamer or like to keep
your brightness turned all the way up
fortunately Samsung includes two levels
of power saving a normal power saver
mode and an ultra power saving mode both
of which will allow you to squeeze more
out of your phone's charge at the
expense of functionality if you're one
to place a lot of calls the Galaxy s5s
call quality should give you some pause
though both michael and i we're told we
sounded muffled when we test a call
quality during our initial reviews
though data speeds and network
performance are far more favorable in
broad daylight the camera is one of the
main draws of this home it's fantastic
color saturation is a little high but
that's par for the course
autofocus locks on quickly and you can
snap photos as fast as you can hit the
on-screen shutter button video quality
in broad daylight is great as well
welcome to tobacco
and the low-light performance is not
very good at all
if you're after a pretty balanced camera
experience the 16 megapixel shooter on
the back of the s5 is definitely one of
your better options so four months later
the Galaxy s5 is still just as great as
it was on the day it launched but it's
definitely lacking the glam and bite
Samsung claimed in Samsung's slowing
growth and falling profits are
indicative of how its cautious updates
are beginning to hurt the company so
would we recommend the s5 today
well not above all else if you won't
perform it's a great camera and an
above-average smartphone the s5 is a
safe bet especially if you spend much of
your time around water but devices like
the One m8 and LG g3 bring much more to
the table in terms of user experience
build quality design and overall value I
