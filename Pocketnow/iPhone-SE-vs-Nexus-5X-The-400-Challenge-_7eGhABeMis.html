versus iOS Google versus Apple with four
hundred dollars to spend and months away
from refreshed devices like a new Nexus
or iPhone 7 if you had to buy a phone
today which would offer the better bang
for buck I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
pocket now and here's our iPhone se vs.
Nexus 5x showdown this was a really
tough comparison to produce these two
devices attack very different areas of
the market and nowhere is this more
evident than looking at the build
quality of both phones the Nexus 5x is a
well-built machine high quality plastics
feel good in the hand but it feels like
a quote less expensive device opposite a
beautifully machined aluminum frame with
glass accents the iPhone scores an easy
victory in terms of aesthetics fit and
finish sides with the iPhone as well
wonderfully machined clicky buttons and
switch feel much nicer and operation
than the mushy plastic buttons on the 5x
looking at organ amah kever delivers a
more nuanced conversation the Nexus is
larger but will always appreciate the
reach ability of a rear-mounted
fingerprint sensor the SE dodges most of
the home button complaints we've had in
the past thanks to its small size but
there's still a bit more of a reach and
unlocking the iPhone we also really
appreciate an always-on sensor for
quickly getting into our phones when
sliding around home screens and menus
the SE is the better one thumb device
but the five X's frame is compact enough
for most folks to go one-handed even
those of us with tiny little Hobbit
hands moving to the technology on board
these two divide up wins in a number of
key areas first of all we get to cheat
one win for the Nexus is this 399 price
moves us up to the 32 gigabyte model
while the iPhone se is stuck at a
depressingly claustrophobic 16 gigabytes
of storage no fun at all for people who
want to carry a lot of music or use
their cameras frequently of both phone
screens or LCDs though to our eyes the
iPhone might be just a touch brighter
outdoor
the iPhone se uses the same retina
resolution as the original iPhone 5 just
under 720p while the Nexus moves
consumers up to a proper 1080p screen
even though the 5x is a larger slab of
glass it still has the higher pixel
density for crisper images and text
while both phone cameras look similar on
paper in actual operation the iPhone
ekes out a subtle lead the SE benefits
from years of refinement and image
processing and is terrifically
consistent in finishing photos with
similar metering on both devices the
Nexus tends to hit exposure a little
brighter than it needs to during
daylight shots while stills are close
video is a solid win for the iPhone
while neither have Hardware
stabilization Apple has developed a
terrific software solution to take some
of the shake out of your videos and if
you're wondering these samples were
created at the same time holding both
phones in the same hand the nexus does a
wonderful job of highlighting every step
you take - that same token headphone
audio is also a win for the iPhone you
get a louder punchy ramp to drive
headphones the SE hardware is
indistinguishable from the more
expensive 6s and 6s plus however we do
like having a front firing speakers on
the 5x for games and videos actual
speaker performance is close but the
Nexus is pointing at speaker in the
right direction in terms of outright
power both phones are snappy and quick
moving through Android and iOS the
iPhone takes the nod for gaming progress
though combining the iPhone 6's chipset
with a lower resolution screen makes
this thing a gaming Beast the Qualcomm
808 and the 5x is just unable to keep up
with more demanding titles like marvel
future fight but what good is powerful
gaming performance a high resolution
screen or killer audio if your battery
can't keep up for having a significantly
larger battery we were disappointed to
see somewhat mediocre battery life on
the 5x when looking at usage benchmarks
our media test streaming 30 minutes of
HD video over Wi-Fi at 50 percent
brightness resulted in 10% drain on the
5x the SE was able to coast through this
same test sipping only 3% in more
anecdotal usage both phones can
to dinner time but we consistently had
more battery to spare on the iPhone and
for the rest these two phones fight for
ties on software both phones come
relatively bloq free funnily the iPhone
might come with more services pre-loaded
which people might not use a both
devices should receive timely updates
directly from the companies which
actually write the code for Android and
iOS and both phones have reversible
connectors lightning and USB C
respectively so let's wrap this up
there's obviously no clear winner here
but this was a fun battle to produce
these two trading blows in ways we
weren't really expecting over any single
Hardware advantage one phone might have
over the other ecosystem is probably the
biggest deciding factor in how you
should spend your money iPhone fan or
Android fan the main victory we should
walk away with is seeing some top-tier
tech features from Google and Apple at
sub flagship pricing so which phone
would get your hard earned cash hit the

get into some fun debates as always
