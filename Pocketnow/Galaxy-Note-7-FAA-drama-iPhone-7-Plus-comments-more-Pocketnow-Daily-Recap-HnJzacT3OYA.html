tech toes I needed to be back to buddy
thanks a lot I'm the first for the first
no I'm the first i'm looking forward to
about 500 apple videos from pocket now
LOL 498 and Counting left that's right
it's that time of the week I am I met
event of this is pocket now and this is
the pocket out daily recap for last week
on Monday the topic was the galaxy note
7 the fact that it was being launched in
China with no battery problems and I
asked you how you felt about that given
the problems of the United States and
Canada we had 701 comments batteries
don't explode in China pocketnow 2016
yeah I'm gonna have to patent that one
probably because if the node 7 exploded
in China they can get away with it but
not us here in the US where laws are
pretty strict for healthy and safety but
you should know better you'd be
surprised at how strict loss can be in
China there must be something different
here Wow Samsung has been on fire lately
I guess you could say they have the
hottest phones around I guess you could
say that on Tuesday the topic was the
LGV 20 our embargo had lifted we had had
some hands-on time with the phone in
Berlin and I asked you what you thought
about it we had 674 comments with a
metal finish and the removable battery
I'd say getting this phone now best of
all though explosions sick burn but yes
I am really happy that LG figured out
how to add metal and a replaceable back
I just wish they would have improved
water resistance but that would have
been probably too much to ask for I'm
happy to see the lgb 20 is getting more
video coverage at the galaxy note 7 the
b20 brings a lot more to the table can't
wait to get my hands on one I'm gonna be
one to debate that I love the b20 but I
also feel the galaxy note 7 is a great
phone so that's gonna be a very
interesting comparison the sign is ok
but the b20 looks a lot better front
panel reminds me of the LG thrill and I
really see a lot of the v20 with tape on
the back not necessarily it's a very
interesting blend of the g5 but yes I
did love the v10s design as well on
Wednesday the topic was apple's event
obviously the iphone 7 and 7 plus were
announced and i asked you what did you
like most we had 612 comments iphone 7
plus jet black
not wait to get mine just to see how
black that jet remains over time it
takes courage to buy Apple products not
sure I'm courageous enough I feel it
doesn't take any courage a lot of people
do but then again I get your point over
the headphone jack I feel that that was
a bad move but hey I was thinking about
the note 7 or the lgb 20 but seeing the
new iphone so weeks we want to buy the
matte black iphone 7 plus which is what
I ordered I cannot wait either let's see
how that goes on Thursday the topic was
again the galaxy note 7 there was an
airline banned in australia with
different measures over what to do with
the galaxy note 7 i asked you what do
you think about these measures we had
637 comments it should be the same rule
for everybody not just note 7 owners
last I checked other phones have
exploded while charging in the past that
is very true I feel that there is a lot
more tape behind these topics mainly
because a lot of it has to do with fake
cables that Chargers the fact that
you're using chargers that are not
certified for the phone i feel that
phone should have a fail-safe where they
simply don't get charged of it's not the
right charger which is something that
HTC did years ago i think it's a much
needed caution some guy charging his
phone in his sleep my burn up the plane
or burn his pants that's gonna be fun
seriously airlines f off where were you
an iphone's caught fire jump on the hate
bandwagon all aboard again it's a very
difficult topic these are not the only
products to do I don't like the fact
that this is happening I hate that it's
happening to the node 7 mainly because
it's one of my favorite phones but I
feel that these measures only allow
these companies to be a little more
cautious and provide new innovations and
technology new ruling I feel that even
though this is a problem it will end up
becoming positive at the end and then
finally Friday back to the node 7 the
FAA had already pronounced that they
were recommending Airlines s galaxy note
7 owners to put it down and we had 1284
comments thanks a lot guys I'm
absolutely waiting for another note 7
i'm not giving this one back unless they
hand me another in its place that is
exactly what i'm doing as well i still
have my notes 7 i'm currently waiting
for a replacement these are troubled
times for samsung and hopefully they
wake up and give us better quality
phones I still hold on to my note 7 it's
powered off in the drawer
though and i highly recommend you do the
same but i do believe that it's sad you
know Samsung is really trying hard this
year they were getting it right it is so
sad that this became such a dramatic
problem I have the note 7 i'm waiting
for a new shipment to reach t-mobile
it's still an amazing phone everything
else works be a downgrade I assume you
mean everything else would be a
downgrade and I do agree with you moving
back to any other smartphone right now
would be difficult and it's the main
reason why I ordered the iphone 7 plus
because I really want to test what Apple
does with a larger phone I feel that
Samsung is the company that has figured
out the fact that you don't just need a
larger phone you can do so much more
with the canvas so again I do feel sad
for what Samsung did this year I do hope
that the company is not affected by this
and obviously does bring better phones
in the future that's it for the pocket
