Danny Webster here from packing.com and
today I'm ashy Wiz Co defragment Mobile
and what this programs can allow you to
do is gonna allow you to defragment your
files and folders on your storage card
or your windows mobile device and that's
gonna optimize folder performance by
restoring the directories under each
folder and if you used a defragment
program on Windows Vista or Windows XP
or any other Windows operating system
you know how essential it is to keep the
performance up so this is going to
dramatically increase performance
especially in applications that use a
large number of files like file
explorers image viewers etc so we'll go
into some of the features right now so
go into the check card what that's gonna
do is gonna check my storage card and as
you can see it says a fat32 and it shows
how large it is and how much of it is
used so if I just go to next and it
gives me a little warning I can click
Next on that it'll just show me that
it's better to have it on AC power and
that there's enough battery left so
we'll just click Next it'll analyze the
system and start checking the card and
as you can see it looks almost exactly
like on your Windows computer it looks
just like the same sort of clusters as
you can see you can see the same
clusters but we're just gonna stop this
right now is I'm going some other
features so for Anna defragment my card
I can do that as well I can also click
don't show this message again because
the same sort of warnings let's click
Next and will show me the same
statistics on the storage card I'll show
that I have 23.4% free on this 7 gig
Arthas 8 gigabyte card so I can also
click Next on this one click Next again
and it'll do the same sort of thing
it'll just fragment this file this
folder card and after it's defragment at
the whole card it'll reinstall the card
back under the device and as you can see
it wants to launch Garwin mobile XD cuz
that's a program that will automatically
launch with the cards we installed so
just click no on that click cancel and
now we can deep-fry it with the RAM and
that's gonna actually increase the
performance of your windows mobile
device quite a bit so I'm just click
don't show this message again click Next
we'll just let it go through here
and it says zero bytes you claim that's
because I've already defragmented it
before when I first did it it showed a
large amount of data that was reclaimed
so I'm just gonna click Next
so if ignore than some of the settings
we can define with the files which
already pre-selected defragment folders
which is like on your storage card or on
your windows mobile device under file
explorer we can sort directory entries
so direct boosts so that will help give
our device much faster and more
efficient file directory will go into
fragment 2 we can flush right back cache
after each step so what that's gonna do
it's gonna clear out the cache so we
want that to be selected so that it'll
run more efficiently and this says skip
error checking now you won't really want
to do that because it says not
recommended but if you know that a file
is corrupt you can it it will come up on
this program and it'll show you that
it's corrupt but we're just gonna hit
deselect that you can enable flash boost
and what this is gonna do is gonna make
your device much faster we'll go over
again click services enable auto defrag
on reboot services so if I restart my
windows mobile device it will
automatically try to defrag the windows
mobile device so this is our advanced
back cache settings we can able fat
cache so right here says cache all fat
sectors and what that's gonna do is give
it much more precise performance because
you want all of your pieces stuck
together you can also read on-demand fat
cache I just selected that one and
enable write back cache and go into
cluster size so this is how many
clusters that will try to cash to your
windows mobile device we're just okay
the only thing about this program that
is in need of a little bit of assistance
is the help folder because when I click
on this it says help file coming soon so
from now to this point on you will
actually have to go online to get some
help for this program but hopefully it's
pretty simple and of course exit so that
is Wisco defragment Mobile and I will
post a link I'm talking either comments
how to get this the program does cost
around fifteen dollars but there is a
free trial for 30 days thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
