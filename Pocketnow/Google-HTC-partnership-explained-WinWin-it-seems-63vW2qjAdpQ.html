with the possibility of Google acquiring
HTC for those of us that have followed
the industry for years HTC is one of the
few pioneers left so it makes sense for
us to worry about seeing it go it turns
out that this is actually a new win-win
partnership between both companies and
before I spend most of the pocket out
daily on just one topic I think this
warrants a separate video I'm highly
metalbend with pocket now and let's
learn more about this new partnership
between Google and HTC in a recent
statement that HTC gave us this morning
the company claimed that HTC has
approximately 4,000 talented engineers
and technical people powering the
innovation behind all of the company's
products and services including our
award-winning branded smartphones like
the HTC u 11 acclaimed vive virtual
reality system and consumer hardware for
partners such as Google under the terms
of the cooperation agreement
approximately half of these engineers
and technical people will join Google
upon closing HTC continues to have a lot
of exciting things in the works
including a cutting-edge 2018 product
portfolio if you think about it this is
definitely a win win scenario on one
hand we've got HTC benefiting from the
fact that it's been struggling
economically for years it's getting 1.1
billion dollars for this deal which will
also allow it to operate leaner with
less employees definitely on the other
hand we've got Google who has been
trying to get it's made by Google brand
off the ground now it'll have technical
expertise from HTC in addition to a
non-exclusive agreement to HTC's IP and
then we also hear that Google will
continue manufacturing phones in Taiwan
and definitely HTC is going to be the
OEM so again I don't see where any
company loses here it's the complete
opposite now obviously there are
concerns and the biggest example is
Google's case with Motorola where we
thought that the whole acquisition of
moto was going to benefit moto it was
going to end up being Motorola building
smart phones for Google and this whole
collaboration and we saw some of it with
the Moto X at the beginning but then we
completely noticed that Google started
worrying about its partners the
companies that are building smart phones
for Android so it ended up being more a
deal of intellectual property and
google has pretty much benefited from
that like crazy but then we see Motorola
completely die out as part of the Lenovo
portfolio I mean you've got the problem
where mergers and acquisitions always
have duplicity and roles and so you get
employees being fired this is not that
this is a completely different scenario
from where we notice we noticed that
this will allow HTC to actually operate
again in a leaner way would this worker
not is the biggest question and it also
leads me to the question of this video
we would love to know your opinion what
do you think do you think that it's a
good idea for this agreement to happen
or do you think that it could have been
done better in my case I do believe that
this was the smartest thing that could
have ever happened to HTC hopefully this
will allow the company to reinvent
itself and continue bringing as great
smartphones I have been a big fan of HTC
for years and I really want the company
to figure this out but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
