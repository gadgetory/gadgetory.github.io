calm and a couple new zune apps just
came out today so we're going to take a
look at some of those over the apps zoo
and HD let's see where are we let's
start with this one labyrinth which i
think is the coolest one and it takes
couple seconds till startup labyrinth is
very similar to the teeter game that you
might might have seen on lolly HTC
devices with an accelerometer but let's
zoom in a little bit more focus okay
this one has much nicer graphics though
here we are loading and the ball just
little marble beams down there and as I
move it the treetops become transparent
so I can see around it and tilt it oh
that's tricky over there I'm gonna go
through all the don't fall in the hole
ah doesn't vibrate but there are pretty
cool sound effects if you have the
headphones on so there we go that's a
nice one and there's lots of levels on
that
great graphics next is going to be
let's see there we are saltaire this is
the very familiar game comes with
everybody's pc i see some nice new
graphics here so you could just touch
that put it over there and well you get
the idea pretty nice
and lastly apps
is this silly little program open it it
is just a stopwatch so go and now it's
cut out when I can start other ones
there's more timers and stop and clear
that's about it so three new zune HD
apps in the zune marketplace right now
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
