smartphone as every device is a
collection of features people need
balanced against compromises a consumer
might be willing to make pros and cons
by this metric we shouldn't ask if a
phone is worth it for the money instead
asking who is this phone for but gadgets
don't live in a vacuum so to help us
answer that question we're not above
pitting two phones against each other in
a back-alley grudge match fight for
blood I'm Juan Carlos back now for
PocketNow and here's our budget Android
showdown between the Huawei honor 5x and
the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 we're still
in the process of reviewing the honor 5x
and the idol 3 was released around 8
months ago but these two budget Buster's
compared really well both are rocking
similar 5.5 inch 1080p screens mid-range
600 series Qualcomm processors 2 gigs of
ram 16 gigs of storage 13 megapixel rear
cameras and similar battery capacities
on paper they're practically cousins but
in real world usage Huawei and Alcatel
have managed to create very different
vibes design aesthetics are entirely
subjective but both companies succeed in
bringing some style to the table Alcatel
x' brushed plastic finish and chrome
trim look sharp angled forehead and chin
sections help frame the front-facing
speakers and details like the centered
headphone jack and micro USB ports are
nicely incorporated Huawei created an
attractive aluminium shell for the honor
5x though I find seams and the headphone
jack aren't quite as nicely lined up
from arm's length
I think Huawei is delivering the flash
earphone up-close the Alcatel is
attention to detail is appreciated but
ultimately I have to give design to the
honor 5x for using the more ambitious
build material Genomics having played
with the idol 3 for months I've never
gotten used to the button layout where
the power is mounted high on the left
hand side and I genuinely prefer the
right side mounted controls on the
Huawei however the fact that the idol 3
is subtly smaller in every dimension
makes it a little easier to hold and use
one-handed so I have to give Alcatel the
nod here
security oh but that fingerprint scanner
so let's just give huawei the win for
unlocking your device super efficiently
the idol is no slouch with tapped awake
and an ice scanning unlock feature but
Huawei nailed the fingerprint scanners
one of the better options at any price
point let alone a budget phone so yeah
we can move on audio and back again to
the idol 3 is Alcatel has found a way to
mount front-facing speakers in a way
maybe more elegant than what even HTC
has achieved
over headphones the battle is much
closer to my ears the honor 5x is louder
and uses a more aggressive playback EQ
the bass might be a bit punchier but
highs are also a tad brittle the Alcatel
might not sound quite as juicy on first
listen but for longer listening sessions
I prefer the idle plus the JBL mode uses
some reverb and stereo widening tricks
which can be fun for movies and video
games performance no surprises here that
the newer chipset on the honor subtly
outperforms the older chipset on the
idle but neither of these phones are
monsters the Huawei handled heavy
multitasking slightly better than the
idle but both struggled with games
pumping out more aggressive graphics
software the great thing about Android
is that you can kind of make it do
anything you want but comparing what you
actually pay for in terms of what the
manufacturer supplies this is an easy
win for the Alcatel the idol 3 lands
much closer to a stock build of Android
where home screens and app drawers are
separate areas for you to organize as
you see fit plus the idle comes with a
nifty gimmick of being usable in either
vertical orientation with a little
screen twist flip Huawei's launcher
combines the app drawer in home screens
which I think is kind of a mess and
moves menus notifications and settings
around in a way which feels very iPhone
inspired for someone shopping an Android
phone advantage Alcatel camera optically
these two are very similar cameras with
very similar performance even down to
the single LED flash in terms of
hardware the Huawei enjoys a slight Ferg
anomic advantage as the placement of the
idle camera makes it easy to
accidentally partially block with a
finger while holding the phone where
they differ significantly as in the
camera app again Huawei is aiming for a
more iPhone like experience where all
katella's provided a pretty feature
complete shooter with full access to
manual controls and settings for people
who want to dig that deep for the
overall camera experience I have to give
the nod to the idol 3 battery the honor
5x has a 3000 milliamp hour battery
where the idle only has a 2910 milliamp
hour battery but that 3% difference in
capacity is difficult to account for
during daily use they both offer up
all-day performance under medium
workloads and neither seem to offer fast
charging capabilities an hour on a
proper tool amp fast charger only
results in about 20
percent for both phones so we'll call
this a tie conclusion two phones enter
one phone leaves but which phone with
some customizing the honor 5x can be a
fantastic smartphone but weighing what
each manufacturer has produced and what
each company decided to showcase I have
to side with the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3
as the nicer overall solution the
out-of-the-box setup is more in keeping
with a traditional Android device and
you'd have all of the same customization
options the huawei would have for
personalizing what is inspiring though
is seeing that these budget mid rangers
are becoming longer term solutions
phones at the sub $200 price point used
to feel like devices you would need to
replace yearly either due to performance
issues or shoddy build quality the idol
3 is eight months old and I think it
still has quite a bit of life left in it
tackling the communication basics ditto
the Huawei where I don't feel conflicted
recommending it as a two year solution
for a cost conscious consumer who
understands what the compromises here
might be but I'm sure you all have
opinions too and we want to hear them
how did you imagine the showdown working
out what criteria are most important to
you and how would you have picked a
winner drop is a comment below so we can
get into some fun debates as always
