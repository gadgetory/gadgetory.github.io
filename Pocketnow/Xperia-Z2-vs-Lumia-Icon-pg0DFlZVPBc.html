these days and Sonia Nokia in particular
have some of the best to offer which has
the better smartphone I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is the Sony
Xperia z2 versus a Nokia Lumia icon
Michael just finished reviewing the
Xperia z2 which at least from the
outside doesn't appear drastically
better than last year's Xperia z1 turns
out he was smitten with the device and
said it's worth every penny
that's a tall claim in a day and age
where some killer Android smartphones
can be had for half the price I also
reviewed the Nokia Lumia icon a few
months ago and made some rather tall
claims for myself I called the icon the
best Windows Phone handset yet Michael
thought I was being dramatic
until he used the phone himself calling
it Verizon's first great Windows Phone 2
phones we really love both of which
offer exceptional camera performance but
which is the better Buy let's find out
in this Xperia z2 versus Lumia icon
comparison before we get started we want
to thank our friends at GSM nation for
supplying us with the Xperia z2 for
review and encourage you to pay a visit
to their site by clicking the link in
the description if you have the urge to
pick up z2 for yourself and we want to
thank Verizon Wireless for letting us at
Lumia icon review as well it's clear
from the moment you first lay eyes on
these devices that both Sony and Nokia
care a great deal about aesthetics the
z2 may not be the prettiest device we've
seen and neither is the Lumia icon but
both are gorgeous devices in their own
right the Xperia z2 is a mash-up of cool
slick glass and metal the icon with a
much more understated design is stark in
appearance and made of a matte finished
plastic the z2 is a flat wafer design on
the icon is contoured on the back and
features that bubble effect on the glass
which makes the front look as if water
is pulled up and ready to spill over the
edge at the very least both companies
paid very close attention to detail will
leave the subjectivity of which device
is prettier up to you that said we're
confident in saying the icon certainly
feels easier and more natural to hold
and use
let's do important to the curved
backside and the smaller physical
footprint of the device at just 137
millimeters tall it's a full nine point
eight millimeter shorter than the z2
it's 2.3 millimeters narrower as well
but one point six millimeters thicker
and four grams heavier worth noting is
all
the z2 s resistance to elements comes
with an IP 58 certification for dust
proofing and water resistance for up to
one meter or a half hour this means
however all the important ports are
covered the icon on the other hand has
no protection against splashes spills or
dust these two foams
oddly enough stack up quite evenly on
paper the Xperia z2 has three gigabytes
of RAM 16 gigabytes of inbuilt storage a
32 million power battery and a 5.2 inch
1080p IPS LCD it's powered by a
Snapdragon 801 chip and it has a twenty
point seven megapixel image sensor fixed
to the back the icon has only two
gigabytes of RAM but doubled fixed
storage a twenty four twenty million
power battery and a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED
display it's powered by an ever so
slightly slower Snapdragon 800 SOC and
has a 20 megapixel optically stabilized
camera both come with similar
connectivity options NFC Bluetooth 4.0
and Wi-Fi AC though the icon has Qi
wireless charging support while the z2
has a typical pogo pins for dock
charging and the icon of course has
support for CDMA alongside its HSDPA and
LTE connectivity the displays on these
two phones are something of a spectacle
both 1080p resolutions and comparable
densities the icons display is notably
more saturated and has much higher
contrast as well as far deeper blacks
thanks to the AMOLED technology but it
can't go without saying how much Sony
has improved the Xperia z2 s display in
comparison to previous Sony devices the
icons display is definitely more vibrant
and crisp but frankly we have very few
complaints about either display unless
you're a pixel junky whose stresses and
loses sleep at night over color accuracy
in contrast you'll feel no different
than us and all the hardware of these
two smartphones is spot-on they're both
incredibly solid and is well built as
you can expect from any phone
manufacturer we prefer the slightly more
manageable size and shape of the Lumia
icon but we could easily be happy with
either phone's hardware inside and out
software and the respective ecosystems
that envelop these devices are where
these two smartphones diverge quite
dramatically the Xperia z2 comes running
the latest version of Android 4.4.2
beneath Sony's heavier custom UI this
time around Sony has packed quite a few
more features for better or for worse
into what used to be a fairly
lightweight custom Android strain over
time sony has been adding more
as other Android OEMs are trying to trim
the fact we're not totally turned off by
Sony software it's still pretty frothy
it just feels like Sony is trying too
hard to differentiate its software in
areas that doesn't exactly need to
focusing on areas other manufacturers
have already explored and backtracked on
the Lumia icon on the other hand runs
Windows Phone 8 which is still the
current version of Windows Phone the
Windows Phone 8.1 release date is set
for July 11th and until then the icon
remains to be plagued by a slightly aged
version of Windows Phone it's not bad
just bland especially after getting a
glimpse of Windows Phone 8.1 Developer
Preview things like Cortana action
center and wallpapers would really add
some much-needed pizzazz to the icon the
biggest difference however is still
application support Android by and large
has a significant lead in application
support and while the so-called app gap
on Windows Phone is narrowing it still
exists no way around it for more
granular information on that respective
software on these devices be sure to
check out our for reviews both written
and video on pocket now with the
Snapdragon 800 and Snapdragon 801 chips
in the icon and z2 respectively both of
these devices are built for speed and
performance they zip through everyday
tasks and heavy gaming switch apps
quickly and rarely ever stutter they're
virtually impossible to bog down what
you can do with that performance however
is a different story the app ecosystem
especially gaming a multimedia somewhat
limit the capabilities of the Windows
Phone experience there are far more
popular gaming titles on Android or
graphically intensive games and a lot
more content to push your phone to the
limit if that's not quite what you're
after then it doesn't matter anyway and
you can rest easy knowing both of these
phones will far exceed your performance
needs for the foreseeable future
speaking of multimedia the loudspeakers
on these two phones offer different
advantages despite having front firing
speakers the audio experience on the
Xperia z2 isn't all that impressive the
speakers produce a clear crisp sound
with little bass response
the volume is considerably lower than
that of the icons which is far louder
but with less definition it's a
trade-off that leaves us feeling
dissatisfied either way
comparing call quality and data speech
is somewhat pointless seeing as the icon
is on Verizon and we've been using the
z2 on AT&amp;amp;T but to hit the high points
the call quality was actually notably
better on the Lumia icon particularly in
the earpiece quality while the c2
sounded muffled into quiet let's put up
impressive data speeds though reaching
well into the double digits for downlink
speeds and posting great uplink speeds
as well battery life is also comparable
despite the 780 million power difference
we started to kill both of these
handsets in a single day of usage we
won't say it's impossible but they're
snapping lots of photos benchmarking
gaming syncing multiple Gmail accounts
and social accounts and browsing the web
both easily mustered a full day plus
abuse but let's be honest what you guys
are really here for is the camera
performance
Michael called the z2 the best Android
camera experience to date despite no oh
is in relatively low contrast and
although the icon isn't quite as capable
as the June 20 it puts out some
compelling images - by default despite
the 20 and 20 point 7 megapixel sensors
the icon is set to take 5 and 16
megapixel images and the z2 is set to
take 8 megapixel photos out of the box
in broad daylight both managed to take
exceptional images though the z2 has the
tendency to overexpose on the superior
auto mode at the same time the SI toos
pictures appeared much warmer and
natural in photos not in direct sunlight
whereas the icon often produced cool
lifeless pictures the next time we'd
take a picture the opposite would be
true and just like daylight photos
low-light shots left us just as torn and
undecided at times the Xperia z2 s
camera would produce more natural colors
and detail and poorly lit scenes even
with no OS other times the icons optical
image stabilization would come to save
the day and help capture significantly
more detail with little light all of
these samples of course were shot using
the out-of-the-box settings and auto
mode fortunately for those who want to
get their hands dirty in the more
intricate photography settings both
camera apps come with manual modes and
all we'd be grasping at straws if we
picked a clear winner and image sensing
who put it this way both are going to
deliver better than
which camera experience but if we had to
choose we depict the icons 20 megapixel
camera mainly due to the Nokia camera
app and oh is we're in a great place
we live in a world where we have to dig
deep to nitpick and choose a winner in a
device comparison and surprisingly this
is one of the most balanced comparisons
we've done of late to phones with
gorgeous displays beautiful industrial
designs above average battery life great
camera performance and tons of
horsepower they both have the tiny
things we love like physical shutter
buttons and the icon has wireless
charging and the z2 is water-resistant
the flaws of these two are few and far
between and that makes it particularly
difficult to choose a winner but we did
anyway until the Windows Phone 8.1
update hits the icon feels a little
sterile for our tastes and Windows Phone
itself is still working through some
growing pains and that's literally the
only reason we'd recommend the z2 over
the icon unless you're looking to save a
buck you can pick up the lumia icon from
Verizon Wireless
for 549 sans contract about two hundred
dollars cheaper than you can currently
get a z2 in the US other than that we'd
be hard-pressed to choose one of these
phones over the other oh thanks for
