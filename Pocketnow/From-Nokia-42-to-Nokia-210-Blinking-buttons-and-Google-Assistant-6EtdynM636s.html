bringing awesome hardware the best of
Google and aggressive price points for
all markets and I'm WC 2019 is no
exception I mean the company is even
telling they've been crowned number one
at feature phones around the world
reporting from New York City and
Barcelona I'm hi- a tower with Jules
Wang editing and let's go hands-on
at the most affordable tier Nokia is
back with another feature phone now
dubbed the Nokia 210 the idea here is to
make the internet more accessible with
the Opera Mini browser and Nokia
surprise every software Java apps are
supported allowing you to download music
and turn Gameloft games it has a
polycarbonate body in different colors
and includes a 2.4 inch QVGA display and
the your VGA camera dual SIM and the
removable 1020 milliamp hour battery
that Nokia claims can go for a full
month as for smartphones the company
showed us their new Nokia 1 plus which
plans to ease the transition for users
between feature phones and smartphones
it has a full removable back that
reminds us of the old HTC type or the
whole external body as a cover and it
comes in this interesting 3d nano
pattern technology and different colors
for a more sophisticated look brings a
5.4 5 inch IPS LCD at WVGA plus
immediate sec processor 1 via bytes of
ram 8 or 16 gigs of storage an 8
megapixel camera with a 5 megapixel
front facing shooter and a 2500 milliamp
hour battery the major story here is
that it runs Android Pi go Edition with
applications being smaller and more
efficient and it starts at just 89 euros
in red blue or black the next two
offerings focus a lot on the Google
assistant as by 2020 comscore believes
that 50% of searches will be voice
enabled as such both devices have a
dedicated Google assistant button and
even include an AI face on lock that
helps you unlock the phone with a voice
command once the device detects that
you're holding it the Nokia 3.2 has a
high-gloss polycarbonate body with a 6.2
6-inch display at HD plus resolution and
the knotch there's a snapdragon 429
processor 2 or 3 gigs of ram 16 or 32
gigs of storage a 13 megapixel camera at
the back and a 5 megapixel front facing
shooter Android 9 PI 1 Edition is here
with zero bloat it's got cool accents
like a notification light integrated
into the power button and will retail
for just 129 euros
last we have the Nokia 4.2 which they
call their new all affordable flagship
experience this has a polycarbonate
frame with diecast metal inside for
added rigidity that also includes a
fingerprint scanner in the back and a
notification accent in the power button
it's got a 5.7 1 and HD + display at
Wacom Snapdragon 439 2 or 3 gigs of ram
16 or 32 gigs of storage in the 3000
milliamp hour battery it has a 13
megapixel main camera with a 2 megapixel
depth sensor in the back and color
options range from pink sand and black
with a retail value of just 169 euros
this phone in particular is actually
more of the looker for me so yes this is
