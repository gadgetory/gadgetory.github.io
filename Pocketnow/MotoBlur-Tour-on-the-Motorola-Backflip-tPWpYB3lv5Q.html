pocket now calm and this is a look at
moto blur on the AT&amp;amp;T motorola backflip
this is 18 T's first Android device
motoblur is Motorola's proprietary
interface that sits on top of Android
1.5 they can also put it on other
versions of Android kind of like how HTC
s HTC sense that sits on top of Android
to kind of change the experience to
allow them to differentiate their
product from the other OEMs out there so
we're to talk about what this motoblur
interface brings why it's different and
also talk about the homescreen
configurations on the motorola backflip
so we're to start off by turning on the
device and unlocking it and i'm going to
zoom in on the screen a little bit so
you get a better view okay so the first
thing that you'll notice right out of
the box on the motorola backflip is that
it will ask you to sign up with certain
social networks and it can you can hook
up to a lot of social networks i'll show
you the full list in a second i hooked
it up with Twitter and Facebook so I'm
seeing information from Twitter and
Facebook and also my exchange account my
email account over here so right off the
bat what we have here at the top is a
widget that lets us quickly update our
status on multiple social networks which
i think is quite nice very easy access
so I can type a message here could flip
open the keyboard or I get the nice
Android on-screen keyboard you can also
choose whether I want to broadcast it to
Twitter Facebook were all services so
really in one shot I can update my
status across multiple social networks
which is quite nice there's some other
widgets that you get here this one is
called the happenings widget and the
purpose behind this is that it will show
you a recent quote happening from one of
the social networks are signed up with
so right now I'm seeing a little a
little F for facebook so this person has
updated their status on facebook they
are using profanity in their tweet or in
their facebook status that will have to
ignore that but you get the idea it will
tie into many social networks and bring
you the latest that is happening over
here on the Left we have a stream right
into my email so i can see my recent
most email and i can tap on that to
bring that up swiping to the left and to
the right we have five different panels
that we can customize just like a
typical android device and let's go
through the widgets that you
get included on the motorola backflip as
as you get it out of the box there are
already a lot of widgets kind of
cluttering up the home screen but let's
take a look at sort of our other choices
so here we have the basic android stuff
like analog clock music calendar picture
frame and search but any any place you
see a little speech bubble that is one
of the motoblur widgets so we already
talked about happenings we already
talked about messages we're going to
show you news in a second and there are
some other motoblur things here social
status that's what I showed you that you
can update your status on multiple
social networks and also whether it's an
accuweather widget i'm going to show you
that in a second as well let's see what
else we can do from here if we tap and
hold we can also add shortcuts as you
can do on any android device to a URL or
to a contact or program can also do
change the folders or of course change
the wallpaper to something that you
enjoy so let's look at these other
widgets here's one of the news widgets
from motoblur and the ideas that you can
swipe to the right and swipe to the left
to see the news stories a very nice way
to sort of flip through news i think and
from here you can tap on a headline it
will open up the web browser and show
you the full story we'll talk about the
web browser in the next video okay let's
go back here is a widget for your music
not really unique to the backflip here
and you can see this stuff has changed
over here on the right since I've done
this video it says it was updated two
minutes ago and this time we have
changed again before it was from Twitter
and outs from facebook so it's
constantly updating here to the right we
have a yahoo search widget we have
another news widget which is kind of
general news and we can swipe to the
right again nice little smooth interface
we have an analog clock we have a
weather widget but this is just the
standard accuweather widget we can swipe
or actually tap down here to change
between detailed forecast and the
extended forecast so it's nice to have
that and over to the right we have tips
and tricks and getting started kind of
stuff to help you get going with your
backflip so if we tap tips and tricks
again we get this little pop-up bubble
interface that reminds you of the
motoblur logo get little tips on
conserving battery life and that sort of
thing I don't know why keeps going back
to that screen and over here we can just
look
through some getting started articles so
let's talk about some other aspects of
the motoblur interface if we swipe to
the right we have a thing here called
account settings and this is what you
get to set up all the social networks
for motoblur and take a look at all the
networks it supports it's quite amazing
so we got Facebook and Google and
YouTube and different email accounts in
picasa and skyrock and you get a little
check mark to show which of these
services are currently being pulled from
and they are all saved under a motoblur
account so presumably if you work too
hard reset your device you could get all
of this information back without having
to reset up all these social networks
which is quite a nice feature let's go
to the application tray I'm going to
show you a few things here's happenings
and this is kind of a more extended view
of what you saw before so in here I get
a stream of all of my social networks
some people may like this some people
may not I personally like to keep my
facebook and twitter stuff set separate
but you can actually just scroll down
and see little icons the tea or the or
the F depending on where these the
update is coming from and let's say that
you find something that you like you can
tap on it you will get the entire tweet
or the entire facebook status update you
can actually reply to that person really
quickly so this is kind of heavy the
Twitter integration works very simple
but it works quite nicely so that was
happenings let me show you the context
menu because it actually integrates with
all different sorts of areas so I'm not
sure that I like this too much the
contacts menu is pulling from my my
normal contacts from my email account
it's pulling from facebook and it's
pulling from Twitter it's a little bit
awkward because most of the people that
I correspond with on Twitter I don't
really know personally so I don't
necessarily need to see them included in
my contacts on my phone and furthermore
they don't have any sort of phone number
associated with their Twitter
information I'm not really sure why
motorola decided to do this it's just
way too much I mean it's an endless list
of context from all of my social
networks you can do some things to sort
of filter this out of course you can
search for a particular contact so that
you can find the one that you want so
you don't have to be
a sea of contacts all the time there's
also some interesting buttons down here
at the bottom so if we go to history we
are taken to a list of the history of
all of my communication on any social
network in any SMS and any email it's
kind of creepy actually that it's doing
this and it really doesn't serve any
purpose in my mind but if I were to
scroll to the top you would see that I
recently sent a text message to this
person this person I recently had a call
with this person I just got an email
from this person and so on and so forth
so it may be handy if you don't
correspond with that many people but for
me it's just a massive massive list of
stuff that I really can't get much value
from and finally there's a button over
here that says status and quite simply
this will tie again into your contacts
and try to pull the person's latest
status whether it's from facebook or
twitter or any other social network and
it will just display a little status
right underneath and you can tap on the
person's name to bring it up whoops went
a little fast there and just like the
previous screen we can see we can add
reply to the person we can also drill
down more precisely to see this person's
list of tweets and that sort of thing so
overall I think motoblur is an
interesting concept that of bringing it
together many different kinds of social
networks into one place but at the same
time it just it's a little bit chaotic
and not very productive for me I really
want to have a great email experience I
don't care care so much about knowing
what everyone's doing at every second
through every different social network
that I subscribe to but I think for a
lot of younger people that are really
into social networking that are very
much into communicating with their 1,000
friends the motoblur interface may be a
winner but for me I think it's a little
bit too much so that was a look at the
motoblur interface coming up soon we're
going to talk about the web browsing on
the motorola backflip and talk about the
built-in programs and the overall
experience including battery life and
performance and call quality so that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
