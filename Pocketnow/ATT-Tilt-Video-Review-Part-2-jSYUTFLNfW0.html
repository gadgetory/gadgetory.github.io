pocket now calm and this is part two of
the video review of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt now I
want to talk about the keyboard for a
second as with most HTC devices with a
slide-out keyboard the keyboard is
really nice it's big it's it's it's
lighted so you can see it at night and
what's special about the the keyboard in
the AT&amp;amp;T tilt it's got a rubbery coating
to it which which feels great it's kind
of like the soft rubber coating that you
would find on the back of back of the
device I'm something that bugs me a
little bit is that when you tilt the
screen up these Hardware soft key
buttons kind of get difficult to press I
don't know if you can see that but
they're kind of hidden by the screen the
screens in the way so anyway that's it's
quite an annoyance and when I first
heard about this device i think it was
in the beginning of this year or
possibly at the end the 2006 I wanted to
myself who would have the need for a
tilting screen you know when you're
messaging and you flip out the keyboard
this is completely adequate right like
on the HTC wizard and Hermes well I
found two ways that the the tilting
screen really really is important for
example if you're navigating in your car
and you don't want to use a cradle or
you don't want to have your passenger
hold the device for you you can tilt the
screen up and rest it on your dashboard
now hopefully you have some kind of
nonstick or non non sliding Matt I
should say on your dashboard so that
doesn't slide around but but having a
tilting screen in the car is really
really helpful another time when it's
really helpful and I'm going to take out
the stylus and demonstrate something
here is for watching videos personal
entertainment so I'm going to pull up
mobitv here it's included on the 18
detailed there's a three day trial after
that it costs a certain amount per month
off to check on that for you so I'm
going to bring up see if you can see
that when I bring up the weather channel
i think it's since I've two days
remaining and there is the weather
channel mobitv is great it's pretty good
quality over over Wi-Fi which is what
we're on now good quality over 3g too so
so imagine seeing this you know set up
in front of you on the tabletop as you
listen through bluetooth stereo
headphones or wired headphones
it's just kind of like your own little
personal entertainment device you don't
need to hold it in your hand it's really
convenient so that's the tilting
mechanism actually gotta close the
program here we'll talk about the task
manager that's built in here because i
have it set so that i have to tap and
hold the X to close a program ok great
so I was getting some questions on on
the elements of the touchflo that was
built into this device and there's only
one and if that's the scrolling that's
the the finger flick scrolling I just
want to show you what that looks like on
the iphone I'm sure you've seen it
before but it's done really really well
so the faster I flick the faster the
list goes if I want to stop it I just
tap it gently it's really easy to use
but on the tilt not so much I'm not I'm
not really happy about this so I go to
contacts right and here all my contacts
and to use this I have to press CC
doesn't even work all the time I have to
press pretty hard to get the list of
scroll and if you can see that and I can
tap it and it stops and I can scroll
faster and I'm going to try to get it as
fast as possible here and that's about
as fast as I can get it to go and I've
got 750 contact so it's going to take a
long time to get to the bottom of the
list through this through this means i
don't think the screen sensitive enough
on this device to warrant the the flick
scroll really and you can also use the
flick scroll in other applications
anything that requires scrolling for
example i can open internet explorer
here let me pull that up and you're we
at pocket now calm and a little bit of a
click and drag will get the scrolling
the work but again it's it's not that
good it really isn't and that is part
two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
