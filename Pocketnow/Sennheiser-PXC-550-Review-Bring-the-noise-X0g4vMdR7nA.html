headphones for you I mean for some
people it's really more about buying
into a popular brand and for others it's
more about the audio quality for me it
has to be a blend of audio quality
definitely but also convenience and I
think I found the pair that does that
job just right I'm high metal you bet I
will pocket now and these are the
Sennheiser pxc 550 over the course of
years of reviewing products I've
received many over the year headphones
and if you paid attention to any of my
reviews you might have noticed that I
actually ignore them like seriously I
travel way too much and I prefer to
travel light but that changed
dramatically since I tested the PXE 550
s and here are the reasons why the
unboxing experience is kind of epic I
mean you get the 550's a very
interesting case that actually shows you
how to put them away adequately a
microUSB cable for charging a 2.5
millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable for
you audio files out there that don't
want bluetooth now notice yes this is
2.5 millimeters to 3.5 so make sure you
don't lose this cable as these are
really hard to find and yes there are
other adapters like in the case of this
airplane one to connect the 550's there
are a couple of neat tricks I need to
turn them on you simply have to switch
the ear pads into hearing position and
that's it to pair them you simply use
NFC to pair through bluetooth by
touching your phone with the left ear
pad the right one is actually a cool
gesturing d-pad four controls slide up
or down for volume left to right to
change the track tap once to pause or
play and then my favorite DoubleTap to
hear the outside world as it uses the
microphones to feed the audio that's
around you now you'd be shocked at how
much I actually use that DoubleTap and
that has mainly to do with this noise
cancellation I mean it's really really
good it almost feels surreal like if
you're stuck in a vacuum and there are
ways to control the levels through the
application or through a switch that's
included on the
now if I had to narrow down what I like
the most about the PXE five fifties it
has to be their design I think it's no
secret that my biggest problem is that
yes I have big ears like bigger than
average big so it didn't really matter
which pair of over the Year headphones I
tried but your muffs would always apply
pressure over my earlobe and at some
point I just couldn't stand the pain
after about an hour to solve that the
550's actually skipped the standard
circular design to a more oval-shaped
making them perfectly sized for my
earlobes to fit inside as a result I've
been able to travel for hours without
needing to take them off and then from
the choice of materials to the field
these headphones aren't just very
comfortable to use but also very elegant
now I've been testing the PXE 550 s for
nearly a month and there are a couple of
things that I love and a couple of
things that I don't positive start with
the audio quality over bluetooth it's
what I call interesting as the audio
isn't really the loudest that I've heard
but very rich and given the epic noise
cancellation the combination is just
awesome and there's actually even an
equaliser through the Sennheiser cap
tune application if you'd prefer and as
for those thirty hours of battery life
that are advertised yeah those are
actually real now just remember to
switch them off whenever you put them on
your neck as these headphones are smart
enough to detect that you took the mob
and so they'll pause the music but what
they won't do is stop the noise
cancellation until you actually switch
them off and then the negatives as
nothing is actually perfect would be
really the wind filter of these five
fifties I mean there's just no way for
wind to not filter into the earphones
whenever you're walking through a breeze
and it just defeats the purpose of noise
cancellation as audio quality just goes
out the window at that moment and then
if you sweat like me there's the obvious
fact that these are not really
comfortable headphones to use if you're
in a heated environment
still even with its minor flaws the
Sennheiser PXE 550's have truly made me
a believer in over the ear headphones if
you're traveling on a noisy airplane or
a noisy subway this is seriously the way
to go yes I do consider the $400 price
tag to be steep and mainly when you can
get a pair of QC 35 s for around $50
less but there's just so much
convenience in the 550's for me to
consider switching yes I do highly
recommend you consider these headphones
