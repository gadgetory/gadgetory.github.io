their R's it's Joshua of regard what's
going on everybody and I'm here to
remind you about the weekly on the
latest episode of the PocketNow weekly
we talk about all the tech we got to see
this week including the LGV 40 and their
new SmartWatch which is really
interesting
all of Microsoft's announcements
including a pair of noise cancelling
headphones and then we sprinkle a little
bit of Nokia right on top so join myself
Brandon minimun and Jaime de vera and a
returning Taylor Martin this week on
wherever you get your podcasts we get
new renders of the mate 20 and along
with some price tags and also for the
bait 20 pro as well we also get more
leaks of the Google pixel 3 excel in its
retail box because we're just not having
enough of these and Samsung wants to
bring four rear cameras to a phone and
it's apparently not the galaxy s 10 I'm
Jaime metabee vera and today marks the
seventh anniversary of the passing of
Steve Jobs as always we thank you for
all your contributions to the industry
this is PocketNow Daley sponsored by
swap ah the official news today begin
with product launches those of you in
the markets for a SmartWatch you want
the sport watch this Garmin Phoenix 5
plus by the way is my favorite but Apple
watch series for version Nike Plus is
now available same price tag as the you
know series 4 it's literally just
different branding a different watch
phase and a different watch band I would
actually I actually wanted to get that
one but I just didn't want to wait now
let's talk about earpods competitors
because we are full of them right now
as early as good but nokia is bringing
us some new ones they're literally just
called the wireless headphones from
Nokia obviously they are truly Wireless
they bring 3.5 hours of use with 16
hours total once you match with the case
it they look really slick and they're
priced at 148 bucks so they better be
great can't wait to get a sample and
tell you more now let's move the
spotlight over to Samsung's plan to take
over the more cameras on a mid-range err
battle as we've got some rumors that the
company is working on yet another phone
with more cameras this time for cameras
and we're not talking about the galaxy s
10 apparently this is another premium
mid-range err the
is serious about the fact that they want
to bring innovation to this market
because that's pretty much where most
companies are making money right now and
well the cameras are kind of in st. you
can see full specifications in the
description I don't know if more cameras
I mean four cameras at the back I don't
know if that's the answer but why not I
mean I used the LGV 40 the
implementation wasn't that great on that
one
and thanks to a Facebook page and by the
way I that's not my favorite social
network but yes we get to see the retail
packaging of the Google pixel 3 Excel it
looks pretty much like the packaging of
the Google pixel to which I liked a lot
I felt that they had a lot of attention
to detail with that box but we also hear
about color options verily there is this
like sand variant that looks kind of
pink that's gonna launch apparently
before the mint variant so it seems that
not all colors would launch at the same
time stay tuned the event is coming up
very soon and I'm really looking forward
to it
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Huawei bait 20 May 2007
may 20 this time we've seen it from the
front but not necessarily from the back
as it turns out it seems that there
won't be many differences with the back
it's just gonna be the same phone with a
different display and a different price
tag because we hear that the May 20 is
going to be costing somewhere around 850
to 900 dollars and wait for it these are
the May 20 Pro is going to be costing a
whopping $1100 they look like beasts to
me I think I'm not saying they're gonna
be worth it I think no phone is worth
that money but let us know in the
comments what do you think do you like
the renders do you like the price what
price would you recommend because in my
case I feel a wall way would go too
crazy if that's the price tag but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion and folks we would
love to thank our sponsor swap before
