start killing the knotch but the
alternatives are rather interesting
Nintendo is apparently showing some love
to the design of the original switch
giving us some new internals and
according to trusted sources we might be
getting up to five new iPads in
September I'm Jaime Rivera and
definitely I know this face it's bad but
our Opel Reno video from Japan is live
it took me forever to edit that video
but it was a great experience make sure
you watch it this is PocketNow daily the
official news today began with
references that people might only
understand if they watched the Matrix
trilogy if you have not you have missed
out on some of the best movies but these
are actually things to be of concern as
there is a new virus called Aegis Smith
malware should I call it that's actually
really disruptive over 25 million phones
have been infected with this malware
with applications like whatsapp serving
it and invading your privacy over 50
million of the victims are in India and
in the United States over 300,000 it's
spread by third-party applications on
the store over nine of which are owned
by Alibaba the attackers reportedly want
to move to the Play Store as they have
found over 11 Boulder rule applications
authorities have been warned and if you
find any adware on your phone or
applications that don't usually have ads
immediately uninstall them it sadly it
doesn't seem easy to detect again if
you're being served ads that you're not
supposed to be getting from these apps
you might want to worry about that now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy fold
as a we're waiting for it to launch we
still don't have dates but apparently
it's already being tested as it was
apparently caught in the wild in New
Delhi recently and obviously it has to
be sent to all carriers words plan to be
launched and these carriers have to
launch all their tests so I assume that
we should be seeing the fold in the wild
over the next couple of days so stay
tuned for rumors obviously we can't wait
to hear more information probably the
Samsung Galaxy unpacked will provide us
with details now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 days of renders
then we covered some renders that
actually came from the official sources
according to the information that we got
and now we've got it
hold on the FCC where we see images of
its measurements we see the fact that
the headphone jack is dead we're still
trying to figure out exactly what the
teaser is with the camera being drawn by
the s-pen but that obviously we're still
very close to unpacked so we should be
getting more information too now let's
talk about iPads as obviously I am a big
fan of iPad OS I have been testing it on
my ipad pro for a bit I am really in
love with the experience so far
apparently we have up to 5 devices being
already sent for certification to the
euro-asian Commission we apparently have
an iPad 7 which is a nine point seven
inch and apparently also read them to
the iPad air which is that ten point
five inch model you haven't exactly
heard about the pros well we assume that
those are the other two models and
probably a refresh to the iPad Mini as
we've seen Apple being doing these
changes to the life cycles of Mac so it
makes sense for this to come to the iPad
lineup as well stay tuned is obviously
their event is most likely gonna happen
in September and let's talk about the
Nintendo switch obviously yesterday the
news were the fact that we had a new
Nintendo switch light which were still
debating if it's actually a switch or
not because it's not anything other than
a portable console think about it is
we're wondering exactly what's gonna
happen to the original switch because
the hardware is dated it's pretty much a
four-year old chip so apparently we are
getting changes not in the design
apparently we're getting a new chip
we're getting new flash memory
apparently there's going to be a change
in the logic board but it seems that the
documents received by the FCC were
mainly that Nintendo's declaring that
these are the changes but then the
design doesn't change at all so stay
tuned we're not exactly sure when we're
getting this new switch but I can't wait
for the update because definitely
improvements in performance are
something that I would really like to
see and finally the hottest news that I
have to do with the future of iPhones
and what exactly is Apple going to do as
we've been covering a couple of rumors
over Apple possibly getting rid of face
ID and once we can make Shi quo on this
apparently it's going to happen but the
thing about it is it won't happen yet
according to many quo Apple has a
roadmap over how they plan to phase out
face ID so it seems that in the case of
right now 2019 we're gonna get three
iPhones with notches and face I
so don't expect any changes now and then
in 2020 were apparently getting two
iPhones with smaller notches and face ID
and one iPhone with no notch and
fullscreen fingerprint scanner that's
gonna be interesting and then in 2021
three iPhones with no knotch
and a full screen fingerprint scanner
now this comes in conflict with other
rumors that we heard where apparently
that fingerprint scanner would only work
on half the display but if Apple could
figure out how to put it on the whole
screen that's going to be great let us
know in the comments down below what do
you think do you think that it's a good
approach to kill face ID cuz Apple
claimed that it was more secure than
anything out there and now for the
company to be killing it off says a lot
I feel that the fingerprint scanner
should have been like the most secure
solution but obviously we've learned
that optically it's not the best so I
feel that whatever approaches are given
in order to improve security is great
we'll see what we get but let us know
what you think in the comments down
below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm talking out
our comment subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one also follow us on
social medias our extended coverage
happens on Instagram and also follow me
on my personal handles to see what I do
with these phones as I test them please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hey Mary thanks so much
for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
