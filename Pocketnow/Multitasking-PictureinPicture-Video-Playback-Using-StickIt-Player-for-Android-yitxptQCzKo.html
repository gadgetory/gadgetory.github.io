pocketnow.com
do you remember our coverage of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 where we showed off
the really cool video feature where you
could have a pop off window playing your
video while doing something else really
anything else on the device if you
didn't make sure you go back and watch
that but if you want to get that same
feature that same functionality today on
your Android powered device you might
want to check out stick it player it's
available in the Android Market let's go
take a look all right so stick it is
just a regular app it's a player you go
ahead and launch it just like you would
any other app you've got here at your
files screen your settings screen where
you can make a whole bunch of changes
and your how-to that has kind of some
tutorials on how to best use the app in
settings we can have multi view turned
on which doesn't work on all devices but
on some of them it doesn't it lets you
essentially play more than one video at
the same time I don't really know why
you'd want to do that
but you can you can choose a theme the
default is transparent you've got Mac OS
Windows seven and over screen that you
can select from and all that does is it
changes the chrome around your player
you can auto hide it do some background
playing and then you've got a whole
bunch of advanced settings by a whole
bunch I mean - and they're really just
if things go wrong you can try tweaking
those out let's go back over here to
files and see exactly what this looks
like go ahead and play this you'll
notice it opens up this little player
now I can come over here let me turn the
volume down for you I can go to another
screen I can flip around I can do
whatever and here's this little floating
resizable window that I can drop
anywhere on the screen now you notice
that there was a little bit of graphical
weirdness going on there
it doesn't really handle resizing and
all of your player elements the way that
you'd expect them to but if you want to
get in and surf pocket now while you're
watching the Android guy weekly for
example
this is an excellent way to go about
doing that go ahead and close out of
that one more thing that I want to show
you let's hop over to YouTube shall we
because I do a lot of stuff on YouTube
and that's where the Android guy weekly
is so after you've installed the app
you'll have a new share via option in
some of your video players in this case
we can share be a ticket and that's
going to send the video over to the app
and then we just hit play and once
YouTube buffers this in we can navigate
away we can move the window all around
we can read the article associated with
this video whatever you want to do it's
there it's easy it's fast you can use it
really kind of cool the app is called
stick it player it is available in the
market right now or the Google Play
Store rather it's about $2 a dollar
seventy nine us but if you really want
to be able to do this and multitask and
you don't want to have to wait to buy
the galaxy s3 here you go you can do it
right now for pocket now showing off the
stickit player and highlighting the
bloopers from MWC this year I'm Joe the
Android guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
