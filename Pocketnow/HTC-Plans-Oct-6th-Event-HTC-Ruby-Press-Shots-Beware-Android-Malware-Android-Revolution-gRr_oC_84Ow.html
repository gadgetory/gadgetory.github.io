for more android we meet the HTC rubies
for spread shots and it's proven that
android allowed stealth malware all this
and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi Mary letter with
pocketnow.com and welcome to android
revolution the show we go through what's
hot and what's not inside the world of
Google's Android project let's talk this
week off with what's hot all right so
this is a week full of Android releases
so cut me some slack as I go through as
many as I can without getting stuck AT&amp;amp;T
has just announced that they're much
expected samsung galaxy s2 variants will
be available on sale as of October
second so prepare your walls because
everybody's expecting that device and
what Verizon an LG have also announced
that they're much expected in line which
is that sliding keyboard device that a
lot of people have been waiting for will
be online for sale on September 22nd and
then on stores as of the 29th verizon
has also announced that they're Pantech
Breakout LTE device will also be
available on September's 20 seconds so
for all of you that are after a 4g phone
that's actually cheap because it's LTE
well this is pretty much your choice and
pick HTC has just announced that their
HTC rhyme which we leaked recently is
also going to be the flagship device
rocking sense 3.5 on verizon though
sadly whoever made that pic for that
color and while speaking of the rhyme
it's also been spoken and I'm talking
about tweeting that o2 UK will have it
exclusively in the UK some time with in
October probably the 17th though
remember there's only a leak on Twitter
so sadly we can't really confirm that
it's going to be an official release or
not HTC has also just announced their
sensation XE will be offering some beats
audio for those of you that are
interested with a little edge on read on
your sensation and well aside from that
HTC is not over there yet because
they've also announced that I'll be
having this october six event which we
are expecting to be an android exclusive
device release event so hopefully a lot
of the leaks that we're going to talk
about in the next segment we'll have to
do with this event so stay tuned and
well Evan bless our expert in all
leagues foreign and domestic keeps
hooking us up with more leaks and more
information that everybody wants to talk
about first of all we recently leaked
some press shots of the HTC ruby that if
we've been leaking for the past weeks
which is rumored to become the HTC Amaze
and t-mobile really good specs probably
a new flagship device the HTC hero s
also pictured at for US cellular
sporting the same HTC sprint EVO 3d
design really interesting for US
cellular the ACC Explorer which is that
in the past was leaked as the HTC pico
also got some press shots on behalf of
some mid-range specs sadly it's not
something that a lot of us are expecting
because it looks like another wildfire s
probably just a variant Motorola seems
to have another atrix up their sleeve
this time it's the atrix 2 and it seems
that the specs are going to be just as
good and a lot better than the Atrix 4G
whenever it came out so hopefully this
device will change a lot of things in
AT&amp;amp;T and probably bring another variant
to other carriers now speaking of
Motorola we just caught this image taken
from a camera of a supposed of droid
razr now that's something I'll be
looking forward to and all something
interesting in rumors from China is that
there seems to be this meizu and next
device that's going to be released in
China hopefully soon and it's going to
finally bring the Nvidia quad-core
kal-el processor that we've been
expecting this year and apparently won't
make it to retailers as of next year
hopefully on this meizu device no
release dates yet only rumors but at
least we now have a device for the
processors that everybody's been waiting
for moving on to all the Samsung leaks a
recent leak has the samsung s hree 120l
sporting a massive 4.7 HD display with
720p resolution now sadly it seems to be
running Gingerbread so we can't really
make it you know the nexus prime device
that we're all expecting hopefully it'll
just be as good but probably not
speaking of samson our friends at club
coat UK recently updated their
availability of the galaxy s note for
late november in the UK so hopefully the
recent rumors that the no will be pushed
to next year could probably be wrong
other samsung leaks even have tweets
mentioning the nexus prime bringing
wimax and gsm under the same hood now
interesting enough there's no real US
carrier out there I think Walt carrier
probably only a Russia that it has wimax
and GSM mixed in so hopefully the leak
was not complete and we'll probably get
a nexus prime that'll actually support
all networks but I don't know how they
aren't going to pull that off but rumors
also have that Samson's actually being
call
their nexus prime the Galaxy Nexus and
not the nexus prime so not really sure
what to expect out of this device and
wall to end Samson seems to already be
working on their galaxy s3 devices and
the smart and really cool thing here is
that apparently Samsung's working on a
quad-core CPU for these devices I really
got to admit it's an seng really there's
a really good job in raising the bar for
the next devices to come in both design
inspect so hopefully all these rumors
will come true very soon out of our
featured coverage for the week make sure
you hit Brandon's recent article on four
different ways on how to make Android
feel and work like new again really cool
article and well if the windows phone 7
Metro UI has caught your eye well
Brandon's also film this really great
video on how to make Android adopt the
same tout interface with a new
application called launcher 7 so make
sure you look at that to Adam lines full
review on the LG thrill 4g is now live
and while even though he wasn't really
that thrilling on the device at first
hey ended up giving it 4 stars out of 5
on the review so that must be something
really good for the device because Adams
really tough on him and will deke Adams
full review on the motorola photon 4G is
now live it ended up making 3.5 stars
out of 5 so make sure you read to know
why dickies also currently filming a
sprint epic 4g touch video reviews and
everything seems to be working fine as
emmaus oh make sure you hit them up and
while tablets are your thing make sure
you watch his recent comparison video
between the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 from
verizon and the ipad 2 and other tablets
a really great comparison that you might
want to look at and things are beginning
to get interesting in Android as Google
prepares developers for their ice cream
sandwich transition rule is actually
doing their best for developers to have
easy guidelines to follow in order to
prepare their applications to be ported
easily into ice cream sandwich but with
the purpose of allowing applications to
work on both smartphones and tablets at
the same time without a learning curve
from developers it's really cool because
on the side note you know it's it was
really difficult for developers to
actually build building applications for
Android Gingerbread and also honeycomb
on the side because things weren't
really the same so hopefully
things are going to get really good as
of now though sadly there's still no SDK
or dates for when things are going to
begin working only guidelines so hurry
up Google okay so that does it for what
sigh let's continue all with what's not
let's begin talking about malware as it
seems to be becoming the thing in
android lately this time reports have it
that there seems to be this new
permission vulnerability exploit out
there that will allow malware to be
side-loaded into your device without
your permission because apparently if
you load other malware this stealth
malware will actually allow these
applications to be installed without you
even having to get permission to the
device I'm getting tired of saying
malware these viruses don't yet have
names and sadly it seems that this will
be the thing as Android gets pointed to
tablets and other different UI so this
is sad news hopefully well Android and
Google will begin working on different
ways of avoiding this without the need
of you no spyware attack software to
protect your device you know I really
hate that you're in danger messages in
all the time and it actually even makes
your phone slower so sad news there
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high middle
you better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
