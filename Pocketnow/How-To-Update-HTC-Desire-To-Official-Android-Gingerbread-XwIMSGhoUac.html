pocketnow.com
and we've got the HTC Desire still
running Android 2.2 Froyo
but HTC has recently released the
Android 2.3 Gingerbread update for the
smartphone and it comes with a twist it
will not be delivered over the year and
it's only been made available on the HTC
developer website and in this video
we're going to show you how to update
your HTC Desire to the new Android 2.3
Gingerbread be careful though because
there's one no turning back and to no
known root solutions as of now so if you
still want to update to the latest
Android version stay tuned to see how
it's done
okay so what you need to do is go to the
following address
HTC EF comm and once there you need to
go to kernel source code see downloads
and find the Android 2.3 Gingerbread
update for HTC Desire listed there
it's a 161 megabyte download hit the
download button read the license
agreement as well as read the frequently
asked questions because this is the
place where HTC tells you that yes this
is the official update for the HTC
Desire and that it will not be released
over the year and it's no turning back
really once you apply this one there is
no turning back to Froyo so once you
download it you will get the following
files in the package because the HTC
desire has limited space and HTC didn't
really want to give up on the Sense
experience you will get the upgrade
Portable Document format so it's a PDF
file with the update what's new release
notes and so on and so forth you get
flashlight and teacher 2 applications
which have been removed from the ROM you
get them as an apk so you can side load
them you get a bunch of wallpapers
because these were 2 removed and what we
are interested in is this the ruu which
is the rom update utility for the HTC
Desire let's just plug in the HTC Desire
to the computer and see how the update
process goes ok so we are back and we
are connected via USB to the computer
there's the icon to prove it and what we
need to do right now is just run the rom
update utility
it will automatically extract and we can
minimize this just to unclutter the
screen a bit and this is the main screen
read it carefully it will tell you
what's included what's not included and
some important information regarding the
update so we'll just hit next we
understand the caution the word of
warning read the instructions again you
need to make sure you have enough
battery power to go through the update
process and once you're done hit next
and let's take a look at the phone right
there currently it's verifying the
information on the phone make sure you
have HTC Sync installed because that's
what it takes to connect and you can see
that it found the HTC Desire you need to
press this update button right here and
the update process should start asks for
another confirmation it says that it
will replace version two two nine four
five five which is currently on the HTC
Desire with three point one four point
four or five point one yes that's what
we want to do once again and it started
on the PC let's see what how it looks on
the phone itself it's being rebooted as
we speak
it's in the bootloader mode and
currently it's erasing the user data
updating will erase all the information
on your phone so make sure to back it up
it will not touch your SD card but
whatever you have on your phone make
sure you have a backup handy because
everything will be gone ok that says
right now that it's updating signature
and this pushing files to the phone you
have a progress bar a progress indicator
on your computer currently you don't
have any on your phone but there should
be one soon
ok so meanwhile it also updated each
boot it's currently updating the radio
on the phone so it comes with a new
radio and there we go we got our status
and progress indicator right there on
the screen and we'll cut back in just a
couple of minutes to see how it's done
okay so it's sending information
meanwhile it exited the bootloader mode
and it came back to this mode right now
with no progress indicator and currently
it should be pushing the files to the
phone it says it's updating the
signature again still no progress
indicator
and this is the moment it should start
pushing the actual platform to the phone
it updated each boot it updated the
radio and now it's updating the
signature again in order to push Android
2.3 Gingerbread to the desire no it's
normally updating recovery now it goes
to user data and then system and there's
our progress indicator again on the
screen of the phone shouldn't take long
it's around 70% and still going and the
same on the phone and there we go it
says run update has been completed so
you need to press finish and let's see
what it did to the phone is currently
rebooting we got the HTC animation with
sound hopefully should be hard resetting
right now restarting again we've got the
HTC logo upon restart and we should see
the boot logo again with the boot
animation there we go it's a little bit
more fluent than it was with the Android
2.2 Froyo the quietly brilliant part it
should welcome us with a first boot
that's right
let's just unlock the screen and this is
the exact first boot
we are currently connected to the PC but
let's just disconnect and this is the
welcome screen on the first boot of the
HTC Desire running Android 2.3
Gingerbread blah blah blah let's go
through this next next next we agree
skip skip finish and let's see how it
looks
okay
and let's go into settings now the
scrolling is is more fluid skill to
about phone and software information and
there we go it's Android 2.3.3
Gingerbread running on HTC Desire so
this was entered denied from
pocketnow.com walking you through
updating your HTC Desire to Android
2.3.3 Gingerbread which has been made
available by HTC on its website if you
