leaked in a service manual Samsung's
future 13 megapixel shooter press to
revolutionize their image quality and we
get more details on the Nokia Lumia
talent I'm hi meri behna maybe hear me
say the phrase as it turns out more than
once on this video please call me out
this is pocket out daily let's first day
off with a single piece of official news
that's actually great news for those of
you owning an HTC One a TNT you're
waiting for Android 4.3 the company's
president the United States has
confirmed that Scott and approved by
AT&amp;amp;T and you should expect it to be
pushed on your phone as soon as early
next week so please hit that upgrade
button and tell us what you think about
the upgrade next week now let's talk
about Nokia's we've got some leaked
photographs that show us their future
tablet and it's got this really
interesting kickstand concept that we
want to understand hopefully very soon
it's apparently gonna be called the
Lumia 2520 I wonder where they get these
numbers but apparently we might see this
tablet by the end of this year probably
earlier so stay tuned for that hopefully
it'll be better than anything we already
know from Windows RT that was all about
sounds like as the company is now
trademark the name galaxy brown no don't
look at me funny that's the name galaxy
round we've heard the company working on
the f series of smartphones which we
assume are the flexible display
smartphones for later this year but it
seems they're going to be calling galaxy
round so stop laughing we've got some
better news now apparently the company
has just confirmed that their optical
stabilized cameras are ready for
production next year so we can expect
them to preach the future galaxy s and
galaxy note apparently the galaxy flex
round or effort whatever they're going
to call that thing is not going to
include this camera which is really sad
news and speaking of curved this place
if you thought that LG was just planning
to bring us some curved glass well it
doesn't end there the company has just
send their flexible all leds into
production for smartphones so we can
expect this to be the new technology
that we will get next year probably by
the end of this year some rumors are
pointing out though I you know I still
can't understand fine you know those
flexible outlets will be awesome a curve
display will be awesome but I see
as the next 3d on displays for
smartphones they're gonna be the next
gimmick sadly that's my opinion and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got a leak service manual of the
Google Nexus 5 and yeah dudes this is
gonna be a very hot phone we're talking
about a Snapdragon 800 processor 2 gigs
of ram 16 or 32 gigs of storage a decent
battery and an 8 megapixel optical image
stabilized camera as well finally we get
some great camera shots from an extra
smartphone but you know the biggest
question and the question that I have
for you today is what would you price
the spoon I mean think about it it's got
all the specs of the note 3 of the LG g2
except for the cameras obviously but you
know with optical image stabilization
you don't really need more pixels as
long as those pixels are big and
hopefully they are so yeah what would be
the price that you would give this phone
in my particular case if they price this
thing at three hundred dollars no
contract even if they priced it at 350
this will be the biggest selling
smartphone ever I mean there is nothing
to envy from the hottest phones on this
nexus phone which brings the Nexus back
to the days the glorious days of the
nexus one so leave a comment down below
what would you price this thing and
friends is always for an earlier scoop
