android google has let us use our voice
to do relatively common tasks like
sending text messages or emails I could
say send a text message to bendito papen
Dorf hey I love the new book and it
would do it but who is bendito Papen
Dorf and why can't I say send a text
message to mom I'm Jo Levi for Pocket
now we're going to go hands-on with a
brand new feature from Google now that
lets you do just that so before we dig
into this this is relatively new in fact
it's so new that it's being released in
stages you might not have got it yet if
you haven't be patient we're going to
show you on the Nexus 5 at running
Android 4.4 KitKat so if you have an
older version of Android again this
might not work second there has been
kind of a workaround in the past if
you've wanted to say send a text message
to mom you could create an address book
entry for Mom and then it worked just
fine but then she'd be mom and it
wouldn't have her name you could set up
a nickname for mom using her full name
but that sometimes worked and sometimes
didn't Google now or the updated Google
search or whatever you want to call it
whatever they want to call it now is
letting you set up those relationships
on the fly so that you can say okay
Google now call mom or send a text
message to mom let me show you how to do
it so I've created a new contact in here
with the name of the bendi dope
Eppendorf and I've given em a fake phone
number and a fake email address and this
will be my fake brother it's that sound
good so we can connect them to a Google
circle if we want to or Google+ circle
but we don't want to do that right now
let's go back home this is my Nexus 5
running KitKat and the Google experience
launcher so I should be able to just say
ok Google call my brother
bendito papin Dorf
and then it asks if I want to remember
bendito papen Dorf as my brother I do so
I will add a relationship and then right
there it's going to fire up my Google
Voice so once that relationship is set
up you can do simple things with it in
the future like okay Google send a text
message to my brother I'm going to be
late for dinner
here's your text do you want to send it
yes
sending message and just as simple as
that I've sent a text message to my
brother who Google remembers is bendito
papin Dorf and it has said I'm going to
be late for dinner you can do this for
anybody you could do it for your wife
your girlfriend your mom your dad your
crazy uncle whoever you want it just
makes the whole experience a lot nicer
now one thing that I haven't found yet
what if I got the wrong person in here
for example if I wanted to do this demo
again well if I want to do that and I
want to remove the relationship I don't
know where that is it doesn't seem to
store that in my contacts so if you have
found out how you can go in and edit
that relationship after it's been set up
we want to know head down to the
comments and tell us just how to do it
what did you do step by step to either
change that relationship or to remove it
entirely so there's a cool trick to send
a message or call someone based on their
relationship to you rather than by their
name if you like seeing these kinds of
tips make sure you throw the video a
thumbs up so we know to keep doing them
for you and of course you want to make
sure that you've subscribed to our video
channel so you don't miss out on those
new videos as soon as we've released
them while you're at it tell your
friends about us
we're on all of your favorite social
networks my favorite being Twitter or at
PocketNow and I'm at Joe Levi thank you
very much for watching we'll catch you
next time
I'm Joe Levi for pocket now here's how
you can use Google's new relationship
that's not even really a thing blah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
