king of tablet makers but can a google
tablet compete I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the new Nexus 7
versus the iPad Mini over the last year
small to mid-size tablets have become
increasingly popular they're just as
useful as their larger counterparts but
can often go where 10 inch tablets
cannot pant and jacket pockets and
pocketbooks and when it comes to smaller
tablets there is a wide array of
different models from various
manufacturers however there are only two
frontrunners one by Apple and one from
Google the iPad Mini and the Nexus 7
made by a soos so which is the better
tablet which comes out on top in this
head-to-head battle let's find out
externally these two tablets have a lot
in common they also have a considerable
amount of differences sighs for example
the iPad Mini features a 7.9 inch
display thus it's physically larger than
the 7-inch Nexus 7 both tablets major
200 millimeters tall but the iPad Mini
is 1.5 millimeters thinner and the Nexus
7 is 20 point 7 millimeters narrower and
18 grams lighter than the Wi-Fi model
iPad while the difference might
initially seem quite small it's rather
noticeable when you're using and stowing
the devices the Nexus 7 is much easier
to Palm our fingers wrap around the
sides relaxed and with ease all we have
to stretch our fingers to grip the iPad
Mini the narrower build of the Nexus 7
also means it drops into our pant
pockets without too much discomfort
while the iPad Mini looks like you
stuffed a dinner plate in your pants the
materials used are also quite different
the iPad Mini is made out of the same
anodized aluminum found on the iPhone 5
it's dirty and reeks of high quality but
scratches easily the Nexus 7 is composed
of a high quality soft touch plastic yet
same for the home button on the face of
the iPad Mini and the top speaker on the
Nexus 7 the designs aren't all that
different their bags are slightly curved
toward the edges the front edges are
chamfered the speaker grilles at the
bottom are perforated on each side of
the charging ports the rear cameras are
located in the upper left corner and
they both feature minimal bezel along
the sides of the display with noticeably
larger bezels at the top and bottom
they're sort of like long-lost cousins
until you power them on internally they
have a considerable amount of
differences
the iPad Mini features only 512
megabytes of RAM comes with a one
gigahertz dual-core a5 chip either 16 32
or 64 gigabytes of thick storage and a
16 point 3 watt hour battery the Nexus 7
has 2 gigabytes of RAM a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro chip 16 or
32 gigabytes of built-in storage and a
15 watt hour battery at 39 50 milliamp
hours both come in Wi-Fi and LTE models
though the LTE Nexus 7 will not work
with Verizon CDMA coverage meaning no 3G
further the Nexus 7 comes with NFC and
wireless charging and it's bluetooth
smart ready by far the biggest
difference between these two small
tablets is their displays the iPad Mini
at 7.9 diagonal inches offers a display
resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels for an
overall density of 162 pixels per inch
the Nexus 7 comes with a 7-inch display
with a 1920 by 1200 pixel resolution its
pixel density is 323 pixels per inch
obviously in terms of clarity the Nexus
7 takes the cake it's considerably
clearer but it's also brighter or
saturated offers deeper blacks wider
viewing angles and it's more pocketable
which is arguably the primary purpose of
a small tablet InDesign these two are
nearly deadlocked though we give it to
the more narrow nature of the Nexus 7
the Nexus also has the upper hand in
specifications but the iPad Mini doesn't
give up the fight so easily it takes
home the build quality title software is
the other strong suit for the iPad Mini
the iPad Mini is currently running iOS 6
which has its own laundry list of
features but iOS 7 isn't slated to drop
until fall iOS 6 features the old iOS
interface it's drab and quite boring to
use we can't help but feel the iPad Mini
would be more useful and efficient with
the new set of features that come with
iOS 7 such as the quick settings menu
the current software simply feels dated
the Nexus 7 comes with the latest
version of Android 4.3 which boasts a
nifty tablet specific feature multi-user
support with restricted profiles this is
perfect for families who share tablets
between various members as per usual
with Android their optimizations on the
home screens and lock screens widgets
which offer at a glance information and
not all of your applications have to be
scan
around your home screens it's simply
more organized and easier to customize
that said there are hundreds of
thousands of applications in Apple's App
Store that support tablets games
productivity and social apps that more
than make up for the rest of the
platform shortcomings and greatly
improve the overall experience
however the tablet application situation
on Android is certainly improving quite
rapidly at that there is now a dedicated
filter in Google Play to display tablet
applications and considering Android
smartphones are continually growing in
size running phone applications on a
7-inch tablet is not nearly as bad as it
is on a full-size slab in software these
two miniature tablets come to a draw
both the iPad Mini and the Nexus 7
perform exceptionally well in day-to-day
use applications launch quickly tapping
the home button drops you back on the
home screen in an instant and even
switching applications or changing
orientation happens relatively quickly
but if we circle back to specifications
there's a logical reason why the Nexus 7
outperforms the iPad Mini the a5 chip in
the mini holds its own in general use
but graphic intensive games tend to bog
the tablet down causing serious drops
and frame rates not nearly as many
applications can be kept in memory this
means you'll see application splash
screens more frequently but the apps
savestate certainly helps offset the
lack of RAM the two gigabytes of RAM and
Snapdragon s4 pro paired with the most
recent improvements of project butter
keep the Nexus 7 purring along smoothly
it handles games well and has yet to bog
down on us through intense multitasking
battery life is fairly comparable as
well the 16 point 3 watt hour battery on
the iPad Mini and 15 watt hour battery
in the Nexus 7 will likely manage to
power you through a full day of use
their standby times are phenomenal only
dropping three to five percent over 24
hours of inactivity but on heavier days
you might want to keep a charger around
just in case in typical use cases they
will only need to be charged every day
and a half to two days and the cameras
on these two will not knock your socks
off by any means they both equip five
megapixel cameras around back and both
take dual pictures which lack contrast
detail and proper color reproduction
your smartphone will likely take much
better pictures but these will do in a
pen
although the first Nexus 7 was a killer
tablet we never imagined the second
iteration would be so great the iPad
Mini has been regarded by many as the
best small tablet money can buy since
its launch in November but Google nsoos
picked up the slack and pumped out one
stellar tablet that will leave
competitors scrambling to return fire
and that's not even considering the
price at two hundred and twenty nine
dollars plus tax the lowest capacity
Nexus 7 is a full 100 dollars cheaper
than the same capacity Wi-Fi model of
the iPad Mini and the yet to be released
LTE model Nexus 7 and 32 gigabytes will
cost only $10 more than the cheapest
iPad Mini the comparable iPad Mini 32
gigabytes with LTE would cost two
hundred and ten dollars more
ouch in other words if you're in the
market for a new tablet are more
accustomed to iOS and Apple's ecosystem
and you're not against paying a little
more the iPad Mini is likely your best
option if however you're wanting the
absolute best bang for your buck we
recommend the new Nexus 7 that's going
to do it for this video but if you
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to see more videos like
this one in the future and for more
Nexus 7 coverage over the next couple of
days including a full review I'm Taylor
