what P but who's gonna win in the screen
quality battle let's find out when
choosing your next smartphone the
biggest question we get from everyone is
which one's better and probably the best
way to determine that is look at the
screen quality I mean the screen is
gonna be your companion from here on
because everything around the smartphone
is just there to power the screen
anyways so we've got pretty much the
three best smartphones in the market
with screen quality we've got the Sony
Xperia S we've got the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus and we've got the iPhone 4s we've
got 720p resolution here 720p on the
Galaxy Nexus also and we've got 960 by
640 on the iPhone 4s which third is
their Retina display so let's determine
which one's best in a couple of
comparisons now showing you screen
quality on video is kind of difficult
because you need a really good lens to
show that off I'm using my Canon EOS
Rebel t3i DSLR for this video so bear
with me here it'll do a really good job
at showing you quality but if i zoom in
you'll notice that mechanically it'll
take it a while to focus sometimes it
won't so we've got the iPhone 4s at the
left this device has got an IPS
technology display there's the retina
display from Apple which is 960 by 640
resolution we've got 326 pixels per inch
right here at the right we've got the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus Super AMOLED HD
technology we've got a four point six
five inch display 1280 by 720 this one
gives us a 315 pixels per inch density
and then we've got the Sony Xperia S
it's got a broad yet engine to provide
colors and contrast and we've got a 4.3
inch display 1280 by 720 but what's
interesting here is that because it's a
smaller screen than the Galaxy Nexus
we've got 342 pixels per inch if we
would guide ourselves only by pixel
density the Sony Xperia S would be the
winner so far now how these devices
handle text well again we've got the
same devices here and if we try to zoom
in as much as we can and also bear with
me I can't set the screen brightness to
maximum on these devices because that
will show throw the camera off exposure
we've got
the sony xperia s in the middle right
now I'm going to move these aside and I
cannot see pixels on the sony xperia s--
it's very difficult you have to try to
zoom in as much as you can and let's try
to do that without leaving focus there
we are you'll notice that you can barely
barely see pixels here now let's try the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus right now and we're
there at the same page from the Kindle
application and you'll notice that what
the Galaxy Nexus you can't see pixels
but it's also very tough to find them I
mean the Galaxy Nexus doesn't have the
best screen in the world I give that to
the Samsung Galaxy s2 if it would at
least give me the 720p resolution but
you'll notice you can't see pixels and
obviously the iPhone 4s
well the retina display will definitely
not show you pixels because it has a lot
more pixels per inch if we did not
compare to the sony xperia so you can't
see pixels on this device you can barely
barely see them so now if we stack the
devices side-by-side it's kind of hard
to decide which ones better handling
text it would be hard to decide between
the iPhone 4s and the Sony Xperia S and
then the Galaxy Nexus doesn't really do
a bad job at handling texts either so in
my particular case I would either choose
the Sony Xperia S or the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus just because I could see more text
than I can with the iPhone 4s you'll
notice that obviously since both devices
are set to 720p resolution you have
probably almost the same amount of text
on each on each of these devices they
end up at a different word for some
reason but still these are the obvious
two winners here the iPhone 4s does a
really good job with pixels per inch of
it still you can see a lot less words
here now we would try to measure image
reproduction you'll notice that hey
everybody asked me which thoughts do I
have so this is Deva this is one of my
two chihuahuas and I'm gonna try to zoom
in as much as we can because all three
devices do a good job at reproducing the
image all three of them do a good job
with the colors and everything but for
some reason the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
does a better job at zooming in the rest
of the devices try to zoom in a diva's
eye here as much as I can and the Galaxy
Nexus does not blur out at any point and
this is an 18 megapixel photo
rendered on all three devices for some
reason the Galaxy Nexus does a better
job at handling it even though it ends
up blurring at some point but if you'll
notice the color quality on each of
these three devices is really really
good it's kind of hard to tell which
device does a better job in comparing
colors so let's try to move into a
different image here let's try to zoom
out in the iPhone 4s this photo we took
at MWC him and try to find it here on
the Sony Xperia S here we go we've
everybody knows the Nokia PureView 808
and you'll notice off the bat colors and
all three devices are great to be honest
with you I'm liking the Galaxy Nexus a
little more even though the Xperia S
does an equal job at handling color for
some reason the iPhone 4s looks a little
whiter and it should probably a little
less warm than the rest of the devices
when handling color you notice that the
reds are red but the Xperia S handles
blacks much better than the Galaxy Nexus
if you would ask me notice the black
coating around the Nokia device here
then notice that at the Galaxy Nexus
this is black black and let's see what
the iPhone 4s is kind of a tough one all
these images are 18 megapixels taken
from the same DSLR and for some reason I
noticed that the experience handle
handles them better though the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus is not far off at all and
if we would try to measure the ability
of each of these three devices and
handling streaming video well we've got
the same video this is a yesterday's
Android revolution running from our
YouTube channel and let's see which
device handles color and detail better
so far I've got to tell you well these
three devices do a really good job but
for some reason I love the detail on the
Sony Xperia S the skin tone looks
amazing on the Xperia so we would
compare it for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
and to the iPhone 4s for some reason
this is the same video all in HD quality
from our YouTube channel and you'll
notice that for some reason the Xperia S
is a better job at handling detail for
some reason the Galaxy Nexus looks a tad
blurry and the iPhone 4s doesn't look
blurry at all but the problem is you've
got this small screen in comparison to
this large screen
honestly it's a tough call it all
depends on you all three devices are
flagship devices it's up to you but so
far if it wasn't for the terrible
battery life on the Xperia that you saw
at my review so far this device is
handling everything better when it comes
to screen the Bravia Engine does a much
better job in handling not only color
clarity but also detail and also
streaming honestly for me the device in
my particular case would be the sony
xperia s-- though again I'm a big fan of
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus these are my
two daily drivers the Galaxy Nexus and
the iPhone 4s and so far I've got to say
it's kind of a tough call it all depends
on you so far I'd say that the bra v8
engine is promising let's just hope they
get Ice Cream Sandwich on this phone
soon that's it for our video comparison
of the screen quality between the Sony
Xperia S the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and
the iPhone 4s be sure to give us a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
I'm Jaime mater Iveta thank you very
much for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
