Nexus devices are getting google
assistant call command Samson continue
to flirt for collaboration in their
future products and we continue to learn
more new tricks of the Google pixels or
whatever they can do I'm hi Mary vetta
and about the only stories i have about
yesterday was pre-ordering five Google
pixels when I actually only hit the
button once but anyways this is parking
out daily
the official news today start with deals
if you must notice must have an Apple
watch well the original Apple watch the
first generation now talking serious one
or series to them talking about the
first generation Apple watch in
stainless steel is currently with great
deals on best buy we're talking fifty
percent off in some cases there were
variants that were seven hundred dollars
that are currently three fifty others
that are just two hundred fifty bucks i
am not saying these are good Apple
watches I am actually really liking the
new one but not the case with the old
ones but then again hey if you want the
basic experience of the Apple watch it's
currently there now some very
interesting rumors have to do with
Qualcomm and Samsung if you remember
both companies work together for the
Snapdragon 820 in order to be able to
make it to the galaxy s7 and apparently
the rumors are this will happen again
with the galaxy s 8 and the snapdragon
830 both companies are going to
collaborate and we should expect
variants of the galaxy s 82 also
launched with Snapdragon which is
something that was rumored not to happen
so I guess there was a lot of pressure
there now for those of you wondering
exactly what you're getting with those
google pixels because they're quite
expensive for what you're getting well
apparently there will be some freebies
if you were able to preorder so if you
got it from best buy for example you'll
get a hundred dollar gift card and
addition a chromecast and if you order
it from the google store or verizon
harrell you'll be getting a daydream hbu
which is a good deal i feel i still
consider these products to be a little
too overpriced but then again the
freebies would probably make a
compelling and speaking of google pixels
the main question that we got yesterday
on twitter is why are these phones not
water resistant that makes a lot of
sense pretty much every flagship that
matters this year is water resistant and
low apparently these phones are I p53
just like the HTC 10 because the
collaborations there so I p53 is really
splash resistant it's not for you to
take it to the pool it's not for you to
take photos while swimming actually no
phones are that good you know they are
just resistant to it but they don't
guarantee that they will be but anyways
that I p53 rating is apparently there
so yeah you can get it wet and rain out
of accident and still have a phone and
finally the hottest news today actually
answer the second question that
everybody had on Twitter yesterday what
will happen with current Nexus devices
and everything that was announced
yesterday not offered for these products
well first of all those of you
interested in Google assistant for
current Nexus devices apparently you
will have to wait until end of year to
be able to get an update that brings
your phone to be able to use a system
natively now for those of you that want
the whole experience of the Google pixel
products on your Nexus apparently that's
going to wait until 2017 with a
full-blown Android 7.1 update which
makes you wonder exactly what was the
whole point of getting pure Google a
year ago and I feel that this is the
main thing that companies get wrong you
know what's let's just go to the
question of the day how do you feel if
you're currently a nexus owner how do
you feel about the fact that pretty much
Google just shot you in the foot in my
case see this is one of the main reasons
why a lot of people have been loyal to
apple you have an old four year old
iphone and you can still get the latest
and greatest version of iOS true you
won't get everything because you don't
have the latest hardware but you still
get the latest and greatest version of
iOS on the day of launch why is it that
android oems can't do the same what is
the mystery here because it's clearly
not sold more phones for these companies
but anyways leave us a comment down
