pocketnow.com
and this is an overview of the
experience of the HTC Hero we're gonna
go through the Sense UI that HTC is
brought in addition we're going to talk
about the Android experience and how
it's different than other phone
operating systems now in future videos
we're gonna drill into the web browser
take a closer look at them the
application store they call it the
market plus compare it side-by-side to
other mobile phone platforms such as
Windows Mobile and iPhone but in this
video we're just going to take a
overview of how the phone actually
functions and works so let's get started
I'm going to press the power button and
immediately we're taken to this unlock
screen which is pretty useful it shows
us the time the date unfortunately not
next appointment we get a preview of any
message that we have such as an SMS or a
missed call down here at the bottom it
says hello it's an SMS now I really like
the way that the hero unlocks the screen
it's just by a swipe downwards with your
thumb the reason I like this so much
compared to say the iPhone where you
have to position your thumb right in a
certain area slide to the right or even
windows mobile 6.5 where you have to go
to the top of the screen to slide over
the lock bar is because you really don't
have to be precise you can unlock your
phone without looking when you're
walking down the street and you're not
really paying attention to your phone so
just a quick swipe of your thumb and you
are to the homescreen interface now
we've talked about in a previous video
and I'll put a link up on this video how
the whole widget based interface works
you can add and remove widgets you can
have up to seven screens of different
widgets you can even download additional
widgets for example this battery meter
does not come stock but I've added it
which i think is a nice little addition
so let's talk about how you actually
access programs in Android on the HTC
Hero now like the iPhone you always have
to go back to the main screen in order
to access programs which is a bit
unfortunate whereas in Windows Mobile we
can go up to the Start menu to your
recently used program list and just tap
on any of the recently used programs and
jump right into it now Android does do
multitasking unlike the iPhone and like
Windows Mobile it actually keeps
applications open at one time it
intelligently closes applications based
on how much RAM that you have so you're
gonna notice if I open an application
and go back to it it opens up very fast
it doesn't have to reload it saves the
state the application was in which is
really important if you're doing
something in an application so any way
to access programs on the hero you tap
this a button in the bottom left corner
you get a list of all your programs now
unfortunately there's no real way to
organize or group these programs out of
the box and it can become a very long
list of programs
fortunately like a desktop computer Mac
or even a Windows computer you can take
an icon
let's take chess tap it and bring it on
to the desktop or if you want to call it
the desktop it's really the home screen
that way you can quickly get access to
the programs that you use most and you
can also have you know many different
panels of icons available so that is how
you get to the programs from the main
screen now there's a really intelligent
notification system and Android and this
isn't unique to the HTC Hero other
Android devices has this as well if you
pull down the window shape you get a
list of all of your notifications in one
screen now the reason that this is quite
cool is because your phone is always
trying to tell you something you have
new email new SMS a missed call or
perhaps you're using a Twitter
application that ties into this
notification system it'll it'll alert
you when you have new tweets or if
you're using perhaps a stock program
that is trying to alert you when a
certain stock reaches a certain price
that functionality exists that
capability is there in Android so of
course we can just go to any of these
notifications and just tap on them to
drill right into that particular
notification area so really interesting
also you get sometimes a preview of a
message if you get an SMS and you are
currently in another program you'll
often get a little scrolling message at
the top that'll give you a preview of
what the person said to you and then you
just pull down the notification shade
and you action on it right there now
let's go into a few programs again we're
going to drill into more programs
specifically later like the web browser
but for now let's just poke around and
kind of get used to how the whole
Android interface
is laid out let's start off with let's
say what's going to the calculator keep
it simple now in Android and it's an
attempt to save screen space they've
really hidden most of the menu items so
in order to change a setting you have to
click on the menu button down here and
then you'll get the any available
settings that are available I think this
is actually pretty cool because it saves
on screen space but simultaneously
because the menu items aren't on the
screen to begin with there's always an
extra key press that you have to do to
bring up the menu items in fact for the
whole system-wide settings you have to
press the menu button and then you go
into settings and now we go into system
settings one of the biggest problems
with how the settings are laid out in
Android is that they're not graphical
based there's no icon next to it so if
I'm very very quickly trying to change a
Wi-Fi setting or trying to change the
wallpaper I actually have to read all
the text that I see here whereas in
Windows Mobile or an iPhone or other
operating systems you can quickly glance
and see the little icon that you're
looking for and drill right into it it's
very very text-based and Android when
you go into the settings and the second
screen is the same and here is scenes
we've we've sought we've seen that in in
a previous video and so through here you
can change typical things right go to
wireless controls you can change Wi-Fi
what Wi-Fi network you're on turn on
airplane mode pair Bluetooth headset or
hands-free kit change your mobile
network settings and by the way I had to
add the an access point for AT&amp;amp;T it
didn't come with that information out of
the box it didn't auto configure itself
to AT&amp;amp;T and we put a post up on pocket
now that shows you how to configure for
AT&amp;amp;T so let's go back and as you can see
an Android to go back to the previous
screen you press the back button now it
doesn't work like Windows Mobile
non-touchscreen where it will go back to
the previous program then to the
previous program it will only go back to
the previous screen within the same
program that you're in so we can go back
again back again and eventually we are
back to the main screen if we press back
again nothing happens because we are
where we started in that program now
let's go into the mail application and
talk about what that looks
so if we tap on any message it will open
up in a new screen look at the look at
the lag do you see the lag right there
that's one of the biggest problems with
the with the whole HTC Hero and Sense UI
is that it's quite laggy and slow at
times especially when open an email
something that should be rocket fest now
something that's reminiscent of touchflo
3d from Windows Mobile devices are these
buttons on the bottom watch this this is
look familiar it's right out of touch
flow 3d the email application is really
cool because what it does is it actually
sorts by certain characteristics so this
is my plain inbox if I go to
conversations it will actually group
email conversations by you know it'll
it'll actually show me threaded email so
I can keep track of you know five
conversations in in five different areas
rather than having to look through
fifteen different emails so very nice we
can go to messages that are flagged and
then we can go to messages that have
email that have attachments on them so
this touchflo 3d kind of interface
carries over to other parts so if i pull
up a contact card let me take it off the
screen we get HTC's unified
communication view and you saw this in
Windows Mobile in touch flow 3d the idea
is that when you look at somebody's
contact card you can reference quite
quickly whether you've had any SMS
conversations with them any email
conversations with them if they've got
any Facebook updates if they have any
picture updates from Facebook or Flickr
and you can see their call history all
in one screen so that you don't have to
kind of dig through a million different
places to find out what you've said to a
particular person so that's come over
from Windows Mobile and it's a really
great concept to have on a on a phone so
let's talk about the on-screen keyboards
because obviously the hero doesn't have
a slide-out keyboard like the g1 or
other mobile devices so the on-screen
keyboards are very important fortunately
HTC really knows a lot about on-screen
keyboards by now this device has a
capacitive touch screen display so think
about the keyboard that comes on a
device like the Touch HD or the touch
diamond2 or even the touch pro2 or you
can go back to the HTC touch pro or even
the touch diamond2 understand how good
the keyboards are so I'm gonna try to
type something out here
and it's kind of a weird angle so so it
uses t9 to guess what you're trying to
say you don't have to be exactly precise
just like on the iPhone or other
on-screen keyboards out there now there
is a version in landscape so let me flip
it over and it kind of takes a minute
which is one of the problems with the
which the hero and then you get a much
much larger on-screen keyboard you also
get a little bit of a haptic feedback
when you type so a very very good
on-screen keyboard because the screen on
the hero isn't as sensitive as it is on
say the the iPhone
typing takes a little bit more getting
used to but if you have a concern about
getting the hero because it doesn't have
a built-in keyboard you don't need to
have that concern the keyboards are
really fantastic I've gotten much much
faster in using it in just a few days
and I'm very very comfortable on it
especially with the vibration feedback
that helps a bit now to hide the
keyboard then windows multiple of course
you would press the button in the center
here but there is no such button so we
press the down button and it hides the
keyboard off of the screen okay so let's
take a look at a few of the programs as
we wrap up this video let's go into the
calendar and see what that looks like so
the calendar again looks very touch
flow-3d like we can tap on a date to see
what we're doing on that particular date
and we get the weather right on one
screen which is really great we can go
into menu and again remember Andrew it
hides all of the settings for a
particular screen behind the menu button
and we can go to say agenda view a
little bit of a delay there's a lot of
delays in the hero when you open certain
programs and when you jump from screen
to screen I don't think it's as fast as
it needs to be we can jump around we can
make a new appointment we can go into
the settings and again just like the
settings in the previous screen the
whole system-wide settings there very
bland and black and white very
text-based very half-baked eloped
looking some people may appreciate the
simplicity but I rather have icons for
everything and a better hierarchy so
that I can look down the list and not
think that everything looks the same at
a quick glance so let's go into some
other programs let's go into the phone
and of course you can access the phone
by doing this cost
button or by pressing the large phone
key here and I'm gonna cover up part of
the screen because there are some phone
numbers listed up there so if I tap on
phone I get this large keypad and let's
say you're trying to dial you know
Jessica so you would type jess2010 grams
real quick and let's go into the YouTube
application the YouTube application is
not as glamorous as it is on Windows
Mobile and iPhone it's very very light
and so we can scroll down and see little
thumbnails and we can do I will just tap
on one of these see what it looks like
mean kitty that should be entertaining
and we go to landscape and here it is
the videos playing we're doing it over
Wi-Fi right now so it's downloads pretty
fast video quality is quite good that's
funny anyway so click the back button to
go back and a lot of programs work in
landscape the app store works in
landscape YouTube does which is good
because sometimes you want the option of
getting kind of a wide screen view of a
certain application if it makes sense in
the case of this application I probably
have it in portrait because if you go to
landscape you get fewer results on the
page at once which really doesn't make
too much sense so overall I found the
experience the user interface and the
way that you use the device on the HTC
Hero are really Android in general to be
kind of a mixed bag there's a lot I like
a lot I don't like I like the
customizable home screens that allow you
to not only have icons on there but you
can have widgets next appointment stocks
all kinds of different things that you
keep an eye on on a regular basis I like
the unbox screen you can unlock it
without even looking at the screen I'll
really like the notification window
shade because within seconds you can
access anything that needs your
attention all in one place I also like
how applications can actually tap into
the note
vacation window shade so that Twitter
for example can tell you when you have
new tweets what I don't like about
Android and the hero is how you have to
go back to the homescreen to open any
programs and as you can see I just got a
text message and it shows you it right
here at the top which is really awesome
so to access any program you always have
to go back to the home screen and press
this up arrow here now Android does have
a feature if you tap and hold the home
button you get a list of the six
recently most used programs and that
would be awesome if you could access
that in any screen but if we drill into
a program tap and hold on the home
button it just takes you back home and
then you can open it again Android can
multitask it leaves several programs
open but if you can't switch easily from
app to app then really what good is
multitasking so really in the end there
are three things from keeping this
device from being my daily driver one it
doesn't have us 3G which will obviously
change probably in the near future I'm -
it needs a little bit more horsepower
there's a delay when when you have a lot
of widgets on the home screens or when
you are trying to bring up an email and
number three I love to find a way to
multitask to switch from app to app
within seconds I'm sure there's some
kind of third-party application that
exists for this and when I find it I'll
make a video about it so that we can we
can have that feature available but
coming up soon we're going to talk about
more specifically certain parts of the
Android operating system such as the
marketplace and the web browser we'll be
back soon with more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
