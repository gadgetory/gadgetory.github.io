general public so of course we've
already installed it on our compatible
devices I'm hi out of Houston in the
pocket now and let's take a quick look
at what's new we already looked at the
consumer preview of iOS 9 earlier this
year and a lot of what we saw then
remains unchanged here swiping right on
the home screen now accesses Siri
suggestions with quick shortcuts to
favorite contacts and frequent apps
along with nearby points of interest
there's a new low-power mode that
prompts you at twenty percent battery
remaining and again at ten percent and
limits background tasks and
notifications to squeeze a bit of extra
juice out of your iPhone the recent app
switcher has also been updated with a
vertical card style reminiscent of
Windows Phone and look now you can draw
and scribble in the revamped Notes app
iOS 9 is a helpful new back button in
the upper left corner of the screen that
jumps you back to your previous app when
you open a link and it's a convenient
way of avoiding the slower multitasking
you I when possible speaking of
multitasking if you have an iPad air 2
you can now run two apps side-by-side
and split screen view something we never
thought we'd see from Apple the keyboard
also finally adjusts to show lowercase
characters something I've been waiting
for for years Apple has added a few new
apps to iOS 9 as well like news and find
friends neither is anything special that
you can't already get from third party
apps but it's nice to see Apple's own
implementations that will play nicely
with Siri and speaking of Siri she's
been totally revamped with a new
interface that ditches the listening
tone and replaces it with a short
vibration series also smarter now so you
can tell it to show photos from a
certain trip or open music controls and
plug in headphones there are a lot of
small improvements in iOS 9 that all add
up to a big update and you can get it
right now straight from your system
settings so download it enjoy the latest
of what Apple has to offer and let us
know what you think by leaving a comment

favorite social channels until next time
