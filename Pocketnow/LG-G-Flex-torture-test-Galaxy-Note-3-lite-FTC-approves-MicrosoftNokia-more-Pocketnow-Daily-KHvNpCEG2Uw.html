berry and begin to surface the Oppo n1
will begin sale soon but no word on
cyanogenmod and the FTC approves the
microsoft nokia deal you all been
waiting for I'm hi Mary better and stop
looking at me funny after where these
long sleeves when it's cold this is
pocket now daily let's lay off with some
official news as the Federal Trade
Commission has just approved the
Microsoft notegive by out that a lot of
people have been waiting for and this
just happens a couple of weeks after the
Europeans Trade Commission has just
approved the same thing so the companies
have green lights to do what they plan
to do and hopefully we will be getting
some products from their collaboration
if we didn't already get the products
already just stay tuned let's hope they
keep the Nokia name and for those of you
that are wanting a 4k display on your
smartphone meizu from China has already
taking a step closer and even though
this mx4 gene does not support a 4k
display it's got a 2560 x 1536 5.5 inch
display which is a whopping 500
something pixels per inch that's just
crazy I really don't know who will even
look for pixels on this thing but still
it's gonna be available soon in China
hopefully we will be getting a variance
in the United States though we're still
not sure stay tuned for that but
obviously this means that the technology
is just a step closer to coming to our
displays by next year now let's talk
about Samson is those two new colors
that were reported from the Argentine
website are now available this is merlot
red and also rose gold white and rose
gold black you get those soon links in
the description for details but even
more interesting is that apparently we
will be getting another variant of the
galaxy note 3 soon and this is going to
be actually a light phone apparently
it's going to be launched in Barcelona
which is mwc next year and it seems that
will either have a lesser camera or a
lesser display we're still not sure I
just hope that this is actually the
active version of the galaxy note 3
which was also reported of months ago
but stay tuned for that and for those of
you that are interested in the official
cyanogenmod smartphone aka the Oppo n1
well the phone is going to be on sale on
December 10th but it's kind of a catch
as we do know that this phone is going
to be launched with their color OS but
we still don't know if it's going to be
launched with the cyanogenmod variant at
the same
time we still don't have any official
word on that now remember this is a very
special phone the specs are probably not
the best but it's got the swivel camera
that's really cool and if this is going
to be the first cyanogenmod phone
officially hopefully we'll be getting it
soon and finally for the hot news of the
day we've been begged for the longest
time to have a torture test then we
finally have one we thought that the LG
G flex and it's self healing technology
would be the best phone to start and you
can watch Michael Fisher full video on
his real-world portraits as for not just
throwing the phone on the floor we're
actually giving you a real world usage
scenario how you can torture this phone
and what it will survive and what it
won't so make sure you watch the full
video but that leads me to the question
of the day would you be willing to pay a
company to actually code a phone to take
torture I mean think about it you pay a
lot of money for invisible shields so
when you pay for a coating something
special because I my particular case if
they would ask me for 50 bucks just like
invisible shield I would definitely pay
for it but leave us a comment down below
what would you prefer and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video's film
achieve follow was on parking our
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you can also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore d better please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high made me better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
