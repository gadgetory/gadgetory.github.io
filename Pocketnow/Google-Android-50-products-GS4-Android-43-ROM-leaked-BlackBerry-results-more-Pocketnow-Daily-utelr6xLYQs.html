console and another nexus q android 4.3
gets leaked for the galaxy s4 and
blackberry keeps pushing more and more
bad news I'm high memory better and now
that it's friday we're pretty much seven
to eight days away from the next friday
this is pocket out daily those are they
up with windows 8.1 microsoft has just
made the software public as a preview
when Adam Lane takes us through a full
video of what to expect with these
changes so far they do seem very good a
lot of reliability changes a lot of new
enhancements really cool features coming
up it links in the description for full
details on the video but aside from that
we've also got some leaked screen form
factors that are coming up 7 inches in
one and then we've got a 10.6 inch
Retina display graphics display coming
up could this be the next surface
blackberries up next but sadly not for
good news the company is struggling
terribly with their quarter results
they're down and just about everything
but probably the worst part is that
they've only sold 6.8 million units
within the quarter which is pretty much
the amount of Nokia Lumia is that we're
sold but wait a second that 6.8 million
is only made of 2.7 million blackberry
10 units meaning that blackberry you
know the z10 is not really taking off
and to make matters worse those of you
PlayBook owners all three of you out
there you're not getting blackberry 10
that's already confirmed so let's see
what happens to the company eventually
and now that the Sony Xperia Z ultra is
public there's still one codename left
of the previous leaks from a couple of
months ago which is the oh Namie the
question is what are we getting we've
got some leaked photographs of the phone
and well we've got a xenon flash we've
got an interesting metal edge and also a
weird sort of leathery texture stay
tuned for the league says probably this
phone will come out in the next couple
of months hopefully Eva now let's talk
about Android 4.3 and no we don't know
when Google is announcing it this is
probably one of the biggest mysteries of
the year but interesting there's already
a leak around for the galaxy s4 out
there links in the description on how to
get it at your own risk but no we still
don't know what features are coming what
are the changes so stay tuned we'll keep
you posted on the updates and hopefully
a date for when this is going to be
announced
and finally for the interesting news of
the big google makes headlines again as
they're working on three products that
you already knew of they're working on a
SmartWatch which everybody is and then
they're working on the game console
which we thought they weren't but
apparently they are and third apparently
they're working on a cheaper version of
the nexus q and the reason why this is
news is because apparently android 5.1
ooo operating system that will allow
android to easily scale two very
different form factors and very
different usages or usage scenarios
would be the right way to say it but
anyways it's really hard to know when
these parts are going to come up and as
we just talked android 4.3 is not even
on the timeline we still don't know any
date so five point 0 is probably even
further down the road so that leads me
to the question of the day are you
waiting on any of these products from
google now that you have google glass or
that some people have it you have a
SmartWatch and Nexus Q or cheaper one
and you also have the option for a game
console is there anything here that
you're waiting for in my particular case
I prefer a SmartWatch from google than
Google glass but leave us a comment down
below of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world makes you follow us on
