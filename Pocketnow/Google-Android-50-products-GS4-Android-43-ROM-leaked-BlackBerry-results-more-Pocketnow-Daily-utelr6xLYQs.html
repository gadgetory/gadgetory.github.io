console and another Nexus Q Android 4.3
gets leaked for the galaxy s4 and
Blackberry keeps pushing more and more
bad news
I'm high memory better and now that it's
Friday we're pretty much seven to eight
days away from the next Friday this is
PocketNow daily up with Windows 8.1
Microsoft has just made the software
public as a preview when Adam Lane takes
us through a full video of what to
expect with these changes so far they do
seem very good a lot of reliability
changes a lot of new enhancements really
cool features coming up it links in the
description for full details on the
video but aside from that we've also got
some leaked screen form factors that are
coming up seven inches in one and then
we've got 10 point 6 inch Retina display
graphics display coming up could this be
the next surface BlackBerry's up next
but sadly not for good news the company
is struggling terribly with their
quarter results they're down and just
about everything but probably the worst
part is that they've only sold 6.8
million units within the quarter which
is pretty much the amount of Nokia Lumia
is that we're sold but wait a second
that 6.8 million is only made of 2.7
million BlackBerry 10 units meaning that
blackberry you know the z10 is not
really taking off and to make matters
worse those of you PlayBook owners all
three of you out there you're not
getting blackberry 10 that's already
confirmed so let's see what happens to
the company eventually and now that the
Sony Xperia Z ultra is public there's
still one codename left of the previous
leaks from a couple of months ago which
is the own ami the question is what are
we getting we've got some leaked
photographs of the phone and well we've
got a xenon flash we've got an
interesting metal edge and also a weird
sort of leathery texture stay tuned for
the leak says probably this phone will
come out in the next couple of months
hopefully now let's talk about
Android 4.3 and no we don't know when
Google is announcing it this is probably
one of the biggest mysteries of the year
but interesting there's already a leak
around for the Galaxy s4 out there
links in the description on how to get
it at your own risk but know we still
don't know what features are coming what
are the changes so stay tuned we'll keep
you posted on the updates and hopefully
a date for when this is going to be
announced
and finally for the interesting news of
the day Google makes headlines again as
they're working on three products that
you already knew of they're working on a
SmartWatch which everybody is and then
they're working on the game console
which we thought they weren't but
apparently they are and third apparently
they're working on a cheaper version of
the Nexus Q and the reason why this is
news is because apparently Android 5.0
is for this they're building a new
operating system that will allow Android
to easily scale to very different form
factors and very different usages or
usage scenarios would be the right way
to say it but anyways it's really hard
to know when these parts are gonna come
up and as we just talked Android 4.3 is
not even on the timeline we still don't
know any bait so 5.0 is probably even
further down the road so that leads me
to the question of the day are you
waiting on any of these products from
google now that you have Google glass or
that some people have it you have a
SmartWatch and Nexus Q or cheaper one
and you also have the option for a game
console is there anything here that
you're waiting for in my particular case
I'd prefer a SmartWatch from Google than
Google glass but leave us a comment down
below of course it's always for an
earlier school of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com it's subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you also follow
me on twitter at 9 underscore Iveta
