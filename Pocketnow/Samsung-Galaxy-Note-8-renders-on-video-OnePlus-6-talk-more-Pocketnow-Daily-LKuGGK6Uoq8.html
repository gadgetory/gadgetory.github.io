video and have some of a skeptical we
already hear there will be some sort of
flex in the 2018 iPhone and we also hear
what to expect for the next generation 1
plus I'm high memory meta and it would
be kind of dangerous for any of you to
read what's on this t-shirt out loud
this is pong it out daily the official
news today begin with deals to a certain
degree if you're in the market for a new
smartphone amazon has got their
exclusive deals where you advise devices
like the new nokia 6 which has been
everywhere except the united states
until today for $229 if you get it
outright that then you'd get a $50
discount of you accept ads there is also
the Alcatel idol 5s which is a little
more expensive and there are a couple of
extra options you going on more in the
description other official news have to
do with the honor 9 which was just
announced in europe remember it was
already announced in China we already
talked about the specifications carrying
960 in addition to 460 bytes of RAM all
the storage you want as well
expandability the only problem with this
honor is that in addition to the fact
that it's gorgeous we don't know exactly
when were ever getting it in the United
States and that's kind of sad because
the honor 8 was an amazing smartphone
and for those of you that want more
details over why the oneplus 5 has this
or doesn't have that I highly suggest
you follow the third link in the
description we have Carl play on an AMA
that was recently on reddit you can
learn more about for example the fact
that it does have some sort of water
resistance even though it's not IP
rating and the fact that for example
there are reasons why the camera is on
one side not in the middle and for
example the fact that we might be
getting changes on the 1 plus 6 in the
case of the fingerprint scanner you can
learn more description and though we
still don't have this year's iPhones and
we're already hearing what to expect for
the next generation iPhone as apparently
LG is going to supply flexible circuit
boards for the smartphone sort of like
what we saw with the LG G flex and even
though the LG G flex got which we
haven't seen a successor to it it would
be really interesting to see other
smartphones bring this technology we
will keep you posted as soon as we learn
more next
here now and finally the very hot news
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 there is a video from some leaked
cat images of the phone and well I'm
kind of skeptical over what I see mainly
because if you noticed the top bezel is
taller than the one at the bottom also
that camera hump at the back is horrible
and we are getting the dual cameras and
the fingerprint scanner is also making
it up there again and this phone does
not seem small it doesn't seem small at
all and it's pretty much how legacy
galaxy knows have always been designed
look at the videos let us know in the
questions say what you think do you like
this design or not in my case not really
I don't like that huge camera hump and I
do not like that tall bezel at the top
but name is a comment down below we look
to know your opinion friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video was filmed
well hop on out our comm and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one they also follow me
on Twitter Highlanders quarterly better
on Instagram a time of live it up please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am I'm editing it I thank
so much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
