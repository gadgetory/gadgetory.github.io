pocket now and this is an sunday night
we are here on the last day of coverage
at mwc 2013 in barcelona we thought
we've taken you for a quick tour of
everything we like and everything with
it not like out on the show floor so
let's check it out let's do it when it
comes to devices this year's MWC wasn't
as big a disappointment as CES there was
a bounty of smartphones and tablets for
us to feast our eyes and hands on
however when you compare this year's MWC
to last year's you cannot overlook the
sliding trend of trade shows in general
especially with HTC now joining Samsung
and moving away from the Barcelona show
for its big product on feelings we're
set to see this happen but it's just a
normal evolution of brent onto the hands
and we were big fans of the devices sony
brought to the table back at CES and
that held true at this year's MWC with
the beautiful slim light and waterproof
Xperia tablet Z handling this android
tablet was truly amazing especially for
someone like me who doesn't get much
quality time with sony hardware and it
made me excited for the future of the
Xperia line for the first time and ever
really the line between phones and
tablets keeps getting thinner and
thinner LG brought the optimus g pro
phablet to try and offer this until
tentative to the note 2 and they have
succeeded up to a point that said
samsung will probably bring the note 3
at this year's Aoife so these
competitors have no time to rest on
their laurels until then the g pro is at
least in our book something to consider
and the optimus g pro wasn't the only
phablet we got hands-on time with ZTE
was on hand with its smartphone tablet
offering the grand memo but that me to
device didn't capture nearly as much
attention as the ax seuss fonepad
essentially a modernized Nexus 7 with a
metal back Intel Inside and yes an
earpiece so you can use it like a phone
if you want it's not something I'd ever
use but I know my esteemed co-host
definitely has different feelings on the
matter yes I do real earpiece phone
functionality was something I wanted on
smaller
tablets for a long time as an
alternative to Bluetooth accessories and
speakerphone the fonepad brings that and
so does the samsung galaxy note 8.0 the
South Korean device also brings another
heavy way to the table the s-pen this
time would edit functionality for air
view and capacitive buttons another
notable tablet though not for its good
points was the HP slate7 a low-cost
Android device with an odd screen
resolution and unremarkable specs about
the most exciting thing about this
device was its Beats Audio integration
and its baked in print functionality
which should tell you all you need to
know about HPS current position in the
tablet market amazing how much can
change in two years fortunately there
were more interesting things to see in
the uncommon form factor 33 asus has
brought the third iteration of its
unique phone and tablet offering with
the padfone infinity there's no middle
road here you either love the concept or
stay away from and of course even if you
are in the first category you have to
squeeze that wallet because thirteen
hundred dollars is something you could
easily spend on two different devices we
were quite disappointed though not
necessarily surprised to find that Nokia
didn't have a true PureView Windows
Phone device waiting in the wings at mwc
once we got over the letdown we found
the Lumia 520 and 720 devices that
aren't going to say she ate those hungry
for a spec heavy meal but with them
nokia and microsoft are driving the
Lumia lines price down and driving
higher end features like great camera
performance lower in the lineup that's a
winning story for everyone rooting for
Windows Phone even if it's not the most
bombastic news we ever heard the big
guys weren't the only ones playing the
field we got to see one of the most
promising new offerings from the startup
sector at mwc yola sailfish OS we got a
tour of the OS and we would lie if we
said we were not impressed the entire
concept both visually and functionally
is different than all the new offerings
out there there's still a long way to go
but if you come to think of it that
third spot in the ecosystem war is only
a couple of percentage points away and
something else caught our eye while we
were in the far reaches of the trade
floor yotaphone didn't just have a fancy
booth it
a fancy phone the self-titled smartphone
is all business up front with Android
jelly bean but it's a full-on party in
the back with identically sized I ink
display protected by Gorilla Glass you
can throw text images Maps notifications
whatever you want on the back and use
that screen when it's appropriate it's
not for everyone but it's this kind of
innovation we were hungry for and a show
dominated by iterative improvements and
we're excited to see where it goes Oh
little mwc was fun as usual but left us
with that slight bitter taste that it
too has started it's doubtful of course
the new venue accommodates more
companies and visitors but with the key
players slowly moving away for more buzz
and exposure we can't help but wonder
what will happen next year and who will
be joining the list of the missing along
with Samsung HTC and Google although mwc
appears to be undergoing the same
transformation at CES and the rest of
the trade shows the optimistic part of
us tends to think it's okay because the
gaps are being filled by smaller younger
companies showing products that are
almost as if not more interesting than
those of the big guys we're excited to
cover mwc again next year so that's it
about the mwc 2013 be sure and stay
tuned for our next major event which is
March 14 for the samsung galaxy s4
launch and then of course the August for
September Ethan Berlin and another CES
after that it never really stops does so
this was an something odd this was
michael fisher it's been a pleasure it's
been a pleasure without on my end as
well sir and we will see you next time
fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
