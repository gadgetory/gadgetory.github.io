about the Lumia 1020 which is probably
what it's going to be called not the EOS
because that would be kind of a lame
name we're talking about the best
Windows Phone yet with a camera that we
saw in the PureView 808 which arguably
if you ask Tony takes the best pictures
of any device on the planet or at least
any smartphone and so Tony phone it's
the Tony phone it's it's it's perfect
it's like perfect validation for Tony's
theory that the 808 PureView is the
megaphone of all phones so we are here
with a bunch of guys here we're here
with Adam yo Tony's there and the 808 is
here too hi May we should do a wave as
we hey Michael hello everybody I have
the junior Lumia with me the junior luo
yin and Taylor Ricky Martin yes would
that be morning my name is Ricky and
Sarah Staley Rick Taylor regular that
would be awful just terrible I'm a big
fan of Ricky Martin come on Taylor do
you prefer being referred to as Taylor
Swift or Ricky Martin haha there's no
lesser those two people hello Martin
splits time between awful nicknames you
add la barca come on man well there's a
both or female anyway so there's or
pertaining Charlotte where everybody
knows me a state a for whatever reason
are you serious hey guys I don't know
are you but now so they're going to
start in 4.1 minutes that is cool and
for those who are just tuning in now we
will have a roundtable a live thing
where we can abide on things as they
happen we're going to watch the event we
have somebody on the ground that Elaine
is there but i'm gonna let Brandon do
the talking yeah so you know this is a
really big deal this is going to get
Windows Phone back into the higher-end
space of smartphones officials right now
dominated by the HTC One the iphone 5
the galaxy s4 the only problem with this
phone that I see and I'm curious to hear
what you
guys think about this is that we know
it's not going to have a competitive
display it's going to have a nice 4.5
inch 720p AMOLED but it's not gonna have
a 1080p display is is that a problem or
do you think that the 41-megapixel
camera were more than make up for that
more than make up for you really think
that he is amazing i love 1080p smart
phones but it's also very it's a luxury
item it's not necessary chosen 41 not a
big its camera so it was a 41-megapixel
is LTE so well here's here's the thing I
mean it's not that the 41-megapixel
camera is not necessary it's the options
that have lost lasoon actually you're
never gonna use the 41 megapixels so for
me I would love to have a more of a
digital digital camera experience with
my phone thanks to the 41 megapixels
that not have it at all let's let's talk
about that lossless zoom because on all
smartphone cameras you cannot optically
zoom in you can pinch on the screen and
it gets blurry as heck and it's
disgusting but with me with the PureView
808 and with the Lumia 1020 Tony how
does zoom work is it really feel like
you can actually zoom in on a picture is
it still kind of blurry in digital mmm
you can of course zoomin but it's not an
optical zoom so because of the sensor is
huge like this is the sensor which is
the entire 41-megapixel sensor whenever
you snap a picture of 5 or 8 megapixels
it only uses a small portion of the
sensor and the rest is unused so you can
zoom in towards the sensors one by one
ratio and that's how it achieves you so
it's rather neat and you don't see a
difference between this type of zoom
which not get employees in the PureView
technology and optical zoom which is
done by several lenses zoom lenses like
for instance on the galaxy s4 zoom yeah
so so with the normal like like when
you're zoomed all the way out you're
getting down sampling correct so from 41
megapixels 25 whatever you 85 or three
yeah yeah so so when you do that and
then when you switch over you're
actually just using a small portion of
the sensor where's no down sampling at
all and what the sensor sees is
displayed on the screen and it's it's
going to result in the final image
you're very interesting well that'll be
fun to test you
this this camera thing is kind of coming
full circle but it because if you guys
remember when windows phone 7 series
which is the name of Windows Phone when
Darth came out when it first came out
one of the main tenants of the operating
system what it was that it was built
around photography Microsoft required
that OEMs have a dedicated camera button
by the way the event looks to be
starting in 38 seconds nokia jingle of
course i'm like 10 seconds behind the
live feed so europe they always behind
the camera software of Windows Phone 7
series was interesting how when you took
a picture you could slide backwards to
the viewfinder and then of course
Android copy that later uh but we never
saw like a killer camera to attach to
the hardware and the software I mean
it's taken a really long time and this
this device has been rumored for well
over a year and eight yeah let me just
say something can you imagine if Stephen
E can you imagine if Stephen Elop
doesn't host this event again he will he
won't yes I was overseas from London for
the 925 i was asking everybody is the
boss going to be here and they were like
well in spirit well that yeah that sucks
but he's i'm definitely gonna be here
I'm kind of hoping that I Malaga no it's
not the Lumia 1020 but it's actually the
lumina phone the what vilonia to the
lobby it's funny I was debating this
with myself last week which is yeah what
if the 1020 is the AT&amp;amp;T name and what if
the 909 is the international because it
would make all the stats gonna be the
case 8089 girl yeah do we've got we've
got some retrospective happening and
some like a back black and white
slideshow over the history of
photography and very very in relying
voiceover happening oh look there's Tony
in the photo there we go you know even
if Nokia or to make Android hardware and
they were to put this camera on an
Android device for the 1080p screen they
would be kings welcome
nokia an android thank God somebody
brought it up oh I'm glad I was paying
attention to go o.o every thought you
said okay an Android okay yes i do agree
there it's the most obvious choice in
the world everyone wants it especially
if this device was a hit and it takes
pictures as good as the 808 PureView
PureView it's like an it's like they're
leaving so much money on the table if
they don't make an android version they
probably can't contractually but it's
such a shame like for the android can't
have this nothing I think the android
community has enough I think there's
enough going on in the android community
I don't wait out of here my god it I
don't like it because the android
community has a fair amount of sameness
you could argue the last three or from
us there's been some difference but if
they came out with a with a 1020 that
ran a droid that would be truly
different and worth creating let me ask
you guys something or ever nothing would
be good to ask you for for quick short
answers in alphabetical order so Adam
Brandon Haim and Michael and Taylor what
do you guys think this nakia superphone
will mean for nokia and for Microsoft
when we lock is on the floor Stephen
Elop is on the floor till I think it's
it's probably their last chance at being
nope honestly if this doesn't take off I
don't know what it means for nokia and
smartphones on us well Windows Phone as
the platform as market share um maybe an
extra four percent on a good day ooh
alright I think that's fair I mean what
this is going to do one of the problems
of Windows Phone is that lack of
awareness people know Android they know
the iphone but windows phone is still
like you're not thinking about it and if
there are headlines tomorrow that are
like 41 megapixel camera even for some
people they won't understand what that
means that's going to be a headline in
the wall street journal tomorrow or even
this afternoon and it's going to raise
awareness for Windows Phone and so I
think it's going to be a nice nice burst
for Windows Phone and maybe I you think
four or five percent this might be good
for I got him said honey I don't know I
just I think that it's going to be a
great opportunity for nokia we're just
going to see the the
courage of Windows Phone towards nokia
if this phone doesn't succeed we're
going to see where the real problem is
cuz no kiss pushing the innovation but
clearly something is wrong in the
Windows Phone turf because they're not
growing at the same pace or or
justifying I think we're going to know a
lot with this phone Michael you're a
huge windows film fan I have indeed and
I'm sorry I've been splitting my focus
with you guys and Steven ella was doing
a retrospective on nokia devices now I
think I think know for what this will
mean for for nokyo if they price it
right will be a continuation or an
acceleration of this gradual reversal
but i don't i'm not confident is going
to be priced right it can only mean good
things for windows phone this is going
to be an epic billboard for the platform
hey Michael let me let me ask question
before we got a lot on android phone
go-ahead run what if we have this device
then in a month from now we have the HTC
one version for Windows Phone do you
think those together will do big things
for Windows Phone platform you know i
don't know i'm not sure that the HTC the
HTC can can make a splash as big as this
is going to be i really don't because I
love don't get me wrong I like the the
one a whole lot but this is gonna be a
class by itself you know he used the 808
in Berlin that's why he's talking like
that yes pretty good um I'm kind of with
Jaime on this and part of the problem
here is windows phone itself I'm
scheduled to do a video on my thoughts
on windows wall tomorrow so basically in
a nutshell I think part of Windows
Phones problem is the reception of
windows 8 upset that before on the
podcast a couple times Windows 8 is kind
of crash not really yeah nobody really
likes it all that much I mean some do
but it's a very small percentage of
people who actually like Windows 8 so
when people see that same exact
interface on a phone they're like I
don't like this I'm not gonna like that
without ever really trying and they are
two totally different experiences so
with this phone um it might change that
but honestly I think windows phone is is
the issue um so much as as much hate as
I'm going to get for that evening I was
positioning the 1020 is the next chapter
in mobile phone photography is it is it
official do we know that this is the we
do not know that the this is the brand
name no we're still seeing bits of the
device zoomed in on very closely and
very inspiring tunes very inspiring
tunes definitely i love them i love the
footage it looks really nice 152
megapixels breaking yet so we're we're
seeing some fanciful renders of the
multiple lenses here we're seeing really
cool 3d models of stuff spinning around
it's almost like Independence Day to
again i was out there you know guys what
I'm most afraid of I'm afraid of that in
one and a half maybe two months this
phone will be already obsolete and let
me explain why it will it will I think
become a piece for museum like my 808
PureView a reference design because the
Windows Phone 8.1 update or whatever its
name will be will bring high resolution
support and there will be phones 1080p
phones with more RAM faster processors
yeah in the phone so those are different
colored tiles yeah but but the thing is
independently of that there you have for
example at 41 megapixel phone how many
41 megapixels phones exist right now
that one to 10 lumia 1020 finally lumia
1020 we attend to enough finally all
right well i'm white and black and
yellow God has long make today us
exclusive for the first thing they
should have launched this with Windows
28.1 a 1080p display and then I would
blow in well I know right they should
have waited for at least we'll listen
but what's gonna be hot about 8.1 that
anybody knows about what's gonna make it
rent is wait a second isn't there 1080p
isn't their support for multiple screen
resolutions within an eight point 0 up
to 7 pull up to 7 768 or 768 yeah so
wxga um there-there's rumored to be new
chipset support so possibly Snapdragon
600 quad-core Snapdragon 600 and 1080p
hmm interesting up and then and that's
going to happen in time for the fall as
they're really a cycle so I mean this
this phone is going to have you know
July August September about three or
four months probably four months until
the new the newer stuff comes out but
I'm sure nokia will have like an idiot
saying nokia not nakia they're gonna
have it what's the correct way nice not
yellow you're black we have white we do
not have cyan I i predicted that cyan
will be an agent e again yeah but and it
won't have it in the retail store so
i'll have to get it online respect
better not be glossy this better be
matte finish agreed I could read man how
was that that when I was at the 920
event I told him I said if there's one
thing you did wrong you made this home
glossy you know I don't know why they're
promoting this phone in yellow so much I
actually like it in yellow it's very
actually and having having unboxed 19 20
and yellow the review yet I love that
color Adam and in another area but I
love it this this phone is a billboard
for nokia because of that lens on the
back and the contrast with the black and
the yellow just makes it's a camera lens
look at this thing agreed no wonder if i
get like a new low sorry it reminds me
of the black and yellow branding like
circle I don't like it with really
aggressive branding you know you know
it's funny it's funny it's funny that
the camera lens the the hole is smaller
on this 41-megapixel phone in on Tony's
Lumia 925 your pimple oh yeah because of
the call out yeah I like it when they
play tricks like that like HTC One did
that where it's like here's this year
the lens it's like no it's not the lens
is still that big but it's yeah I like
that trick oh it we got 4 megapixels
right this is 10 times the resolution so
the most the most important thing I am
curious about I can't wait to find out
is how is nakia managing to capture 40
something or 30 something megapixel
images with Windows Phone as it is yeah
but I was gonna bring up so let me let
me just let me finish the question
because you don't know what I'm going to
ask bert yeah that's Taylor one is
Microsoft doing something special for
and with Nokia in support for a special
build on this phone or is nakia
being smart encoding a special camera
application which was rumored on top of
Windows Phone now there's the question
well I have another question to add on
that chip set the chipset doesn't
support up to 41 megapixels is it you
know if it's using us if it's using the
the Snapdragon s4 pro it only supports
up to me something ok let's try to
remember something let's try to remember
when the Lumia 900 was announced Windows
Phone did not support LTE connectivity
and they somehow expanded Windows Phone
to be able to support LTE with the Lumia
900 and so most likely what we have here
is gdr2 I think that's the code name of
the second step for windows phone and
it's going to be built specifically to
support this phone obviously if nope is
the the challenge partner here they're
pushing all their guns on this phone and
you know independently I think that
whatever ddr2 or ddr3 is going to
support is going to be included in this
film that's they're gonna figure it out
I think my only concern is I don't know
if you gave you guys hold on what I'm
gonna interrupt you it's going available
ly 26 for three hundred dollars on AT&amp;amp;T
fully hun really country that was the
rumor I was saying on Twitter this
morning that they were gonna price their
299 on contract which is that story
isn't it that enemies like a lysine you
Tori hi sorry I'm sorry I'm it bleeds
back to you yet that's gonna be cute for
like eight hundred dollars unlocked or
something like that but still okay okay
my biggest concern is remember when
windows phone mango was announced you
know I think that Windows Phone took
decent photographs as an operating
system but then I've had to win to win
those phones from the original turf and
ever since mango was announced the
photos look terrible regardless of which
phone I used and then when Windows Phone
8 was launched I had the same problem I
have a problem getting photographs that
are not jagged or I'm sorry not moved
it's hard for me to be able to like
really focus on a shot and and and get
it right so that's like my biggest
concern it's not the camera it's the
it's the operating system can Windows
Phone really handle this cameras my
vision I can say es I've been using the
925 now for a month and I like the
camera is it your view 8 awake like no
is it one of the best cameras on the
market yes so that that problem is
solved or at least nokia managed to
somehow solve it okay we'll see well so
we're talking about video at the live
event right now Stephen Elop is talking
a whole lot about how this device is
going to revolutionize mobile video
apparently there's so they're showing a
video of the 1020 yeah the 1020 1080p in
1080p of like of beekeeping which is
fascinating what do you mean that pin
doesn't recording 4k video what the yeah
and you know you know what show me what
what is still 720p wood windows phone
you had what's the video a performance
like on your 808 in terms of what like I
mean is it good in general because we
only shot stills I don't remember
shooting a video that's good it's good
you did you did shoot video the thing is
you were drunk but I have it in the
bloopers yeah if you like it on me for a
second what I was talking about is the
s4 um it's max camera support is or the
max resolution in the camera is 8
megapixels on the s4 play plus is 20 and
the pro is 20 but it doesn't even
support the probe windows phone doesn't
support the purpose is quite for well
that's move yeah so that's what i was
asking like how do they do 41 megapixels
it's probably only um you're probably
max at 20 and you i don't know i don't
know how they do that well just ok ok
the question is how is that 808 PureView
able to support 41 megapixels what
processor is it i can tell you from the
top of my head i'm sorry it's been a
year since i reviewed it but the thing
is that it doesn't generate 41 megapixel
images it generates 3838 depending on
the mode you're shooting in but the i
might have an answer for you for this
chipset problem maybe maybe the chipset
does not support outputting files which
are 20 plus megapixels but the raw
processing maybe is done by the software
itself so one point three gigahertz
arm11 I've got a with stephen has been
talking stephen elop has been talking
about the optimist I
like that agree and yeah I know but I
think we're starting to learn a little
bit about why this thing is 299 I'm
contract we don't know the full retail
prices yet but I mean the optical image
stabilization involves a lot of ball
bearings mounted in the bracket along
with some piezoelectric motors it sounds
like Michael are you trying to say that
the Lumia 1020 finally brings a
combination between PureView stage 1 and
p review stage 2 yes I am in fact yes
yes finally and that great I asked plus
a 41-megapixel it's every day stop
speaking speaking English to me what is
pure no stage 1 and stage 2 1 is the
beautiful glossy digital zoom the
PureView technology which we tailor if
you once again interrupt me I'm gonna
fly over to the USA and I'm gonna have a
conversation with you that sounds like a
bus conversation it's gonna be a lot of
fun libre sir it's that technology which
allows you to use lossless zoom and the
down sampling technology PureView stage
2 is low light performance coupled with
optical image stabilization the 808
doesn't have that the Lumia a 97 lead us
in have stage 1 now finally we'll have
the down sampling thing with lossless
zoom and optical image stabilization and
low-light performance coupled together
yes they're comparing motion capture on
the galaxy s4 iphone 5 and lumia 1020
and obviously the 10 20 ticks perfectly
still pictures while the other ones are
blurry in essence that's interesting how
could that be that in a notegive and
we're gonna have a blurry shot of the
Nokia phone come on all right it's
almost like this that I you know yeah
yeah it's like if we were watching an
Okie event right now that's odd
interesting inception inception Michael
what's hot on them go ahead what's
happening at the photo comparison that
y'all are talking about is going on I'm
10 seconds behind you guys because
apparently I don't know internets you're
in boston your do boston it happens yeah
they're showing a sure a full-size
headshot of a woman holding a tea mug or
a tea tea oh and you're able to
read the texts and you can read the tag
hanging
because he's it so yeah it does take up
to 38 like the 808 so yeah thanks up to
thirty eight megapixels and you can do
it in four by three or in sixteen by
nine at 38 and 34 right yeah you know
probably one of my biggest questions is
you know with all this 808 PureView with
all this phone how come we've never like
really seen a DSLR with 41 megapixel
sensors in question well because they
have optical zoom to make up for it
right yeah you do but not necessarily I
mean if you get an 88 pi x what is the
what is the see this lettuce type that I
have sorry I love this this zoom
conversation where you're like yeah you
can read it the little tag on a teacup
or whatever but what about when you're a
great distance away from your subject
and you're like let me just take a photo
from 400 feet away like that's that's
really cool like a gigantic silver ball
across a glue gun the reason for huge
megapixel count is not to output huge
images because we know that even four or
five megapixel images can be printed out
as posters it's because it's using that
huge sensor in order to zoom into it so
the whole reason for huge megapixel
count is the zoom itself right right
right I just find it interesting that
nobody's done it on a camera but you
have you have the optical zoom for on a
human camera you don't need that on if
you don't need you only need huge sensor
on a phone because you don't have the
room unless of course you want to be
like Samsung and make a camera phone
okay but that's the thing I think that's
the point I'm trying to make okay so
yeah 20x zoom on the Galaxy camera how
much do you have on this 41 megapixel
camera Tony so I think up the six
depending on the mode you are using
because you can choose at least on the
808 from either 85 or 3 megapixel images
so if you make a calculation from 40 128
or 25 or two three it's gonna be a zoom
up to i think four six and eight
something like that interesting i just
can I just make the point that stephen
alive just called out three of his
employees for for being in the sauna in
the middle of the day because he was out
on a boat taking a photo from them by
like a half mile away with the 1020
you fire them what's that no no no no I
hear them chuckles and he said they will
live in infamy so I guess there they are
still employed it was awesome so this
Amatil this is just a exciting thing I'm
not gonna lie i i'm not a huge windows
on fan but I'm kind of like geeking out
over this thing me too honestly same
here I i we were talking with Tony I
mean if the price is right i'd be
willing to pay for it doesn't look like
the phrases on the new camera software
it zooms it it has a camera like a pro
camera app or something yeah yes
releasing a pro camera app with the
Lumia 1020 I want this uh we're good
okay we're getting some comments on the
post right now and for 482 if you're
confused whether to watch the live
stream or us please watch us what we're
telling you what's on the livestream
anyways yeah yeah looks like they have
some kind of on the fly rotating and
cropping on and yet it's a like what's
in the frame will be cropped if you
press a so guys the the Lumia 925 which
I have here is a built-in with this
nokia smart cam application and i'm
having problem with the focus there it
is it's the night smart camera it's it's
a lens and it will come to other Lumia
phones to with the amber update now this
lumia 1020 will come with a dedicated
broke am application so that's going to
be interesting hmm and here's what one
of one or both of these camera apps
include the ability to tell you what
shooting mode you're in so that you
don't spend all day shooting back like
mode the night mode like I always do on
all of my nokia phone alena I'm gonna
ask like the stupidest blondest question
on the planet um how come nobody's ever
figured out how to load android on a
Windows Phone and then we could probably
tinker with this phone kernels yeah I'm
gonna show the reason because they
talking about that I'll bring you some
popcorn butter no it's the wrong because
they run the same hardware or they're
both capable running the same hardware
but you don't have a kernel source for
different hardware that company is
talk about the pot pie yeah honey yeah I
was about to say I mean that the hd2 is
able to run just about everything even
windows 95 so hey hey why not run this
do you have dust under the lens of your
iPhone 5 I did on the one that I swapped
earlier yes of course he swaps I don't
talk the phone so this one doesn't have
any dust but i did get dust on the other
one that's disgusting why would get dust
on it that's a good question man this is
a beautiful sapphire lounge it is
impossible actually fire a team-high
said it's the purity and intense
position in this design does not allow
for these types of things well what
stack I don't know why I'm having a huge
deja vu watching this this event here on
my left with the with the event I
watched in 2012 I think for the nokia
808 it's it's almost the exact same tone
and did they do did they do the needle
in a haystack Tony not this Shelly but
the image is the placement everything
seems to be spot-on god it's so it makes
sense presentation I would take a devil
of a hectic hey you're missing the point
hi may like it was like an just waiting
for for the the Titanic kid to come out
and falling off of boats and dying so
what's his name the titanica the he's so
dreamy come on work with me here
Leonardo are you know okay yeah the
Titanic it oh they're talking about an
idea bro camera the application which we
mentioned earlier and there's also this
is exciting mm-hmm and it is a dedicated
special camera application so it won't
use the windows phone camera application
you will be using probably the Nokia
application for peer review stuff and
the windows phone camera application for
simple shots my guess that's cool that's
cool that's that's cool I mean I hate
people like the windows phone UI for for
taking photos I don't I always confuse
myself and slide back to the old
photos you do yeah oh are you okay
that's something my mother would say but
it's faster what are they picture of
here looks like Luke Skywalker sitting
on a flower you taking a picture yeah
like a creature in the middle of a
flower but what's interesting is I just
saw you ha get a little too close to the
to the flower and it looks like this
thing has the same exact focal length as
like the 920 because I've you always try
and get it which is which is a lot of
one it well it's not bad i mean it's
it's it's about on par with anything
else but oh they lie the difference is
graphing circular like having like
exposure control that you can that
surrounds it earlier where we seen that
recently on all samsung camera thing
yeah you know what but samsung puts on
like you know the physical stuff like
that you know the the skeuomorphism with
the rings and the physical thing i think
this is all very you know is translucent
you ILM's that look better I think I
it's a mate it's really a good idea that
they're doing like this live demo
because this guy who's playing with the
camera obviously is an engineer who like
built the software and it's just seeing
seeing it in front of you know not notes
glitzy video it seeming persons I can't
believe you can change the focus on the
fly that's awesome I manually changing
focus with the software right now oh
like well actually they were doing that
10 seconds ago no that's amazing I think
that's the first time I've seen that
with on a smartphone maybe I don't pay
attention here no you're right i haven't
seen that either there's an app i use on
the iphone that does it but it does it
very poorly all right yeah i have to
actually have to jump off but it was
cool hanging out i didn't expect to be
here but we love a good luck man send
our hearts to the newest minimun will do
to make your man good luck you will soon
man you'll still fight over whomever
gets to review the 1020 we always that's
been decided already yeah right alright
what my mom's that list hi man welcome
to the bottle washers club our
that's like painting with it with some
for second exposure always dad what's
going on trippy hesitant about defensive
that's interesting because the longest
exposure time on the 808 PureView is 3.1
or three-point-something second so they
must have ah they rode out 1020 that
dies how cute I of course we can
recording is in with the new microphones
which is always good I'm not sure
whether you find good use of it or not
see what they should have written out
was you know you want this but anyway so
that's more than four seconds exposure
time I don't know I do want this phone I
i was asking this question on on park on
a daily two days ago and i got like 300
comments of people that were like okay
this phone is all that i'd be willing to
pay forward and I I think that that that
speaks highly of what to expect for this
device hopefully look we get some narrow
doing none of your recording the video
demo right now yeah oh yes hey how is
audio on that 808 PureView tony was
recording video it's good i think the
808 PureView had the first the first was
the first nokia phone with bridge
recording so it was good you can
literally stay 10 feet away from from a
I don't know stage where we're at band
is playing a concert and it will not be
distorted at all so what what you hear
the camera here's and that's what he'll
hear back from the recording but it's
not i'm not sure how many times now here
you will be in a situation where you
take advantage of that mmm now it's it's
stereo audio or or Ramona oh it's burial
yeah it's the real really yeah but it's
only it's only one microphone meaning if
you're panning around like it doesn't
it's not like three microphones yeah
yeah but do you hear it do you hear that
difference as you move the camera around
yeah but if I had my fingers like this
then you absolutely hear this the stereo
effect really yep interesting that is
sexy now dealer a so we've got nokia
smart camera we've got creative studio
we've got panorama and we've got photo
beamer what the hell is photo Beemer
Beemer is that that not
getting which allows you to send upload
an image online and share it like that
to some with somebody else dealer you're
not a huge win this it's really easy it
wouldn't you establish the link between
the phone and whatever browser you're
using you just swipe on the phone and it
immediately mirrors it's like display
mirroring for photos it's actually
really awesome oh it like generates a QR
code in your web browser you take a
picture of it and that's how it links
and then just boom race salute you are
not a huge windows phone fan would the
Lumia 1020 be enough for you to consider
having a windows phone as your daily
driver that's uh that's a tough question
they're thinking about it and I'm
thinking about how am I going to do
google hangouts on there because I use a
lot of Google Hangouts that's how I'll
talk about the most of my friends now um
and google voice which I could get but I
mean there are a lot of different things
that the windows phone doesn't have and
I'm back to carrying two phones what
would ultimately happen is probably I
would I use my iphone basically for a
camera so I probably get rid of it and
get the 10 20 and carry like the note 2
in the 1020 so is the iphone that suffer
out yeah it would replace the iphone for
me i think is there's not much i do with
the iphone other than take pictures
Michael fill us in what's happening
we're seeing the demo of the Nokia here
sweet just basically the position for
his transition from talking about the
camera to talking about the ecosystem I
think we have 165,000 apps on the
Windows Store now and but we're talking
about kind of augmented reality in the
here suite and it looks just as kind of
clumsy as ever it's pretty but I don't
know augmented reality has has yet to
help me out in a real world situation I
remember being very excited about it
like five years ago and now I'm like
yeah what city lens hey look there's a
mcdonalds if I turn this way oh wow yeah
if I walk straight through this building
i remember be no show i remember being
so excited about that city lens feature
for for the Lumia when it was an out
like a year ago or two and then I
noticed that Yelp had been doing that
for a while already so oh well I don't
see it is there it is nice there is a
gliding sure that every much it works
offline like that's that's a that's a
pretty pretty solid features have been
it Stephen Elop is announcing something
all of the your features are coming to
all Lumias and we knew that yeah that's
okay or or Lumias didn't they did
negotiate to all windows phones period
yeah I thought I thought here I was
about to say all the hair sweet exists
yeah the new SDK for image sensing
developers ah so they are back to the
Yammer image so they will be opening up
probably some API so third-party
applications can can utilize the
PureView camera through yep nokia smart
camera broke camp and not through the
standard Windows Phone 8 camera
application yeah with it not possible
imaging it yet and then you go through
the typical chicken or the egg problem
of there not being enough Lumia 1020's
in the market for developers to be
interested yeah you got a blah I don't
know I don't know I don't I don't think
that's gonna be as much of a much of a
problem here I think you're gonna see a
nokia or Microsoft incentivize
developers to build some really some
pretty cool stuff yeah CNN is is already
like co-writing this yeah they're gonna
line them up on the screen here of
course I'm Way behind you there Durkin
they come on Michael they've been
incentivizing developers ever since the
inception of Windows Phone 7 and hasn't
taken off what are you deliver giving
away I don't know I don't know what my
form you're using when you say these
things if you're talking about
blackberry I get you because there's
nothing I'm like oh man I can't find
anything I'm looking for and then like
our bus which over the windows phone I'm
like oh wow Hey look I can do almost
anything I want to do is it an iphone
now but it there's enough there well
there's a lot of stuff that I need on a
daily basis that windows phone doesn't
have as well just say probably son my
google bubble I agree with you but I
don't like I can if I can do that so
that's but that's the thing I mean in
pocket now we're pretty much stuck
within the Google bubble as
of our work I have our work routine so
if I problems wrongly against it no I
like it I i was i was always strongly
pro it now that that is true would you i
read that editorial right i want them
windows from that gets along with
google's back end but man i'll put up
with it for some of this especially for
the device like this i will
inconvenience myself and I wonder if I'm
alone I don't think I had that's what I
carry two phones I I guess the biggest
problem Michael is this windows phone is
three years old and we were having you
remember we wrote this editorial a
couple of days ago I forget the name of
it but there's somebody made this
compelling comment about the fact that
when those phone is now five percent of
the market share the problem is that iOS
is thirty-eight percent and then Android
a 60 something percent and so you have
you have the problem where you're like
okay if windows phone has barely grasped
five percent of the market in three
years how long would it take Windows
Phone to reach a 20-percent principe
compelling another six years know if
you're building the share on on a like
consistent ramp than yes but if you take
into account the increased the
accelerated growth that has been
evidenced recently in markets outside of
America uh it's not going to take that
long and listen I'm not intriguing
overall shared necessarily as a consumer
right I just want to write this in Urdu
to death it's also a marathon it's not a
sprint I mean it's not like we it's not
like Windows Phone has to be twenty
percent tomorrow if it's not 60 gonna
get it takes six years I mean okay but
the problem with that is that developers
keep using that excuse to not adopt it
that's the price watching this which
young The Ugly Kid battery cover which
ex as he probably what a wireless
charging thingy just like on the Lumia
925 oh god no please yeah I mean I like
say no I won't get that had that yet I
feel like they had enough room in though
no that's the camera grip nice see that
no it's just what I want you know look
at that it's a wireless charging show oh
but it's also a spare battery and it's
also a camera grip that looks like it
you know you got a phone that's so big
you need to bubble up
back anyway just flatten out the back
and put in a freaking wireless charging
coil why is this hard completely an exit
you if you can fit wireless charging in
the nexus 4 you should be able to fit
wireless charging in that phone agreed
so guys I have a question I don't know
why but I actually like this I actually
like the fact that I if I don't need
wireless charging which almost probably
never use I don't you know I I'd rather
not have the extra bulk that's me excuse
me I'll throw up in my mouth a little
bit yes here's that looks so incredibly
frustrating cuz they're just gimping
that feature that when when it was
announced on the nine tony was was one
of those awesome set off so it was like
look here's something cool and
futuristic and yeah it was going to be a
tough sell to people and not everyone's
gonna care about it but at least it's
something that's integrated you don't
have to think about it now this is like
I have to get a shell if you could put
this thing on a sled the pan I don't
know about you guys but out of the AT&amp;amp;T
store with a wireless charging plate I
mean I don't know why this is a hard
thing that's not hard to set if you if
you if you include the wireless charging
plate which a teensy did ralph de la
vega's on stage and i just want to hear
that this phone is not exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T
please please I'll be nice yes please
Michael are you listening what is he
saying I'm listening but he's not even
on stage yet in my in my world I'm
listening okay please please do not make
for Michael gets it on please I beg you
I beg you not exclusive phone nobody's
gonna be able to take this I'm not gonna
be waiting until next year to get this
phone come on it's so funny how
different ralph de la Vega sounds than
Steven ela like they have like the most
opposing voices ever it's so fun this
yeah yeah please come on do not make
this a phone don't come on come on not
an exclusive phone not our spending at
all good I think it's gonna be I really
liked the camera group though it's a
good idea really like the camera
throwing some real Tim battery and a
shutter button and a tripod mount yeah I
like it that for me that's like an
accessory that I would buy a AT&amp;amp;T is
super excited to be the exclusive US
carrier for the 1020 yo oh gosh most of
us carrier hang us carrier but it
doesn't matter there's two
exclusive yeah it still hasn't learned
that being an exclusive is awful was
that I realized you analyze this for a
second what other options do they have
because if they over Eisen and sprint
they have to change the entire internal
so the other option would be just
tmobile and that just not viable enough
oh yeah only they could help that is
never with wait a second at all you know
one of the time we have the same chipset
on the galaxy s4 and on the galaxy note
2 then on the CDMA there and it's pretty
much the same phone I think the
technology has evolved to the point
where you can match two things on the
same device yeah but no I don't think
that with there's more to it windows
phone has tricked hardware requirements
both for chipsets and for everything
else but the haylor we're gonna say
something yeah i was gonna point out the
iphone 5 has exact same specs on both
ends its exact same phone one running
seed nikon run oh no it's actually three
different units the only one that's
actually the same device is the iphone
for us true but don't forget guys that
both on the iphone and on samsung phones
they are using custom built chips and
you can't do that on windows phone
because windows phone has hardware
requirements for OEMs for
standardization across flat across the
devices and OEMs right but we've seen
that it's possible to make effectively
the same device like in the Lumia 920 in
the 928 across a little bit yeah the
Lumia 928 is a device that will give you
I think does it give you LT on AT&amp;amp;T
Michael oh yeah I can pop an AT&amp;amp;T sim in
there and it works fine yeah yeah yeah
but do you get LTE or is it just hspa+
you get it yeah LT see is that it is
possible it is completely possible this
is just a damaged lucem deal worried
right yeah AT&amp;amp;T is just pouring money on
this and Nokia's bleeding for money
right now but here's the thing I that
may be it also there was that talk that
we've had a couple times about when we
complained about the 920 being an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive and there was some talk that
we'd never were able to really verify
that the 920 was a rider on the 900
contract like when Nokia signed up with
AT&amp;amp;T they were like this includes the
920 as well so I wonder I do wonder if
this is some kind of secret exclusivity
deal that was signed like two years
when the world was different I don't
know well whenever whenever Microsoft
and nakia shook hands back two years ago
or three was it I think two years ago
there was this entire huge buzz when
Windows launched and Microsoft put it
out with huge bold letters that AT&amp;amp;T is
the premier carrier for Windows stone
and ever so okay ever since came it app
we lost timing probably one of the
things that pissed me off the most about
this whole AT&amp;amp;T exclusivity as the
launch partner for windows phone 7 is
how many retailers would you go into an
AT&amp;amp;T store three years ago and would
tell you buy a windows phone nobody was
doing that but it didn't either they
didn't even have active units in the
stores man they had dummy units that was
like the stupidest launch strategy that
Microsoft could have ever conceived and
it's happening right now again this is
anybody oh these people don't get it
they don't get it competitors will be
available in pre-ordering on AT&amp;amp;T you
can do it on July sixteenth it'll be
available this quarter for China Europe
and Latin America listening mmmm this
quarter all right so we got like two
months that's that's as far as end of
September well q3 just begun so that's
like yeah the coming weeks they're
doubling down I'm not going to review
this after all uh 380 with the grip
package 30 so it's an acadia occasion I
cute a dollar on it listen IOSCO go and
Taylor said grip package yeah any word
on the no contract price nothing I can
ask nothing in I can ask someone hold on
yeah ask that someone please I look if
she just sent me an email okay I should
just send me an email too what's the
deal here no okay so they are starting
Q&amp;amp;A right now for
any man 20 ladies it's matt black really
wear yellow it's matt finish none not
shiny 00 yellows the mess options well
it's awesome ok I think that's like the
first yellow phone that I'll ever buy
seriously I think this is why don't they
have the Scion out as you want it well
why do you have a wide alluvion yes i
have a white lumia 920 come i didn't
want the white when i bought it because
they only had the white ones in the
retail stores a white or red or black
and I was like well I'll go for the
least ugly one that one's mad all right
sir it's not mad no the white is on
piano white yeah piano what if I don't
hey right now they're having it they're
having a Q&amp;amp;A session at the event and
it's you know the live stream is
actually a little bit slow i guess this
pretty much I guess the event is over
pretty much I mean before we wrap it up
either Taylor or Michael or anybody else
do we have a rundown of the full spec
list the official spec list because back
in the rumor days or the rumor hours I
think I think that's Stephen already
posted it on I'm looking for it right
now can we do a recap of all those just
to see exactly the official wording and
what what this phone is all about aside
from the camera yeah you guys have the
press release Taylor yeah I'm filtering
is right now but it's just all scattered
everywhere we got 4.5 inch amoled
puremotion hd+ at 1280 by 768 16 by 9
Rilla glass three hey 0 and 0 guys first
Windows Phone to include AT&amp;amp;T locker how
about that oh wow yeah wow what a cool
oh let's see what else do that and then
we got along there's the camera stuff
impressive imaging capabilities
obviously a 1080p video 30 frames per
seconds six times closer with the
lossless zoom and 720p resolution 720 @
7 20 yeah what are the storage options i
mean you know one of the things that
this camera thing
the camera accessory is nesting is
expandable storage he didn't really put
up an amazing way that's a solid point
and that's that's amazing I mean if they
would have added that camera hump I
would have been perfect now this would
have been the perfect phone I mean how
many photos can you actually take it
thirty eight megapixels with what the
typical storage that you get right now
not not too much I'm telling you those
images are as high as 10 15 Meg's so
yeah I just hope this is what 32 gigs
what it's definitely got to be at least
32 I mean I wish it right he says 32
gigs of built-in storage thank you okay
all right I just dropped a link in the
chat I drop okay drop the case here
you'll be able to carry you want to
check out what we're looking at it 18
t.com / lumia 1020 for anybody ATT /
okay so how do gourd how do we feel
about this how do we feel about this
guy's Taylor what are you thinking
what's on your mind right now I'm
actually okay so I I was swooning over
the Lumia 900 I couldn't wait to get it
and that was probably one of the biggest
letdowns I've ever had my entire life
ever I didn't like it it was pretty
awful and the camera was terrible
because the software problems that had
but I'm really kind of I wanted to try
an 808 and I never really got the chance
I've never touched one so I can't wait
to see this I will probably buy this and
try to use it as my personal device um
supplementing with Android but other
than that yeah price aside i'll probably
still buy it mr. Fisher was on your mind
you know I I'm gonna sound like a like a
real jerk for saying this and I'm gonna
get this thing all right I there's no
question I can see myself taking awesome
pictures with this despite my status as
an amateur photographer I really really
am excited about it still but guys I'm
bent out of shape about this blue thing
I know it's stupid to be annoyed what
about the phone knocking off and wait
we got we're nokia right he started the
whole colorized revolution like don't
you have a little bit of a
responsibility to like continue it
because we saw the 920 launch in five
different flavors and I was excited
there's not a cool tone in this lineup I
don't like my electronics and warm tones
red and yellow I don't get it i do
ketchup and mustard fine else another my
technology I want blue you know I even
mean I don't care uh whatever i'll
settle for the white one if they don't
give us a sign but i am really annoyed
about this come back to me from well if
you remember that the the Lumia 920 what
was it launched in cyan initially it
took about a month for the phone to be
like and then it was online only that's
why I have the white one so I agree I
mean you're right there could be but I'm
not gonna wait right I'm gonna get it on
launch day so what I need to see okay
tell you what III get it review it get
it in wipe reviewed and then ship it to
me okay all right mr. Adam bad what's on
your mind you have that shiny yellow
Lumia 920 I do have a shiny yellow Lumia
920 ah it's it's a it looks like a great
camera um and you know I obviously I use
the phone as a daily driver so you know
that's not an issue for me um it looked
i don't i meet the you know like i said
in a piece just recently I have a
mortgage i'm not sure i have an extra
three hundred dollars to drop on a phone
right now but it's definitely it's
definitely on the Christmas list if
nothing else so yeah daddy wants so i
got no contract pricing yay 699 Oh much
what is it 659 for no contract 659
that's that's acceptable wait you double
the price I don't come on track cool
it's a me at heine agree that this is
acceptable you see prices for all off
absolutely oh my god the iphone a 16 gig
iphone 5 or 6 56 59 is a reasonable
price 649 very reasonable price
absolutely i can if i can jump in a guy
from mashable just asked a question
about why they didn't include wireless
charging without the attachment Stephen
Elop kind of gave a can't answer that
says they're very still
I committed to what I was charging but
he gave the space constraints not excuse
but excellent explanation so that's very
honest that's an exit but he did finish
up on the point that they still are
going to be including wireless charging
in some form okay okay okay okay let me
let me show you the difference between
why was charging and not on wireless
charging right now I don't just yet in
this place the phone on a big pad is no
okay you don't get it oh go join the
trolls and a comment I know you don't
get it no no I don't know here's my job
let me show you don't just okay girl
have shows good jokes you you have to
place it on it on a big pad for it to
charge right so all you have to do is
leave that wireless charging accessory
on top of the pad and then you come with
the phone you snap it in and they kept
it out way or no really yeah you're
right yeah super glue accessibly right
to the pad yeah I don't let it doesn't
claim that you know that's not at all I
great stock right that's not at all like
I'm pink no no come on I'm so I'm so I
don't care about wireless charging now
look at Tony Tony you were not you and I
don't care about it we knew that that
thing was never gonna take of it's a
cool thing I would love it in my car I'd
love to go into my car and just put the
phone in the mid pad and have it charged
but just just the fact that I have to
carry a wireless accessory that's the
size of my freakin microphone just makes
it just makes it pointless for me that's
me so I I don't mind would you mind if I
kind of shift the conversation real
quickly and bring up something I don't
think we've talked about yet I'm just
looking at the official spec sheet at on
nokia's site here and anybody want to
take a stab at the weight of this thing
I think it's about what it is it's a
hundred it's a hundred and fifty eight
grams yeah that's not bad at all man I
mean that like the Lumia 920 was 185
grams and that was a tank you know why
Michael yeah well both a wireless
charger there's no wireless charger
right get serious know what tonight
because I think Nokia screwed up big
time they included the same two thousand
million power battery as they included
in the 920 on the 925 on the 920 and
this camera will suck on that battery
big time did you get the camera grip on
the line powers yeah it is two thousand
million pairs the three point eight
volts it's the same internals as all the
other looky Lumia nine something school
has they definitely didn't talk about
that yeah yeah rush over that one I have
two points to make their the wireless
charging adapter is eighty dollars I
believe yeah yeah even though we have
you get a spare banner you get a spare
battery no that was an immigrant I don't
know the price of the photon no it's the
same thing that thing is a wireless
charger it's a camera grip and it's a
battery right but i think that was
separate wireless charger there's a
separate one that's just a wireless
charging slide yeah there's two heads
but you can do is charging on the s4 by
what a ten-dollar add-on accessory or
five dollars earn five dollars and
convert a different mic that's a big
difference michael taylor i have a
question for you guys a good question
because i know a great great thing on
the 808 PureView is the ND filter does
the 1020 have the ND filter in the specs
or in the press release or anywhere else
because it's super super useful and
bright sunny outdoors did you take devan
CMD and the Yandy fielder it is a signal
from birdies in delta now it's just
November Delta Brian uh no III didn't
say I having say that neutral neutral
density filter it's basically sunglasses
for your camera whenever okay that
whenever the light is too bright it
automatically on the 808 snaps out that
that darkening filter and you get so it
looks like a couple sites have posted
posted some rumors that the camera will
include an ND filter yes but there's I'm
not seeing any confirmation on that from
a legit site the camera is the same as
the one on the 808 it should have the ND
filter yeah gsmarena is reporting that
it has an ND filter good good good no i
have nokia spec sheet but yeah
yeah well let me country music right our
then I believe the event is over the
event is over the event is over on Tony
what what are your thoughts on this
phone are you getting it I am definitely
getting it and I am going to get it as a
replacement for my good old 808 PureView
I I'm getting it because i'm a geek of
camera phones but i think and people are
going to hate on me for saying this that
the lumia 1020 will mean nothing for
nokia will mean nothing for AT&amp;amp;T and
will mean nothing for windows phone
because it addresses a very very small
portion of the market a niche audience
target audience which are us the geeks
or the prosumer camera users so I think
it's gonna be a group of concept phone
like the 808 PureView some of us will
have it but it will be far from being
the best selling Lumia out there I'll
just rig I i I'm gonna disagree as well
I'm gonna disagree as well I mean I'm
right now okay let me put let me point
this to you the only reason why i have
an iphone 5 meaning why is the iphone 5
so big for me in comparison to other
phones is because i like the camera
honestly uh and for me I think that like
Taylor was saying right now if we are
used to carrying two phones than the
Lumia 1020 is gonna be a good device to
carry as your camera phone aka personal
phone and then we just use any other
android phone our work yes I agree with
your disagreement but you are a geek I
bet your wife my girlfriend or Michael's
girlfriend or whomever wife or
girlfriend doesn't really know the
difference between an eight megapixel
camera on the Lumia 925 or 920 and a 41
megapixel camera on a 1020 why do I need
that you can't go wrong my my girlfriend
would know the difference but yeah yeah
you know license that Apple made such a
big you know made such a big meteor
trials because they showed consumers
what they wanted before consumers know
they knew they wanted it so this is the
first this is the well okay that first
phone but it's the set it's the first
phone that has a chance of being popular
to have this 41 mega thing
camera with this lossless zoom so you
start showing soccer moms that you can
take a picture of your kids scoring a
goal from 400 feet away with no more
leverage point nobler nobler exactly
with nope okay okay I'll talk outside
I'll tell you this I would agree with
you Tony of this phone costs thousand
dollars but the fact that this phone
costs exactly the same as a galaxy note
2 and exactly the same as an iphone 5
off contract is clearly pointing out
that this is not a niche device or at
least oak is not seeing it that way
they're trying to turn a neat feature
into something that's mainstream and I
think that it is a solid point I think
that they're doing a great job I you
know I do have concerns over the battery
life I do have concerns over the AT&amp;amp;T
exclusivity but to be honest with you I
am phone hi this is like the first
Windows Phone that I'm like yes I want
it I want this thing a more example for
me I was go ahead good I was just about
this American friends correct me if I'm
wrong three hundred dollars on any AT&amp;amp;T
contract isn't this about the most
expensive phone on AT&amp;amp;T lineup yes
absolutely after all so it's right up
there with the note 2 i'm no tears
there's your niche price yeah okay Tony
what the adonian Tony the Cybermen what
if you want a 32 gig iphone 5 it's $300
great if you want to go to doctors yeah
it's not a dollar so i think that the
price is right i think that their
pricing it not too aggressively to not
have that you know focal point of this
is a cheap phone and not too not too
expensive to be like okay no i'd rather
buy an iphone i think that they are
pricing it right i doing feel that that
well I'm sorry one thing that does
guarantee mean though is the three
hundred dollar price point is above the
32 gigabyte s4 and above the HTC one
yeah and by a hundred dollars so hope
there is that I'm sorry I'm sorry can
you really compare the camera on the s4
with this thing absolutely I'm saying no
when you compare the s4 to the Nokia
Lumia night 1020 I mean that's you know
your what your if you if you're if
you're exclusively looking at can
no there's no shot but if you're looking
at complete ecosystem the s4 is a very
compelling and so is the HTC One both
very compelling devices for fifty and a
hundred dollars less yes but years off
you go ahead go ahead Taylor most
smartphone buyers here in America
especially the soccer moms the people
who aren't geeks not prosumers are
looking for the best phone for the best
price not necessarily just the best
phone they're looking for a deal they're
looking for the s4 they're looking for
the s3 even as you're saying sorry
they're looking for something that's
great that has a great camera but
nothing doesn't necessarily have to be
the best thing on the market there are
very few people out there who were like
I need the absolute best right now
that's the progress Nokia's biggest
problem right now is showing people why
they need of lossless zoom camera so if
they can do that if they can do that
effectively then maybe they can move
some of these things yeah if I tell
someone hey this phone has a lossless
suit camera they're like what does that
mean my camera zooms they don't care
that when they zoom in that it looks
like crap they do it anyway good time
for your rating is not the entire event
and all I've been hearing from from some
of the screen shots which I'm seeing
here in pictures is is about talk about
the lossless zoom did they ever at the
event drop anything about the down
sampling technology I mean if what if I
don't want to use you what if I would it
out sample images did they gather better
briefly they do but but you know just
you just touched on it you know I think
they were really focused on showing the
product of the of the camera not the
technology behind it but yeah I talked
about that right early on when he the
same time in the same breath is talking
about the 34 and 38 megapixel full res
shots yeah I talked about the seven
pixel doubling or whatever it is seven
to one is that what it is it depends on
resolution yet right yeah yeah so mark
out I'm gonna ask you a quick I'm gonna
ask you a quick question Michael um for
example you've pretty much reviewed
almost every one of the phones that have
been launched this year um I would you
agree with me that the s4 would be
nothing without all the marketing push
that it has I mean
you compared it to the one uh and and
now comparing it to this 10 20 I mean if
you didn't have all the marketing push
that you see from Samsung would you
Michael Fisher be compelled to get one
or would you be like know that 1020 is a
good option what is on what is on your
mind I think I need to make the make the
risky point that it would not be
compelling to me even with all the
marketing push behind it the s4 is just
not a not a compelling device to me
personally but no at the s4 is building
on a on a on a dynasty that Samsung is
made is built around this galaxy title
so yeah no I think it's riding on the
coattails of previous successes a bit
yeah but you know I that's certainly I
mean that's a really really difficult
juggernaut for anyone to take on and
we're seeing that and everyone else's
you know struggles as they try and match
samsung but do we think are you are you
asking in the context of like the 10
1020 vs the s4 like how they're gonna
yeah I do you think that you think that
the 1020 stands a chance of it had
better more a better marketing push than
we've seen before actually that that's
the answer i was going to give earlier
when i was still going to answer the
question that came a while ago like yeah
i think that if this thing is positioned
properly it stands a good chance of both
increasing the awareness of Windows
Phone and pulling nokia out of its
slightly out of its slump I don't think
it's a initiative ice I think its
pricing is not going to help it
certainly but it's not going to be the
808 again I mean it runs a much more
popular platform it it's going to be
sold in the United States for one yeah
but you know what I don't care what else
you say if you if you say windows phone
is not a more popular platform than
symbian and I know mean numbers that has
a future and it's running a platform
that a lot of people that I think still
has a lot of legs under it for people
who've never really mean it except on a
commercial you know I think I think what
what what that 41-megapixel sensor is
gonna do it's gonna get people in the
store to pick this thing up and maybe a
lot of people that have never picked up
a windows phone before and sure half of
them gonna put it right back down Brian
dealing with this but the other half are
gonna be like this is compelling I
actually like this I never would have
thought of a windows phone before and
then we'll see yeah I have a question
for you
good at if if you were if you were
suggesting a phone to the most basic
user your mom your grandparents whoever
it is what would you suggest one ATT
would the nokia lumia 1020 be at the top
of that list i don't think it would know
yeah that's the point that's the point
ways hmm i don't know about the device a
device has to have a ten out of ten
granny score in order to be successful
is that no no no no that's not the point
I'm trying to make I'm trying to make
the point that most general consumers
are going to go for the device that kind
of covers all the bases and the galaxy
s4 kind of has that to it it's manage
the the replaceable battery expandable
storage which I will buy to the grave
that it really doesn't matter all that
much people still care um you purchased
it has Jaime Jaime sayonara phone still
talking about mom and pop or are we
talking about because I feel like we
would jump there I feel like I don't get
the jet yeah hey I checked the chat
ladies and gentlemen I think we have to
wrap up we've been on the air for an
hour or something already oh okay if I
ever to ask one last question just a
real quick rapid-fire for all the other
folks here yeah let you have five
seconds okay lumia 1020 bad for android
bed for iOS bad for both bad for neither
go needs art with Tony neither it won't
matter neither it's not at that point
yet it's not at that point yet it's i
think that the mark anyway so it'll have
its own mark regardless of iOS or
android okay Michael Michael yeah I I
don't think it's going to hurt either of
those platforms yet but it may well in
the best-case scenario it will provide
the foundation for a future product of
mala one product to her exactly so it's
still important it's not handedly do it
though okay Taylor anytime yeah except
for my my feelings because I won't one
on Android okay like okay we have to
ride it it's been a pleasure talking
it's been a pleasure shot in sharing the
show floor with you guys obviously Adam
Lane is right now at the event so expect
a lot of hands-on videos of the spell
and obviously Adam is a professional
photographer so is it was very important
for us to actually send that in to this
event so that he could take a real stab
at trying to compare this phone as much
as he could so wait for the hands-on
coverage of everything that's going to
happen with this phone I am I never be
that I want to buy this is the first
Windows Phone that I would ever want to
buy and it'll probably will be the case
of Michael can't give me a review unit
yeah okay so thank you very much for
watching thank you very much for sharing
your thoughts obviously there will be a
lot of editorials from us on our
thoughts on this phone I think we have a
mixed bag of thoughts right now we all
want it but then again you know the
question is is it really going to push
Windows Phone to the next level that's
yet to be seen and I think that it's
going to be shown mostly on the other
way around meaning is Windows Phone
really going to show enough leverage for
this phone to actually survive so
anyways thank you very much for watching
everybody thank you very much for
joining us and we will see you very soon
on our thoughts and threats let us know
what you think in the comments down
below as well as any closing thoughts I
think you just close out their james's
it oh yeah done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
