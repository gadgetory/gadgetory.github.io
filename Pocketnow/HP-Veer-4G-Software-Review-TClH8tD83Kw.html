pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna talk about the software on the
tiny miniscule HP veer 4G let's get to
it okay so I've got both the pre 2 out
and the veer 4G because we're going to
compare them the the pre 3 has a faster
processor 1 gigahertz with 512 megabytes
of RAM whereas the veer 4G has an 800
megahertz processor with the same amount
of RAM so presumably the pre 3 should be
faster than the veer 4G in fact it
should be the fastest webOS device out
there right now until we get the pre 3
which comes out in the summer which ups
the ante and across the board in terms
of specifications but until that comes
out we can compare against the Palm Pre
2 and they're both very spinny by the
way so you might see them spin a little
bit because they just have that kind of
tapered edge design that makes the edges
lift up so that there's a point of
contact in the center so anyhow we'll
turn these on and we're running sort of
the same kind of apps so we can do a
direct comparison and also see and get
an understanding for the screen
resolution of course webOS has that
fantastic notification system pops up on
the bottom when you don't want it you
just flick it away and boom the screen
expands to fit the entire area really
awesome notification system that hasn't
changed now on these devices we are
running on webOS version 2.1 on the pre
2 and 2 point 1 point 2 here on the vote
the veer 4G it's pretty much the same
version of webOS 3.0 is shipping on the
pre 3 but for now we have three two
point one to work with here so let's go
back to the home screens and of course
webOS has some really fantastic gestures
of really fresh interesting UI which
they've kept what kept up with since the
original pre and so what we have here is
really the same thing set up I've got
three of the same web pages in stacks
stacks are really great for grouping
together similar applications for
example web pages here and over to the
right there is a Google Maps entry and
we can see how smooth scrolling is oddly
it's choppy on both which is kind of
strange
they flip that card away and go into the
web browser so here we are on Amazon can
move around the page very smooth you can
tell that you get to see more on the
screen on the pre - because there's a
higher resolution 480 pixels is the
number you get 400 down on the veer for
cheap 480 down on the pre 2 so you get a
little bit more but it's really not that
big of a deal where it gets kind of
strange and this was the case with a
pixie is pinch-to-zoom
you really barely have any room to work
with here whereas on the 3.1 inch
display of the pre 2 you get a little
bit more in terms of screen space so
let's go back to the home screen and you
can flick off individual tiles there and
we can go into different websites pretty
smooth performance to zoom in a little
bit to get closer and so we can flick
all these off the screen and let's just
bring the veer 4G here now right now
we're over h plus we're over the HSPA+
network on AT&amp;amp;T let's run a speed test
to see what kind of speeds we get in
theory you should be able to get up to
about 14 megabits per second but AT&amp;amp;T
never claims to be able to provide that
according to them they're HSPA+ network
should be able to do about 6 megabits
per second down right now on a very good
day so if we swipe over to the right and
left and by the way these are all
customizable panels we can rename them
slide off the keyboard and call it you
know games if that were the case okay
and I have a games panel and this is all
new to - webOS 2.1 or particularly 2.0
and we can also slide along these
different items from screen to screen
you can have one screen for games one
screen for system settings and so on and
so forth so let's go down to some
benchmark utilities we have first one is
called net speed we're going to use two
of them because we don't have the
standard speedtest.net application that
we like to use when we test speeds on
PocketNow so I hit start we've got full
bars here and let's see what kind of
download speeds we get over HSPA+ so
this app is going to give us kind of a
low reading which is why we're gonna
test with another one we're getting
around one point one point three there
which is really 3G likes
speeds right it's not the faster HSPA+
speeds and the upload speed this app
actually doesn't even do upload speed or
I actually there there it goes
yeah but it doesn't really measure it
very accurately so we're gonna flick
this off the screen close that Abbe jump
into the other one called
net speed one that was overrated a
little bit better in the the webOS App
Catalog and it says we're over HSPA 4G
scroll down we can do speed test and
it's going to download a 10 megabyte
file we were doing the largest file size
possible to give the the data speed a
chance to throttle up which sometimes is
the case and it's almost done let's see
what we get here in terms of download
speeds very poor actually about 500
kilobits per second maybe less let's do
that again because that seems to have
been an anomaly and again it's running
cut back in a sec and the results were
that much better that time you know
about you know 520 kilobits per second
so not that great speeds on the veer 4G
not sure if this is because of
processing power because again AT&amp;amp;T is
showing us an h+ here and we're not
actually on the h+ network or on 3g that
could be the case that is our best guess
but don't expect to get blazing fast
speeds on the veer 4G it's got the 4G
branding to it but that doesn't really
mean much in this case as we're finding
so let's open up a bunch of cards here
and just kind of keep it going to see
how many cards we can add before things
get very slow real quick got a play game
of Angry Birds Angry Birds on the veer
for G's tiny screen is totally usable
but it's it's a little bit strange okay
so here we go and we're off this is the
free version anyway so I'm gonna leave
that running in the background because
this is webOS of course we can have
these cards open and let's open say the
dialer okay there's the dialer by the
way same as any other webOS device and
we can open the weather channel which
has
kulap the fat load while we do sky
climber kind of a bouncy like game and
keep going and see what we can do in
terms of getting this thing to to get
slow so we've got the camera open which
is always a little bit intense we can go
to the calendar just keep going here
open up different apps see what
performance is going to be like after we
have lots of apps open it's keeping up
quite nicely as you can see so let's
dive into a particular website we're
going to go up here and go to bookmarks
alright go to pocketnow.com we'll go to
the full version and see how long that
takes to load doesn't really make sense
to compare this against an Android phone
a lot of the Android phones now have
dual-core processors they're pretty darn
fast and it's loading right now and
actually gonna turn on Wi-Fi just so we
can get the fastest speed possible okay
there we go and we'll put that back
starting to slow down as you can see but
again we have a lot of apps open so it's
connecting to Wi-Fi it's thinking it's
trying to access pocket now and let's
close some cards that might actually
help it a little bit so we're pressing
the little capacitive button
so it's really not me to multitask this
heavy I mean most webOS users are going
to have maybe two or three apps open at
one time
in fact most webOS users that I know
will actually keep all apps closed at
all times just to keep the the battery
life as strong as possible and also to
make the device feel as fast as possible
so we're trying to load pocket now again
it looks like we're having some problems
with the server alright and we're back
we had to reboot the device it froze and
the internet connection kind of stopped
working so we're loading pocket now
right now we've got flash elements
turned off and we can kind of get a
sense for how long it takes to load
pocket and all this is the desktop
version it's kind of complex a lot of
images a lot of things to load you can
watch the little spinny thing here and
determine when it's ready
flick down the page quickly we get some
checkerboards unfortunately but it
eventually keeps up once the webpage is
loaded into memory we've no other apps
open right now just this particular
webpage which is loading of course while
it's loading we can jump into other apps
with webOS you can slide your finger up
from the bottom and open up a wide
variety of apps that you've added to
your dock the for apps not a wide
variety you only get a choice of four so
we'll stop it there and just move around
on the page and go into landscape
eventually one of these days so the the
veer is is still underpowered as you can
see it becomes unresponsive at times and
we just have one thing open here it's a
web page can pinch to zoom it's
relatively smooth it gets a little bit
choppy at times but overall pretty good
in terms of moving around on the screen
and we can put it as a card and then we
can flick it off the screen now let's
jump back into the application tray I
guess we could call and see what apps we
have pre-loaded here on the veer 4G most
of it is stock to webOS but there's some
added things from 18t like a teen teen
navigator which you have to pay for YP
mobile which you could have downloaded
from the App Catalog anyhow photo
gallery memos music kind of the standard
stuff and down here are a lot of things
that I have added good to see the New
York Times have an application in the
webOS Catalog speaking of the catalogue
let's jump into the catalog and see how
it is right now it's not nearly as big
it's a fraction of the size of the
Android App Store and of the iOS App
Store but it's it's getting there slowly
over time it's got most of the major
apps covered like New York Times like
Angry Birds like The Weather Channel
most of the major apps are covered
they're sort of the the more niche apps
you're not going to find in the palm app
catalog at this point because there just
haven't been enough webOS devices sold
to make developers excited about
developing for the web OS platform so
the app catalog the App Store is coming
along but it's still not there yet and
who knows if it will ever get there
beyond the built in apps webOS is
starting to feel a little bit dated it's
a mere 2 years old kind
in actually about a couple of days June
6 2009 was when webOS was was first
talked about and it wasn't until a
little bit later that the Prix came out
but compared to the other operating
systems out there you feel a little bit
limited I mean this paradigm of having
the app cards take place on your desktop
is a really cool feature but all of the
other operating systems can multitask in
a way that is more out of sight and out
of mind an Android you tap it hold the
home button in iOS you double tap the
home button you can quickly jump in and
out of applications the problem here is
that in webOS you can't use your desktop
your home screen for anything all you
have are these cards and for
applications and if you want to get to
more applications you have to jump into
the app tray most people use more than
four applications on a regular basis
maybe six of them or eight or ten and
with iOS and with Android you can put
them on your home screen and Android you
can add widgets and webOS all you get
are these cards now also new to webOS
2.0 but we saw this in in the pre two is
the just type so when you're on your
home screen some added functionality
here you slide out the keyboard and you
type you know iPhone right and it will
start searching everything whether it's
Google or Google Maps or applications on
your phone for iPhone which is a nice
little feature but you get the same kind
of thing in iOS if you swipe to the to
the right and in Android if you if you
go into the Google search widget it's
nothing new nothing that interesting
just a little piece of added
functionality so the experience on webOS
is good the menu system has always been
very elegant very nice in webOS it just
looks very polished and refined all the
sliders are pretty the toggle switches
look great the drop downs the way that
the operating system shows you where
you've tapped on the screen all is
really really nice it's just a matter of
evolving the software getting it to a
point where it's truly competitive not
only competitive but innovative when
compared against the other offerings out
there so webOS is what you expect it to
be on the HP veer 4G it's a little bit
slow it's doesn't fix that problem
of being laggy when it's loading a big
website or slowing down and you have a
lot of apps open it's a pleasant
operating system it's not made for power
users at this moment in time hopefully
when the pre three comes out that story
will change a little bit as that will
have more power under the hood we'll
have a full review of the veer 4G on
pocket now coming up soon if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
