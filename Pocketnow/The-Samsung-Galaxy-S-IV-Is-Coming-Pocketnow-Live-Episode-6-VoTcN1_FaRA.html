us about you how's uh I was at the
monument of this place where there's
this museum from through ye'll which is
actually a restaurant yeah I was
absolutely everywhere it's a very pretty
country guys I recommend you go it's a
beautiful place yes is it really nice
especially something angle because it's
they call it um the lungs of the country
because it's mainly trees everywhere
wherever you go there's trees gigantic
trees yes very it's very colonial yeah
it's really this better so tell us about
your phone what device to use I have the
HTC Sensation XL the reason why I
decided to use my laptop instead of my
phones because I'm just in case I wanted
to show it no I've been happinesses lat
december and i absolutely love it I mean
I'm an Android girl i love HTC in a love
Android just like joe i'm absolutely in
love with the OS of android know and we
like the fact that you like Andrew
usually girls go for iphones all the
time no not this one believed me not
this one the smart ones no Android yes
the only thing that have that is Apple
are the new um earbuds oh I'm using
those and I hate these things they
always fall off my earring well you're
obviously these fell of my ears all the
time and these are regular HTC
headphones that oh but you know those
HTC headphones actually sound really
good I think that out of all the
headphones that I've ever received on a
phone um they're the ones that sound the
best and that are least intrusive I
don't like any or headphones because for
some reason they always block the end so
so well i still i used to use skullcandy
the ones that go in inside your ear but
after a while I don't know it kind of
bothered my like the way I was hearing
stuff so I decided my friend told me
which is an Android junkie so he told me
you have to buy these trust me you're
not gonna regret it in honestly I really
like them they I've run with them and
they don't follow up at all oh so you're
into your into running 20 no yes nice
accent how many moms me how many miles
do you do a day or Kalama it's brimah
it's bragging time for Jaime right yeah
yeah I have just finally always having
this nonsense order okay I'll let me do
not subscribe to his facebook check that
up okay let me be honest here I was I am
actually still 28 pounds overweight um
and so I I started having these medical
conditions and what I used to do in high
school was running so I had to get back
into run
but man it's taken me so long I mean and
yeah the the years have a lot to do
right Tony yeah I not getting any
younger I started doing two miles for
about a month and that and now I'm able
to do up to six miles but it's taken me
a while to get there so tell me about
you well the way I run is this way I run
on so I cannot breathe so I don't count
miles or kilometers all right that's
good that good you know that's actually
the smartest way to run because you're
last you don't feel the stress of the
commitment that's great so the pressure
well I also had to lose weight because
my family runs um blood pressure and
cholesterol and a whole bunch of other
things and I had to drop I've dropped 32
pounds Wow congratulations man ain't you
good for you good for you not now tell
me what what tablet to use do you have
any tablet no I don't have a talent I'm
train took a guy that I get a you're
you're not missing out on much but that
tablet Z is actually very cool I mean
Tony you saw it right now at Eva betos
about it yeah it's michael michael was
head over heels when he saw i can agree
it is definitely a very nice design it
is thin it is like my only concern the
screen is excellent my only concern is
the android ecosystem and the
applications which are and are not at
the same time present on android so
that's about the only thing which is
holding me back from choosing a android
specific hardware because android
tablets are good specifications are good
it's the ecosystem which which gives me
a couple of question marks yeah i'm
actually getting the the the zoning
xperia ZL for review next week so i'm at
i really can't wait i mean i really like
that design on CS when I saw it so I'm
really looking forward to it but okay
let's let's talk about what you know
we're really here for we want to hear
from what you think or from what you
want on the galaxy s4 I mean what are
your predictions for the galaxy s4 what
do you want well honestly I don't I
never thought they could come up with
something better than they already have
I've heard a whole bunch of you are
rumors and stuff but I don't know
it's a thing that I'd rather wait cuz I
don't want to get all excited and hope
for something and then not get it I
think so far they have really good
phones I wanted for them to jump from
the polycarbonate plastic or whatever it
is because I like what my phone is kind
of heavy and I like phones that have
some weight on them because I used to
have a phone that was completely plastic
and one day I usually keep it in my
pocket one day I don't know what
happened I lost it I loved that phone
because you guys are still having like a
light weight on your pocket then yeah
when you don't feel you're like wait
wait a minute and it's been hours since
you lost your phone and forgot it
somewhere I'd rather have my phones nice
and heavy sad news as well come well
it's been a pleasure meeting you guys do
you have any questions for the nesa the
nesa is actually my Twitter sweetheart
she was a value make me a animated gif
of me doing my dance oh man I want to
see that how i well know danessa don't
you dare retweet that no I'm not every
Twitter he can go to lake twitter is
like you can you can ask this face for
the gift alright Venus I it's a real
pleasure meeting you and you're really
happy to have you here and I'm really
happy to follow you on twitter so again
a pleasure yeah well nice pleasure Tony
you take it from here pleasure bye-bye
vissa my uh no actually Joe's gonna take
it from here because he's next and i
will pick somebody after Joe and then
it's up please be so kind and and the
closest hang out so other people can
join in your free slot so sweet to me
that to pick the next person yes the
pressure well I'm gonna get two birds
with one stone oh yeah that's two people
in one so welcome aboard go ahead is
that is the way that is the way to have
a hangout I am so envious and you know
what is before I'm going to just
famously drop in here and say that I am
happy that now we have at least two
ladies joining the Hangout
actually never was the first and BB was
the second one and I just hope many more
tech girls will join us hang out and
back feet Joe right and back to me so so
let's turn the time over to you guys
introduce what what devices we're gonna
hear I assume two devices that you have
where you're from and what your favorite
smartphones houses what happens but not
the entire team is on the Hangout they I
think they presented their phones with
the occasion of every hang out this ever
he's got a 1 V with the chin and he's
got a he's got I forgot your phone for
guys or man i really i really like that
one v that chin design was really cool
and I'm sure you do too Joe I like chins
I like curves my phones but but anyway
what are you guys from we're here in
Indy Indy Indianapolis yeah okay so from
the United States not too far away for
me i'm out in utah still it's it's
raining today so all kinds of lovely did
you happen to wash your car because i
just watched my car the other day and
they started boring the minute i came
out of the car wash no no in fact i
think this is just it was your rain
that's finally made it around the world
capitalize on that i should i hate it
every time you wash her car tony it's
always an issue golf isn't it you never
wash your car every time you washes his
car trains people should start bay me
for to wash my car no in you type here
we have another issue with with car
washes most of us wash our cars more in
the winter time than any other time
simply because we've got we've got snow
and salt on the roads oh true we wash
the salt off rather than and washing the
cars to make them look pretty high up
told Evan I don't want to step on Joe
staff but I have a personal preference
since I know you both guys are Android
guys and girls which one would you
choose and this I would like an answer
from both of you the HTC One or the
galaxy s4 um I'm still waiting to see
what happens with the s4 but I'm I'm
pretty sold on the one for now and then
follow-up question what the
the s4 have to have in order for you to
choose the s4 over the one uh well
honestly I'm not um I've kind of become
less of a spec person over time so I'm
not I don't really care if it's got the
octa-core the quad core or whatever but
mmm i'd like to see some improvements in
touch with I mean I I like TouchWiz to a
point but there's a lot that I you know
it it doesn't look very good to me and
sometimes there's just some features
that I wish they would leave stock I
guess how do you how do you feel about
the creepy features about the the the
eye tracking and the double blinking and
across I and everything the cross-eyed i
wanna see ya you know doing it's just
kind of a battery drain I'm not I'm not
I never use like smart stay on my s3
when I had that or anything and he
doesn't I pretty much have to say the
same thing that he said there you don't
really get a lot on the s4 right now so
all we know is about the one and as you
know I'm a fan of the build of HTC
phones anyway yea though I would still
probably stick with the one since I know
about that right now aren't you
concerned about the camera I mean 4
megapixels and I recently seen and
shared with the with the guys on the
team some sample images from the HTC One
and and Maya those those were not the
best pictures I've ever seen 4
megapixels is not what matters in a
camera 4 megapixels is your size it's
not your quality having the controls
that you have like in my one I can
control is 0 and white balance and all
those things and as a photographer
myself those are more important than the
size of your pictures entirely like
you're not blending up making huge
brains out of your pictures no and as a
professional photographer i'm generally
got my big camera with me where I need a
pic yeah yeah I think probably my
biggest debate with the one i want the
one i love that design um I it's just I
I don't know it's why I loved we saw the
photos with Tony this morning and they
were not great and you know that's
that's when it comes to the point where
okay I want a great camera I don't want
a great
technology that doesn't really deliver
that's my opinion sadly you know you
know at times where you get you you have
the gs3 which actually has some decent
photos really good photos actually you
have the iphone 5 which has some good
photos I mean why is the one not on par
I mean that's what we want and I wanted
that with the 1x and it was sadly not on
par with the rest of the phone set hey
hi my check this out is a few on that's
a tie game Gigantor victoire to miss
okay whatever nobody's gonna beat this
move over ultrapixels now we're going to
have Gigantor pixels that is true now
tell me what camera what's the big
camera they use what's your favorite um
i use a nikon 5100 and i have four
lenses no nice and oh they're all good
no i'm a poor guy i'm a poor guy i use a
team i use a t3i that's actually what I
use for parking out daily by the way
okay market for a camera i recommend it
nikon's really good no they all nikon
makes good cameras that's for sure and
good lenses oh yeah so very good uh the
question that i have her follow up is
you guys are sitting pretty good right
now with android-powered smartphones are
either one of these two big phones
either the HTC one or the SBS for are
they enough to make you switch from
where you are right now specifically
from the nexus 4 on up or do you think
you'll skip a generation you know I've
been trying to decide that honestly I I
go through phones a lot I've probably
been through ten twelve phones in the
past year and a half but um I don't know
because I'm really happy with my Nexus
but I want L to evac and if you know if
either those high table the day they're
both can have LTE but you know it's it's
all about our software I made it the
Nexus has the best offer to me I'm
perfectly happy with it but I
do miss LT so I don't know yet honestly
I'm doing a speed test on my Nexus 4 /
HSPA right now is I've just LMK once and
that's it you don't have LTE in Utah
freight danger what yes and do you I've
got LTE here I can do verizon fact some
of the the verizon phones that I've used
I've gotten 35 megabit per second down
in your face so yeah I mean gsm gsm you
don't have a on AT&amp;amp;T or whatever you
don't have uneasy NTD yeah the other
they've got hspa+ and LTE AT&amp;amp;T does in
Utah and then verizon as well but I mean
t-mobile I don't know if you guys can
see that that's hspa+ 6.14 megabit down
well I'm pretty happy with that okay
that's what I get to hear that's what I
get here non-buddhist man well Gavin
down under give Ramon Buddhist and and
it just sounds cool and love you Utah no
one has ever claimed that Utah was cool
yeah I used to get about 50 down on LTE
here in Indianapolis but no now that I'm
on hspa+ I get I'm lucky to see 45 down
ouch but I actually did a speedtest last
night on our Wi-Fi here at campus and I
got a came back with a hundred twenty
three megs down see here's the part of
hspa+ at least with tmobile that I don't
like and I don't know if you guys can
see that they cap your up speed at right
around that's less than 1 megabit that's
yes the nigs happened at half so if I
want faster speeds I don't get me
started downloads nice but let me upload
I want to be able to upload oh well
anyway I think that's it guys thanks
very much for joining us we appreciate
you having the watches and participate
and hangouts throw things back over I
guess it's your turn now Tony yeah it is
thanks very much Adam and Evan and come
back right bye-bye and I will take this
opportunity to talk to my nwc friend Sam
who's from the UK if i recall well or if
my accent recognition is
in its place we have met we were I think
it was early in the am when when we have
met at the nokia event we actually with
michael fisher we woke up at about four
thirty in the morning we had to travel
to the nuclear engine center and we were
the first people in line actually there
were five people it was Michael Fisher
myself and then it was Clinton and Sam
and that's that's how we know each other
so welcomes him to the to your first
pocket my life thank you very much yeah
i am from from the UK well England
specifically book you know we had a
dramatically in you Michael yeah
football book but yeah so this this is
your first hangout I just want to throw
in this we have a rule either we talk
about whatever you want to talk about or
if not we talk about whatever we want to
talk about well I'll let you guys and
ask me that galaxies first of all
devices whatever you guys want to throw
towards me cuz an eye I general asked
whitey okay I'm gonna be bad this time
I'm not gonna ask you about the s4
because everybody's talking about the s4
and you'd be cheating so I'm asking you
to tell me your predictions about the
supposed alleged and upcoming Motorola X
phone do you think what do you think
that will be about yeah and i got myself
a business that's why I do that to you
to him I mean I don't think it's gonna
come and not anytime soon and they're
gonna go personally we have had a lot of
conversations about what I'm certainly
gonna do the nexus 5 first cuz they're
gonna brand is the five the nexus 5 in
the fifth month android five and then
two of us 02 / kind of things to Brent
as I the nexus 5 because everything's
going like a 5-inch 1080p and they're
gonna run up samsung cuz samsung they've
only got the for an HTC they're way
behind cuz they're still there the one
you see I have a question I mean that's
totally logic logical what you're
explaining to me but what I don't really
think it will happen last year at the
google i/o we've seen the Nexus 7 and it
should be time for a tablet release
since the nexus 4 was released like
four or five months ago wouldn't it be
time for a phone somewhere in the autumn
quite possibly but it really depends is
how Google are going to going to start
selling their phones now dunno they want
to do a year release our every six
months because it seems like nowadays
everyone want to try not death at the
hardware a lot sooner than 12 months so
it's like right do a bit six months
every 12 months it's kind of like hmm
what are they gonna do now wife and the
might do is release two devices you know
try and do side-by-side you know I've
try and get a bit more exposure for each
device and go right isn't you Nexus 7 it
is a nexus 5 to kind of go with it
because less bun is the nexus 4 kind of
is is close to a 5-inch than a 4-inch
anywhere so it kind of makes sense for
him to do the 5-inch 1080p and just kind
of brand along that where know now one
thing one thing I mean we you know
motorola when google bought motorola it
was their commitment that they were
gonna leave motorola as their own
company you know they were gonna leave
him alone and they were gonna build
whatever they wanted and listened this
and that and we've seen terrible market
push in the united states specifically
um and then now we've get the news today
that they laid off 1200 employees yeah
so if you know it makes you wonder this
Motorola's still gonna be a company or
whatever it is in the next 12 months i
mean could it be that the razr m and the
razr HD and all these devices or like
the test okay can motorola survive on
its own and since they haven't succeeded
could it be that they're gonna just
ditch motorola and use the hardware
division of motorola to actually build
the first like real google phone meeting
like no longer the nexus brand but a
real google whatever yeah i mean not
that makes logical sense to me because
in the UK motorola almost non-existent
you know they released someone so in
carriers but I don't know anybody that's
got a motorola device literally nobody
buys them in the UK so it makes sentence
obviously with the pixel you know the
chrome pixel he's now Google hardware it
kind of kind of leads us to the going
that where you know you gotta look quite
bare and I say obviously they are
looking at doing they're on their own
full hardware division and it would make
sense
in our Pro branded as a Nexus device but
an actual true Google Nexus device
instead of an LG Nexus or HTC nexus and
you can kind of see where they want to
go with it going forward so in line with
the the pixel do you think they're also
going to charge like twelve hundred
dollars for the phone good good question
and was all hundred dollars for a web
browser all right oh I mean once audit
boots fast time it in boots fast yeah
you know I was seriously I I'll be
honest with you I was you know since I
have the the Retina Display MacBook Pro
this is a three-thousand-dollar computer
at some point I was like you know there
are some times when I want to go to the
coffee shop but there's a lot of theft
in my country's I was like I don't want
to carry this computer I'm gonna get a
Chromebook um and and I started looking
into this Samson joining the dollar
Chromebook and then when they brought
out the pixel I was like men what these
guys are not charging for chrome itself
I know the app they'll be making with
the damn computer should seriously I
couldn't believe I mean as nice as is
let's be honest it is a beautifully
crafted device oh absolutely portray
it's still just a web browser effective
or you know unless they do this you know
what I'm kind of hoping a lot of people
are as well they kind of merge chrome
and Android together it kind of makes
sense touch screen on the pixel
touchscreen android apps kind of leases
to where they're going with it but it's
one of those will the do it because
they've always said they're not going to
do it but will they actually decide
right yeah and I've always wondered why
they don't do that i mean we have
android we've got tablets now we've got
google TV we've got phablets we've got
phones we've got all these different
screen sizes and other than they've guys
who you know did google the search they
do search low you didn't know their
address and that other they only deliver
and read mail i agonizing Tony
loves gmail if anyone doesn't know how
much Tony loves gmail but but back to
background point we've got this
ecosystem of apps that arguably works
across all of these platforms including
to a lesser extent google TV and that
10-foot experience
hmm Chromebook is just it's a laptop
it's it's a tablet with an attached
keyboard put android on it or at least
give me that as an option because now
all of my apps will work on it the way
that I know that they work the way that
everything yeah and it's a lot of system
is there and it's an ARM processor yes
they just think about this we can run
android apps on windows 8 I mean Adam
you're showing us in a video how you can
do that you do that to Joe you did it a
couple of months ago and why can't we do
it on the TAM Chromebook with me man it
makes logical sense from to merge it
because from what I understand the
technical point of it then they can they
can kind of crossbreed together and make
it kind of one so why not just give is
it we all want it so I give us what we
want the exhibit glass first San do you
have any any closing thoughts we have to
we have to move fast your BS my twitter
feed is going crazy and everybody wants
to join which is good for us but
unfortunately there's only ten slots in
this hang out and just your thoughts
obviously you you ask anybody what's it
gonna take for the inner for the s40 no
gayness 4014 for you guys for me
personally the s4 I said it yesterday
and i will tell this the exact same
answer every time i get this question it
will take two things to happen at the
same time so not one or the other but
two things at the same time number one
the s4 has to have a better design than
the S free and arguably a better design
than the HTC One and the second thing is
the s4 has to deliver a better imaging
experience than the HTC One if these two
things happen at the same time I don't
care about specs about ram about
internal storage and we care about these
so if this happens the s4 if either one
of these or none of these happen it's
it's the HTC One for me and I and I
forgot to ask you as yesterday Toni I
mean you at you were the one that had
the s2 and then you had the s3 and then
you had the HTC One and then you decided
to sell your HTC One and actually keep
the s3 so tell me what what did what
does a point of view about the HTC one
that everybody knows my opinion
and I've said maybe people will continue
hating on me but I am like this whatever
my experiences are I tell them straight
out I think the camera on the HTC One
was overrated I think it was a mediocre
camera with a huge marketing hype behind
it the images were were little filled
with lots lots of noise and they were
jagged and compared to this the S free
had a much better camera I at one point
did a camera shootout between the HTC
one vs free the 808 PureView and the
iphone 4s I think at that point and the
HTC One came out on bottom on all tests
what about jocks I don't think of a ja
sam was just being on and what would
what would it take for him you know you
would you get one or an s3 over a nexus
you know what uh that's not fair and
that's just not sure it's it's no
surprise i'm i'm a nexus family because
of all the things that Nexus is and does
and what it allows me to do right there
I've got to Nexus force one of them you
can't use but anyway I'll show them off
like that because I know at least two
people here hi Mary but I myself who
will probably kill for that phone yeah
thank you thank you but yeah the the
galaxy 4 is just it's another galaxy
it's going to sell like hotcakes
everybody's going to love it it's going
to be the next iteration up from the
three and it's going to be wildly
successful am I going to get one
probably not uh if anything i'd love to
get back to HTC because i love HTC i
love their hardware i always have since
back in the old ipaq days oh that when
you're hitting me in the heart here oh
so yeah if I were to do any of the two
right now I would probably take a chance
on the HTC agreed agreed cool well
thanks for having his guys and I would
rest of the show thanks for being here
and the week will do see like ice by way
and with that I'm gonna I think handed
out to you hi mate it's his turn right
now okay let me look for somebody that's
been here for a while my diaz
you made the comment about the cigar
Tony please pull out your masterpiece
well I don't know what he was talking
what comment now you eat buzzer damn
John I'm time video smoking cigars is
great yeah well it's usually about one
of the you somebody's microphone is
acting up someone's by the ocean they're
lucky right oh yeah they are so it's
it's something's got to kill me at one
point so that's when doing kids do the
mat for yourself oh so Matthias tell us
about you how are you day one angle how
are you two I'm great where are you from
and what I like if I love when the side
is ah i was i was a big fan i was there
oh man it's been it's been almost 10
years since the last time that i was
there but it was a great experience it
is a beautiful city and man that is like
the best meat and the best wine i've
ever had my life yeah yeah so tell us
about you tell us about you what do you
do for a living for example well I am a
programmer oh really yes that is awesome
man over my own heart yes but eyes nice
and what device are you using hey I am a
nokia lumia 800 uh guys phone guy
finally somebody walking with this
fellow yeah yeah that is that was a good
phone that's the 800 like 900 oh the 900
the 900 still I i like that i actually
like the 800 a little more because of
the size it was a smaller phone but the
900 was a really cool phone the night
day a country they never came to action
Tina each song then I country water
first the cementum is here t or 300 no
no buddy get in this in September 900 we
have little body behind but so I've got
a question for you then regarding your
choice of phones did you go with a
windows phone because you have a
programming background using Microsoft
technologies and just saw that as a
natural evolution of progression for you
to pick up and be able to write
your own apps for the Windows platform
or do you program in other languages no
I am a good girl Emma Koch oh wow oh
okay you're gonna have to enlighten me
here what does COBOL mainly use for only
bank maybe I did a funny guy banya no
interesting interesting so no but that's
an interesting legacy man that's an
interesting legacy what about tablets
you have any tablet or your sticky only
with a smartphone no no my mother got
one excuse something like that oh yeah
now you know as every time you know I
think that something's really happening
you know a lot of people that are buying
their first computer like kids or
teenagers or stuff they're going for
tablets obviously but all of us that
have been using tablets for the past
three years you know I find myself using
a tablet less I don't know about you Joe
or Tony but I find myself using a tablet
less than I used to because I know why
for works you're carrying something like
this Oh true true that's why because if
it if you carry something like this or
the veer then you probably use a 7-inch
tablet okay so i've got a pimp my
article that i just wrote what was it
yesterday day before about now that
we've got tablets that are doing so much
do we still use laptops or can they
replace laptops and I think it's either
getting close if you're using it as a
portable entertainment device or for a
very basic set of use case scenarios but
you know for us where we do an awful lot
of typing we probably do video editing
tablets just aren't quite there yet ipad
I think it's getting close I mean
correct me if I'm wrong but video
editing on an iPad is getting there yeah
yeah and to be honest with you in my
case for example I i I'll be honest with
everybody I despise windows 8 but the
move the move I don't hate it I despise
it um but the move is actually not a bad
move it's actually very interesting what
they're doing I mean I feel that that
you know it should we should have more
powerful tablets and they've always
existed for the past
12 years they have existed but the
problem is um you know if we are gonna
be stuck with with with the limitations
of a tablet I just don't find the use
for it i mean is that the reason why you
stayed away my peers know me is
expensive here and this phone i got was
600 different oh wow ap man country oh
wow technology in here is it so
expensive an ipad is enough one thousand
dollars oh wow well it looks like you're
in the same boat as I am because I was
just tweeting the other day I was
checking out the the price for the Lumia
920 and that is priced here in Romania
at the same price point as the iphone 5
both going for one thousand dollars so
that's too much any but but interesting
I mean Mattias you know when I was in
Buenos Aires probably one of the things
that struck me the most was you know
probably technology is expensive but
life there is not really that expensive
food there is is extremely affordable
and really good quality food everywhere
yeah let me dress and I am I suggesting
eat less buy more phones no but okay do
you have any questions for the team that
before before we close the final
thoughts no I shall say that about the
topic of the Hangout is for t1 not for
me not for I don't I don't I don't know
what why what that exists if keep doing
the same thing the same thing I mean
you're so you're happy with Windows
Phone meaning that that you're really
satisfied with your purchase what up I
windows phone 7 hey I I can talk about
Windows Phone 8 well you know is this
this is not for me I actually yes I back
into the question of a show if I shall
want to try okay so so one question
which would be your next phone meaning
if it's not the s for the HTC One which
phone is out there that you
on right now the Xperia Z which one do
one would you consider the one if you
know this I um I know HTC I am on a
one-win window a window mobile 6.5 ah
yeah those are the day they what well my
process map is ok so I'm gonna ask you
one final question but there's actually
a personal question can you explain to
me what type of meters the be fair choti
so what is it a filet or what I've been
trying to figure out what meat that is
to buy it here locally and this is
coming from somebody who speaks Spanish
but not Portuguese well it's it's a name
but it's not of a specific steak it's
just a specific cut that they have only
in Argentina that you don't find
anywhere else and Tony I am going to
take you there and you are gonna die
that is delicious that is delicious am i
right man no way to go there with you
yeah yeah am I am i right about the ass
yeah yeah but do you know what cut is it
or not really HSN I don't know winning
in English it's an embodied oh yeah it
is oh so it's a combination of a sausage
with me sort of you would say but me a
ball is oh my god like it it is amazing
Tony it is amazing yes well we weren't
telling us about your running thing and
now you're talking about sausage yeah
Matthias it is a real pleasure meeting
you man you live in a beautiful country
congratulations and we hope to see you
next week thank you thank you I'd ok
take care bye bye see ya next one the
answer a guy is up next the android guy
you know this is kind of like roulette
you gotta look at everybody who's in
here and say which guy is running
Android and which guy is not ok so
Simpson Floyd juniors been here for a
while I don't know Schurrle hate 'let
that sounds good to me go ahead
introduce yourself say hi to the team
and what tech are you on but bursary
unmute your mic
hey can you hear me we can now okay
excellent um well I'm running really old
take a couple years it's like um us HTC
Sensation nice looking for hold on let
go look at this this was a really good
phone but Tony knows the story behind
this phone so I'm not really gonna talk
about you go it's getting old so it's
time i'm gonna go to something else are
you running stock rom monitor review
done anything custom to it I'm just stop
but since it's so close to being out of
two year I think I'm just going to start
writing some custom stuff and he's used
it to experiment you have any real arms
in mind or I'm thinking of Sgt beside
you my ten points of my dad for a jelly
bean you know that I you can't go wrong
with cyanogenmod it's one of the the
most stable out there not really cutting
edge anymore you've got a okay p and
paranoid android that are kind of
pushing the envelope there but if you
want wide variety of devices stable lots
of cool features cyanogenmod is the way
to go so I we've asked everybody else
this will ask you to wear where do you
hail from where where do you call home
oh I am in Alabama that I love them yes
very nice and you consider that the
north-south the deep south oh it's the
deep south is the Bible bill so that's
definitely so I'm very good it it
depends some people you know I've talked
to people from all over the place and
some people like well Alabama it's it's
kind of up near the North we're not as
south as some of our other neighbors are
but it's a state of mind I love this app
enough I mean it's hot all the time so
that counts I may I'll tell you what hot
is right oh yeah actually I've actually
been to mobile and it's hot oh yeah it's
a mobile absolutely so what tell us why
you picked Android and what it might say
I'm going to just kind of turn things on
their head here what would it take for
you to switch over to another platform
other than Android
oh I know the platform any platform not
just iOS or something like that yeah any
platform what would it take i mean
you're on android why and then what
would it take for you to switch I'm on
Andrew because of it because it's highly
customizable we can do about anything
with it is it's as close to having a
desktop or a computer a real computer in
your hand as you can get I think iOS it
would it would have to be a lot more
customizable they'd have the chance to
look of it now we have to be able to do
it stop be able to change the screens
and make them harder want custom icons
knees are sore now just just a question
because I would like to know when you're
talking about customization are you only
referring to the looks of it the aspect
or are you thinking deep tweaks and X
well what's nice about Android is you
can do 2d tweaks if you want i'm not at
that level i want to go there but for
someone like me i can do the surface
stuff very easily and not to have a
brand new look every day if i want not
me i enjoy that so you're talking with
me live wallpapers widgets new folders
and whatnot i have like five home
launchers and I just choose every day
which one I want to work with and it has
a new look automatically fabulous what
watches your favorite this week um nova
launcher on my phone and on my tablet
apex apex launcher wow it's really
stable i love it very nice very nice do
you have any questions for the team what
about is that before you before you ask
the question um it's uh it's 2012 is a
galaxy tab 7.0 plus huh that was a
really good one mm-hmm this nice and
he's holding up great everything on
upgrading that to say D note 8.0 which
got a beautiful year beach and my the
only one wants to talk on a tablet yeah
probably so yes well I mean I'm trying
to get away from having to carry an
extra tablet along with my phone i was
thinking more lies
something like the the optimus g pro or
the gas note to the g pro is great
believe me i've been using the g pro for
four hands out in comparison in
barcelona and i'm using the note 2 as my
second phone as daily driver you know
what it's right there if you don't care
that much about the s pen itself and and
everything surrounding the S Pen the g
pro is a good competitor 44 the no 2 now
of course it all depends on samsung and
the note 3 I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to wait that long what the Sam
August like August somehow so so far
into the future it's too far this is
changing technology every six months
thing you know the August is a really
long time away yes yes it is so I had a
question for you guys I'll referring to
something i read this morning about new
foley technology for the yaw cs4 have
you discussed that already no we have
not i have read about it and i think
steven has posted about it on our
channel but on our page but I couldn't
tell you right now but if you'd like
while you talk with the other guys I
read it up real quick and I will chime
in so in my understanding what Samsung
is planning on doing is because already
by the way I already film parking out
daily and that's part of the news today
yeah okay so that you know about it you
talk about it yeah so apparently what
they're changing is the way they are
lighting up display um I don't really
know the difference between one
technology and the other um but
apparently the idea is to make apple you
know to me it's probably still gonna be
called a mole in just a new generation
and you know in the past what we've had
is a mole it just gets better you know
it gets better for lighting and they
light it gets better in efficiency and
apparently what what this new technology
is gonna do is just make it more
efficient like when you had an LCD in
the past in the past then you moved into
LED and what you change was the
backlight um I believe that that's gonna
be the swap I don't know about you Joe
you know what does about on par yeah you
know what I'd like because regardless if
we're talking about the galaxy s2 the
galaxy s3 or the note to my single
problem with
the AMOLED screens is that if you go
outdoors in a study they you can see you
can't see jack yeah so that that's my
problem at hope this thing addressed is
that or at least that's my hope I don't
know if that's the technology right
there that i use out in the sunlight
anymore that's all i gotta do fun well
you got a pebble yeah i got my pebble Oh
podcast yesterday oh I haven't been able
to add Tony knows I've had a swamp day
but but uh seriously I you know that
SmartWatch thing is something that's
really been itching me I just wish that
we get a SmartWatch that actually looked
elegant I'm you know I'm uh you know I'm
a stainless steel type of guy i don't
i'm not into the the plastic heat I
noticed Michael swapped the the arm
piece the armed man on his it made it
metal so I could probably go for that
you get so you got a Kickstarter phone
didn't you yeah I got in excuse me I got
a little bit of accosting going on I'm
I'm digging in my pocket here that's why
the camera went all over the place I got
into the Kickstarter after Michael data
he was 99 bucks I was 115 but that right
there is a claim ticket for a really
nice metal watch band that i bought from
my local my local watch store they have
it ordered for me because they only had
gold and silver and i wanted a nice
black one so there they'll have it to me
in a couple weeks they say nice nice
i've got a video going up later today
actually you haven't seen it yet because
i'm saving my bandwidth right now it's
not uploading while I'm trying to do
this you can thank ya later but as soon
as we're done here I'll start that
upload and it'll go live later today
about some of the things that the pebble
smartwatch mrs. and just spoiler alert
here guys the band at that's one of them
oh ok syn thank you very much for
joining us any last thoughts um no kind
of curious about the UM BM the pebble
watch if it was worth 150 price tag for
I mean maybe that why should be good if
it was around seven or eight 100
it's a lot for the functionality right
what do you think about the four hundred
dollar I'm watch made in Italy I think
I'll pass well said so I'll take that
question um I backed it I didn't know if
it was quite worth it at a hundred and
fifteen dollars that's 115 it is it's
well worth that plus the 10 and a half
month wait in my opinion and I'm a
SmartWatch connoisseur I've had a half a
dozen seven smart watches over the years
is it worth 150 dollars probably and
especially if they gave it a nice
quality watch band absolutely is it
worth 150 plus a seventy dollar watch
band like Michael put on his I don't
think so they got to do something with
it the watch band to to upgrade it and
make it feel like a higher quality time
piece because it really is it's a nice
high quality I love this thing to watch
itself other than the band absolutely
love it's one of the best watches that
I've ever ever worn and every time you
enter thank you thank you very much for
joining us and please do come back next
week thank you thank you take care about
a man whose turn is it I think it's
yours Tony I do i do I guess Tony Stern
okay if this is mine then sim could you
please could you please leave the
Hangout so we can free up a slot and
awesome I had this a twitter friend of
mine who's from romania his name is
Caesar but I know it's chas dodd so it's
actually the first Romanian except for
me on this handout so good evening how
are you know everyone your audio is is
yeah if you can talk a little bit louder
okay okay I'll try that okay this is
perfect so high first of all nice to be
here it's good to have you it took me
one time the hour for this podcast we
publicize gmt so
we can not publicize all times but I
have a neat trick on my sleeve I will I
will from now on publicize a link to a
nice time and date converter so
everybody just clicks on that and the
Seas exactly at what point in time
happening at them well I think we all
need to switch over to swatch internet
time because then we can all be confused
together right a spy on the Google+ fing
is nice you can add it to the calendar
and it sings the time for you yes that
is true and whenever a host changes but
it syncs automatically so Romania I have
a sapphire black sv whoa my colleagues
don't think no no dawn so tell me you
have a sapphire black you know when I
saw that phone initially you know if the
phone is just so black um that there is
just no way around the fingerprints on
that thing it looks sort of like mad
that's why I went for the pebble blue
but but how have you liked it in black
color well I used the case from the
first day it does it's nice with the
case there's they are no fingerprints
I'm very careful not to break my phone
cost me a lot oh yeah yeah which raises
this one with i was using cyanogenmod on
that one it was the only reason I kept
at home i'm using it right now i flashed
the rom the first day I got the phone
Wow first time so it's interesting
you're saying that the phone was
extremely expensive and then you just
made a hata kitty right there yeah
that's the reason I chose the s3 over
the One X because i could not void my
warranty Oh interesting so just tell you
one thing are you planning on upgrading
the s3 to the s4 which which more about
know why not
this is a great phone I don't really
need a better phone right now you make
me you guys don't you guys talk so alike
hey and the s-1 would probably be bigger
and yeah it's not one that's the Tony
Tony is always like Tony's always like I
don't need a better phone i have a nokia
pureview 808 that's all I've 808 that is
correct I don't need anything else the
food is great yeah what's happen are
using if any I'm not using any tab I
don't find a good use for that side for
media streaming yeah you've got a big
phone anyway so you're good yeah so when
your portable do you find yourself
falling back to your your smartphone or
do you also have a laptop that you carry
around or do you just write back to a
desk when I have to work i use my laptop
April but the phone is quite fun I
usually browse the internet a lot and
the battery life is awesome yeah you
guys get a deal over there for mobile
it's like crazy what you guys pay over
there for for being on one what was it
don't like like three bucks yeah that's
that's on my specific carrier which
which I don't think cuz I razon well
hospital so you're not you're not on the
same city no we're not in the same city

not sure which carrier he's on I'm on
the smallest one which also happens to

I believe he's with the one which which
has a fruit name yes I was once in with
the collar yeah okay see you have any
questions for us Chesson what really
just want to say hi see how everyone was
doing pleasure meeting you man a
pleasure man Tony's told me so much
about Romania that I have to go there

special place in my heart for Romania I

me right well I know Tony and who can't
love that face right but no I actually
was back when Google Maps started
something call attitude where you can
share your location with friends and
family all number world I was just
playing with it and accepted a friend
request from a crystal and didn't know
where he was and turns out he's in
Romania and he just happened to come to
the States for vacation with his father

out of everything and so one of my
friends was so piss drunk he just goes
back to the cover he comes back with a
palinka but he already drank like I
don't know like water bottle oh man I I
can't feel this thing when I drink it
but what is palinka made up by the way
it is it is moonshine locally made out

you what device you're using um I'm
using the iphone 5 oh nice nice very
nice varies i I'll admit I join you it's
my daily driver yeah I one of my two
daily drivers ah hey Tony when did you
go black that's what she said I finally
saw that there's a story behind this
when when Michael and I first met up in
Berlin last year at ebah he has kept on
bringing on these that that's what she
said things apparently the things which
I was saying and I didn't get the entire
idea but now I do and I and now I that's
why she said everybody that's that and I
got I got the black one recently because
initially I went with the white one you
told me that that thing looks awesome
and it looked awesome until the day I
managed to sell it and I said okay let's
try this one and you know what I finally
realized that the black iphone is not
black it's blue it depends on the
lighting and I love it because if you
take a look at it from from the from the
front it's just a black another
fingerprints but it's a just a black
slabby don't know where the screen
starts and where it's green ends yeah
it's cool that's the cool part about for
for me the iphone 4 in the iphone for us
were better in black i didn't like him
in white III didn't like him in a white
i have the forest here which is i don't
know i just didn't like this phone in
white my for was actually in black so
how are you liking the the iphone tell
us about it Chris
since I used before the iphone 4 I
didn't had any problem with the five I'm
kind of came with it oh good good how is
it holding up there do you have any
scratches or scuffs or or any signs of
color where nope just a white one not
but my brother is using the black one
and he had the same problem with the
scuff games mmm okay can you believe I
mean in my I'm in my five when I filmed
me after the buzz um my phone was
pristine zero issues zero whatsoever but
you know I was looking at it last night
and I actually have like one Nick or two
out of the blue I have no clue how to
wear oh that's good that I got applecare
on this phone I'm just gonna go swap it
but you know it's just the sad thing I
mean I haven't dropped my phone ever and
it's already got it yeah just kiss for
the record hi Matt and me are about the
only people on the team who don't take
care of phones they cherish phones they
place them not directly on something but
on top of a claw yeah okay I've take
offense of that because of all the
phones i have ever had I've only broken
one and it happened to be the
slipperiest phone in the world no yeah I
taking her mind to you should see
Brandon I have no clue why he doesn't
smash any more phones than he already
does cuz it in Brendan's like talking to
you and he's like it I'm like yeah I
need to make a phone call can i borrow
your phone he's like yeah yours ha sigh
he throws it to the other side like crap
God he's like Hulk but only he says
Brendan smash Oh serious seriously a
mini vaca so Chris it's okay what
somebody out there I'm cutting you off I
me but while we're on this somebody out
there get your photoshop skills take a
picture Brandon minimun and turn him
into Brandon mini hope I gotta see that
that's gonna be an awesome one is so
tell me Chris what's habit are you using
if any oh I'm using their I pit mini oh
okay I'm glad I
like that yeah I've you know I've tried
to like it but I need a I need an iPad
Mini with Retina display that's me yeah
I was just gonna say that with with
retina you know I was just so spoiled i
have a Retina Display MacBook Pro I have
a high resolution on yet every single
phone that I have and then I go to my
tablet and everything looks jagged it
just pisses me off I didn't take the
bigger one the threat not because it was
just for me to bake it is big yeah it is
big i actually went to the mini because
of the size as well but but your liking
the mini that you consider it to be a
worthy the worthy device to you okay so
final question um any well you're
definitely not going to get an s4 have
you already got an iphone 5 or are you I
mean what predictions do you have um I
saw the one and I don't know I were
watch out for the as far if it's okay
because I got this one before There s
free Oh interesting but one day later it
fell down and cracked but I did stable
works without any problem I look maybe I
take the s 40 or I wait for the iphone
5s yeah I can't find my broken Galaxy
Nexus it was just one fallen broke just
one so III don't know I it Samsung has
got they've got awesome design but they
really just play it on the edge with
display and that's really not not a good
way to design it's easy to break the
display no matter what you do which is
something good about HTC phones man I
mean I've had some HTC phones really
beaten not by me by Brandon and then I
get them after they're after they're
beating and they look good HTC's
industrial there they're very well put
together yeah yeah well it's it's a
pleasure to meet you Chris it I don't
know if you have any questions for the
team before you go mm-hmm not any
question cool cool well it's a pleasure
meeting you thank you for joining us
same here say next week bye bye bye
mr. Levi you know I've got to go with
Zoltan Joe because he's got facial hair
and Zoltan come on that's such an
awesome name that's how you Ian so
introduce yourselves to us and let us
know you'll have to I'm you I got a
little back going on there too yeah
we've got a little lag going on there
hello guys hello welcome to the show
definitely from Hungary I can I
recognize that accent from I'm Hungarian
but uh I'm from I mean I live in Austria
very nice very nice so tell us about
your tech introduce us to your uh what
you got for your phone and a tablet if
any and why uh my Danny driver is uh oh
man I am envying you that is it that's
the Z I can eat yet I'm actually getting
the whole I'm actually getting the ZL
that the phone is beautiful and now tell
me something have you dipped it in water
yes that's all right on purpose yes you
know I just think about this guy's how
many times have you been in a situation
where you want to go to the pool with
your friends or with your kids Joe or
something and you just want to take a
photo and you don't because you don't
want to get your phone wet yes yes I
know yes most of the time I don't want
to get wet either so I'm staying far
away from the puzzle done tell it does
about you aside from the Xperia Z how
are you liking it you're enjoying the
phone yes I get it on on Tuesday and
yeah it's pretty good tell me one thing
we are currently reviewing this so I
know the answer but I want to know
exactly your opinion on this what do you
think about the display i mean i've
heard mixed results mixed reports from
across the internet i know our take on
the screen but i want to know what do
you think about the screen on that thing
well the viewing angles are not so good
oh but by the way they're not so good
because there's a screen protector on it
like with every sony phone yeah that is
that is such a piss off I mean they
always ship with this you know it took
me like tools to get it off the
experience when I reviewed it and that
once I took the screen protector than
the viewing angles were good oh and
apparently the Sony branding is on the
screen protector itself and not on the
glass really yes and the the Xperia
branding also no no only on the front on
the front yeah hmm but but that's
actually cool you get rid of that Sony
name and you've got like a black slab
that actually be good yeah ok every time
I see that I am just reminded of 2001 a
Space Odyssey Nexus just that big black
slab there that's sitting there the
monolith and you wonder what it is and
it's just so elegant in its simplicity
yeah it's it's an elegant phone it's a
beautiful phone absolutely are you using
any tablet yes a nexus 7 oh that's a
good tablet hate the display but it's a
good tablet yeah the displaced basis i
hate the display i like it okay you know
what it looks like it reminds me of
washing your clothes and you know if
they were yeah you remember when you
know that you put your shirts in there
and they're they're red and then they
come out after the dryer they come out
you they lost color that's what that's
what everything looks they're like on
the next seven and I guess I'm I'm
probably blind then Brandon always
looked at my photos and says Joe what's
wrong with your picture is it and if I'm
looking at it I can't see it I just I
can't see it I'm just lest artistic I
guess I don't know you you look at red
and red looks pink you look at yellow
and yellow looks like white that for me
that's the promise color accuracy yeah I
think Apple has spoiled you you know but
but but think about this I mean you
think about this surely the Nexus 7 is
not an expensive tablet but then if you
have the option to buy
something that brings you better color
accuracy and now tablets are becoming so
cheap you know I've seen Sam's and
tablets that do a lot a much better job
probably not resin resolution but in
color reproduction so I would rather pay
for something does a good job in
everything then not a good job in
something I don't know that's me okay so
to follow up for both of you how much of
a premium would you pay to go from the
colors that you have on the current
nexus 7 to something quote unquote
better how much is that worth you how
much more would you pay for a tablet
that was exactly the same specs just had
better colors on the screen ooh i'd be
willing to pay an extra hundred bucks
for a good display extra hundred bucks
yeah how about you Zoltan yeah me too
now would you pay that if you had the
two sitting side by side would you throw
down the extra hundred dollars to get
the one with the better colors or would
you say I'm gonna save that and maybe
get a one with a bigger storage capacity
or one with LTE instead oh okay so
here's the problem with tap here's the
problem with tablets I don't know about
you sold on but in my case the tablet is
about to display you know it's not about
the back it's not about the sides it's
it's about the display everything in the
tablet has to do with the display so
it's like in a computer I mean if the
keyboard was mushy you know it's a full
that the computer is about the display
the keyboard the trackpad there are so
many components that have to do with the
computer so not everything is about to
display but in the case of the tablet if
they don't get that right then it's not
really something you enjoy and that's
really the prom in my book yeah you're
you're right you're right fair enough no
any questions for us all down on your
case oh no nothing special I'm getting
the Xperia ZL next week so I'm really
eager to join you in that 1080p yeah
yeah and yes i will get rid of the skin
of the screen protector i will i get two
screen protectors with it but i don't
don't know if I if you know if it
doesn't if it doesn't bother you i would
recommend you don't take it off
initially because those are like not yet
those are really expensive and good
screen protectors you know it so cuz it
took me a while to grab the experience
and notice that there was one it took me
a while like like a couple of weeks for
me to notice that there was something
there yeah if I didn't read or hear
about that didn't notice it yeah okay I
put a pleasure meeting you hold on thank
you thank you yeah maybe hi guys who's
next you are next Tony oh yeah good and
before I do that I will take this
opportunity and I have learned this from
Joe I'm not gonna pimp out my Twitter I
just want to say thank you everybody for
following me because I finally crossed
the 1000 followers mark so thanks
everybody hey here's to the next 2003-4

ever okay now I'm the one that's gonna
complain i've been stuck at 1800 for a
while yeah go on follow hymen yo Joe

gotta win some heritage let us talk to
uh to whom shall we talk we shall talk
to I think bowel asuncion I totally
messed up your name but yeah it's okay
it's a date hi where are you from I'm
actually streaming from d okay hold on
just one second Fritz can you please
yeah mute your mouth I already made it
in ok good so back to you Paul yeah I'm
actually from DC from DC great and you
have a Spanish name I do but I'm not
actually so you don't speak spanish
because i was good i was thinking that
you might be able to talk a little
spanish with hi mother so the way think
that this thing works is I don't we talk
about what you want or we talk about
what we want so let's hear what you want
um a little bit of both I guess I guess
I kind of wanted to ask you this
question for a while Oh what's your job
like like waking up in the morning i'm
excited i'm doing a pocket knife thing
today i do i will tell you just a little
bit of how it is to work with
and now and not because I don't want to
tell you more because we will have an
awesome thing coming up soon which will
let everybody know and see how one day
in our life is so that's a little
spoiler for here so for me it depends
whether if it's a weekend or a weekday
I'm working on both weekends and
weekdays but i usually wake up at seven
a.m. local time which is 12 a.m.
midnight Eastern I'm covering the
overnight news shift and as a managing
editor I'm in charge with everything
which appears on the front page whether
if it's scheduling of editorials or
assignments of different tasks and with
that I will not tell you any more i will
give you at one point an entire episode
of my life with pocket now and I'm gonna
end it over to hide yeah we're actually
planning on filming a video for for that
um in my case I I do video mostly I i
actually do pretty much well i
administer the just like Tony
administers the front page i administer
the youtube channel so you know the
whole organization i wake up but usually
i wake up at six in the morning i run
for an hour then i'm available at seven
and usually all the reviews that you see
in most of the shows that we do i edit
those and so usually i would edit those
videos in the morning and then at at
noon we cut at noon for PocketNow daily
so whatever news that came over from
tony and from steven early those are the
news that are gonna make pocketnow daily
for the day so I film at noon um I
actually there's somebody that helps me
which is our video intern who edits
pocket out daily and you know usually
for example if we're gonna edit and
after the buzz or or or review usually
it could take from from I don't know
seven probably six to seven hours to
edit a good video um and therefore you
know I usually spend like an hour
building an hour to building PocketNow
daily and then I focus back on whatever
videos we're doing or writing editorials
it depends so for me that's usually my
day but on the on the normal side let's
say I'm up from I'm available from seven
to seven that's pretty much the schedule
and just before before Joe before Joe
Stern hi Matt and myself as well as
other peeps on the box
now team are full timers Joe is just a
part timer we hope you'll become he'll
turn eventually so that's my boy well
doing Rob o'clock so back to you Luke it
is my destiny um so yeah that's been
something we've been talking about
Brandon and I since the the early early
days I've been with the team now for two
years and my role continually changes I
was brought on just for news in the
beginning and then news plus some
editorials and then news editorials and
videos and now it's just editorials and
videos and you know all kinds of fun
stuff my day since I am just a part
timer and I have what we call in the
industry a real job you think and I say
that because if I had to choose between
the two jobs today right now I would not
choose the real job if it's it's one of
those things where you wake up you dread
going to work you trudge along all day
and then you go home and pocket now is
my escape pocket now lets me play with
cool technology they let me write cool
articles talk about apps do videos and
really be an evangelist for the platform
not just Android but the mobile platform
so it's something where i can utilize my
passion to to share with you not not
just to say hey this that or the other
or to crank out code all day but to
build up the community and to do what
we're doing right now you know i'm here
on my lunch hour from my day job taking
a long lunch just so i can be here with
you guys and I'll pick up some food on
the way back but back to your question i
usually get up in the morning around 6
30 or seven o'clock the night before
I've done probably half an hour to an
hour worth of research on the topic that
I'm going to cover the following day
from there I'll write and write and
write whether that's a 1500 word
editorial or writing out a script and
then shooting video that Jaime do you
want me to send you
all of my material so you can edit my
videos cuz i oh you do a better job than
I do so yeah I do all the video editing
of my own stuff and it probably shows
and then I'll give that up in online I
do your reviews come on I make you look
at I haven't done a review in a long
time but yes you make my reviews look
gorgeous absolutely I got your message I
got your message but no that's what I do
and I i say i would probably spend
probably 23 hours a day creating and
researching content and then just all
throughout the day I'll answer comments
i'll answer emails whether that's
youtube comments or where comments at
talking now and then i just try and stay
up to speed with what everybody else is
doing on the team i use paga now is my
number one go-to source for news along
with you guys too so it's it's wonderful
i love what i do for pocket now all
right um now question for you what
device are you using i actually using
the galaxy s3 yeah nice what colors does
that pebble blue it's the pebble blue
version yeah i've got i've got the same
for me it's my favorite color i don't
know why that doesn't very nice i just
got it cuz it was kind of unique I
haven't noticing a blue phone back then
when they first came out so I thought
yeah yeah and what I like the most about
that color is that it depends on what
angle you're looking at it from cuz it
like color it like iridescent right yeah
really cool any tablets um no actually I
don't my dad has the nexus 7 but you're
not you're not missing out on much trust
me yeah I'm okay with a smartphone and a
computer no and the gs3 s got everything
you need man seriously yeah yeah a
tablet is something that's nice to have
but it's not really something you need
yeah like I haven't regretted buying
this phone when it first came out like
back in the summer um I really love it I
mean I know there's a lot of good phones
out there I like the droid DNA and the
One X plus a lot of other good phones
that I probably would have bought if I
hadn't gotten this but I haven't been
dissatisfied like my previous phone I
actually got a windows phone back in
2010
and then verizon announced the iphone 4
and i said i should have gotten that
instead so uh no no but you you know
honestly the iphone 4 on verizon was
like terrible because if you know then
connect LT um and you it wasn't a world
phone you can add you couldn't add a sim
card on it was just that I don't know I
i hated the iphone for verizon that was
me the problem with verizon is is you
know their LTE network is insanely
gorgeously great but their 3g network is
terrible either fallback network is
terrible i don't know I I there die
whenever I travel to the US I use a lot
of verizon products but I actually use a
verizon phone with an LTE see with an
AT&amp;amp;T sim so that's that i'm actually on
AT&amp;amp;T and i have LTE here so i know i'm
lucky yeah so it's really nice then
you're in a big metro with AT&amp;amp;T oh
you're lucky yeah speeds are pretty
decent higher than average about the
same as my Wi-Fi network hear that guys
that is fine yeah I'm not gonna start
talking about my Wi-Fi speeds no comment
any final thoughts um i was gonna ask
you about the galaxy s4 cuz um i don't
know if i want to upgrade I mean it's
gotten a lot of hype and I know that I'm
gonna have a family plan pretty soon
right now the only one with a smartphone
in my family so uh I was thinking well
if I actually get an upgrade because I
know there's one family member who's
actually willing to take my galaxy s3
surprisingly so yeah don't you just love
Pamela yeah yeah so uh what are your
thoughts I mean should I upgrade to the
next one cuz i'm satisfied wherever I am
well it all depends on what it what it
is exactly that you're using your phone
for or what it is exactly what you're
expecting from the s4 um well I kind of
like surprises so I don't make up my own
rumors or look at really so just just to
rephrase my question then the s3 already
does at
you throw at it it's a fast phone it's
got a great display ok the s4 will
probably have a higher resolution which
in my case I don't really care about
full HD I'm fine with with a qHD or with
a 720p display the camera on the s3 is
as good so it all comes down to when it
comes down to me it all comes down to
preference is it better than any aspect
which interests me and for the moment
that has to be better than the one ah ok
well I mean right now I'm satisfied with
it I know a couple people actually quite
a few people with the s3 we don't really
do like those features like s beam and
stuff but I mean I was just because it's
a popular phone that maybe idea it is a
popular phone I mean you're a teenager
and the problem is we're teens and I'm
try try to be a teen every now and then
we liked we like to be in style then I
mean we like to have what's popular but
you know to answer your question up if
you have the opportunity to upgrade I
always recommend that you do because the
problem with Android and specifically
with the galaxy s3 on AT&amp;amp;T because I
have the same exact phone I have the
same s3 yeah is that that is the dual
core Snapdragon um apparently this this
device that's coming is either the
Snapdragon 600 or the X and O's 5 and
they are they are insanely better that's
one but probably the biggest problem is
it took like three months for that
galaxy s3 to get jelly bean um so the
problem is whenever android 5.0 out
it'll definitely reach it'll definitely
reach that galaxy s4 first and then
you'll have to wait for the galaxy s3 to
get so if i were you i would definitely
get rid of it as fast as i can yeah
probably i'm still waiting for that
update where you get like the
multi-window features and all those
other galaxies I'm school why do you
think i'm using the note to you know
honestly I prefer the s3 um but I get
multi window only here because the note
the the s3 on AT&amp;amp;T sadly does not have
the up
yeah I don't like the carrier carrier
approvals of the updates I didn't really
understand why they did that that's
android system and that's a complete
different discussion Joe would you want
to come in and then we'll just have to
get our last call uh so excuse me this
is my cold that I'm still recovering
from again um just a public service
announcement based on what you just said
with s beam turn it off please everyone
else I don't need turn on your Android
Beam keep that on keep your NFC on for
that so then with your Samsung device
you can still send stuff right over to
me with my with my Nexus and then love
jewelry right there here here whoa I
can't look at that um but no I've got a
friend who just got an s3 and he had s
beam on and was like check this out is
so awesome and he tried to show me how
cool it was I of course I know how cool
it is but I had to make them feel
special right and it never worked he's
like this never works with anybody I've
tried this with everybody and I thought
if it was going to work with anyone it
would work with you why isn't it working
and all I had to do was go in turn s
beam off and then everything works with
me and everything works with everybody
else Wow just samsung why why don't I
see why they do it they've done some
wonderful things but use that as an
enhancement that is automatically
enabled when you're a samsung talking to
a samsung so that you're still
compatible with everyone else so
everybody out there who's listening if
you've got an s3 turn s beam off but
turn Android Beam on so that you can be
compatible with everybody in it it'll
make your life a lot easier and simpler
down to the question which I don't even
remember if I remember it all the way
anymore because I ramble ah the the
problem with well let me rephrase I've
got the nexus 4 right now am I gonna get
the nexus 5 when it comes out yes good
nature my job if I were an ordinary
regular person probably not what I
gotten the nexus 4 I had the Galaxy
Nexus would I have gotten that if I were
just at a normal everyday regular person
no absolutely not the person can be look
at me look at me I'm a regular ordinary
person I mean not in the industry my
wife still has a Galaxy Nexus and loves
it absolutely loves it it does
everything she needs to and it's running
the latest version of Android because
it's a nexus if I had to buy a new phone
to get the new version of Android yeah I
do that I'd be forced into it and I'd
begrudgingly fork over you know a big
wad of cash to be able to get it but I
shouldn't have to and that that whole
carrier approval for upgrades just it
ticks me off don't even get me started
on it I should be able to just like
Apple does just like Nexus real Nexus
not verizon or sprint Nexus like real
Nexus devices do it should come right
from the manufacturer and everything
should just you know two weeks after the
update released everyone who has that
phone should have the new version but
yeah to mirror what hi May said yeah the
new version of Android is going to come
out to the five before it comes out to
the four and it may even come out to
that six or eight months after you know
android 5 has been released which is sad
but that's another topic altogether yeah
that's kind of why I rooted it so yeah
okay Bowl we have to wrap it up if we
need it can be have to have another cold
so thank you very much for joining us
and please do come back next week and if
you hear something in the background
it's the plane landing Tony lives in the
baggage claim at the local airport so so
okay just leave it at that thank you
very much and who's next to pick
somebody it's gonna be our last call

anymore forget it so this is it tells
about you were you from it's really you
shouldn't have to change yeah I just
make it I just make it easy for
everybody else yes it does about you
where you from well I'm from London
basically oh nice nice but you still you
still have an Indian accent so you you I
living in yeah all right cat never knew
you well the thing is I and I don't know
I have a lot of friends that are from
India I actually have a lot of friends
that fly in India um and they've brought
friends from there and you know it's
just really it's like if I spoke in
English but in on gluten accent or tony
is is is either Russian a Romanian
accent it's just really easy to tell
where you're from yeah that's true yeah
it could be because you know because of
your heritage but what tell us about you
what device you're using well mine is
kind of a long story basically i had a
HTC Desire few months ago and basically
fell out the window oh my god I think
you're gonna be like you're gonna make
joke right I'm already holding back to
tears i'm looking at that going on oh
yeah this is the gloss from it oh my god
it's nothing still alive no that's no
way ok basically and I've been like I'm
out of contract pretty soon so I've been
like i just bought a pay-as-you-go like
kind of nokia just yeah yeah just just
hold on and just hold on a so yeah
you're the perfect guy for them for the
questions right now because you you're
gonna be
ready for a new phone very right that's
why so first of all condolences to your
HTC Desire you know that that was the
basis for the for the nexus one which
was my first android phone and i still
love that thing to death I wish honest
today I wish they still made phones that
then that portable that beautiful that
was a beautiful phone yeah is a sense
was just right then it was it was
perfect but okay tell us since you're
about to switch contracts what is your
next driver what are you looking into
you know that's what I mean like after
my main problem I'm torn between the one
HTC One and the Sony experience said oh
not even considering the s4 nice because
it's it's am just touch with which is
just too um I don't know who's right if
you're doing alluded it's convoluted
crayola it's not mature if you get one
me it's kind of like I think it's mature
I think that it doesn't look that good
or it depends on your taste but it's
definitely mature I think it's one of
the most but your custom ui's on top of
Android ever copied iOS not really but
I'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to help
you out here um okay so first of all um
with HTC you have something which i
consider to be maturity in design well
both in the design of the device and the
design of the UI I mean whoever told the
and I'm sorry to say this but it's just
true whoever told the idiot it's samsung
that we want to read email with a black
background and white text you are nuts I
mean it's slow black beer that's okay
yeah I believe that HTC has the best
taste when it comes to the design of the
UI I feel that they put a lot of thought
into what really matters in the way you
use a phone and that's why the One X
would be my daily driver if it wouldn't
for the trashy camera that's right i
don't compromise on the cameras oh ok
now okay so let me move on to the
experience
or the experience that as you're calling
it okay so you've got a couple of things
there first of all this is a okay so
knee doesn't the good thing about sony
is there not just the phone maker um
they make tvs um and they are obviously
also make the playstation and everything
and this phone actually sells you some
old playstation games one um this phone
is rugged it's waterproof so it's you
know better than the than the HTC One
which is not and one of the best things
about it is the fact that the galaxy s4
camera and the iphone 6 camera are gonna
be made are gonna be based on that Sony
sensor that you're gonna guess what I ya
on the Xperia Z but probably the best
selling point for the experience e right
now is the fact that you just go pick it
up at the store right now that's she so
what you another one is expendable money
in all honesty in all honesty if I were
and I'm gonna use Joe's phrase here if I
were an ordinary guy and I would have to
choose between the two I love the 1x to
death but I feel that this I feel that I
hate Xperia phones by the way I reviewed
the Xperia S and you know it was a good
phone but it wasn't a great phone I feel
that Sony really got it right with their
new Xperia line and I do feel that I
would give him all right hey hey yeah
yes I i would i would give him a chance
ok i but that's that's me again that's
my money so in your case you've got it
you've got a tough choice i don't know
about the rest of the guys you're
choosing between something awesome and
beautiful on one hand and something
beautiful and awesome on the other hand
i don't think you're going to go wrong
and let's loop in the that the sgs4 as
well if you pick any one of those four
devices you're going to be really really
happy with your choice you might suffer
envy over somebody who has something on
their phone of the other two that you
don't have on yours but you've got stuff
on yours that they don't have on there
so these are all wonderful technology
they're built by top of the line
companies pick what you think you want
and
and rest assured that whichever decision
you make you're gonna love what you have
now I cannot be four so go ahead go
ahead go ahead go I don't know how long
were these phones gonna be supported by
the manufacturers 20 a closet unit cuz
like i have google nexus of say android
version 5 is coming out soon so I'm just
like you know okay okay okay I I am
going to give you a downside to get me
telling a sony phone um you know they've
done a good job in trying to make their
experience as stark as possible but they
are extremely late when it comes to
android updates um HTC has done a better
job with the one lineup they managed at
least for the unlocked versions to get
the the the updates a month after the
launch of whichever new version of
Android is out so HTC is doing a better
job you know I just what pisses me off
the most about the HTC one is the
compromise it's like you get expandable
everything on the on the galaxy s4 which
that's gonna be the case um and then
Arnie on the Xperia Z I at least can
expand the memory um but on the HTC One
I'm not gonna be able to expand anything
so that's pray Sony's phone so thin I'm
pretty sure HTC could have found a way
to insert and we called throughout
somewhere you get my point yeah like it
was so to pick up what Jaime was going
in the past yes sony has been very slow
comparatively speaking to HTC to update
their os's we've recently had the whole
Xperia in the AOSP which we might see
some AOSP releases that are more timely
now than we had in the past so we if we
use history as an indicator of what
they're going to do in the future future
absolutely right but there's that little
inkling of hope that I have for a nexus
Xperia or at least you know Nexus
developers who are contributing and
adding that are going to help speed up
the implementation of AOSP versions of
Android onto the xperia even if that's
just a Sony branded experience they'll
still have all the
libraries and all the check-ins and all
the contributions of developers in the
open and source that are contributing to
AOSP that they will be able to use and
bootstrap into their own custom versions
of Android you know bottom line I don't
know how it is in the in the UK but at
least in the United States you can just
go pick up the phone if you don't like
it you can return it in less than 30
days so you could probably just go give
the tryout to the Xperia Z which is
already out there we have heard rumors
that the HTC one is going to have some
manufacturing constraints initially so
you could run into issues waiting for
that phone so you could probably just
try this one for now and if you don't
just returned and swap but we are sadly
running out of time um so it's been a
real pleasure talking to you again
whatever choice you make is going to be
a good choice as Joe was mentioning if
it was my money I would go for the
Xperia Z even though I love the one the
HTC One so back for that much I'll
handed over to Tony it was a pleasure
