my best phone ever fr he's one of pocket
now excuse me I'm is one of pocket
knives team members one of the many team
members rapidly losing weight Taylor's
losing some I guess Taylor went to go
went to go I'm not gonna forget it
forget it we'll talk about it later well
we were talking about something before
you came on the air but I haven't made a
joke though yeah don't worry about a
different losing weight but temporary
Lori luck I'm sure you lost about three
pounds right now before we started
recording
the point is it's funny I was talking to
Brandon earlier because I'm going to be
covering Aoife in Berlin with Anton
denote possibly the the biggest weight
loss champion on the team right now and
I was joking with Brendan minimum
earlier in the day that I'm when we go
to e4 this year this time I'm going to
be the fat one because I haven't lost
anyway so i was about to say you're
gaining weight in your reigning hair
wait hold up am i gaining weight I never
said it was gaining weight I said the
wrist you guys are losing i don't i'm
not big because Vera all right well
screw both you guys it's all that Dunkin
Donuts coffee man i was about to say you
need to start following the active in
that galaxy s4 active start using it for
that wow wow wow come on my own podcast
to get roasted thanks thanks to ya when
your knees are occurring when I've been
there yeah your move been there way just
like I'm not a fat guy whoa so you're
saying I was no where are you I don't
know I don't know these things I only
see you want the internet more than once
in my life yeah but it doesn't matter it
doesn't because even if you even if you
are it doesn't matter that's fine that's
right we don't know even if you are we
love you like a flat City that's exactly
right yeah I have no idea how to get out
of this anyway why don't we talk about
technology how's that ok let me think
knology that'll make you slimmer that no
I'd know cuz that's boring technology
what about a very slim android phone oh
that's very nice like that I like it but
you know what before we do that I'm
gonna crush your segway and I was about
to say wow Taylor is that a segway no
right he was he was learning but then I
just smacked him down we need to just
your learnings no listeners that we are
not stopping everything or Aoife there's
stuff coming out even as we speak we
have received in the office some devices
in the past couple days Taylor Martin is
going to be getting a droid ultra I
think tomorrow is that correct that is
correct yes motorola droid ultra does a
verizon unit obviously and i have a
feeling that Taylor is going to be able
to milk that for for quite a bit we're
going to have a maybe a comparison
between that and the ex-im if my psychic
powers are working correctly we have
about 40 videos on schedule for the
droid ultra yeah
okay that's a lot that's a lot but no
but it's probably of confidence well
that's good that's coming up there's I
just posted a video with the ax t vest
neo compared to the a texty and since
you probably don't care about that
there's a review coming up on the t VES
neo and since you probably don't care
about that there is also a huawei ascend
p6 in my are you but are you burning
windows phone is that what I'm here I'm
learning right now that's the problem no
exactly that's the problem right no I'm
the leading Windows Phone cheerleader
right behind Adam Lane on the team and
Adam doubt but even given that these
devices are not my favorite things to
carry on I'm very much looking forward
to getting rid of these mid-range phones
masquerading as high-end devices at
least the price is right yeah fifty
bucks on contract for the achieve an S
yeah rent and 0 for the 8xt on country
but I never judge Windows Phone by the
price tag I'm and the Lumia 920 was a
hundred dollars after two-year contract
and that was not a hundred dollars phone
no absolutely absolutely you're right
but you know what the funny thing was
that these phones came out on sprint by
the way listeners if you don't not
familiar with sprint these are the first
two windows phone 8 devices ever to
launch on sprint they are very late to
re-enter the party for various reasons
but they launched at at I think a
hundred bucks and fifty or one hundred
and fifty and a hundred or something
like that and within like a week they
were discounted by I mean the prices
were just slashed on him so I I don't
know what that says about back-to-school
promos I don't know what it says about
the perceived worth of the devices but
you should not not everybody wants a
purple phone man it's not purple it's
California blue it's like it's like shea
stadium was bro it's a good little error
speaking of price cuts though that uh
that nexus 4 I know I'm a little off
topic here but yeah what's it i didn't i
didn't realize it until this morning but
they dropped the price to 199 and yet
250 for the uh yeah 16 gigabyte model
250 for a no-contract nexus 4 that is in
sad is crazy that's cheaper than the
look like out i want to buy two of them
just just in case something ever happens
to one of the runs I'm using you know
it's funny cuz the nexus 4 was what i
was going to invest in before i got the
Moto X the customized Moto X and i will
say since we're on this brief jaunt into
android that I'm no longer regretting my
white face plate choice on the Moto X
I've discovered that it's the perfect
summertime phone you take my phone out
in the sunlight and it looks great well
son summer times about to end son you
know you know I Taylor there's a reason
you don't work you don't work at
buzzkill international alright which
it's okay to be happy here on the pocket
and weekly it's okay speaking of buzz
killington um galaxy gear sorry I'm just
practicing segues and it's good good for
you know we have to jump into Aoife
stuff we're trying to keep this light
with mon kill a Segway man making pale
it haha no cuz it's a good one we have
to jump a diva and but we're not going
to talk about galaxy gear so eat it the
first we are gonna do that later the
first thing we're talking about is the
galaxy note 3 now this is a mainstay of
Aoife ooh the galaxy note now correct me
if I'm wrong gentlemen the galaxy note
the first edition one was announced at
Aoife two years ago correct yes yes yes
and then the second one was last last
year and so I was there for that with
Tony and Aoife the reason it's close to
my heart this show is because it's the
first trade show I ever covered and so
it's you know I've special memories from
the event even though a lot of things
went wrong but the galaxy note 2 was
announced then and I that is when I fell
in love with the phablet category I
didn't take the first galaxy note
seriously I thought it was hilarious and
then it became somewhat successful and I
sort of took it somewhat seriously
intellectually but it wasn't until the
galaxy note 2 came out that I really
embraced the phone and then I got one
and it has been my it has been a
consistent source of my what do you call
that when you bounce back to a previous
lover besides you know a predictable
human behavior can I say that can I say
that I'll go yeah we bout thank you it's
been my consistent rebound phone
sentence and so yeah about every three
weeks I'll pop my son back my galaxy
note I'm like yeah I remember the s-pen
this is fun the big screen big battery
so anyway it is also my show phone so
i'll be taking the galaxy note 2 over
there to see the galaxy note 3 until you
have a go to note 2 as well i do have
the the international version oh I have
the t-mobile version wait you have a
galaxy note 2 down there as well yeah
all three of us
the air have Galaxy Note 2's that's
pretty cool hi mate I'll trade you of
course this go ahead make the point that
samsung also sort of flooded the market
with these things I think they're this
was the most plentiful review unit I'd
ever seen where I reviewed it three
times we yeah we had our mouths like
we're halfway through a sentence is like
a samsung do you have any galaxy note 2
and they were like yeah we got eight you
want you here take take take 16 so okay
i left the US launch party with two and
then they sent me another one in the
mail of two or three weeks later yeah
yeah sorry crazy right isn't it nuts
inside sometimes review units are really
hard to get hold of and sometimes
there's just a dump truck that shows up
and yeah they were like don't let
anybody see the second unit and they
stuffed it in my book bag and I walked
out with it no but but they did the
right thing I mean I think all of us
love the galaxy note 2 I mean it took me
it took me a while to convince brandon
and give me his because that the 1i have
is actually his room everybody gave it
to me at sea at CES in vegas yeah yeah
yeah and I you know he was that he was
like are you really gonna use this phone
I'm like it give it a try and I haven't
stopped using it it's probably one of my
favorite phones so we've spoken about
the virtues of the galaxy note 2 before
we've been over this territory before
that what is coming in the note 3 we've
heard a lot of rumors but an audible
venture to say that not a lot of the
rumors that are believable are not
hugely exciting but I don't mean to say
that as though I'm surprised this seems
to be Samsung's year of incremental
upgrades right yeah that's every year
well not really because of the three the
galaxy s3 okay there's three with my
argument that that was a big step up
right yeah but it we've sought at the
beginning this year in Barcelona when
they unveiled the note 8 which was a new
category you know it was bringing the
note line to a new form factor excuse me
a new sighs you know segment and even
then it wasn't mind-blowing we're about
to do an after the buzz on the note 8
this week and I enjoy the product but
even when Anton and I were looking at it
in Barcelona I was like it's kind of
just like a really blown up galaxy s3
isn't it with a wit with an estimate or
like a really shrunk it down galaxy note
2 more precisely and that seems to be
holding true and all the rumors we're
seeing here it looks like a slightly
expanded
galaxy note 2 rumors say what is this a
five point six eight inch screen versus
the existing 5.5 inch yeah it's kind of
all over the place because we've heard
six point three five point nine five
point seven five point eight we've right
so many we've heard so many sizes you
know Fred first we heard 6.3 and 5.8 and
then the galaxy mega came out I know
that's why they have all those panels ok
yeah comment on that you know the
problem with the note 2 is that you know
I I've never heard I've never been in a
scenario where we've seen so many
conflicting rumors we've got some leaked
photographs of a square display like
five weeks four weeks ago and now
yesterday we got leaks of the panel
which just looks like a blown-up galaxy
s4 you know that's right so it's gonna
be in this upset yeah and then we were
hearing optical image stabilization and
then apparently samsung had to kill it
because other cameras yeah their vendors
not ready on the camera and now as of
yesterday we're hearing that the cameras
gonna be capable of 4k video which is
you know guys I still find this funny
I'm not gonna be able to afford a 4k TV
for the like the next five years why you
know it's cool to have the capability I
just wonder where am I gonna watch it
you know that's very true but now is
this something i have a question is this
something where like we talked about
with 1080p screens like when 1080p
displays on smartphones were rumored we
were like this is ridiculous we can't
see pixels on 720 why do we need 1080
and then the droid DNA came out and we
were all like oh now you can see that
can't you you know is this gonna be
something like that where it's like ease
no it's it's 10 it was cuz it's 4 x 1080
p i mean come on what's the point about
recording something in for cave the
video size is gonna be so big you're not
gonna be able to keep it well there's
that and and who has a 4k television
he's going to have one for the next you
guys down five years I've got like 12
you can have one of mine I mean it's
it's a feature that it I think for now
for now it's gonna be like the HTC was
it evo 3d yeah like who really cares
about having 3d video if it knew cares
about having take care of that if it's
cool if it's done right but nobody's
done it right so nobody nobody's on
1080p video
right yeah nobody nobody's done it right
and listen it's not like if we're
complaining about progress there's
nothing wrong with that working video
it's just one of those things that I
wish wouldn't have been yet and they
would have focused their guns on
something else like optical image
stabilization which doesn't prove
low-light performance on it yeah optical
image stabilization is like the new
thing it's gonna be the thing and in six
months you're gonna really need to have
it it's gonna be on most smartphones
right now you really need to have it on
a new product for us to take the camera
seriously I feel like and yeah that was
quick i mean that that just started
happening you know with the Lumia 920
right yeah so yeah in under a year it's
become basically a standard and my
problem with 4k is that basically if
somebody uses that in a camera on a
phone they're doing it mainly for the
selling feature the spec list saying
this can shoot 4k right nobody cares
that they can't utilize it or that it
looks like crap its 4k it's like I've
got like quad-core processors a year ago
yeah just tell me how many camcorders
you know like affordable camcorders in
the market right now can shoot 4k yeah
again I really matters like a system of
measurement nice and I don't mind I
don't mind that we get if we get a 4k
display on the phone because let's just
say that the next thing next year will
be 4k displays on phones I don't know
what the point is gonna be but at least
you don't need something else to enjoy
the display meaning you'll have a 4k
display you're gonna be able to see it
right there and enjoy it right there
whatever it's gonna do it's gonna do it
fine but what's the point about 4k video
if you can't enjoy it yeah yeah there's
a solid point I still have a camcorder
as a unit of resolution measurement that
you know I guess the only reason was
lots of resolution on that camera 14
camcorders I guess the only reason why I
would like 4k is like if they would
figure out a way to do like what you can
do with the Lumia 1020 you take a
photograph and then use crop in its
Robin and in pixel double if they can
figure out a way to do that meaning i
could shoot a video right now and then
crop into a portion of the video and
have that be 1080p and have that not be
pixelated and i would enjoy it but I
don't think they're gonna be able to do
that with that sensor with a sense for
that big I don't think they're gonna
figure that one out at least not yet no
but you can do that with the 1020 you
you can zoom in and you're still
recording a 1080p correct no you're
you're actually your cropping into the
video you're making it smaller I believe
I don't know what in video mode i'm not
sure i'd answer that but i don't know i
want to get away from the camera for it
for a second because we don't we just
don't know enough about the camera here
well okay good to answer your question
taylor before we prefer begin yeah
you're not losing 1080p but your your
pixel your pixels are becoming bigger
the more you zoom in so it's not really
1080p the final format of the video is
1080p but the real pixels were taking up
like four five six eight depending on
how many how much you zoom into a clip
so it's not really zooming alright so
we've established a little bit about the
display one thing we should touch on is
that I feel like four months and months
and months the galaxy note 3 has been
associated with this rumors of a
flexible display which we should
probably should probably say even if it
is included doesn't mean a flexible
phone primarily that is a that is a
savings in weight and thickness that may
be a shadow resistance you got a
resistance yeah how is that the case
though because even if it's a flexible
display the display elements they're
still protected by a layer of glass that
has to be something some kind of
conventional glass right yeah but yeah
it's not rigid anymore right if you drop
the phone like if you if you drop a
phone with a rigid display not bridgit
glass covering the display a rigid
display that panel can shatter if you
shatter just the glass of that you could
replace just a glass if the display
doesn't shatter I using one of these
flexible displays then you could just
replace the glasses which is cheaper I
get you okay I understand that but most
of the thing i see shattered phones in
the real world I see shattered glass and
a perfectly intact display behind it
yeah but they could also just use
plastic over this flexible display
instead of glass which I would I would
ain't it fringe yeah and that's that
would be a samsung move that would be
what would be they wouldn't be able to
do that it's like
facet of this play mmm and that would be
like a surround you you can do that
together no you can make your capacitive
display with plastic do yeah you can but
but it woke a so it will be the worst
scratch magnin you could think wait you
don't see the palm pre yeah and by the
way regarding the regarding the flexible
display um actually that was like about
a week later after those rumors of a
flexible display then it came out that
both LG and Samsung had played this
crazy order a flexible displace to the
vendor but they're really looking for
using that for smartwatch to give it
more of like a pebble curvature and we
are going to get into that in a second
yeah we're gonna talk about that soon
but yeah I guess that's not coming on a
phone they're planning on using it on
something else actually so that yeah I
will stick out of that one I don't I
don't know I don't know enough to know
so that's what I'm gonna throw my hands
in exact way buddy and I was enough to
know back away I just don't think that
they're gonna come out with something
like crazy resolution airy on this phone
because the galaxy s whatever they're
gonna lie they're using the galaxy s as
the phone that pushes whatever
innovations and then the note 2 is just
the bigger version with a setting that
can also use the saddle thing this is
the timing no III agree so all these
rumors about a possible metal chassis
and all this stuff is like now we're not
gonna see that we're gonna see a larger
galaxy s4 yeah rather a larger galaxy
note 3 but that uses the design language
the galaxy s4 you know and I'm almost
want to say I'm okay with that just
because I I like the look of the galaxy
s4 you better and the galaxy s the
galaxy note 2 improved on the galaxy s3
in terms of its did feel in hand it
definitely feels more substantial and
not just because it's heavier and bigger
because it's built better and I hope
that that's the case here as well with
it with a note 3 but we will find out
about that and the last thing I want to
talk about is that the battery I think
they've I've seen this at a couple sites
I don't know if we reported on it but
looks like people are nailing down this
value of a 3450 milliamp hour battery
yeah which is slightly larger than the
30 100 ml and power pack that the
current note to rocks but I am
read that this won't represent a sizable
boost in endurance because it rips with
an eight-core processor right skizzy can
go up with the accident and no okay
apparently it's apparently okay so this
is an old rumor there are seven variants
of the same phone right actually at
seven variants apparently and one of
these is most of these are running the
Snapdragon 800 so if you get the
Snapdragon 800 plus that battery I'm
sure that's gonna be you know that's
gonna be a beauty now one of these
phones actually has an LCD panel and not
an a mole it is that the one that
they're saying that might be the Galaxy
Note active yeah and they're the rumor
in that that phone is also gonna have an
8 megapixel camera so so yeah so yeah so
apparently we are getting a note active
and I would guess a C's experience of
the note I don't care what the specs
I'll get it I loved that galaxy s4
active man I missed that thing well Liz
yeah I'm speaking of wanting I'm
actually as much of an advocate as I've
been of the note in the note 2 mm-hmm
I'm kind of math about this and I wrote
an editorial yesterday I said I may be
done with big homes for ever nom and
which is weird because you have like the
biggest hands on the team right yeah and
and I've loved im mean I've been a huge
advocate of the so-called phablet for
years now and I've looked bigger phones
and then I got the galaxy mega 6.3 and
co hey that's ridiculous that's not bad
that ridiculous they break absolutely
just destroyed me oh um because I just I
could not get into using the phone like
I usually get a new phone and I don't
care if I wanted to get it or not like I
might moan and groan when somebody's
like hey we're sending you this phone
and I'm like okay and then i get it and
i unbox it and I'm like okay I'm excited
yes let's have fun with this and in the
Z ultra was just kind of like sweet this
is awesome i was excited about getting
it and then it came and I'm like oh yeah
this doesn't fit anywhere no I saw one
on the bus the other day looks
ridiculous I had nowhere to put it
didn't fit in my pockets I had to sit it
in my car seat because it wouldn't fit
in the console picture and you're like
I'm picturing you like buckling it in
with
seatbelt did you have a child safety
seat for this yeah yeah did you tie a
balloon to it just in case it wandered
off I mean there was just nowhere to put
the phone except for in my bag and if I
put it in my pocket it literally jabbed
me in the stomach when I sat down so I'm
going out with my friends to restaurants
and stuff and I'm just like you know
squirming around in the seat trying to
fix my phone because it's just not
comfortable by the way like is it like
right now it's like eleven o'clock in
Romania somewhere in some dance club in
Romania Anton's like Anton's is just
like perking up and like looking up into
the air and like sniffing and going some
that was my right on the podcast that
phone has to be mine he said it's like
he said he was done with big forms to
what yeah he's always wanted tablet this
is the guy yeah this is a guy who loves
tablet phone so if you ask him I will
ask him because I'll see him next week
I'll ask him that very thing yeah he
said after the PadFone he was all right
I I'm gonna make the point here Taylor
though that those two phones that you
cite I think are not even in its case of
the Sony device i don't think it's
properly positioned i think that's a
small tablet not a big phone and you
said as much and i think that the galaxy
mega is just ridiculous so if you put
those aside the fact that they're not
really either well-made or well targeted
products you know the Galaxy Note family
is the handheld ones the phablet
versions so you know I think that's good
keep it if they keep it around the same
size but what they're going to look at
five point six eight inches if that's
true you know that's like basically
because 5.5 is is pretty good I think
yeah yeah if they keep it around the
same size i'll be happy yeah much it
that doesn't necessarily mean i'll get
it though because I mean as much as I've
loved the note 2 and I mean I still use
it now you know from time to time I'm
actually really enjoying having a small
phone again and I think it's because I
carry two phones again yeah that is that
is it if you carry more than one device
but then you get into our territory of
like get tech dudes and I don't want to
get too far away from I don't want to I
get worried about good losing touch with
normal people you know after a while
because most people don't carry more
than one phone you know and we all carry
it like 16 at a time you look at the
forum threads at the pocket on forums
what's in your bag Michael Fisher like
86 devices then do you really want me to
answer that exactly he's one response to
the thread took up like three pages yeah
it was it was it was nuts so so I like
to stay in touch with people who only
carry one phone and I understand
Samsung's decision to continue improving
the note line even if it's only
marginally and we don't know maybe maybe
it'll be massive but one thing that I'll
say is if these rumors are true which I
think they are that we're going to see a
marginal increase its just an
incremental upgrade that's sad because
to me last year the note 2 was very
exciting not just because it was
represented an improvement in aesthetic
design but because it brought in so many
useful features and cool features that
it kind of totally reinvented the Galaxy
Note like the first one with this
experiment that went right but the
second one was like now we've got a
polished consumer product here and watch
us sell millions and then they did so
that yeah that was cool wasn't it yeah
no I mean the mode the multi-window the
the hovering of the pop-up yes sir and
that you have a browser I mean that they
really figured out okay we're gonna ship
a big displayed let's not just make this
a big phone right let's make let's make
it useful right I'm afraid they're gonna
go galaxy s4 with it though and what I
mean by that is is throwing in all these
yes vote innovations where and I said it
today in an editorial I wrote I don't
want to tilt my head to scroll in the
browser and I don't know anyone that
does and and that's kind of Samsung's
thing as they're like ooh this is a good
idea let's do it mm-hmm but and and and
I feel that they're gonna probably do
that with a couple things and it kind of
detracts from the whole experience and
yet i was comparing that with the moto x
because i was i was saying that nobody
wants to tilt their head to scroll in
the browser and nobody wants to scrunch
up their nose and blink twice to you
know fire the shutter in the camera like
nobody wants to do these really weird
unnatural things and and motorola has
actually kind of used real use cases to
improve the phone and and samsung it's
it's like they have this disconnect with
the real world where you know if you
stand on your head
phone will do you know crazy things it's
like why I don't understand so that's my
fear with with the the note 3 I said the
Samsung what I'm good I just imagined
the project manager going into the
engineering department of being like
okay guys we're gonna build what sensors
are we're building into this phone and
they're like oh this and this and this
okay what can I do with these sensors in
that you know everybody just brainstorms
like 20 ideas and he's like okay build
them all into the phone yeah yeah you
know it right and like like cross your
eyes for pinch to the counter-argument
pinch-to-zoom the counter-arguments all
that of course is like why not right so
the counter-argument is why not include
all these features and if you don't like
him you can just disable them right but
in but throwing that many features into
the phone to begin with you know first
of all diluted it is and they're not
invisible it's not like they're just
hanging out back there the phone prompts
you out of the box is like you want to
enable all this crap and you're like
yeah sure and even if you don't do that
they're in the toggles the notification
toggle shade all the time so the thing
just feels loaded down you know what is
loaded down the system images like is
huge footprint is massive so but we've
we've covered all this before we'll see
what Samsung does in the future let's
keep our eye on the on the ball here and
let's move on a little bit we're going
to come back to sams and oh I'm gonna
patent are you're gonna patent crossing
your eyes to pinch to zoom I think you
should do that release the Martin phone
I'd buy one let's talk a little bit
about a different phone from another
manufacturer for a second now this is a
manufacturer I don't know much about and
I say that in a lot of podcasts and you
know you got it you got to think that
sometimes maybe if I communicated more
with this company I'd know a little bit
more about him but we don't know we
don't know these things maybe we'll find
out maybe I'll get to meet some people
at Aoife maybe that'll change some
things guys tell me something about the
Sony Honami is this a is this a
smartphone what is this it is a
smartphone actually at first I thought
this was gonna be a phablet but it turns
out that this is like it's like a
continuation to the Xperia Z where you
know it's actually being rumoured that
it's gonna be called the Xperia Z what
you guys remember the name ok well yeah
it's yeah i was gonna exactly the z1 it
was rumored to be called the xperia i1
and then they changed it to z1
it's like a continued it's like a
continuation to the Z so what you're
getting is you know I'm knocking I I'm
knock I'm gonna knock on wood here and
I'm just hoping that they figure out the
display with this phone um whatever ok
let me stop you there I reviewed the Z
ultra and it has the new triluminos
display yet it doesn't have the one I
had does not have the X reality engine
yet it was using the mobile bravia to
engine to and honestly I just I didn't
feel the display I thought it was it was
okay it wasn't a mind blowing and I just
got absolutely just torn apart in the
comments of that review and I did I used
it beside the one the all the all the
different you know just lie types and I
read other reviews and they were saying
that the display was great but I
honestly didn't think it was amazing the
black levels are absolutely garbage like
black on this display looks her was like
light gray slate gray yeah yeah yeah it
was mediocre and people were just
ripping you can go read the comments now
it's just it's alyssa listeners the
reason why this is is because the
display yeah okay so when people when I
review the experience the elevat-- they
tore me as well they were like what it's
got the mobile the Mobile BRAVIA Engine
what and I'm like you know what I
reviewed the Xperia S which did have the
Bravia Engine one and that was a
beautiful display it's like if they
grabbed the this way of the HTC One X
and they just put it on there Sony it
was that's good yeah it was that good
the Xperia S had a beautiful display but
what is the Bravia Engine on the Xperia
ZL okay listen just imagine yourself
opening the photograph and then when you
open the photograph wait one second and
look for greens to look greener and look
at lose to look bluer that's really the
Bravia Engine it only works when you
open a photo ok you know it ramps up and
and I don't know if the X reality engine
is the same way I can't tell because
I've never used it because the Z ultra
that I review didn't have the X reality
engine and I tried to explain that I
explained it in the review and people
just didn't get
so yeah I started I met you know what
started having something happen over
here just in the last couple seconds my
eyes started defocusing and I started
salivating in anticipation of a yawn and
I think within about 10 seconds I'm
going to be asleep so can we talk about
the home that'll be good ok so the
Honami I'm actually I'm actually gonna
gonna praise sony and a couple of things
here before i continue talking about
this phone so apparently you're getting
a 20 megapixel camera i'm gonna praise
the fun of the sony later but okay so
you're getting a 20 megapixel camera and
rumors are that you are getting and i
don't know about optical image
civilization but i do know 4k video so
we go back to the same galaxy note
commentary forget about it you know
that's but that but aside from that it's
apparently a dedicated camera shutter
button is the rumor dedicate open well
almost yeah well the xperia ZL had one I
don't know busy all drill tro did too
yes good 0 sony continuing that that's
nice yeah and and and actually this is
gonna be a waterproof phone as well yes
it's dan apparently it's gonna have this
metal chrome band around it and it's
gonna be really thin metal chrome band
would seem to suggest that there won't
be the bevy of access doors in this one
exactly well well the ultra had a it was
a it wasn't chrome but it was an
aluminum band around the outside and it
had all the access to oh did it really
ok so now i'm gonna take that back sorry
yeah alright so that's that's pretty
cool what else we got there that's time
dragon 800 under the poet or an 800 is
we go to ram hunza bezel is there time
to bezzle from the images were saying
yeah on the top and bottom there's a lot
it just looks when you compare it to
something like the s4 which has very
very little bezel mm-hmm this looks
ridiculous or or maybe it's because i've
been using the Moto X for so long or for
a few weeks and it's just well you've
also been using the Lumia 1020 you
should be used to a little basil but now
yeah you know and listen again in my
review of the zeal that another comment
that i got like crazy was why are you
complaining about that 13 megapixel
camera ok the bottom line listeners is
you know Sony builds the sensors for
what you get on the iphone and the
galaxy s4 and just as that I don't know
what these company
do with the sony sensor that's better
than sony because photos on the 13
megapixel camera of the zeal were grainy
and I don't know what to expect about
this 20 megapixel camera as well sadly
yeah sadly i also don't know yeah sony
is is really big on emphasizing their
camera quality in their in their events
like you have motorola you know sort of
did that for the moto x but then once
the release happened or once we get
closer to release they really really d
emphasize the camera performance so
other companies kind of adapt on the
move it sony always seems to make this
big deal about like we were using the
Exmor RS and all this kind of stuff in
it's like yeah they're giving names to
everything and it's not listen by the
way but Taylor Martin's all three of us
have a sony NEX camera that we used to
film our videos yeah we love we are
happy we are happy sony customers when
it comes to their cameras but sadly
that's like if these two departments
didn't talk to each other over there in
japan it's like if they don't get along
it apparently is that product another
interesting thing I'm seeing about the
Honami in addition to it being
waterproof which you know I always love
is freaking the the battery looks like a
3000 milliamp hour battery from what I
understand yes yeah yeah on a bet on a
very thin phone apparently this this
phone is gonna be like really thin well
it doesn't look thin in the the pictures
that I'm saying but then again this
person's hand might be just extremely
small um yeah I can't tell I don't know
but uh if I have one note to add I've
used the Z and the Z ultra and they're
both built really really well there that
it's a very high point the the tablet Z
I have that as well same exact design
language they're all built very well but
they all have the same problem the glass
scratches so easily really it's dragon
trail right I haven't scratched my
xperia ZL that's interesting i scratched
the xperia z unboxing it no way yeah and
the ZL scratched with III babied that
thing I you know yeah I had to use it
with two hands thank you not yet not the
seal i mean the the old z ultra sorry
but i babied it yes
hi me but i babied it and I you know I
carried it two hands set it down gently
and everything and it just it got
scratched and I really just didn't take
a whole lot and that was a leak well
I'll admit for example the ZL is
probably i don't think i've ever used
the phone like the zeal without a case
for so long because i don't find cases
for that phone here and it is it looks
brand new it still looks brand new but
you know another thing that I'd probably
like to praise about Sony aside from
their build quality is you know this
phone is already running Android 4.2
point2 and this is like a first time
ever that Sony does this I mean ever
since they launched their xperia android
lineup you know we were already doing
froyo and they came up with it with a
cupcake phone hmm and then the Xperia S
they offered their their ice cream
sandwich update and they kept people
waiting for six months they said march
then April and May then June July when
you least expect that you got it in
October i was the taylor swift phone i
can't remember the name of that one I
don't want yeah there was a phone that
that it was an Xperia that they had like
a Taylor Swift special edition it might
be the ones you were talking about this
cupcake it took them like a year to
launch the phone because they couldn't
get the software right yeah and so and
so the point is Sony's getting really
good when it comes to software you know
i got android 4.2 point2 like almost
three weeks ago and yesterday I got
another update for some battery issues
um you know they're getting really good
at this they they're finally figuring
out their software updates that's
probably their implementations not the
best in the world but at least you mean
it's probably like one of the most
advanced films that I have right now and
that's like the first time ever Sony's
always been late and they finally
figured this one out so I guess that you
know let's see what we get with this you
know honami whatever that phone is gonna
be called but you know at least on the
software front they're doing a really
good job let's hope they go ahead I know
a lot of people don't like the sony
interface um I don't like the icons in
particular but that's about the only
thing i don't like about it yeah yeah i
actually enjoy the software and the
small apps it's not that we're cool yeah
the small apps or they've been done
before but the fact that you can turn
any
widget into a small app is amazing yeah
so you can just open like my press
widget I use press for RSS reader i can
open press and view that while i'm in
the browser you know it's just it kind
of one ups on samsung's multi window or
you know yeah the other floating apps
that are out there but as you can turn
anything into a float you know i am you
know in spin speaking of Samsung I mean
and speaking of Android as well I mean
none of the galaxy I mean not none of
the phones from last year galaxy note 2
galaxy s3 none of these phones have
gotten four point two point two yet and
Sony's already nailed it and for those
of you that are rocking the HTC One X
it's already got four point two point
two as well at least the international
very and I got it two days ago and it
finally made this phone usable again so
I mean Sony is one of those companies
that has figured that one out which is
interesting because Samson was really
good about updates before and now
they've become terrible well and then
carriers get in the game and you know
the updates thing is something that
might never get solved ever but yeah but
yeah we samsung said they're not doing
for that too because for that three is
there it's already out there were
hanging on it right yeah so this just in
222 new facts i'm sorry about my flurry
of typing before but it was a
time-sensitive issue i'm apparently i'm
going to a red sox game tonight hooray
hey that's a nice fun surprise secondly
I've just dispatched another email to
one of our contacts at Sony and
hopefully we'll be able to see this
thing once we once we arrive at Aoife in
a timely fashion we will definitely be
able to see the Honami it's just a
question of when and hopefully it will
be sooner rather than later in a related
note we we have a very very very busy
schedule at this year's Aoife and i
think we should move on a little bit but
i want to ask you guys about something
else we might see from sony at this
event and it's not the one ami but it is
an accessory and it's something we
talked about on the weekly before it it
looks like the most ridiculous thing
ever you remember the soup can we talked
about that goes on the back of your
phone makes you take pretty pictures yes
so yeah there's a there's a rumored
price for it now what is that rumored
price for this attachment
um one of them let me see if i could
find us they liked that didn't you
that's what it looks like all right let
me look what is it gonna be called
Campbell's or what the Sony Campbell's
Campbell all right so funny progressive
is called the qx100 and the other one is
a qx10 yes I said yeah the qx100 is uh
supposedly gonna hit at five hundred US
dollars these guys are nuts that's a
question oh wait a second that's the
price of an NEX five then why am I gonna
pay ya my bar why am I gonna pay ya
careful soup can that I have to attach
to my phone when all I could use as my
mirrorless camera that's stupid is
you're gonna be kind to things anyway
right yeah what's the other one great
2x10 is priced at approximately 230 US
dollars now it supposedly uses the same
sensor as the rx100 which is a very nice
camera ooh what hey wait a second that's
a full-frame sensor yeah it's an in one
inch sensor 1 inch 20 points megapixels
okay no hold it right there if you're
talking about a full-frame sensor on
that out of little frame but well the
rx100 that's what it has it said that's
the whole that's the only reason what is
it full frame sensor okay so when you
buy a DSLR you either get you know it's
not a full frame sensor and those are
like the entry-level cameras but if you
get the full frame sensor that's like
you're talking about canon 5 you know a
5d I'm on a really expensive camera okay
you have to bite like a really expensive
camera to get a full frame sensor and
what made this rx100 so popular is that
they figured out it fit that small
little sent that huge sensor into that
small little petite camera so it's it's
it's not a mirrorless camera it's like a
point it's a point-and-shoot camera with
a full-frame sensor that's what makes it
popular so I mean if they're gonna be
charging 500 bucks for that lens which
is a camera as well it's got a full
frame sensor that thing is gonna be out
of this world for 500 bucks now we're
talking wait no
go ahead know the rx100 isn't the rx1 is
a full frame okay x 100 is not full
frame it's a it's a cyber shot it's a
pocket okay well that's what wait a
second that but that's the thing they
are there was there's an RX
point-and-shoot camera that has a
full-frame sensor and that's why it's so
popular hmm it's like don't like the
camera it's like it's like a leica
camera it's a it's a portable it looks
like it like yeah that's the arm that's
the rx1 which is like a 2700 dollar
point-and-shoot camera yeah yeah so
that's not what we're talking about yeah
so we're talking about the rx100 which
is like seven hundred dollars or 750 so
you're getting that same sensor which is
still a great camera the the rx100 is
the best point and shoot you can get if
i'm not mistaken but this this little
Bowl tone attachment for your phone will
have the same sensor 20.2 megapixels as
the rx100 m2 so your mark 2 and that
that one's supposed to be around 450 to
500 and then the other one is 230 so
it's yeah I mean so these things seem to
be its I don't know what their strategy
is here right because you're carrying
their things that once the only thing
that makes this different than carrying
a smartphone and a dedicated really
awesome camera is that these are smaller
than a typical dedicated really awesome
camera they're not much smaller but they
are smaller so maybe that matters if you
are you know not if you're gonna be
wearing skinny jeans but if you're going
to be carrying like if you don't wanna
carry a bag but you are going to be
wearing a vest with a lot of pockets
imagine imagine imagine getting a phone
call with that thing strapped to your
phone and you wouldn't want to write so
it should be something that's so easy
that it the NFC is constantly aware and
then when when the apps NFC connection
is broken then it just disables it I
don't know maybe it's just some good
slap on quickly so Sony is making this a
seemingly it's an awesome product I mean
to be able to attach that to the back of
my Moto X and actually take decent
pictures is amazing i'd like to do that
and i actually probably would stop
caring and the moto x needs it yeah the
Moto X doesn't need this accessory but
they're making this accessory that is
the
it's not going to be marketed to a mass
consumer base because nobody is going to
actually want to buy that for 450 or 500
dollars now they're not going to see the
point of it because this is an accessory
you're selling an accessory for more
than what most people conceive a phone
to be worth exactly and Percy this is a
world where you can wear the galaxy
excuse me the LG g2 has an optically
image an optically stabilized camera
built into a body that doesn't have a
bulge in it basically you know that
that's you know that's the world you're
launching these these big old hockey
pucks into so I just it depends on who
the who the target consumer is maybe
we're all being short-sighted and
there's a there's a market for this
that's just been dying for this but I
don't know exactly what it is but I will
say this and I've said it before but the
geeky part of me is excited about it i
want to put aside my responsibility to
the consumer for a second and just think
about me because i do that well i'm a
selfish dude but it's like hey look
there's this nerdy thing that that that
attaches to your phone and enhances its
functionality like a tricorder
peripheral like a sensor package like
something anything that that actually
like gloms onto the back of my phone to
make it better for some reason I'm
really amped on that I don't know why
and just I like that I like hardware
that's customizable it's like an
exoskeleton for your phone yeah like an
Elysium did you see that there was an
awesome movie it was an awesome it was
not subtle but it was an awesome movie
it was not subtle at all but it was
great Jenna Foster's accent lol I don't
know just I'm trying to see if
functionality for this it's cool I mean
it just cost the same amount of money as
a camera and it's got almost the same
sizes of camera so what's the difference
about just carrying I am I know how do
you how do you move your pictures from
your camera to your phone when you're
okay okay so here's the thing that body
that body has storage it has its battery
it just needs the phone as a viewfinder
yeah so so yeah you can send the fight
I'm sure you can send the photos to the
phone with this like on a sony nex-5r
you can send them through Wi-Fi you can
do that so do that with my camera you
can do with the NEX just get a an eye-fi
card exactly 4 30 40 bucks exactly so I
guess my point is this is
cool it's just you know let's see how it
goes well yeah but I mean I used to do
that last summer I would go out and take
a bunch of pictures with my new camera
yeah and I used an eye-fi card and I
would just connect my phone to it for a
few minutes just let the picture sink
over and any picture I took with my five
in would be on my my iphone my iPad or
whatever I had connected to the eye-fi
card it's uh that to me seems like a
much more practical solution because
you're carrying it may be a little more
bulk but you're also getting the full
functionality of a camera that doesn't
need a smartphone exactly and it's
wonderful so all right so we've talked
this thing sorted to death and we'll see
it and we'll we'll talk about it next
week as well on special edition pocket
now quickly from Eva let's talk about
another product we're not sure or at
least I'm not sure is is called for
there's a rumored LG G pad tablet stop
like the things g and g anything LT so
LG G pad last year's products are gonna
be called the oh jeez oh god whoo so
yeah this we i think the details on this
one are pretty slim right we're looking
at a possibility 8.3 inch screen it's a
good start we like that resolution
excuse me like that size with 10 20 or
excuse me 1920 x 1200 resolution which
is also quite good I mean not quite good
but it's good and a quad-core processor
2 gigs of ram and a very thin form
factor with minimal bezels and an
aluminium back as a no brainer friends
would say for reduced weight and a lot
of Korean bloatware that you're not
gonna be able to read no well yeah yeah
there's that she likes to do that the
the optimus g pro that i had there was i
could use like a fourth of the things
that came pre-installed it came
pre-installed with over 70 applications
was like 85 or something that a cultural
thing is a blood we're kind of expected
in in the Koreas no I'm yeah yeah I
guess yes I mean it had something for
everything everything I mean it had the
TV app that I couldn't use
it had all sorts of crazy things that I
just couldn't use because they were all
ingredient and changing the language
didn't do anything so yeah you know just
on the face of it if you take off the
branding if you just look at the rumored
specs with this 8-inch screen it's an
okay resolution 2 gigs of ram and a very
thin form factor with an aluminum back
honestly you've got my attention do I
remember other devices from LG other
tablets having aluminum backs why do I
think this is familiar to me was there a
brushed metal suits yeah no I know I
seuss doesn't but did LG do any of them
I don't know but I know that aluminum
backs on tablets has proven tricky I
guess for Wi-Fi connection scratch
alluro connectivity yeah because the the
ax sous which one was that transformer
pad I don't remember which one it was
they're naming so awful but um I had one
and Wi-Fi would cut out i was like maybe
15 feet from the router and Wi-Fi would
just drop off and they would reconnect
and it would drop off and it would
reconnect and they released an update to
it with a plastic cover over the
antennas and it worked fine so you get
around that then yet and we all like it
go ahead go ahead go ahead my friend I
was just saying the plastic look like it
wraps around the edge on one side so it
might be where the antennas are the only
thing to look forward to on this phone
is a very boring event and yeah LG
builds the I pest IPS this place that
Apple uses and those are good they're
state-of-the-art so we can expect the
beautiful display on a tablet uh that is
probably just gonna be another me to
tablet I guess and it's probably
probably and I'm just going out on a
limb here it's probably gonna miss the
mark by 10,000 miles on price oh yeah
yeah that's the thing when you have the
nexus 7 which is arguably one of the
best tablets have ever used in my life
for two hundred and thirty bucks how do
you compete with that how do you kiss
tells you in detail yeah yeah lgb we
would be taking a hit on the price
whereas Google doesn't really care if it
does it pays a sous to make the tablets
it sells them through its own store and
it makes the money back through google
play yeah so good point so how can
anybody compete
that well they'll do is you take a whole
bunch of features and you slap him on
there and you know LG does this to a
similar extent that Samsung does but now
I'm gonna beit's AC get it really bad
well I don't know that g2 announcement I
will tell you this I was not in love
with the the build quality or the choice
of materials for that device I don't
think it's very good-looking I don't
like the way it feels in my hand I don't
really think I would ever carry it for
its for its physical attributes but some
of those features i found compelling i
liked their multitasking approach i
liked some of what they were doing with
multi screen I don't think the UI is
very pretty but its functionality it
might come in handy in some in some
instances you know okay okay so you're
telling me that you did not doze off at
that event now that event oh no I liked
that event because that isn't taylor and
i were liveing on the air yeah we could
not fall asleep I was in the audience
and I won't tell you that event treated
me like an adult did not insult my
intelligence didn't make too many lame
jokes and actually revealed a compelling
thing or two so no I would never give LG
bunk about that event i SAT through you
know I survived Radio City I don't want
to talk about yeah as long as there's
not a tap-dancing kid on stage usually
I'm happy anyway so didn't yallah but
when I get married and you're at my
wedding no madam that's a kid jump out
in the middle leaving I'm leaving I'm
gonna live tweeted angrily and I'm gonna
leave Oh Joe Levi segue I know so let's
talk about something that's actually
compelling to me that apparently no one
else cares about this was funny because
um I sent an email to Steven shank our
chief news guy and frequent guest on the
Pocket net weekly and Anton yesterday
there was a galaxy gear news leak if
this is about galaxy gear at Samsung's
rumored SmartWatch or almost confirmed
SmartWatch I guess and I was like oh I
saw this at another outlet oh my god
wonder if we've reported on this so i
sent it to Steven and Anton like Oh guys
this is awesome i'm drooling and anton
sends back this wise remark raised like
hey you should check out pocketnow.com
and add them to your RSS feed i hear
it's a really cool website and then
licks me
to a story that he wrote on the Galaxy
gear the problem was he he buried the
galaxy gear news in a story about the
galaxy note 3 screen size and that was
also the title image so it didn't grab
me I don't guys I don't get all excited
about seeing a screen component like I
generally won't click on that news story
but I know a lot of people will it's
only way so I got annoyed but then i was
like no you know what you're probably
right i'm not i'm a super nerd for
smartwatches so i would have put the
galaxy gear image in the headline and
maybe not a lot of people clicked on it
so i want to ask you guys before we talk
about this device specifically does the
galaxy gear excite either one of you at
all why or why not hi mayor gets to go
first mmm you guys have used a
SmartWatch I haven't I you know if it's
just gonna be another Android a
companion to my phone meaning that it
has the pair to my phone to be able to
work and it's just gonna save me three
seconds to pull the phone out of my
pocket and see what the watch is gonna
barely show me I'm not excited you know
unless unless somebody figured out a way
to make this unique in its own way
meaning that it had to be a watch you
couldn't do it in any other way than
watch then I would be interested in
buying that thing but other than that
you know if it's just another accessory
that I'm gonna have to charge you know
which is the really the reason why
Google glass is really so lukewarm I
mean people are not really excited
anymore about it because if you don't
pair it and you don't pay for for the
tethering plan you can't use it so
what's the point of having it hold on i
don't know this a whole nother i would
dispute your contention that no one's
excited about google glass anymore
because it listen it's just it's just
it's just hype but it's not functional
is what I'm saying let's see why not
talk about cuz we'll talk forever about
google glass when I want to talk about
that lid I wanted yeah Taylor what's
your what's your nagawa okay so one a
dispute hi mays claimed about you know
having to use an extra device to barely
read a notification because you know my
pebble has completely changed the way
I've used my phone yeah it stays in my
pocket unless I need to pull it out and
in the charging thing that's that's a
totally valid point but it's also still
up in the air because my pebble I just
tweeted today or Instagram yeah I saw
your tweet today yeah I don't remember
the last time i charged my pebble today
i charged it and i think i charged it
may be a week and a half two weeks ago
get out of here did you post an
Instagram photo of your pebble today yes
Jesus whatever stops like I was gonna do
that two hours ago I didn't know that I
was going to do that today I'm really
glad I didn't because you and I are
still doing the same thing at the same
time that's okay we are here here's
here's the thing Taylor you have an
e-ink display watch it's different you
know this is a cool yeah it's he Taylor
well LCD no but it's fun implementation
of that but the point the point being is
color requires more power t paper um so
so listen LG has taken a stab at the
SmartWatch years ago like three years
ago and it was terrible Brandon reviewed
it then Sony came has come out with two
smart watches and they still haven't
taken up they're awful they're awful and
again again I'm listen we're geeks where
we live in a bubble we get a lot of
devices and it's our job to test them um
but you know if I would have to step
aside for my role and just think about
the fact that I'm gonna have to be
paying for that watch I would rather buy
me a gps watch or or something that adds
me some functionality that the phone
won't provide yeah that's a fair
argument but uh in the same respect I've
really loved the way that my chip my
pebble works and there are so some bad
sides to that in that you know I've said
this like 15 times in this podcast but I
wrote about it today in that it's also
made me maybe a little more rude when
I'm with people because somebody's
talking to me and I keep looking at my
wrist and they kept checking a tree that
I hot date there sailor yeah yeah and I
and I had to explain to them no I'm not
looking at the time somebody just texted
me you know and then it becomes no less
rude than just checking your phone right
no it's not a polite with instrument
that's not no that's kind of what it was
built on because it was no it wasn't it
was built inconvenience it wasn't built
on then I'm Bianca I'm gonna give you an
example I'm going I wasn't through then
I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you an
example of what I would like to see in a
smart watch the
didn't work either hey you guys remember
that moto active yet yeah release watch
that was a fitness watch okay fine I
love fitness that's my thing I want to
buy me a fitness watch because I want to
compare the results of that GPS tracking
to my phones for calibration um but the
point is why did that moto active not
take off the reason why was imagine look
a watch obviously Android was a very
different thing that that back then but
imagine Android crashing on you on your
watch while you're you know in a run or
something so it didn't work I guess I
guess yeah the only reason okay so the
only reason why I'm looking forward to
this galaxy gear is because apparently
it won't run Android apparently it'll
run something that you remember the
those rumors that it had its own
operating system I not seen those I'm
looking at the news story right now and
I certain those are very old rumors and
the rumors are I forgot I forgot the
name sorry about that listeners but
they're apparently it either won't run
Android or it won't necessarily just run
Android I don't know what everyone is
saying it's gonna run Andrew it is yeah
yeah yeah well we'll see again
apparently they were working on there if
it's not happening now it's gonna happen
later but it wouldn't that be something
if they launched the thing with on Tizen
if the galaxy gear was the first Samsung
Tizen device I it wouldn't surprise me
but I've got something to add my problem
with the galaxy gear is that it I guess
95% sure that it's going to require a
galaxy device so yes you know the galaxy
s4 probably i know they used samsung
connect or whatever one of their many s
s beam or a you know a to ya so so it's
going to require a Samsung device I
don't carry a Samsung device I don't
enjoy samsung android phones yeah save
for the note and in the note 3 might
change that do you think they would
limit their their exposure like that
yeah they would it's Samsung they wanna
they want to push their own eco and I I
guess they're not limiting anymore I
mean they're pretty much the biggest OEM
now so yeah but they're also trying to
push people into like the apps there was
a rumor saying get the apps for this
watch are actually only going to come
from Samsung's apps store perhaps so
yeah so yeah
they're what they're doing is they're
trying to further people into their own
little right so eventually they'll just
drop Android all together from far down
the road exactly so that's what this
device is trying to do it's selling
their ecosystem and and to me that just
that's not cool if that is good if that
if that is the case i will be one
hundred percent with you I don't think
you're gonna do that I mean I listen I
think it would be it's it's perfectly in
line with their behavior and I think
it's consistent with what we've seen
from them and I wouldn't be surprised if
they did it but I just don't want them
to so I'm gonna believe they're not
gonna do that ok I'll give you I'll give
you an example of one of those cases
that totally failed the blackberry
playbook oh yeah yeah you know the
blackberry playbook could not how could
you build a tablet that can't read email
unless you have a blackberry phone yeah
but you know they were talking about a
very different company there a because I
had already fallen off the top of the
heap yes but that was that was when
blackberry was still blackberry two
years ago three years ago never rent you
know whatever research a mover and they
were falling hard yeah that's the thing
they were samsung is not is nowhere
close to falling I mean they're they're
throwing Ling Desai's like that they're
turning out kind of iterative
improvements on plastic stuff they're
there skyrocketing yes Samsung is
throwing a million ideas at a wall
seeing what sticks and sticking with
what sticks they're moving forward with
the good ideas and the one thing the
final point I want to add is that the
korea times and you called me buzz
killington yesterday on twitter for
saying this buzz killington yes but the
korea times had an interview with a
samsung executive and her name is lee
young-hee and probably mispronounced
that but she calls the galaxy gear a a
concept right yes I wear a bra concept
device that yeah important because it's
a custom device is not close to
protection or close to being made into
production but they are going to show it
off that has been confirmed yes they
know so don't see it but I we don't know
if it'll ever get made I guess mm-hmm
listen I want this thing to get made I
like wearable technology especially
watches it
a nerdy cool thing I like him almost as
much as I like flip phones almost as
much as you like Star Trek well the
reason I like flip phones and when watch
phones is because of Star Trek so
they're blows on the right point right
yeah you were I dragged you were near
there so we will see you're near there
your your round about the neighborhood
and also there's some Chinese phone
that's the thinnest android phone ever
that we're gonna see any of us so uh
let's get yeah we're not you know can
you imagine that gay if they would bring
back PTT and add that to the galaxy gear
and make it a thing like God push push
to talk between between watches that i
would that would be cool all I want is
for push to talk to make it come back
such a push-to-talk nerd as well I just
want to make calls with my watch so I
can look like Dick Tracy yeah man yeah
man listen I have a better chance to see
listen just just think about it just
imagine the idea of having a bluetooth
headset on your head because there's the
sets the moment you can have been trying
to imagine trying to imagine on hammy
but I don't know if I quite get there
it's so far-fetched all right sorry
about this sorry about that okay badges
carrying a bluetooth headset and using
your watch I mean some people are not I
could this be like the next dumb phone
meaning you know oh my nice what like
the Bluetooth watch replaces the dumb
phone for people who just want voice
calling and maybe an SMS yeah you know
it's it's gonna be a watch it's gonna be
a dumb a dumb phone concept and it you
know you can either use it as a speaker
phone or use an optional accessory to
make phone calls can you valley that
would be awesome that would be awesome
dude dude that is an awesome editorial
I'm not gonna be able to write it you
should write it is the Bluetooth watch
the next dumb phone you see you don't
care about it but I would watch that but
now you know 10,000 people are gonna
hear this and this can involve
somebody's gonna write it somebody will
somebody out there you won't have time
but somebody will you're welcome you
want to add one more thing I lied when I
said that I only had one more point to
add it's fresher on me but go ahead yeah
yeah Lee Jung p kid I got I got to go
see the sox kid yeah go ahead she also
said that it would not have a flexible
display which yeah kind of goes here
yeah the galaxy gear she said it would
not have it fit a flexible display which
kind of goes against
the patents and designs that we've seen
the losers yeah is this render who made
this render by the way well the first
rendered I don't know about the the
colored renders but I know the first
pictures of it were from a patent
application so they're actually what it
should look like but they also show a
curved display so if it's not flexible
display but it shows a curved display I
don't know on our hands in the air back
away you know what it might be I think I
might envision like an inverse of the
nexus s where it has a flat so it's
nothing like the render we see but it
has a flat display underneath a curved
glass light I mean glass that's convex
it might it might don't leave that what
uh what I meant where we gonna say well
I guess that's like the only point why
you would want a flexible display
because it would be as your nomming for
your or you're exactly like that's the
thing all right so i will i'll admit
that I think the renders of this thing
I've gotten me more excited than
anything else about it because this
curved this image of a curved display
that's compelling I mean I'm gonna laugh
when it comes out and it actually just
looks like a pebble it's a pebble with
TouchWiz and like hyper glaze and faux
metal trim can you imagine you can put
you can you can now wave it your watch
to move you know from side to side yeah
you flick your wrist 15 times i'm like
really samsung how is it that flicking
my whole hand will be more ergonomic
than just flipping my finger over the
display exactly yeah basically what
we're so excited for about the galaxy
gear is that it's everything against
what Samsung is theoretically about so
the fact that if they announced this and
it's a typical Samsung device we won't
care that's pretty much what we've just
confirmed right so basically Samsung if
you do your normal thing and nobody's
gonna care about the galaxy gear do
something new basically no tap dancing
right no no tap dancing please samsung
if you do one more thing please throw
some tap dancing in your f event for
furred Michael just Michaels okay Sam
service listens and see what word of
warning word of warning are
romanian is going to be there and if you
pull a tap dancer there he's gonna push
his Russian accent Stan look nothing I i
want to tell you i want to tell you guys
that I i took a tap dancing class in
college I had a dance requirement to
fulfill was part of my acting degree and
I took a tap dancing class and I enjoyed
the heck out of it but I was not any
good at it and I'm really glad that
cameras on phones were not so prevalent
back then because there's no footage of
me tap dancing and there never will be
and I'm glad about that and tell you
that yeah yeah there is footage of you
piss drunk in Vegas so anyways you know
there's footage of you saw on a couple
logs in Vegas so guys I think we've
we've hit the molecule point of the
podcast where we have to say good night
Taylor final thoughts before we bail on
out of this aircraft I don't like tap
dancing it's not a bad idea I just the
man I just imagined Tony getting up and
being like let's get out of here let's
connect let's go there's always this is
always the mighty should we should not
be doing this yeah let's let's go get
some jack let's go get some jacket is a
waste of time you will have a jack we
will have a cook we will do a podcast
yes yeah speaking of Tony we will be
doing the next of the very next pocket
now weekly podcast you hear will be live
from Aoife and by live I mean you know
as live as it usually is and we will
record it from a hotel room with
probably a lot of echo and we will have
a little bit of palinka so it should be
nice and enjoyable we should be able to
link up with one of you fine gentlemen
back here in the United States so we can
have a nice three-way conversation and I
think it's going to be very exciting so
we're going to be talking about things
we've just seen including Samsung
Samsung products because their event is
before anybody else's samsung and sony
or like two days before the show even
starts and then yeah and then there's a
variety of shows after that there's LG
is also opening their booth the next day
so we're gonna have a lot to talk about
next week before Aoife even get started
so stay tuned for that we're also going
to be covering it at pocketnow.com as
usual and guys thank you in advance for
for backing us up back here in the
homeland we appreciate it guys my night
my mind
I kill your exit for a second I mean
yeah I'm star Delia my cousin are we
even expecting anything from Windows
Windows Phone anything from even with
Windows the Windows Phone team will be
there from Microsoft they will be I
imagine will be much like mwc was where
they have a lot of events or well nokia
had their 720 and 520 at mwc but
microsoft also just had a kind of a
thing where they showed off the existing
Windows Phone where's and we got to talk
to some of the people on the team and
that was very cool but I don't think
we're expecting anything new from from
them it would be cool to be surprised
but I don't think we will be is this a
motorola going to be there as well to be
quite honest I don't know it's a
European event and so I think unless I'm
missing it on my checklist I don't see
it it's on here somewhere alone I
tweeted a Stefan earlier so our friend
and friend upon friend of the show
stefan constantinescu at what the bit we
liked him we liked our friend Stephan
Stephan damn it I can never get that
right either yeah I can't get it right
friends names right Tyler oh here it is
Tyler and Jamie we're about to sorry it
was HTC just kidding uh yeah thought so
cuz omoto is not big in Europe so we
will but it you will be seeing everybody
wait wait a second speaking of HTC the
one x max are one max or whatever oh
yeah the one well there but I don't
think we've seen any signs that read
listeners that is the phablet that is
yet made in the shape of the HTC One by
the way I just sent an HTC one mini to
Brandon minimum that thinks cute yeah it
is too small for my hands fresh HTC one
max images and details come to light for
hours it's it's too limited for my hands
anyways haha we makin jokes hey there's
definitely a square outline under the
camera of the HTC One max for presumably
for a fingerprint reader I I can't
figure out you know they've tried to do
fingerprint readers ever since the
pocket pc yeah but this one is right
where the dimple is on the Moto X what
if you had to keep your finger on the
HTC One max for the entire time you used
it if you ever get finger off it would
lock
you need to stop talking listen I think
this is a great idea I'm gonna go start
my own company I'm working here you're
gonna be calling that the finger phone
yeah that's right finger dimple hey crow
crows you home kitchen the fingers the
finger dimple links up with your Galaxy
gear just cross your eyes the 10 on your
head you make phone call scrunch your
nose and blink twice to take pictures
right I want to make it clear that thank
