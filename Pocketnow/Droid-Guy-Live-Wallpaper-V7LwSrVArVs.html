pocketnow.com
and today we're looking at a new live
wallpaper for all you Android fans out
there I'm talking about those of you who
can't get enough of that lovable little
green robot
it's called droid guide live wallpaper
and it allows you to interact with the
famous Android mascot let's check it out
all right so at first glance it doesn't
seem like there's much to this wallpaper
it actually sort of seems like a static
wallpaper because nothing happens when
you swipe through it you don't see any
movements in the background but you
can't actually interact with this green
robot in order to do that all you have
to do is tap on each one of his limbs
the body or the head and he'll react to
you so let's go ahead and start with the
funniest one or the action that I think
is the funniest if we tap on his mouth
so did you see that you can actually see
him pull out an apple he takes a bite of
it gives it the look of death and then
the view shifts over to the side where
there's a trash can and he throws it
away absolutely hilarious so it's
basically poking fun at the iPhone all
right so if we tap on his left arm he
sort of starts flailing his arms almost
looks like he's doing jumping jacks and
if we tap the left leg what is that the
Running Man so he dances when you tap
there if we tap on the right leg he does
a backflip let's do that again
all right and the right arm a simple
wave let's tap the body not sure what
that is but maybe a stretch and finally
let's tap his head he doesn't really
like it when you tap his head okay so he
goes crazy grabs the screen pulls it
closer flips it to the side and then
starts kicking it so some funny
animations here with this droid guy live
wallpaper so this is a look at droid guy
live wallpaper by uprising Studios it's
in the Android Market for $0.99 so it's
not free but it's
expensive either we'd love to see some
updates in the future with extra
features settings and animations but the
initial release is already pretty
entertaining remember to follow us on
