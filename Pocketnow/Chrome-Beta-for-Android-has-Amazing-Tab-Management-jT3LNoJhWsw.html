pocket now calm a lot of people refer to
the default Android browser as Chrome
and in fact it's just the default
Android browser it's not Chrome today
Google has released Chrome Beta for
Android and it has a lot of really cool
features and a really impressive UI that
really takes advantage of fast devices
with a lot of RAM let's take a look at
it now and so this is an Ice Cream
Sandwich app and one of the coolest
things that it does is it allows you to
place shift from your desktop to your
phone a lot of other browsers allow you
to do this that is have the taps that
are open on your desktop they also open
on your phone but now we finally have it
in Chrome a lot of people use Chrome and
they really didn't have that fluidity
between desktop and between mobile
browsers so let's go into chrome beta
here and right now we are looking at the
verge and it's got some really cool UI
features for example if we go up to the
tabs here we can actually flip through
our tabs and if we want to discard one
we chuck it off the screen here's one of
my favorite features you can switch
between tabs by swiping to the left or
to the right in this case and look how
smooth that is how many times are you
switching between multiple web pages and
you wish there is a faster way to do so
without having to pick up here to the
open tabs and and click that way as you
can see performance is very very smooth
and let's say you want to open up a new
tab so we can go up here to new tab and
by the way you saw some of the options
up here new tab new incognito tab
bookmarks other devices which we'll talk
about in the sec find in page kind of a
search settings and help you can kinda
see the Ice Cream Sandwich interface the
back button is hidden out of sight and
the forward button and so down here we
have three choices if we want to open up
a do new tab number one is sort of the
speed dial view that you get in Chrome
on the desktop so it keeps track of
recently visited webpages so very
quickly you can jump to any page that
you've been to already over here to the
right we have bookmarks and this is
syncing directly with my my desktop so I
can always have my bevy of bookmarks in
my pocket and over to the right this is
probably the coolest part this is
actually synced with my computer my PC
so these three tabs are open right now
on my desk
and let's say I had 10 tabs open because
there are 10 things I wanted to read
later and go into Chrome on my Android
phone pull up this screen and see all of
these tabs that are open waiting for me
to view them so a really cool interface
pretty fast not the fastest browser
certainly let's go to the desktop
version of Pocket now and see how long
that takes definitely competitive in
terms of performance flip down the page
as it's loading having a little trouble
loading the page kind of kind of get a
blank spot this is definitely in beta
form in fact it has crashed several
times already and this is the Galaxy
Nexus the flagship Google phone right
now so performance isn't that good I
expect with time that this is going to
get really really good and it's really
refreshing to have this new interface
that lets you swipe quickly between tabs
it really increases productivity so it's
in beta it's in the Android Market and
there's no reason why you shouldn't try
it if you have an Ice Cream Sandwich
device we'll put a link up in the
description so you can go check out
chrome beta for Android phone and let us
know what you think about it that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
