with another throwback device for you
this is the HTC Kaiser
the AT&amp;amp;T branded version which they
called the tilt for obvious reasons this
was a Windows Mobile Pocket PC later
known as a Windows Mobile professional
because it didn't have a touchscreen
you've got a stylus that pops out around
here somewhere but I can't remember
where actually do a really good job
camouflaging it up in there for you very
nice device I can run windows mobile 6.5
though a little bit sluggishly
I'll give you a few points to look at
really interesting placement of the sim
card you've got to flip the phone open
unlock and open it up now by doing that
the phone is automatically gonna power
off which is a really good feature in my
opinion I don't know why they made the
SIM slot so accessible and still made it
power off but that's neither here that
nor there sim slides right in that way
door closes and locks you're good to go
never had a problem with that coming
open or getting lost or even the sim
getting loose while I used it on the
back we have a 3 megapixel camera no
flash on it but we do have an external
rear facing camera you'll notice down
here is a little HTC logo kind of muted
back then they made things pretty small
they didn't want to brag about their
hardware you've got an external antenna
port for your GPS and then over here on
the side
I pushed a top button which I
reprogrammed for voice command you have
this nice scroll wheel up and down and
then an OK button this scroll wheel also
can be pushed in to select okay kind of
redundant to have a separate button and
you can't reprogram this button
unfortunately but it was nice to be able
to scroll up and down and then tap ok on
the front you've got your typical soft
buttons left and right you've got a
directional deep
which really showed quite a bit of where
you've got your internet explorer button
your email button which kind of broke
off so now it's just a rectangle button
okay
windows your hang-up and your pickup
buttons really nice they're thing I
don't like about this phone I keep
trying to slide it open and it won't
slide open because for some reason they
did it backwards
there's your slide it's different than
the t-mobile g1 it's different from all
the sliders before it at least all the
sliders that I used why they did it
backwards I don't know they must have
had a good reason but it took me forever
to get used to that
so let's look down here on the bottom
we've got a micro SD card no AC just as
the little lanyard loop and then the HTC
proprietary USB port and headphone jack
kind of nice some people too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
