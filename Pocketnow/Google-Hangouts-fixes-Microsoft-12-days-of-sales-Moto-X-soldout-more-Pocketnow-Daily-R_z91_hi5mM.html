with yet another software update
microsoft announces 12 days of deals for
those of you interested and the Moto X
went on sale today and it went really
fast I'm hi anatomy that I and if I'm
not smiling that's because I was not
able to land the Moto X today but this
is pocket out daily lets herself with
some official news as yes Motorola kept
their ward and they did relaunch their
wholesale at the Moto X at three hundred
fifty dollars which is one hundred fifty
dollars off the regular price but
obviously as always there's a catch as
the sale only lasted ten minutes and
that's really because the phone sold out
that's how much they took the sold out
whatever stock they had we have no
official numbers as how many phones have
been sold of the Moto X it's really
interesting to know exactly how many
phones were actually on sale but anyways
if you're interested in it seems that
the Moto G would probably be your best
option speaking of deals let's talk
about Microsoft does the company is
holding twelve days of deals from today
until next Friday and these deals are
actually pretty good first of all for
example today they have the dell venue 8
pro for just 99 bucks that's two hundred
dollars off the price that's really
extremely too good so much so that the
tablet is already sold out so obviously
stay tuned links in the description for
more details on what else is on sale as
the rest of the stuff is actually good
as well now let's talk about nokia and
both official and unofficial news
because on the official site first of
all they finally launched their guru
bluetooth headset which is interesting
because it's an accessory that requires
you to have headphones the jack into the
accessory so for fifty four dollars it
really doesn't make sense for you to buy
this and you can just get a stereo
headset battle you know just hook onto
your phone automatically through
bluetooth without the need of a spare
separate headphone set that'll just make
everything more expensive but aside from
that in the unofficial news we have more
reports of an eight point three inch
nokia tablet and judging by the lumia
2520 this could be a good review so stay
tuned for that now let's talk about
Samsung as the company has just launched
their galaxy J in Japan and I don't look
at me funny I mean we don't report
Japanese news but the reason
I this is cool is because the phone has
a very interesting design yes it looks
like almost every galaxy phone out there
but the back looks metal it looks really
cool it looks really minimalistic and it
seems that it has the same
specifications as the Galaxy Note 3 in
every way only that with the galaxy s4
design so we don't really know if this
galaxy jay's coming to the united states
or not or to europe but stay tuned we'll
keep you posted and finally for the man
news of the day Google is just updated
their hangouts application to deal with
all the specific complaints that
customers had with the previous one this
time it does it's a great better with
SMS messages up to the point where now
you don't have to use an mms to actually
send the multiple recipes message you
can just use an SMS which was one of the
biggest complaints that people had about
this but you know that leads me to the
question of the day do you use these SMS
substitutes like Facebook messaging with
the whole you know face pop ups for do
you use this you know Google Hangouts
application because in my particular
case samsung phones are so terrible to
integrate with these apps than I end up
using the typical SMS app because you
get two notifications which is extremely
annoying I don't know about you believe
is a comment down below what do you do
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is film achieve follow us on
PocketNow comment subscribe tranki
channel as well you also follow me on
twitter highly underscored iveta please
