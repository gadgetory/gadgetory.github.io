calm and today we're going to walk
through setting up a super nintendo
emulator on the shadow many thanks to DJ
reveler for doing the footwork on this
project for more details go to all
shadow calm click on forums in the right
column then the hacks and modifications
form and finally click on the thread
titled SNES for shadow faq install guide
ok first things first download the file
pack the DJ reveler put together from
tinyurl.com / 577 in AE extract the file
contents to your desktop and begin
syncing your shadow if you don't have
the option to extract a rare file on
your right click menu you can get a free
copy from rare lab com / download HTM
next you're going to want to connect and
begin syncing your shadows so we can
transfer the files using windows mobile
device center transfer the contents of
the folder cabs to your shadow and
install them both if you have already
installed the all shadow calm
performance enhancements then you don't
need to install this RealNetworks app on
lock cab instead just install the t get
file cap when done reboot your shadow
once you've rebooted connect and sync
with your pc once sync drag the folder
marked SNES to your memory card it's a
little larger so it might take a little
bit longer to transfer
once the folder is copied over to your
shadow navigate to the folder on your
storage card using file explorer then
run the file marked pocket SNES exe
gradual ations you now have a working
super nintendo emulator on your shadow
you're going to need to assign keys to
work with your shadows keypad do this by
selecting options in the emulator then
keys from the menu in order to assign a
key press left or right on the scroll
wheel until that key is selected then
press Center select and you will see the
alphanumeric code next to your selection
change to three periods next press the
key to you wish to assign be sure to
assign them all and remember which is
which you can use this image as a
reference for setting up your keypad
additionally I suggest going to options
and display and selecting portrait and
otto frame skip now there is a little
more tweaking before you can load a ROM
with your shadow still sync to using
windows mobile device center navigate
back to the folder with SNES and make a
new folder called good roms or whatever
you want then copy the roms inside the
roms folder into the new folder you just
created ok so now it's time to load up a
ROM wordpress file load ROM you get a
little popup message here it's nothing
to worry about just press ok it'll come
and go every so often and I load it on a
bunch of roms here so there's a bunch to
choose from let's check out Super Mario
World get a little Nintendo presents
screen and there's super mario world now
I have this set up in portrait so I can
use the keys how we had laid out in the
example however you can switch it in the
settings over to landscape so you could
play it like this i have seen seems to
be a problem when the landscapes
oriented this way so just use the first
landscape mode now i have the bottom
left key the alt button assigned to the
menu key and that's how you exit the
game now you can go ahead and press file
load ROM and load a different rom if you
want or you cancel if you'd like or
additionally you can go and change
options so you can play with the options
in the
middle of a game so like if you want to
try out playing with some of the sound
you can try that out and that concludes
our tutorial for the SNES emulator for
the t-mobile shadow if you have any
questions check out our forums there's a
threaten their dedicated to the SNES
until next time I'm Mike Benton for all
shadow com
