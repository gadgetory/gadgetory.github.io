and today we're doing a quick comparison
of two leading LTE Android smartphones
the HTC One X on AT&amp;amp;T network and the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus on verizon's LTE
network we're going to compare specs
build quality display you I performance
and camera let you know which one you
should think of buying if you're on the
fence okay these phones are separated by
about six months as far as release dates
go so we're obviously going to see some
differences in specs under the hood now
the LTE version of the galaxy nexus is
working with a TI OMAP dual-core
processor clocked at 1.2 gigahertz it
also packs a gig of ram and 32 gigs of
storage space 28 of which are available
to the user on the other hand the LTE
version of the One X features a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
it's got the same 1 gig of ram but only
16 gigs of storage only 12 of that is
available to the user so if you need a
lot of memory you can stop right there
the Galaxy Nexus is going to be the
device for you but if you're the type
who stores a lot of content in the cloud
or if you just don't need a lot of
storage space for whatever reason it's
still anybody's game let's check out the
build quality after carrying the One X
as my daily driver for about a week
going back to the Galaxy Nexus was quite
a shift it almost feels thick in the
hand much more like a rounded stone than
the flat shingle of the One X the casing
is only slightly smaller than the One X
but it fits much better in the hand
probably because of its increased
thickness it doesn't feel like a giant
phone while the One X really really does
by comparison on the other hand the
materials on the One X are just
incredible as I said in the review it's
almost like holding a piece of
futuristic chalk rather than plastic the
polycarbonate casing along with the
clean lines and the unique design just
blows away the generic look of the
Galaxy Nexus which looks ok
a butt feels almost chintzy by
comparison but the casing is only as
important as what it surrounds the
Galaxy Nexus is rocking a 4.6 5 inch
super amoled while the 1x has a 4.7 inch
super lcd2 there's really no room for
subjectivity here unless you have bad
eyesight it's pretty clear that the 1x
display just destroys the panel on the
Galaxy Nexus now they're both 720p
displays with excellent deep blacks and
much more vibrant colors and you're
going to get on older LCD panels the One
X's s LCD to with the RGB pixel
arrangement delivers better whites
whereas on the Galaxy Nexus the whites
appear a lot more like a wet newspaper
because of that pentile Super AMOLED and
HTC is really showcased at superior
color performance with a lot of the
animations available in the HTC Sense
also because the Galaxy Nexus uses the
soft keys in stock ICS you're losing a
bunch of pixels at the bottom of the
display the One X doesn't usually have
that problem thanks to its capacitive
keys here so though its display is
really only maybe a twentieth of an inch
bigger it's usable area is significantly
larger much of the time speaking of
stock ICS these two devices offer
radically different software experiences
as Google's flagship Nexus device the
Galaxy Nexus offers stock ICS and the
One X does as well but the One X is
running sense for on top of Android so
that changes the experience measurably
in practice this means that even though
HTC has lightened up a lot and sense
you're still going to get more glitz and
more trim on the One X than on the
Galaxy Nexus that's all very pretty but
it does weigh down the experience a bit
especially sometimes when you jump out
of a nap and sense has to reload all of
its widgets when you hop back to the
home screen and as I discussed in my
full review the sense keyboard is
probably one of the worst I've used for
English typing even though it looks
pretty and very inviting with its big
keys the stock experience on the other
hand while possessing much less visual
flair is just much more responsive and
snappy and it's much more apt to just
work
in my experience sure it's less exciting
but it's minimalism is quite appealing
and the keyboard is phenomenal finally
HTC is making a lot of noise about the
supposed amazing camera on the One X how
does that measure up to reality in short
pretty well the saturation is a little
higher than what most people will be
used to and the low-light performance
could be better but the one axis camera
delivers better results than the shooter
in the Galaxy Nexus not just because of
the 8 megapixel vs. 5 megapixel
difference either the software is what
really gives the One X the leg up over
the galaxy nexus allowing users to shoot
still shots in video and take up to 20
shots in quick succession also this
unified view finder is a real time-saver
by contrast and we've talked about this
before the Galaxy Nexus is a
disappointment in the camera Department
while the camera software on stock ICS
is very clean and quick and I really
like the built-in panorama mode the
sensors performance is very
disappointing colors are reproduced
somewhat more accurately than the 1x but
everything is cast in a slightly gray
pallor it's almost like you're shooting
through a fine mist especially in low
light the edge definitely goes to the 1x
here so they're both beastly devices
with some of the best specs you can get
on the two largest networks in the
United States now the Galaxy Nexus has
been available for some time it's
available now on verizon wireless for 1
99 99 on contract and the 1x will be
available starting May sixth on AT&amp;amp;T for
the same price or you can get it for
cheaper if you pre-order at certain
locations so which one to get well both
devices have flagship specs and
certainly coverage and your carrier
choice is going to make some of that
decision for you but if you're looking
for a better camera experience ultra
modern design and amazing display and
much better battery life and the HTC One
X is going to be the way to go for you
on the other hand if you want a more
solid more fluid user experience with
the probability of somewhat more timely
updates from google a Galaxy Nexus is
going to be the way to go for you that's
it for now this has been Michael with
pocket now
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw and thanks for watching we'll
see you next time speaking of stock ICS
these two phones offer incredibly
motorcycles man get a bicycle
no offense if you ride one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
