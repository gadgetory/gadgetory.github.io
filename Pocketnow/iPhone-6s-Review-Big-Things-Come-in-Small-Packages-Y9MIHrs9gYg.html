the iPhone buying experience each year
Apple introduces new iPhones but only
half of them are redesigns the other
half are re-imaginings improved takes on
tried-and-true existing hardware these
takes are never the most exciting phones
but they're always the ones worth buying
I'm Hayatou Houston with PocketNow and
normally my favorite s model comes
backed by Elon Musk but after this week
I might be willing to make an exception
you guessed it this is our video review
of the iPhone 6s
from the outside the iPhone 6's looks
completely identical to last year's
iPhone 6 save for the new s call-out on
the back it sports the same unibody
frame this time upgraded to 7000 grade
aluminum for a slightly grippier feel in
hand and better resistance to bending
and we still have those unsightly
antenna bands there's also the same 4.7
inch IPS display with the same odd 1334
by 750 resolution coming in at 326
pixels per inch and the same big top and
bottom bezel surrounding the screen
giving way to only about a 65% screen to
body ratio that's not terrible but with
phones like the Moto X pure edition
trimming bezels to reach upwards of 75%
Apple probably could have either crammed
in a bigger display or made a physically
smaller device well they could have if
it weren't for the new editions of the
3d touch and tap tech feedback engines
inside we'll come back to those in just
a second but they do make the iPhone 6s
a tad thicker and heavier than last
year's model though that's not
necessarily a bad thing since the added
weight makes the iPhone feel sturdier
than before being an S model we weren't
expecting any kind of major changes to
the aesthetic design but we were
counting on upgraded internals and Apple
definitely delivered this year the new
a9 chipset may only be dual-core on the
surface but combined with a 6 core GPU
it's one of the best performing SOC s
you'll find and that show is in
benchmarks and real-world performance
alike the iPhone 6s flies through
anything you throw at it
and you can switch between more apps at
once than ever thanks to the 2 gigabytes
of RAM inside double what we've seen
before the only thing standing in your
way of truly taking advantage of the
iPhones hardware is the 16 gigabytes of
internal storage on the baseline model
seriously before my first 24 hours with
the phone were up I'd already burned
through all but a gigabyte and a half of
space an Apple still doesn't match your
iCloud storage to your phone's capacity
spend the extra money and just buy a 64
gigabyte phone trust us no matter what
storage size you get though the iPhone
6s sports a new version of touch ID
built into the home button and
is stupid fast so fast that you can't
even view your notifications without
unlocking the phone I never thought that
being too fast could be a problem and it
almost is here but it makes using your
phones so effortless that you forget you
even have a security code until someone
else tries to get in which if you ask me
is a huge victory the button can also be
used as a quick shortcut to all kinds of
features from opening series of press
and hold to launching Apple pay with a
double-click on the lock screen to
switching apps with a double-click
anywhere else say what you will about
physical home buttons but apples made it
loud and clear that this is a
quintessential part of the iPhone
experience and it's not going anywhere
another essential part of the iPhone 6s
is 3d touch this is a whole new method
of input powered by a physical sensor
within the device the registers
different levels of pressure applied to
the screen it's hard to understand its
practical use until you try it for
yourself but once you do you realize
that the potential here is tremendous if
you 3d touch on a home screen icon a
contextual menu will pop up like a
right-click on a computer giving quick
shortcuts to the different functions of
that app 3d touch on a link in Safari to
preview the corresponding webpage or on
the subject line of an email to preview
the body 3d touch on a live photo in
your gallery to animate it then set it
as a lockscreen wallpaper which you can
then you guessed it 3d touch to animate
again a lot of people have compared this
feature to the long press we've had for
years and pretty much every smartphone
but I really can't stress that right
click analogy enough this is something
that almost no other phone can do and
I'd really like to see it implemented
more in the months ahead
the iPhone 6s and its larger sibling the
6s plus are the first phones to ship
with iOS 9 running out of the box we've
been running the software in its beta
form for a few months now but for
everyone else this means an assortment
of new features to add layers of both
convenience and confusion the system
font has seen a makeover and there's a
new screen to the left of the main home
screens in the style of Google now or
HTC blinkfeed that displays new stories
along with some of your frequent apps
and contacts those frequent apps also
show up in the spotlight search bar now
and contacts have been omitted from the
multitasking screen which now bears a
card style design looking past the
various design tweaks a lot of
thoughtful changes have been made to the
way you navigate the phone one of my
favorites is the button that takes you
back to the previous app when you're
sidetracked by in-app links or
notifications though I wish this button
could be at the bottom of the screen
instead of all the way in the top left
corner
speaking of notifications they're now
organized on a timeline by default
versus the per app sorting from before
which makes it so much easier to clear
out a whole day's worth of notifications
all at once
I really wish the clearing out those
notifications also dismiss the badge
icons on the home screen though a
redundancy that's plagued iOS for years
but maybe next year so as expected this
is the best version of Apple's iOS yet
also the best that it's ever been is the
iPhone 6s is camera it's taken a bump up
from 8 to 12 megapixels and it's learned
a few new tricks on the software side
too
Apple was really excited to show off
live photos which work together with 3d
touch to create well basically a short
video of course they don't look at it
that way and you capture live photos the
same way you would a static one but
we've seen the same thing done on other
phones before from other manufacturers
so it's a fun addition to the iPhone and
as mentioned before you can set these
live photos as animated wallpapers but
be careful taking too many of these if
you skimp out and buy the 16 gigabyte
model which again you shouldn't well i
photos take of twice as much storage as
a standard shot
those standard shots look great by the
way the iPhone has always taken
top-notch photos and the new 12
megapixel sensor on the iPhone 6s is no
exception
photos are full of natural color and
detail and the camera is really good at
balancing exposure even in scenes with
multiple light sources it's weird to say
that the iPhone might not have the best
camera out there for once Android OEMs
really stepped up their game this year
and phones like the note 5 and LG g4
give the 6s run for its money with great
optics and a myriad of manual controls
but when it comes to quick
point-and-shoot captures the iPhone
still sits on top with the most reliable
camera in general oh and the jump in
resolution also means 4k video for the
first time on an iPhone even without OIS
its smoother brighter and crisper than
ever before and you know what I'll let
you be the judge
check it out the front-facing camera
also saw a pretty major update this year
it's been bumped up to 5 megapixels and
the amount of added detail compared to
last year's iPhone is pretty wild it's
still not wide-angle like most of the
competition but paired with a new
software flash it's the most capable
selfie shooter we've seen come out of
Cupertino even though the iPhone 6s
doesn't have as large of a battery as
the 6s plus or even last year's iPhone 6
endurance is outstanding the phone
always made it through a full day
whether I was streaming YouTube or
playing games and on lighter days when I
was just scrolling through Twitter and
handling emails I was able to squeeze
nearly 2 days out of it I wish I could
be just as positive about signal
strength which was good but not great
other phones from Samsung and Motorola
this year outperformed the iPhone and
reception and moreover I saw faster
speeds on the others too so what's the
verdict should you buy the iPhone 6s is
it worth its top dollar cost of course
it is between the solid design terrific
camera silky smooth performance and
selection of quality apps it's no wonder
the iPhone is the most popular phone on
the market it's not for everybody and if
you value Ross specs open customization
or hardware amenities like expandable
storage or removal
batteries then like always there are
probably better options for you on the
Android side of things but for the
layman that doesn't want or need to
spend hours tweaking their phone or for
the app maniac that always has to have
everything before anyone else the iPhone
success is about as good as it gets
just so long as you prefer a smaller
form factor there's a whole lot more
