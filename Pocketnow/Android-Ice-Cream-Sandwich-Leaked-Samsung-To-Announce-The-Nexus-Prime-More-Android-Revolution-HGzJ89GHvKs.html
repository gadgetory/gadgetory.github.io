on video Samson plans and unpacked event
for ctia on october eleventh that smells
like nexus prime and amazon takes a real
shot at android and the ipad 2 with the
kindle fire all the sin more coming up
right now
hello everyone I'm high memory better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of google's android project
this week is going to be a little
different because everything that we
have to talk about is hot so let's start
it off that's right believe it or not an
anonymous tipster was lucky enough to
get himself a used nexus s on ebay and
to his surprise it was rocking google's
latest test build of ice cream sandwich
many are still debating whether the
video is real or not but believe it or
not in our opinion it seems to be real I
mean and gadget leak that and everything
seems to be so well done that it just
couldn't be made at home or edit on any
software but make sure you hit our
website for details and watch the full
video to see and make your opinion on
your own recent rumors have it that ice
cream sandwich is being capable of
unlocking the phone using facial
recognition and everything else that
wasn't really shown on the video so
there may be more than meets the eye on
what you'll see right now so currently
our point of view is ice cream sandwich
is actually looking really nice and
speaking of androids Ice Cream Sandwich
Samsung has just sent out invites for an
october eleventh events at ctia and it's
titled the google story so it screams
google nexus prime or galaxy nexus in
every way most likely samsung will share
the stage with google and impress us
with the next generation of android
though time will tell I mean Sammy is
currently already pushing 10 million
units of their galaxy s devices so
hopefully they will show us some google
nexus prime that looks a lot like the
galaxy s2 that's being very successful
another releases for the week HTC has
officially announced their Explorer
which is their entry-level smartphone
aimed at Asia and Europe and well no
really big specs there and it's based
off that pico device that we leaked
recently they're plumb rhyme is also now
available on verizon you can actually
get it on sale at target for a trade off
visit first much as 50 bucks so that's
looking really good samsung has just
unveiled their new XO nose 4212
processor which promises to deliver
fifty percent better graphics
performance and thirty percent less
power consumption so looks really
interesting aside from that t-mobile has
also made their
CC amaze 4g and their samsung galaxy s2
launch dates and pricing availability
public first of all both devices will be
available for pre-order on october 10th
and you can actually pick them up at a
store as of october 12 and while the
Amaze will cost you two hundred and
sixty bucks after a two-year contract
and the galaxy s2 will cost you two
hundred thirty bucks after the same
kidney contract and well both devices
will be rocking 4G as of t-mobile and
well you can pick them up really soon
and well armed man Evan glass expert in
all leagues foreign and domestic has
again hooked us up with more leaks first
of all the HTC raider / holiday has
already appeared at the FCC sporting
some really great LTE specs and an AT&amp;amp;T
logo really nice rumors also have that
on october six the HTC london event will
be all about releasing beats audio
devices to the public and well the HTC
Runnemede is also having their retail
branding being available and sporting
some beats audio lows at the back we
also came across the motorola droid
force first test photo and well sadly
there wasn't really any specs to be
mentioned but it seems that the device
would look everything like a droid 3
except for the name and what rumors also
have is of the motorola droid HD aka
spider that a lot of people have been
talking about is probably the droid razr
that many ovens are actually wanting so
hopefully that'll be the case and while
the samsung stratosphere specs have also
been leaked and well make sure you visit
our website for details on what to
expect on the device and well out of
this week's coverage make sure you hit
Vicki Adams recent full review of the
samsung galaxy s2 epic touch 4g tongue
twister for sprint and well gain 4 stars
out of five so the device seems really
good but again read the review to make
up your mind deke Adams droid bionic
videos keep rolling and now we have the
software review of the device so make
sure you look at it before you decide
whether you want to purchase it or not
and also have a look at Brandon minimums
recent unboxing coverage of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 8.9 which sadly doesn't seem
to impress him that much watch the video
and see why and Wilson's everything this
week in android is hot let's end today
show by talking about amazon
you can assume that their recent move to
release an android app store for amazon
was just to start up for something much
bigger and while they just released
their android based kindle fire tablet
and many of us see this tablet is
capable of igniting some true
competition for the ipad 2 amazon is a
software company at its core and well
they're aggressive way of pricing this
tablet at just 200 bucks there's a way
to show that amazon's not really out to
sell tablets they're out to offer a
product that will allow people to
consume their amazon prime services and
also to consume more apps from their app
store it's already proven that even
though there are a lot of tablets out
there that sport much better specs in
the ipad 2 and these are all honeycomb
tablets the secret sauce to sell better
than the ipad 2 has nothing to do with
specs amazon is actually not being
aggressive in specs with their device
but they're actually doing a great job
in offering amazon mp3 plying their own
app store movies and just about
everything including their new cloud
storage services so we do see that this
amazon fire is going to be a success and
this will finally bring some real
competition to the ipad to that which
should be because what people are
actually out after is actually more of
an ecosystem than just a device that is
just a standalone device that won't
allow you to consume anything that's so
for the best and let's see what amazon
will bring to the table because hey for
200 bucks anybody's willing to pay for
it even me that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching and hey
if you didn't notice we're currently
hiring so if you want to take a shot at
doing some really good quality video for
pocket now calm don't forget as soon as
your resume at jobs at pocketnow.com end
well I'm high Meadow iveta thank you
very much for watching don't forget to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now
