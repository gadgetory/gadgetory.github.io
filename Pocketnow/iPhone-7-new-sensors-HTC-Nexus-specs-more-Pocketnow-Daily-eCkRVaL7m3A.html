true tone display rumored specifications
of the HTC nexus tell us a little about
how much powers included and t-mobile
summers keep disrupting the way you've
roam around the world I'm hi Mary vera
and yeah i know this video is gonna be a
little late trust me i am really looking
forward to editing this video at
midnight but hey this is fog and i'll
daily the official news today begin with
tmobile as the company continues to
disrupt the way you do things mainly
when it comes to roaming yes you have
like around 140 countries where you can
roam in 2g but as of july first and up
to august 31st the new deal from
t-mobile is that of your in europe and
pretty much almost every country in
Europe you're getting free 4G roaming
and you're also getting free SMS
messages and then your phone calls will
cost fifteen cents a minute it's crazy
learn more on the link in the
description now after the news of Peter
challenge departure from HTC we continue
to see new things that the company is
doing one of the things we like the most
about HTC devices is the HTC Sense user
interface for us it's one of the
cleanest ones and as of today a closed
beta is allowing users to try HTC Sense
on other android phones so seems the
company continues to try different ways
to differentiate itself and it seems
that since we'll probably be away I've
got some very interesting rumors were
screen protector manufacturers are no
longer receiving orders because
apparently Apple is going to make some
changes here with the iphone 7 we're
talking about a larger earpiece and
we're talking about the movement of the
ambient light sensor to a different area
and this is also a different type of
ambient light sensor because apparently
Apple is working on bringing two tone
technology into the iphone 7 more or
less like what we see in the 9.7 inch
iPad pro that's great apparently we are
also getting some changes in the
proximity sensor for more accuracy we
should learn more as more rumors develop
I've set your calendars for july twenty
ninth as let echo is apparently going to
have an event
Shanghai where we're expecting two
things disruptive things sure Lego is
still not officially in the united
states as of yet but it will be very
soon and apparently were getting the
first device with a snapdragon 823
processor in addition to a crazy 8 gigs
of ram yes this company wants to disrupt
with this powerhouse we came that way to
learn more and finally for the very
interesting rumors today we are talking
about the HTC nexus codename sailfish
and since we're talking about the
Snapdragon 823 apparently this device
will launch with an eight to one which
is almost the same processor in addition
to four gigs of RAM just for and 32 gigs
of non-expandable storage in addition to
similar cameras to what we saw with the
Nexus 6p and this is not really good
news we were expecting this phone to be
a powerhouse and right we're not saying
it's not but then again with devices
with eight gigs of ram six of ram it
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think about these specifications
do you think that Google is slacking
with the future Nexus or do you think
that this is fine because in my case I
know that this isn't enough for this
phone to perform the palm is what'll
happen with the devices that will launch
in 2017 leave us a comment down below
