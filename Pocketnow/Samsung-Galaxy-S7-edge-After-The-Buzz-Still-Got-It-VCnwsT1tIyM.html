every single time the media goes crazy
over every hot new device and after that
review period wears off so does the buzz
behind that new toy you might still want
to buy but that now faces new
competition in the real world things
shouldn't be that way for most of us
aging is just as important as the moment
you unbox your product for the first
time it's how that device performs after
extensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's take a second look at Samsung's
best phablet left now that the other one
kind of blew out of the map I'm home
it'll be better with pocket now and this
is our Samsung Galaxy s7 edge after the
buzz 2016 was already Samsung's best
year with the launch of the new Galaxy S
line up the experimentation with metal
and glass of the previous year matured
into an s7 duo that was finally able to
delight both design purists and power
users alike the Galaxy Note 7 was
supposed to complement the lineup with
more added features but we already know
how that ended up so for those of you
that are still thinking that grabbing a
galaxy s7 edge is taking a step back
well that's actually not accurate at all
for starters if you remember the spec
differences were really meagre the
processor Ram expandable storage and
even water assistance were all really
the same if it wasn't for the Wacom
digitizer for the s-pen an iris scanner
USB type-c and double the base storage
on the note 7 you are pretty much
holding a Galaxy a7 edge with added
tricks and yeah even a slightly smaller
battery I've been using the galaxy s7
edge on an off since launch date on
March 9th and it continues to be my
favorite phone mainly because I mean
look at it
it still looks brand new I published a
separate durability report video that
I'm linking because I really haven't
babied this phone I've never used the
case safe for the usual sleeve that I
carry but instead of your average
couple of falls I once dropped this
phone from a second-floor onto rocks by
accident I was expecting to pick up the
pieces but instead was surprised by some
meager dents on the aluminum a smash
camera lens a single hairline crack on
the glass and believe it or not the
phone just kept kicking as I promised in
my video I took it to the 8:37 Samsung
store in New York City for repairs and
after one hour and 48 dollars later I've
got a new back water-resistance is
intact and the warranty is still active
there are some minor scratches on the
home button as well due to average use
but in everything else this is a very
strong foam that is aged better than
pretty much any other I don't think I've
ever submitted a phone to more use than
this one this year and then there are
the features of this phone that are just
timeless and extremely difficult for any
other company to better like this AMOLED
display Samsung continues to set the bar
and display technology and the subtle
curves don't just contribute in the
visual beauty of this phone but also
when improving the overall feel in the
hand now my only complaint really is
that what's shown on this display is
still old software samsung is terrible
at bringing new software to older
devices and this is not really even an
old device if you think of it at this
point the only feature that has
partially been ported from the note 7 to
the s7 edge is the new always-on display
and the reason why I say partially is
because the notification icons still
don't support third-party applications
at least right now the grace UX is still
not here even the theme store is still
the old version that doesn't let you
choose wallpapers or icon packs
separately this is not to say that the
current user experience is bad in any
way but features like secure folder the
blue light filter and even the updated
settings menu would really refresh the
appeal of the galaxy s7 edge and right
now Samsung really needs to do that but
to be fair they're half than some subtle
improvements like better palm rejection
and even if a few software updates made
this phone a little clunky about two
months ago that was fixed with a recent
update about two weeks ago as well
and then there are the things that just
won't improve even with software updates
like the case of the audio experience
the mono speaker on this unit continues
to be one of the tinniest and most
easily muffled my swans real audio
review has proven even the headphone
jack provides second to worst audio
quality over headphones at this price
range sure you may argue that it's
single best competitor doesn't have a
headphone jack but the amp is stronger
and really stereo speakers are the way
to go for the next Galaxy if it wants to
compete but you know what even if not
everything is perfect about this phone
there is one thing that competitors
still have not been able to beat and
that's the case of the cameras sampson
clearly has pushed out the best camera
combo for 2016 where color saturation
and contrast is never a problem and
where low-light performance is always
great it'll become a big fan of manual
controls and low lights and Aereo's
mainly to reduce the noise through
shutter speed tweaks it's just really
hard to stop using this phone mainly
because of how much I trust the camera
this is also still one of the best
experiences for stable video recording
and even if I'm not a fan of selfies I
do prefer this phone mainly because of
the wide-angle lens and also the bright
aperture really even seven months after
its release I still recommend the galaxy
s7 edge to my friends and family this is
one of the most beautiful phones you can
buy and also one of the most powerful
and capable and sure you could say that
Samsung has taken a backseat in adopting
new trends like dual cameras but I still
don't think that the market is mature
enough to warrant for you to consider
that to be something that's missing from
RIC at the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is
still one of the best phones of 2016 and
really just the software update away
from being a great phone overall
