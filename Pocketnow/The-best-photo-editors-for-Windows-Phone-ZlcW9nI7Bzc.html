Lumia 1020 and you've been taking some
awesome pictures with your phone but you
need something to edit those pictures
look no further I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and these are the best
photo editors for Windows Phone back in
July I made the decision to give Windows
Phone yet another chance the switch to
Windows Phone for the end time has been
a lot smoother the platform has matured
and although I can't really access my
Google services all that well there are
some notable alternatives that have
smoothed over to the transition however
there are still some things missing such
as one of the best mobile photo editors
that Windows Phone may never see
Snapseed which is now owned by Google
nor doesn't have the robust mobile photo
editor Photoshop Touch which is
unfortunate for the platform that's home
to one of the best smartphone cameras
ever while the photo editing app
selection may be a ghost town there are
some important apps worth checking out
the first of which is Thumba in fact
Thumba sort of reminds us of Snapseed
with its before and after quick previews
and seemingly quaint yet robust editing
tools choose a picture to edit tap the
magic wand icon at the bottom to open
all the filters adjustments and other
tools select an option and hit the
checkmark when you're done with that
edit it has 23 different filters redeye
reduction your standard adjustments such
as brightness control contrast white
balance etc and several trippy effects
that can be applied to your photos it
also has a watermarking option built-in
which can be automatically applied upon
saving or sharing though the watermark
is actually just a snippet of text
overall it's a decent photo editor and
well worth the $0.99 price tag one of
the more popular titles on iOS and
Android is aviary like most mobile photo
editors it comes with a horde of filter
and auto enhancements that never quite
seem to improve much of anything but
photo editor by aviary on Windows Phone
does allow for some manual adjustments
and the interface is extremely easy to
understand and navigate it's great for a
quick and dirty editor plus it's free so
you have nothing to lose when trying it
out photo light is a very lightweight
editor that comes with your basic edits
you can apply a grey scale rotate crop
adjust for contrast brightness resize
sharpen apply noise reduction
some other things and of course it comes
with a horde of filters that you can
apply to your photos photo light is free
and if it weren't for one key feature we
probably would have glossed over it an
exif data viewer one of the most notable
photo editors on Windows Phone is called
fotor it has two modes collage and edit
the UI is super simple and has a lot in
common with aviary choose a photo to
edit and choose what you want to do with
that photo say you want to apply a
filter if the redundant FX effects
button and scroll to the right until you
find the right effect choose from the
submenu of effects to apply and adjust
the intensity of said effect in the
collage mode you have oodles of
different layouts to choose from and
creating an actual collage is simple tap
an empty square to set a photo tap album
choose a photo and repeat the process
for all the empty squares you can adjust
things like the radius of the corners
margin thickness and shadow when you're
done with a collage or a single image
hit the Save button and you're done
photo tour is also free and well worth
checking out
finally a photo editor with one specific
purpose came from our own Adam Lane it's
called image water marker and it does
exactly what the name suggests and only
that you can apply a transparent Ping
watermark to your images before you
share them which can be very helpful
image water marker is simple to use and
free but there's one small caveat it's
an italian fortunately there are only
three options choose image add watermark
and save once you figure out which
button does what you're golden what do
you feel is the best photo editor for
Windows Phone personally my vote goes to
Thumba as it seems the most robust photo
tour isn't bad for quick edits and
Nokia's creative studio isn't bad but
it's limited to Nokia Lumia devices
