styles from the high-end to the super
cheap all manner of sounds can be coaxed
from these cans with a general rule
being the more you spend the better they
get but not all ears are created equal
and even headphone seeks to redefine
sound quality with patent-pending ear
print i'm adam down with PocketNow so
let's take these headphones for a spin
you may be aware that not all ears are
created equal this year is different
from that ear and that's different from
this year and that's different from well
you get the idea but what you may not
realize is that this year is also
different from this year sure they grew
up together but over time the ears have
started to hear sound differently and
that's what even is here to solve even
uses a patent-pending process which
plays eight different sounds in each ear
at different frequencies to get your ear
print the response to various
frequencies plus a little mix of
proprietary technology combined to give
you a full balance and even sound in
both ears wait even okay that makes
sense down anyway
this ear print is designed to give you
the best sounding music you've heard in
both ears that's
even's key selling point here and we can
confirm these headphones sound great
whether listening to a podcast jamming
on some metallic gaga or some rockin
lindsey stirling violin these headphones
will cover the whole spectrum of sound
from dubstep bass to whaling Kirk Hammet
and what's more it gives you the same
sound experience in both ears that were
missing when we use other headphones the
headphones themselves are solidly built
with padded metal headband and a walnut
ear cups there is no active noise
cancellation and the isolation of the
headphones is not the best you're gonna
want to pause your podcast when a train
passes the inline remote is plastic and
a bit cheap feeling and the even button
is easily bumped between your stomach
and a table another interesting choice
is that the volume buttons are
independent from the system volume that
means if you turn your headphones all
the way up and your phone all the way
down or vice versa
you don't get sound all the same great
balanced sound is just a set of
headphones away it's logical that our
heavy-metal damage ears might not hear
both the same way and even sound quality
is quite eye-opening in that regard
you'll really notice it when you're
using other cans the other peripheral
issues might bother you or might not
depending on your taste but as for
developing great balanced sound
even's mission here is accomplished
thanks for checking out our video review
of the even headphones don't forget to
give us a little love with a thumbs up
and share your thoughts in the comments
we have new videos every day so don't
forget to subscribe
once again I'm Adam doubt dead
technology on Twitter reminding you that
even you can have well-balanced sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
