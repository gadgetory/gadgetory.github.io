to take a look at the verizon wireless
storm 2 which is the successor to the
original storm which was heralded as the
first touchscreen blackberry on verizon
wireless the storm two will be available
in retail channels on October 28 and
today we're going to do an unboxing and
then we're going to take a look at the
hardware and compare the storm two with
the original storm so let's go ahead and
do the unboxing the original storm
actually came in a retail sleeve which
actually shows the packaging better I'm
not sure if we got a retail packaging
for the storm to but it comes in just a
simple box there are no manuals or CDs
included all it comes with is the score
to with the battery already and inserted
in the device on a charger USB cable and
headphones headphones for the device so
let's go ahead and set aside what came
in the box and do a hardware tour at the
storm two the device is actually a large
touchscreen slab Darren mill hardware
keyboards actually a relatively thin
profile and compared to the original
storm with the flex screen DeStorm to
and the original storm there are not
much difference in size or weight the
original storm had a click screen that
was a little bit wobbly you can actually
see it move around when you're up close
to it and there's a little bit of LED
light leakage coming from the the screen
around the borders also there are actual
physical hardware buttons on the bottom
which you won't find Bobby storm to the
storm to the screen actually you can't
press in when the power is off and the
buttons are actually integrated into the
large capacitive touchscreen so these
buttons are actually clickable on the
screen as well let's go ahead and turn
the device on once the device is
actually powered on the touch screen you
can actually press in right now
and start clicking but that was not
possible when the device was off let's
go ahead and take a look at some of the
hardware first before we go ahead and
look at the software on the back of the
device you have a 3.2 megapixel camera
which is the same resolution as it was
on the storm one and also on LED flash
the battery cover now you actually just
lift and pull and there are no latches
on the side as was on the storm one you
have the sim card the actual battery and
a microSD card slot which supports up to
32 gigabytes of memory card on the left
side of the device you have a micro USB
charging port and you have a short time
hardware button which is default to set
to the voice control application on the
other side you have the integrated
volume up and down switch and also a
shortcut key for the camera unlike the
storm one the buttons are a little bit
more subdued here you have the the
buttons or more integrated whereas on
the storm one it's actually chrome and
the three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack at the top here of a
storm one it protrudes out a little and
on the storm two it is more flush with
the device at the top this actually are
these are two buttons that you can
actually press in on one side you have
the mute button which is the same as it
is on the original storm and on this
side you have an integrated switch if
you press and hold it for a while it
will turn the device on and off and if
you just quickly press in it will
actually just lock the screen so when
you click on the screen nothing would
happen on the original storm the power
is actually integrated onto the end the
call end button but since this is a
capacitive touchscreen you can't do that
with the power button because there
would be no power if the device is often
you can't click onto the screen so this
is a brief hardware tour of the original
storm with the storm two so let's go
ahead and take a look at the software
tour comparison in the next
