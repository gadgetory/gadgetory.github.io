current generation ipad is due for a
refresh and the google nexus 10 seems to
be coming soon i'm high metal iveta
wishing i could switch the verizon right
now and this is pocket now daily images
have already surfaced to the current
generation ipad sporting a lightning
connector but keeping the same design
that you already know the rumors have it
you'll be getting a new ipad and the
ipad mini assets budget companion
october twenty third it just makes you
wonder if we'll be getting a new or ipad
next year early on or if this will be
the new ipad event happening in the fall
from now on now if you're interested in
the nokia lumia 920 or in the HTC
windows phone 8x this holiday season
best buy seems to already be offering
these on pre-order but the reason why i
say seem is because the nokia lumia 920
is no longer there the windows phone 8x
is still there for 150 bucks after a
two-year contract and it doesn't hurt to
pre-order now and get it on october 29th
that's the launch date or at least we
assume that because there's no shipping
date there now the google nexus 10 keeps
getting interesting apparently the code
name for the device is Manta it's being
manufactured by Samsung and aside from
sporting the 300 pixels per inch display
it'll also be sporting Android 4.2 the
question is what's Android 4.2 going to
be called think of a pastry that starts
with K but apparently the multi
manufacturers strategy for Google will
be the nexus 10 coming from Samsung then
we'll be getting a 3g version of the
nexus 7 and the LG nexus 4 october 29th
is the date now speaking of google
motorola customers have a new reason to
complain when it comes to their android
4.1 jelly bean upgrades first of all if
you bought any of the new razors that
were launched like three days ago well
you'll be getting jelly bean but that
will happen before 2013 that's a good
two months and a half for that to happen
and then if you're like me and you've
got the atrix HD or any of the new word
more role of devices for this year well
you'll be getting jelly bean but
Motorola doesn't know when I wonder why
Google bought the company seriously and
finally for the hot news of the
the HTC j butterfly that had everybody
drooling in japan is now showing up in
photos coming to verizon in the united
states now the vice brings the same
1080p display the same quad-core
Snapdragon s4 processor and Android 4.1
jelly bean out-of-the-box along with the
same design that we saw in that j
butterfly now we still don't know if the
device is going to be exclusive to
verizon but it's being dubbed the HTC
DLX or probably di x that leads me to
the question of the day would you be
getting this device if it comes out this
holiday season leave us a comment down
below now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
