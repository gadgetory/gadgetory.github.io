disturb means not get to adopt some
aluminum in there feature Lumias and
Tizen is the new word the Samsung arena
I'm hi Mary vetta hitting the fact that
I own an iPhone every new year and this
is pocket now daily you know the lg
optimus G was more than just a cheap LG
android smartphone for this year I mean
it really impressed is in our review it
impressed Google up to the point of
making that device the basis for the
Nexus 4 apparently LG is already working
on their optimus g2 which apparently
will debut at CES 2013 with a 1080p
display along with tons of better specs
so stay tuned for our coverage from CES
because we'll definitely be at the event
covering it live now nokia has been all
over the news lately with their
economical issues but apparently this
time the company's already been leaking
their 2013 lineup and their new Lumia
devices will apparently not include
polycarbonate and this time they'll be
sticking to aluminium to bring a much
lighter and stronger frame for the
chassis now the interesting new series
that appalling this device will be
called catwalk as in that's the code
name which I don't know if that has to
do with the right said fred song you
know the arms too sexy thing but the
point is the device apparently is
already being tested and hopefully we
will be seeing something at CES 2013
though most likely they'll be an
announcement today for it to be launched
in december as they always do now
Samsung has been hard at work when it
comes to software upgrades for their
galaxy s3 lineup probably the company is
currently working on an upgrade that
will fix the sudden death issues the
certain customers are complaining about
with their galaxy s3 Callie it is
isolated to the 16 gigabyte model it
runs the Exynos processor though we
can't confirm that and apparently it's
only happening to a few units now that
said Sammy doesn't provide any date as
to when the upgrade will be available
but we do know that there is a security
update being available today for UK
customers mostly for some issues that
people were complaining about so just
keep a lookout now speaking of Sami the
company apparently doesn't plan to leave
all their eggs in a couple of baskets
meaning Android Windows Phone and bada
barely the company is already hard at
work with their future galaxy s device
running the Tizen platform that pretty
much picks up the pieces of with no kin
until
with me go there are no dates just yet
as to when this device will see the
stars but apparently we could be
expecting another event and you never
know that could be the galaxy s4 I don't
think so though and finally for the
disturbing news of the day if you're
like me and lots of us that have noticed
that your iPhone or iOS 6 device does
not stop disturbing you even after
you've told the device not to do so
that's because the service doesn't work
and according to an apple support
document and won't work until January
seventh for reasons that they don't
disclose just like last year the alarm
didn't work on a specific date and it
just frustrates you that some services
don't really work all the time when it
comes to iOS 6 devices so that leads me
to the question of the day do you like
the fact that Apple will just send you a
support document saying sorry it won't
work until this date I mean I feel that
Apple should take more responsibility in
the fact that last year was the alarm
this year it's do not disturb what'll
happen next year will the phone work I
really don't like what's happening but
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow was on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi meri behna thanks for watching see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
