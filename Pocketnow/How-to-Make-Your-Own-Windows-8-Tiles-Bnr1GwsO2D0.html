pocketnow.com now when you sick of how
some of these tiles look on Windows 8
why don't we change them up
I'll show you how so here we are with
the windows 8 on my tablet and you see a
lot of nice flat tiles you got
information showing you got pictures
changing they look pretty nice but let's
scroll over here and now we're going to
see some of the old programs and they
just kind of normal program icons that
look like something from you know the
20th century and I don't really like
them so we're gonna change some of them
we're gonna make some new ones now back
in the desktop I've opened Photoshop
here and I've already redesigned some of
the Adobe Creative Suite icons you see
those here and I did it in Photoshop so
there's all my my layers and what you
need to do you have to make them 120 by
120 pixels so here's one that I cropped
out this is for Adobe Illustrator and
I'll show you it that it is 120 by 120
that's gonna be the size of the tile and
then you also want to save one that is
30 by 30 for the smaller size and so
that's gonna make a smaller one so we
need two of those and over here is my
folder full of all of my new tiles that
I want to use okay and now the next part
this is a little program called ugly
tile
now be sure to check out the description
of the video for the link to where you
can download this and I haven't launched
right here and from here you can type in
the tile name and you can hide the tile
name so if you do not hide it it's gonna
have the text written out on the bottom
of the tile and then from here you
choose the program path so let's find
illustrator
there we go you can add attributes if
you want now I'm going to choose the
tile image there is and I'm going to
choose the small tile image that's the
30 by 31 and you can choose a background
color this accepts ping files which can
support transparency I did not use
transparency in this one but you can
choose a background and tile color and
then I just hit create I'm tile has been
created it's now we go back to our Start
menu and there's the new tile I already
made those three but you can see it
looks a lot better than these old
old-style items now of course you can do
pretty much anything you want you could
make like a whole mosaic of a larger
picture and you can rearrange the links
so that's a quick look at how to use
oddly tile to create some more
interesting windows eight times for your
program icons be sure to give this video
a thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
