pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to show you how to do something
that's pretty awesome with your windows
mobile device if you're familiar with
the Verizon and Sprint MiFi you know
that it's a pocket-sized router that
essentially pulls down Internet data and
turns it into Wi-Fi so imagine you're in
the car with a friend and you both have
laptops there's AI beliefs in that
obviously not a Wi-Fi router around you
take out the my file you turn it on you
both can get Wi-Fi high-speed access and
use the connection at the same time you
can do the same thing with your windows
mobile phone through a special utility
and actually the HTC hd2 will have this
functionality out of the box but XDA for
a few months now has had a utility that
you can use on any Windows Phone and I'm
going to demonstrate it right now so
here I've got an HTC pur and I'm going
to go to the Wi-Fi internet sharing
wizard and I'm going to change the name
of the of this particular connection to
test and below that it has a WEP key and
I'm going to click on start and it takes
a moment to connect and now it's ready
tells you what to do and it says test is
running so right now on my netbook here
I'm not connected to any wireless router
just to sort of prove it if I launch
Chrome try to get to a website nothing
happens okay so in the bottom right
corner I'm going to go to the connection
manager and find test here it is right
here I connect to it press connect it's
going to ask me for the key which is one
two three four five six seven eight nine
nine zero press Enter connecting to test
but wait about 10 seconds for it to just
connect I'm going to move the device
over here okay and it says select a
location home network and let's see the
internet connection here we go we are
online right now through my phone and
what's really amazing is that I can put
this phone in another room or almost as
far as you could go with a wireless
router and I can still get a connection
let's go to speedtest.net to get an idea
of how fast
my up-and-down speed is on this program
using this program through my phone it's
obviously obviously not going to be as
fast as Wi-Fi because it's over cellular
data but it actually comes pretty close
to HSDPA for HSDPA so here i'm going to
begin test and let's see what we get
alright here it goes and it looks like
I'm getting a pretty fast downstate
actually about 1.4 megabits per second
which is quite good considering that
we're over Wi-Fi that's being
broadcasted from my phone and let's see
what the up speed it's probably gonna be
pretty low yeah you definitely don't
want to upload a YouTube video using
this this connection it's about point 12
megabits per second but you get the idea
and I've tested this while using two
laptops at the same time the speeds
stayed pretty consistent and it was a
very a very good and easy experience to
get multiple laptops connected so we'll
place a link in the sidebar on how to
get this program you're definitely gonna
want to have an unlimited data plan on
your device or else you're gonna
probably rack up a lot of overages if
you're using a laptop or netbook with
your data connection from your phone
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
