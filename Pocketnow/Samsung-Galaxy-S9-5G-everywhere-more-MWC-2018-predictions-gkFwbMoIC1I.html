packing and getting ready to head to
Barcelona for one of our favorite shows
of the year and the VC is all about
mobile and so are we we've been covering
a ton of rumors of everything that we
will see at this show at the PI now
daily and we decided to condense
everything into one video to make this
easy before we do that we would love to
give a shout out to Squarespace for
sponsoring this video whether it's a
domain or building your own websites or
even building your own online store
Squarespace is one of my favorite
services mainly because you've got
amazing templates it's got this really
awesome all-in-one platform and it's got
great 24/7 customer service I would
suggest you head on over to Squarespace
visit squarespace.com slash pocket now
to get 10% off and get started I'm
hiding everything I would walk in now
and let's talk am the BC 2018 I'm gonna
start this video off talking about LG
mainly because we were expecting to see
the next G at the show as LG has done
for every single MWC it turns out the
company has changed strategies so bear
in mind you're not getting a g7 at the
show according to official statements
what apparently we are getting is a new
LG B 30 meaning it'll look pretty much
like the current one but it'll bring a
boost in AI that will allow it to take
better photography and this phone takes
great photography already but we don't
exactly know is what will change
hopefully we're getting the snapdragon
845 on this phone as it allows an even
wider color gamut for photos but we'll
keep you posted on how that goes now
when it comes to wearables and tablets
we're not really expecting much I mean
if you've noticed the Google website
it's not even listing Android wear
anymore and I can't remember the last
time we had a really good Android tablet
regardless we hear that Huawei plans to
still approach this market it seems that
we will be getting a Huawei watch 3 I'm
not exactly sure if it's going to
continue on this recent trend of sport
and classic or we're gonna go back to
only classic with better hardware which
was my favorite
approach from huawei but yeah set your
watches for a watch three probably the
addition we also hear that Huawei is
going to bring a media padam five in
addition to another mate book I really
like the make books particularly let's
see if that happens too now obviously
the stars of the show are going to be
smartphones and we're really happy to
see one major player making a comeback
surely Sony Etsy is that unsurprised
anybody with their offerings but we hear
that their flagship will be announced at
MWC or should I say flack ships
apparently there will be a couple of XZ
variants that we should expect and
hopefully they bring this design
language that we saw at CES which fixes
the fingerprint scanner edition we also
hear that Nokia will bring an update to
its 3310 that might bring 4G in addition
to other Nokia Android smartphones that
will raise the bar to what we saw last
year we've also been waiting to see what
Alcatel is planning to deal with it's
one three and five series I mean we saw
devices at CES but these were mostly
dummies and concepts being shown off
that five series is really cool
hopefully it'll make a launch at MWC and
most important we also hear that a soos
is going to bring us as n phone five and
it's going to bring a ton of power
though I wonder if they're going to
continue their whole approach to
augmented reality or just stick to the
zenfone smartphone as it should be
I'll keep you posted on those as well as
for the theme of the show it is
definitely going to be 5g everything
we've been covering this for months
a lot of people were like now we're
still far from it we're actually not
surely what we get this year will not be
ready for 5g but we hear that Cockrum
wants to push this technology to be
ready by end of this year and be ready
for 2019 early so yeah 5g everything and
we also expect some surprises
probably from Huawei I mean we didn't
expect to see a p-series mainly with an
event being announced for March and we
also hear of this mate X variant but
there are some trusted sources that
claim that we will be seeing something
from Huawei so that'll be great
and another device that we've been
waiting for the longest time is the ZTE
axon successor which we hear is not
going to be 8 but instead
9 whatever the case may be apparently
it'll happen not necessarily at MWC but
we hear that we might see something so
stay tuned for that but finally the
hottest topic for MWC 2018 is definitely
going to be the Samsung Galaxy S 9 we've
been waiting for this phone forever and
we're glad to see it come back to
Barcelona for an event as it made a
hiatus last year over the ESA being
delayed to get things right after the
note 7s design is awesome when it comes
to rumors I mean we've been hearing
improvements in camera performance we've
seen Samsung teased that it's going to
be crazy fast and obviously we know that
the snapdragon 845 is going to be very
important for this phone so we would
love to know in the comments I mean
we've got a full show we're actually
going to be there for nine days what
would you like us to cover more
specifically at MWC we would love that
to serve us as a pretty much our
blueprint over how to cover the show and
we will definitely have a
boots-on-the-ground video to tell you
more about how we plan to do it so let
us know in the comments what you would
like to see friends that's it for
everything we expect to see at MWC make
