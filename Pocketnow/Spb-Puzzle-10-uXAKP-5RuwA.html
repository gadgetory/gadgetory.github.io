packing.com and today I'm going to show
you SBB puzzle 1.0 and this is a little
jigsaw puzzle program that works on any
windows mobile device with a touchscreen
so I'm just going to go into menu select
a new game and right here we have the
SPV preloaded images so you can select
this one right here and once you're
finished with this puzzle so if we go
into this it'll actually unlock this one
so if i click on resume we can start the
puzzle and let's see we want to do edges
first okay so when you have a piece that
you know will fit you just select it
here and drag it over to where it should
go so this is a corner piece oh I know
it's going to go in the corner and it
would give you a little hepatic feedback
which is a little vibration tell you
that you have it in the right spot so
that's neat I'm going to finish this up
and I'll show you what it does at the
end okay so I finished the puzzle and
here's the last piece and I can just put
it in here and it will load the image i
will show me a little blurb about the
image so it also showed me the wikipedia
address and give me the image as well so
click on next and click on new game and
click on one of our custom images and
select your own image so just click no
and then we'll load our image and we'll
click select now click easy and then
old-order image size you can see it's
loaded here and we can resume and it'll
break it into a piece of puzzle and the
cool thing about this is you can also
hit this back button and it'll take you
back to the image so you can see what
it's like so this is spb puzzle 1.0 and
i'll post a link and pas kinetic
comments to how to get this the program
does cost ten dollars with a full
version and it's pretty neat and it
works just like any jigsaw puzzle on the
desktop thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
