for the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus new
Amazon deals emerge and this time for
the Google pixel to sort of and the
essential phone is getting three
brand-new interesting colors I'm hiding
that arethat and in a perfect world
beavis and butthead would still exist
and but man would be the darker night
this is bogging out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for a Google pixel to in
pixel to excel I would highly suggest
you head on over to Amazon's woot and I
just been surprised I didn't know when
Amazon acquired Reuter that was always a
service that belongs to Amazon but yeah
refurbished pixel 2 for 529 bucks and
there are options up to 579 that is
crazy you should follow that now let's
talk about the essential phone those of
you that thought that this phone was
going to die given how little it has
sold there are actually three new color
options that are kind of crazy like for
example copper black stellar gray and
ocean depths and I hope I got those
names right the most important part is I
do acknowledge we've been sitting on
this review of the essential phone for a
while it has a lot to do with software
updates and everything but yeah it
doesn't mean that this is not a good
phone and one of these color variants is
already available you should learn one
of the description now let's talk about
Google's project fire it continues to be
my favorite way to connect I'm currently
in on dota as I've been traveling around
and my pixel to excel is connected
everywhere currently it has just
expanded to another 170 countries and
it'll still cost you a crazy $10 a
gigabyte and you've also got that data
protection after 6 gigs you can learn
more the description as well and for
those of you that have been rocking iOS
11 point 2 point 5 and you've probably
noticed some bugs on iMessage you are
not alone Apple has acknowledged that
there is this bug that actually makes AI
a message crash and depending on
whatever message you get you get even to
even deeper trouble Apple is working on
it but we're not exactly sure we're
getting the update just a heads up it's
out there and finally the very hot news
today I have to do with the samsung
galaxy as 9 as a yesterday we were
discussing the fact
the company is working on some sort of
an emoji that's gonna be called 3d emoji
the company actually eventually teased
that with a video where we saw this
probable emoji working in addition to
camera features the teasers show us that
it's great in low-light performance etc
you know it leads me to the question
today as we're getting close to MWC I'm
pretty much already packing to leave her
butts alone in a few days

+ s 9 plus you've heard the rumors
