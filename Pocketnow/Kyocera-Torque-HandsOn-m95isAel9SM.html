pocketnow.com checking out the new
Kyocera torque the bear grylls approved
phone super durable phone for Sprint in
the United States let's check it out so
this is the Kyocera torque we just want
to take a little quick hardware tow for
you this phone as you can see is heavily
heavily reinforced it is built to
standard IP 67 and 810g for durability
that's blowing rain salt fog humidity
solar radiation and water immersion
among a bunch of other things that I
have since forgotten you can see a
dedicated camera Hardware button there
the usual Android keys down below is a
sprint Direct Connect phone for their
CDMA based push-to-talk service so
there's the push-to-talk button volume
rocker - down this is a 5 megapixel
camera around back and you can see this
screw bears down on a gasket inside to
keep the things sealed up and these
ports USB microUSB and the headphone on
top are protected as part of that ip67
rating coming around to the front here
there's a 4-inch display this device is
running Ice Cream Sandwich Android Ice
Cream Sandwich
because jellybean does not yet support
the software necessary for Sprint's
Direct Connect service so that is
something there and one really really
cool thing is you'll notice there is no
earpiece port here and turn this play on
so you can see there's no hole there's
no penetration at all for an earpiece
because this uses tissue conduction
instead of typical speaker so what that
means is if we can bring the camera up
that means is when you bring the phone
to your face you're not getting audio
wave 3 or ear canal it's actually
conducting the sound through your
tissues so that's cool in a geek
encounter way but in a very practical
sense it means and I just did this you
can Don a pair of headphones like these
like you would find in a work
environment put the phone up to your ear
and you can actually hear the sound I
just did this a second ago there's no
way to demo it right now but it's
ridiculous it comes right through and
put it over to your forehead you can
hear the sound so obviously once again
very very cool from a geeky perspective
but also very cool in a practical kind
of sense and taking it down to the
device one last time we have the Nextel
controls reproduced on top the
speakerphone toggle on and off it's a
very loud speakerphone once again excuse
me it's not on the back left and right
forward firing speakers another really
really cool bonus so anyway just a quick
look at the Kyocera torque
4
sprint and just as a testament to the
durability of this device we'll finish
it up by tossing it in the durability
chamber and ruining the demo table sorry
everyone but once again a quick look at
the Kyocera torque michael fisher with
pocket now stay tuned for a lot more
from MWC 2013 as the story show
continues thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
