you're stuck in the appo ecosystem with
FaceTime iMessage and iCloud you can do
so much better for the same price or
even less if you're willing to go
Android in this video we're gonna talk
about two such options let's get to it
this video is brought to you by the
geniuses at Wix before we get into it I
should say that for this video I am
considering the tennis not the tennis
max because as we showed you in a
previous video the max does almost
nothing to take advantage of its larger
display to justify the higher price tag
it is our recommendation that if you're
going to get a tennis save the money and
get the smaller version the bigger
version is just not worth it so as such
we're not going to talk about the tennis
max in this video let's start with
phones that cost around $1,000 the first
phone that comes to mind that meets and
in most cases exceeds the capabilities
of the tennis is the Galaxy Note 9 with
the note 9 you get a bigger six point
four inch notch list Super AMOLED screen
that is both brighter and more vivid
than the 10s not only that but the note
9 has a pixel density above 500 thanks
to its 1440 by 29 60 display resolution
versus the 458 PPI found on the 10s is
12 42 by 2688 screen the note 9
Snapdragon 845 keeps up and in some
cases beats the 10s the note 9 is a
fantastic productivity tool that lets
you take notes signed documents and even
multitask like a boss thanks to split
screen multitasking and even pop-up view
that lets you window any app and place
it on top of another the tennis does
nothing except for picture-in-picture in
some cases to allow you to do two things
at once and multitask we could go on and
on about why the note 9 is a better way
to spend $1000 with the exception of
Apple diehards there's just no question
that the note 9 is better in almost
every way oh and it comes with a fast
charger in the box that allows the note
9 to go from 0 to 100 in about 100
minutes whereas the tennis of course
comes with a slow charger in the box and
it takes almost twice as long to charge
fully let's talk about another phone
that is better in most ways comparable
to the tennis
and that's the one plus six which is
over four hundred and seventy dollars
cheaper than the 10s and yet it's faster
by most measures especially keeping
absent memory let me just emphasize that
the one plus six is almost half the
price of the iPhone 10s half the price
half the cost the one plus six might not
have as good of a camera as the 10s will
admit that but the camera is far
improved from previous one plus phones
and we think that the six keeps up with
many flagships with the one plus six you
get a smaller notch a screen that is
nine percent bigger double the RAM a
significantly bigger battery plus you
get one of the most customizable and
smooth versions of Android ever before
we conclude this video let me tell you
more about our sponsor Wix if you want
to make an online store blog or other
website with no coding knowledge Wix
offers an amazing portfolio of tools
that let you design something that is
right for you and it's all drag-and-drop
or pick from one of their many templates
you can learn more in the description
below to wrap things up we don't think
that the iPhone 10s is worth it and you
have much better options at this price
point or even below so unless you're
tied to the Apple ecosystem consider
other options because there are better
ones out there than the iPhone tennis
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
