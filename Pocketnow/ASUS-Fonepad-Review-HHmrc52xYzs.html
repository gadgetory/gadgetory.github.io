phone functionality meaning you can put
it up to your ear and talk as strange as
it may sound will it be enough for you
to buy it well let's answer that
question I'm Anton Dean odd this is
PocketNow
and you're watching me a sousaphone bad
with you let's go check it out
the Asus phone pad is one of the first
tablet smartphone crossovers thanks to
Samsung we are by now familiar with the
phablet concept of a smartphone tablet
hybrid but the phone pad is a tablet
with phone capabilities one of its main
selling points is the earpiece at the
top a bold addition to a 7 inch form
factor will it make you leave your phone
at home and more importantly could this
be your one and only daily driver for
the full text of the assist on that
review including benchmarks and more
make sure to check out pocketnow.com and
follow us in the links in the
description on the outside the phone pad
shockingly resembles the Nexus 7 that's
because the Zeus is the company behind
both of them however they replace the
plastic back on the Google tablet with
the aluminum cover which is both good
and bad depending on which side you are
on looks or durability behind the
aluminum and front glass there's an
Intel Atom z24 xx processor clocked at
1.2 gigahertz with a single core 1 gig
of ram tries to help it in addition to
the power VR SGX 540 GPU you can choose
between 8 and 16 gigabytes of storage
options and of course whatever you
choose you can expand it by a micro SD
card slot and if you are lucky to live
in a region where the phone pad has a
back camera you'll find the use of the
3.1 megapixel shooter on the back else
you're stuck with the 1.2 megapixel
webcam our review unit has compatible
radios for GSM and HSDPA operation in
addition to the usual Wi-Fi GPS
Bluetooth radios no there's no NFC on
the phone pad powering everything is
Android 4.1.2 out of the box and a 4217
milliamp hour battery there are two
things setting the phone pad apart from
the Nexus 7 the earpiece and the
processor after using the phone but
exclusively for a week believe me when
I'll tell you this people will give you
the looks where ever you are once you
take a call on your tablet if you're
like me and you don't really care you'll
finally be able to leave your phone at
home while your
I know I'm one device lighter when I'm
on the go the Intel Atom z24 20
processor also known as the Lexington
platform is intended for emerging
markets a processor on the cheap not
compromising too much on the performance
and though even though it's a single
core in today's sea of dual quad and
even octa-core devices until heavily
calls out the Android optimization on
the CPU on the software side you're
greeted with Android 4.1.2 out of the
box would a light a su skin on top of it
which tries to keep things as close to
stock as possible the custom
notification shade and the assumes
keyboard can be easily disabled by
flipping a switch to revert everything
to the way Google intended Android to be
sure you left with other assumed
specific features but they're not that
much in your face like custom widgets or
some menu options
overall the tablet did a pretty good job
at handling a regular day-to-day
applications like Facebook Twitter
Google+ Foursquare email calendar
Spotify YouTube Maps browsing and so on
it is an instant but it isn't
frustrating either it does a decent job
until you throw a high-end game at it
where it occasionally stutters it is a
single-core CPU after all some other
assumed specific applications include
Asus blendin for tweaking your display
to your liking this is story for a quick
and easy way of grading photo stories
the zoo studio a gallery and photo
editing application the audio wizard for
tweaking the sound output by applying
certain equalizer settings and buddy
buzz the gathers all your social content
under a single application there's also
a dictionary file manager movie studio
paint application note-taking solution
Amazon Kindle and zinnia you can
uninstall a couple but you have to
disable most of those you don't use so
that they don't get future updates on
top of the baked in ones there are also
some asou specific widgets some
interesting like the battery widget task
manager and buddy buzz and some you
probably never use like several clocks
emails counters Press readers and so on
we've used the phone bed exclusively
over the course of six days in the city
of Florida Romania under the stable
HSDPA umbrella call quality was decent
on both ends and speakerphone
performance was solid the phone that
seems to not only pick up the slightest
signal but it also managed to give us
an additional bar level over phones in
the same spot sadly our review unit only
had a front-facing camera and thus far
as webcams am concerned it delivered
medium performance
it won't wow you but it will come in
handy for your Skype calls battery on
the other hand will deliver a solid
performance under light to moderate use
you will get as much as 3 days of usage
and under heavy usage it will surely
last throughout the entire day at least
our typical daily review usage implies
10 or so emails sent and received 3 to 5
calls just as many text messages social
media activity on Facebook Twitter
Google+ Foursquare listening to music
through Spotify watching PocketNow
YouTube videos light mapping and
navigation with a fair amount of
internet browsing your mileage may vary
depending on your usage and whether you
use one of the three modes of smart
power saving on the tablet ultra saving
optimized and custom we have had it
disabled all the time and still got
decent battery life the phone pad is
most of the times round the park however
that only happens when you put it to
your ear it answers a question of a very
specific market those who always carry a
phone for calls and a tablet for
on-the-go work even if you're not part
of the target audience having an
earpiece up top and never using it it is
always better than not having a certain
functionality at all
our review unit set us back 333 dollars
here in Romania but depending on your
region you might be able to grab it
cheaper if you're lucky you might also
be able to get the camera enabled
version 2 will rate the issues fonepad
an 8 out of 10 because even though it
has an earpiece and the Intel processor
is doing an excellent job at light to
moderate load that often has trouble
keeping up under heavy load that plus
the screen is moderate that's gonna do
it for our soos film path full review
