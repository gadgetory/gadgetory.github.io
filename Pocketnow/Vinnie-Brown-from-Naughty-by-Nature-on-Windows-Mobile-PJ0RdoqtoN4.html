i'm also a windows mobile MVP and we're
here with vin rock and why don't you
tell us a little bit about your contest
you have going on all right how you guys
doing out there wrong it's very Brown
from Naughty by Nature AKA them rock and
we have a promotion going on with
microsoft windows mobile over facebook
and our contest is you could win this
brand HTC touch pro2 preloaded with
Naughty by nature's custom theme
preloaded with our brand new single
called get to know me better so the
concert started June fifteenth we picked
the winner on july 15 and the winner
will win this phone and then the winner
and a guest will get flown out to LA at
the nokia theatre on august 15 and see
us perform live so the winner has to
answer to trivia questions about not a
nature absolutely well though don't get
the two questions i'll share the two
questions weren't you the first question
is what was the name of Naughty by
nature's group before we switched its
annoying by nature and then the second
question is what was the title of the
album under that previous groups name so
with those two clues or with those two
questions you're going to need to use
the internet do some research and I'm
sure you come up with so like in five
answers right now it'd be ready oh
definitely be ready so it's basically
like a lottery you have to be quick like
one of those jeopardy games or whatever
you you press the button and you know to
answer in you to win it want you to show
some close-ups of this custom graphics
got here okay well first and foremost I
mean this is probably the most exciting
part for me is a the reboot you know I
got my buddy pro back some
I found him over the Internet thanks
lament dash and probe X is from Canada
so once I saw his work I was like oh my
goodness he did a nun custom jessica
alba theme so once i saw that on the
internet I was like I gotta have this
huh this is my favorite part right here
watch this so of course this is a custom
screen right we had an animation going
on there you definitely hit a hip hopera
music playing in the background and
there's a three shot of myself kg and
Treach and i we actually just finished a
new album kg um left the group around
1999-2000 and we just recently reunited
and finished the new album and now this
is really exciting what we're doing here
so we're using the mobile technology to
reintroduce ourselves you know and as
you can see right here laying out at the
bottom if you have a sexy zoom that's me
and kg right then that red since he's
the leader and he's the man he gets all
the start time then and I on our Home
tab as you can see this is a home call
ill town so that's what we dubbed out on
home town east orange new jersey l town
and you know just as you go through
there's so many custom icons custom
graphics going on there and of course on
the internet yours truly pops up night
you know so as you know as you're going
through the phone I mean there's so many
custom graphics going on and the library
part we have this icon that naughty by
nature and from Inc is the title of the
new album so my buddy pro backs even an
incredible job wet you know
incorporating certain elements
that's really relevant to naughty by
nature you know and one of the main ones
on the homepage is the chain right here
all the naughty fans know that a Trent's
the chain remains so that's all our
brothers and sisters on lockdown and you
know just a reminder that no one's
forgetting them excellent did he
customize any other parts like the phone
dialer well yeah he's doing that now I
was going that now that's at the last
part you know because that's it again
you know this guy he has the basically
hack into touch book three day Anna and
he said there's so many files they're
like thousands and thousands of files
and every time they upgrade the
interface they leave a lot of junk
behind you know they don't clean up the
entire interface so he is a go through
search through and figure out what's
that stuff filter yeah exactly i'm
customizer exactly so you know we're
definitely trying to reach out to HTC
and you know just get a little more
insight info on on the user interfaces
so kind of turnaround product faster I
know windows mobile 6.5 is going to have
a lot of nice features for making your
own custom themes yes and that yes
you're planning to make your own theme
for what is mostly point five when that
comes out as one yes definitely only
have um touchflo 3d version 2.5 Hammond
out as well so definitely another
project it on a whole nother project you
know and then there's another interface
the sense UI come here if they have it
for Android this thing are going to port
it for windows mobile so that's a whole
nother product options yeah yeah
definitely so how did you first get into
windows mobile um at first I had a palm
treo and that was my first you know
introduction to PDA devices and as I
started using the palm there was a
actually an AT&amp;amp;T wrap he had an 80 125
and I was at we would go from
a car shop you know getting our car is
fixed so I had the trio I was swearing
by the trio and he was like hey then you
may want to check out windows mobile I
mean they really have a lot going on so
after a little researching and I picked
up the 8125 I realized I'm like wow this
is a mini PC you know once you click the
Start program and go through every damn
light this is a mini PC and then I knew
all the features it had you know just
native features with the palm treo
through a lot of third party apps you
had to use to the email read PDF so you
know the word documents that was like
Windows Mobile this is the world
illustrator so I was I was hooked from
there awesome now how did you get hooked
up with Microsoft on this contest
promotional project right well I'm
basically been a windows mobile fiend
ever since you know and once I found out
HTC was the hardware manufacturer of my
favorite windows mobile devices you know
I kind of zoned in on HTC and I started
just upgrading from that 8125 to the
8525 to the top and we've been waiting
for this touch pro2 you know so once I
saw the touch pro 2 then they're
actually even before that I saw the
touch pro yep and you know I've been on
xda-developers all the underground sites
always check parking out how to get the
latest info and I came across a guy died
she had a touch pro and he had a custom
interface on it which was the unjust
calma theme once I saw that I was like
wow you could really do a lot and
automatically like I'm the marketing
guru for naughty by nature anything i
see i translated for the group you know
so when I saw it I was like I could have
that for naughty by nature so i dub thee
and i found the guy who actually did the
theme guy named pro backs up in Canada
so I emailed them told them hey buddy
I'm a big failure you
he hit me back I'm a big fan of your
work and I you know we started
developing the thing then from there I
know we had the new album I was like I
have to find someone from windows mobile
and and cross promote with the new album
so even my road manager Duane he was
like then you didn't know how you didn't
know when but you knew you were going to
find Microsoft and it was like divine
intervention we want a flight to detroit
and i saw a guy with an AT&amp;amp;T talk so I'm
like the phone junkie always see or look
and see who's using Wi-Fi there and
every person who has a windows mobile
device I made small talk boil you know
so I'm like hey buddy I see your fellow
82 owner because at the time I had the
touch HD but I sent it up the canada so
pro bikes could start walking and
building the theme so I reverted back to
my tilt so I'm like hey buddy I see you
have an AT&amp;amp;T tilt he was like yeah I
actually worked for Microsoft I like
what he's like yeah I actually work for
Microsoft and um you know I'm not
allowed to have a iphone but we have
tons of new phones coming come please
who are you talking yeah I'm touch pro2
you have one of those mobile seven
coming you have this that the other and
I whipped out my arm shift I'm like
buddy i use my shift I'm like I'm
building a custom theme from the touch
pro 2 tonight the touch pro two he
didn't even really know about that you
know I'm sure he's so involved in
supermarket yeah yeah so you like
whatever you know but I told him about
the phone like I'm developing this theme
for this new phone is coming out it's
like one of your best phones coming this
summer and I'm looking for your
marketing department it's to
cross-promote so I showed them
screenshots that the thing we had and he
was like that I'm sure the people would
love to work with you so he's like can
you email me on the feudal screenshots
are your thing I was like of course so
by the time we land it I popped in my
sim card in this shift and as I was on
my way to the hotel I sent them the
emails and from the screenshots he had
everything
before i'm sure he reached his
destination and by the time I got back
from by the time I got back from Detroit
I had an email from windows mobile the
marketing department he was like hey
then we got your email and and we love
the work something out with you so big
up to my man Matthew keys I met him on
the air on an airliner and you know
because of him we made this happen so
you know once hooked up with the
marketing department we tossed around a
few ideas and they just came up with the
promotion you know collectively we came
up with the facebook promotion unlike
pretty cool and then they really blew my
mind he said hey then let's take the
Wonder and fly them to one of your show
so I looked on my itinerary on my la
staple center and I august 15 everyone
would love to go to our lake and
excellent we made it happen so this is
an seinfeld in a shoe store this is a
real guy real windows mobile power user
you know promoting them when it's more
yeah definitely I mean and it's not even
a deal it's just the promotion you know
and you know some people are like hey
why are you guys using Naughty by Nature
why don't you use it and soldier boy or
jay-z and like you guys you don't get it
it's not about that it's not about
grabbing a hot celebrity and using them
you know it's about real windows mobile
users who understand the product who for
want to love the product and that's why
this thing makes sense so I guess it's
just the test to see how things work out
and you know hopefully the relationship
we evolve as an MVP for windows mobile
we've always been complaining about the
marketing
so we grabbed you ever seen a commercial
for windows mobile phone or when that's
one more in general absolutely not you
know windows mobile or HTC I'm sure
they're fixing it now you know the donor
heart I see them they have the ozzy
osbourne commercial going out then I'm
reading a lot about HTC you know what
they're doing as far as marking
especially in the US market but I know
like hip hop music we are the best
marketers in the world you know we've
taken cardboard from the street corners
and made an international phenomenon you
know we took scratching on your parents
record players and made that
international I'm sure something is
useful as a windows mobile device we
could definitely you know gain some
ground on some of these other devices
that really sell themselves but they
basically do half the things windows
mobile does yeah so what are some of
your favorite programs they have on
windows mobile well for me I'm a
traveler and I'm not much of a gamer so
for me what I definitely love is my
navigation I know they have time time
but I you know I support you have I use
telling that and then of course you see
I have slingbox on here so I always you
know check out slingbox then I have us I
have skype i use skype definitely when
I'm overseas you know I catch a Wi-Fi
connect and you know we do a lot of
concerts so now it's like every concert
hall has Wi-Fi free Wi-Fi or you know I
can always get the UM get the code and
get on and then I have Scott fire that's
my favorite browser head to use skyfire
and another program I like I mean this
world card mobile I like that like I get
a lot of business card so the ones I
don't throw away now hot another throw
business cards away the ones I really
a lot I just take the picture and it's
amazing how it gets on with that info in
it and of course i use facebook shout
out the facebook they've been really
good to us over there and i really love
this notes program because I'm always
dropping down little notes and stop it
this is what I love that other devices
don't have you know you have a digital
pen and paper at all times so I could
always use that yeah recorded voice
knows yeah voice notes the voice no
program I actually use that a lot I I
have a lot of voice notes on here
because you know when i'm home writing
my rhymes um I'm always playing back off
the computer but when I write the runs
and I think I have it complete I whip
out the voice recorder and see the verse
yeah so you know I I definitely use the
voice recorder before I get to the
studio I'm like hey if it sounds great
on this and it's just a rough I'll nail
it in the studio alright last question
anything to say to the windows mobile
haters out there the windows mobile
hater so I think I would say this to the
windows mobile haters you know it's all
about ignorance and not ignorance in a
bad way ignorance meaning you just don't
know you know you just don't know so
before you hate on windows mobile before
you say uh this sucks or this device is
vada do it feature for feature
comparison I mean all of these devices
have pages and pages of what they're
capable of doing and it's not about you
know who's better than what it's about
feature versus feature so go ahead I
dare you awesome thank you very much for
joining us no prob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
