n2 Aoife 2014 but before we left we
wanted to run down the highlights of the
show for you join us as we take you on a
tour of the smartphone tablet and
wearable news we've encountered this
week in Berlin the first devices we saw
after landing in Germany and arguably
the most significant smartphone
announcements of the show where
Samsung's note line the galaxy note 4
something everyone was expecting coming
into the show Samsung is used to launch
its new Galaxy Note smartphones for the
last three years and although it's
pretty much iterative this year the
Galaxy Note brought some necessary
changes to one of Samsung's most popular
brands like actual metal trim and even
some newer S Pen features and even
though it's pretty minor the bump to 32
gigabytes for the base model is a trend
I'd like to see for more manufacturers
the one device I don't think anyone
expected what's the Galaxy Note edge
we've been shown this curved display
technology for years I've seen it at CES
at least two times now but I don't think
anyone was expecting the note edge to
actually emerge but it did and it's
effectively a galaxy note 4 without a
bezel on the right edge the display
wraps around the side of bone with 160
extra horizontal pixels looks cool when
it's interesting until you actually cold
and use it there's a lot we're uncertain
of like how useful it is important or
for left-handed users by myself and if
any developers will even use the sba
either way samsung isn't giving up on
curved displays anytime soon it's only
the beginning from the looks of it
Samsung device I was most looking
forward to was the galaxies have active
actually no it wasn't it was a total
surprise to me and I had a good time
checking out this rugged tablet anyway
it was samsung's new SmartWatch capable
of operating without being connected to
a smartphone which captured my inspector
gadget imagination and the run-up to
Aoife and after holding the gear s well
I still think that hardware is rather
beautiful if clunky Samsung Tizen
software didn't do it justice on the
show floor I was much more impressed by
the LG G watch our it's still no moto
360 as Joe leave I will doubtless a test
and the name is pretty weird but it's
circular display is still impressive a
much more fitting home for Android wear
than sony's somewhat unremarkable
SmartWatch 3 sadly as we discussed with
guests nicole scott and Joshua Vergara
on the latest pocket at weekly podcast
none of these wearables are a great fit
for women the wearables are all too big
I wish that someone would come up with
something a little more elegant
something that fits my wrist I have this
once Moses a thigh gap but you know take
me moving this is like good watch cap
that's a problem the SmartWatch
ecosystem has yet to solve and Aoife
2014 didn't do anything to change that
one place samsung may be targeting women
is with the Galaxy alpha based on the
advertising we've seen from the company
and the tendency of om's to market
smaller devices to the female audience
the gender ankle is a conversation for
another time what we will say now is
that the Galaxy alpha is almost exactly
what the galaxy s5 should have been even
without its IP rating people at least in
the vocal online communities on a nicer
flagship from Samsung a pretty handset
with nicer build quality to better
complement its stance in the industry an
active variant would have brought
ingress protection anyway the galaxy
brand wouldn't have been diluted further
and the Alpha series wouldn't have even
needed to exist it all would have made
more sense switching to another s
manufacturer we found Sony's line of
larger devices more impressive but
thanks for the company's quick-paced
release cycle nothing here is a real
surprise the z3 is an improvement over
the z2 in both features and hand feel
and the z3 compact builds on Sony's past
experiment
smaller flagships on the bigger side the
z3 tablet compact brings the slim design
and lightweight of the tablet Z to a
smaller form factor and given how much
we enjoyed using the original tablet Z
in the bathtub we're excited to give
this one a try speaking of size while
weight went big with its ascend mate 7
in more ways than one for sorters it
would all metal two jingly glossy
plastic your it also blatantly ripped
off the design of HTC's One max even
taking what Michael refers to as the g
string but it has a huge battery
beautiful sulfur in the best mobile
fingerprint scanner we've ever used it's
fantastic and works exactly how a
fingerprint scanner on a phone should
work while wave hecht everything that
could into this one and it's a truly
solid entry and let's not forget
Microsoft the company dazzled us with
the colorful notification light of its
new wireless charging plate and teased
us with the possibilities of Lumia denim
but the real star of the show is the
Lumia 830 smartphone meant to bring
Nokia's excellent camera experience to a
lower price point with a special 10
megapixel PureView shooter it's sibling
the Lumia 730 is much less notable well
it's got a solid front facing camera
it's mainly a vehicle for Microsoft's
new selfie app which will be made
available to other Lumia phones
eventually and much of the news from
gifu came from the other side of the
world our own Adam Devils on site at
Motorola Chicago event and everyone's
favorite Android guide to leave i
unboxed the new Moto X moto 360 and moto
G the Moto X has now five point two
inches framed in aluminium comes with
bamboo and leather backplate options and
has front firing audio the Moto 360 is
the same circular Android wear watch
we've been drooling over since spring
but it didn't launch with the steel band
options only leather straps and the Moto
G crew to 5 inches has a higher risk
camera and it also has fun firing audio
off the same starting price as before
179 dollars before tax and a bit of a
loose end from HTC something we saw
quite early in the shows the desire 820
looks a lot like the other members of
the desire family but with much more
stylish trim a big ol screen in a 64-bit
processor which of course will matter
to those who want to crow about specs
and might matter more as Android starts
taking advantage of hardware like that
thanks for joining us from Berlin for
another exciting international phone
ushed alone and if you want it even
longer run down of Aoife 2014 tune into
pocket now weekly 112 where mobile geeks
own nicole scott and android authorities
Joshua Vergara join us for an extended
podcast running down all of the fun and
exciting and maybe some of the
disappointing stuff from this show until
next time this has been michael fisher
and i'm taylor martin and we'll see you
on the other side of the ferns a term</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
