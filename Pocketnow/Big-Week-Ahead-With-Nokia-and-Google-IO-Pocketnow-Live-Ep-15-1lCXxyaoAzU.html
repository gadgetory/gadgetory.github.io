morning good afternoon good evening
everybody welcome to pocket now live
episode number 15 from the top of my
head I think I'm right I am Anton denied
managing editor for public pocket not a
town thank you very much for joining us
and I have with me today senior editor
Joe Levi good morning good afternoon
where we are hello and also with me is
senior editor Taylor Martin had it howdy
you definitely have to teach me how to
say that so before how are you doing
before we kick this off I have two short
announcements to make as usual I will be
moderated be live good morning oh my god
and I'm hearing myself speaking which is
never good and I have no idea where I ok
I'm muting myself it's a terrible I feel
ok now we should be fine so you should
it's it's awful to hear yourself echoing
so the first thing I'll I am monitoring
the YouTube comments so if you guys have
any questions please post them in the
youtube channel all caps question and
question as well as on pocket now on the
posts another announcement is that we
will have Joe Levi with us only for the
first 30 to 45 minutes so he will have
priority and any conversation the topics
for today are easy not yet happening on
the fourteenth google i/o on the 15th
but enough of me I'm gonna hand it over
to Joe we don't want to lose any more
time so Joe please take before all right
I'll do what I can every ones frozen up
on my end but person I don't even have
names over here ah there we go it's back
for a minute so let's start off what are
some things that you hope to hear coming
out of Google i/o and the Nokia vent
let's start off with wu jie zhang did I
pronounce that ok yep welcome to the
show what what are the things that you
hope will get out of those two SMS
comments keep getting this echo
it's the plague of the echo Tony uh I'm
hearing everybody fine without an echo
at the moment so I'm getting some weird
echo about a minute delayed echo maybe
you can see if you have any other
windows open where this live show is
playing else I'll have to ask everybody
if we are not talking to you guys please
mute your microphone thank you uh does
it be it okay I think we have a problem
with with him Joe can we sign up to him
and choose somebody else let's move
right along so whooshing will come back
to you in a little bit let's go next to
a-rod tovar tovar welcome to the show
tell us what you hope we're gonna get
out of Google i/o and our nokia event
hey how'd you doing guys really well
really I don't know what's going to
coming in Google I'd like to know a
little more about it I don't hear too
many things about that so that's
anything from you guys is gonna be
better so we'll start off some rumors
that we've heard google seems to like to
announce new versions of android or at
least show off parts of them at Google
i/o they're not always available at the
conference or immediately after the
conference and for a while we were
hoping that we were going to get android
5.0 key lime pie at this year's i/o
recently we've got some rumors coming up
to that may be substantially to get this
point that point to not getting key lime
pie by point 0 at the show but rather
4.3 which everyone's calling another
flavor of jelly bean we ran some
articles on that recently about some
things HTC is announced or not really
announced but let leaked that they're
going to be including in their upcoming
products with Android 4.3 so maybe we
should turn it over and say if we do get
4.3 what kind of stuff are you hoping
that we'll get inside that
version of Android oh so many games I
can wish but I don't know this comes it
through really I can't think anything in
this moment with yes everything is we
get in this moment so far it's been good
to the phone and the Android one so you
see guys so many videos of all the
Holograms hip pads and everything I
don't think so that will not be true I
don't think so the technology is there J
so probably what we can get now is more
speed and the processor that's going to
be the best in think we just lost Joe we
lost this video maybe we got his audio
go he still with us I am afraid not and
he's gonna have a hard time getting back
and I am I'm seeing dublicate people I'm
seeing lags and I'm seeing people
joining like 55 thousand times so yeah
well if our dear guest here is talking
to Joe right now has any other questions
for myself or for Taylor please go on
because we lost you this moment no okay
i will say just just quickly that I are
we getting echo as well I'm getting a
little too and i have no idea from from
whom I neither but um it i will probably
see babble that's probably them the big
thing for android is the unified
messaging and chat app which i'm dying
for already okay thank you very much for
joining us if you have any final
thoughts please feel free to let
everybody know of them or where you can
where they can find you on your social
media networks or good morning here in
google+ or a lot awesome thank you very
much for joining us
and they have an awesome weekend take
care of it fever please well I see some
Tibor thumbnails like jumping like crazy
in my status bar please feel free to
choose somebody to talk to you okay i'm
waiting for names and things that it's
going crazy right now you gotta love
hang out I can't see much of anything me
neither just go played by ear this is
gonna be fun yeah all right um I'm gonna
pick the first person I see I'm mark to
mark Selwyn so so on I don't know how to
pronounce names of bad with names how
you got it all right sweet so you have
any questions for us first and foremost
no questions I do definitely have some
predictions actually okay I'd love to
hear so a couple weeks ago I actually
went to Google for a developer meetup
they do a lot of those on their campus
and one thing that I noticed was being
really big and a big on the secrecy was
around the Google+ building um and I
think unified messaging a service and I
think there's a bigger picture i think
google is going to go all out and try to
fully integrate everything right cuz i
think if there's one service that people
aren't using the most it's google plus
and I feel like they're gonna I think
with the next iteration of Android it's
going to be a it's basically going to
integrate Google+ in a way that's going
to essentially force everybody to use it
one way or another so for example they
could do things like you know they can a
great Google+ further with google music
and they could do something like you
know playlist listening parties or they
could do something with google maps
where they could you can say hey i'm at
this bar right now come join me you know
like public like public announcement say
like you know this group of friends
describe circles are at this place right
now come join in things like that so i
think i think we're going to see
a big push on integration between
services especially with Google+ yeah
that's something I'm definitely looking
forward to it something that that google
has failed to do over the past couple of
years because they have so many
different messaging and communication
platforms and none of them are even
remotely integrated with one another
Joey EU back just just a question yeah
I'm kind of back ok good thing I'm
working on I'm sorry fact you thinner I
think this finally calmed down finally
we don't have like 50 people trying to
join well yeah and i have my control
panel of x which is good not as good but
what i was saying is is google has so
many communication platforms and none of
them are remotely integrated google
voice google talk google+ messenger
which is kind of the same but different
from google talk gmail that there are so
many different ways to communicate using
google and none of them are integrated
there you have to use a different app
and a different service for everything
and it drives me insane you're not so
yeah and another thing i noticed was i
recently what I've been you know on the
job hunt and you know obviously Google
is one of the top places i'd like to
work for and I noticed that Google has
been ramping up a lot of support and
operations for Chrome they I've
discovered that they have hired three at
least three third-party recruiters and
they've been going crazy been hiring a
support technicians for the Chrome
operating system and chrome Hardware
recently so I feel like there's also
going to be some sort of big push on
Chrome it's always a big push on Chrome
that's their money maker yeah part of it
I have the thing that Android is going
to be taking a back seat at this I oh I
think that Android is gonna I think I
think they're going to use what they
have to you know integrate and build on
existing services but I don't think
we're going to see anything drastic on
the android phone I think it's going to
be chrome Google+ and Google glass this
year
yeah in a way those are all part of
Android because it's it's all kind of a
unifies to ecosystem so so let me chime
in there just for a minute and this is
just me kind of brainstorming thinking
outside the box a little bit rather than
seeing a big emphasis on Chromebook on
Chrome proper or on Android I think we
may see a lot more integration and tight
coupling of services between all of
their product offerings on all platforms
and that's also going to include all of
the iOS stuff that we've seen recently
which they're getting some
features over there that they're a
little bit nicer looking and feeling
than than they are in android so I'm
really hoping that this IO is going to
be about bringing the entire Google
experience together regardless of
platform regardless of of OS regardless
of where you are and I like Taylor think
that's going to focus a lot around that
you know this product Babel which is
going to a project battle which is going
to unify as much of the real-time
communication services as possible yeah
I'm probably wrong but that's what I'm
bringing more to the ecosystem versus
you know having this broad array of
services that don't really play that
well together kind of bringing it
together and making it an ecosystem then
making it awesome yeah and awesome I
will use that exact words to describe
not only your glasses mark but your
microphone is awesome it's even more us
and then the microphone I'm using and
half of the bucket now team so thumbs up
for that you have any final thoughts um
no that about does it for the i/o stuff
then I'm gonna lock my camera on you so
people can see where to find you it's
plus Mark Sullivan if I can see right
that's your google blossom yep that's
the one okay so everybody go at him to
his to your circles thank you very much
for joining us thank you and that is a
nice Mike I have one of those it's very
nice thank you figure and Joe back to
you but not before I have a question and
it's from YouTube sterling man says do
you expect windowed apps in android for
dot free / 500 most probably the same
way and on the same vein as Samsung's
multi-window 4.3 no 5 10 possibly I
think before we go to full multi window
like Samsung's doing we're probably
going to see more chat head like
experiences where we're getting
notifications pop ups and relevant
information on top of whatever app
is is active and then that will slowly
grow out into having other peripheral
apps being able to run at the same time
as another app but I don't know if
Android even in key lime pie is going to
see true multi window at least not on
the smartphone platform maybe when we
get to tablets will see that just my 2
bits yeah but I'm actually exactly on
the same page there tablets yes multi
window is a great thing it's wonderful
for tablets multiple windows on a phone
unless you have something the size of
the galaxy note 2 or what the rumored
size of the galaxy note 3 is it's kind
of useless like I can't really get into
it on the galaxy s4 or the galaxy s3 and
I even struggle with it on the note 2
because you just don't have enough
screen to utilize to applications at the
same time unless you're using something
as lightweight and and free-floating as
chat heads that's why I found chat head
so impressive it's because it works so
well it's it's just boom the load the
app loads you do what you need to tap it
and it's minimized well it's not just
the app that just works it's that it's
the metaphor it's the concept it's the
way that that information is
communicated that whether it's chat
heads or whether it's something else
that interstitial just work yeah I don't
know if you saw the editorial I did we
lose Joe again we did oh man this is
awful I did an editorial i wrote an
editorial on hold on to sport with one
second please dboys holdings people
please stop trying to join us you
obviously cannot you I cannot stop you
from joining I can please ask you stop
joining because we cannot talk to you
and you are taking up half of the slots
available thank you very much and I'm
sorry that's that's just the way Google
sucks yes Google if you see me now you
suck back to you tater I'm frustrated
because I have no souls i see people
coming and going like 55 times per
second and i can't do anything yeah it's
driving me nuts too
but I wrote an editorial saying that you
know there are so many other ways that
we could implement something like chat
heads nice as a beautiful finger you
have there um we like Spotify I did a
mock-up of a nap it was Spotify and if I
can if you can lock it on me I'll try to
get it on here just as you are locked
all right I will I have to find this
first so and we got your back thank God
yeah yeah uh I don't know what is
happening on my way knows what happens
so let's play by ears it's the thrill of
being live it's part of the experience I
think I'm frustrated enough for the
entire team and the participants yeah oh
my god of fire who we are watching
Taylor looking for something and having
no idea what he looks for and let me
lock the camera on meds because he said
something yes Google sucks and i agree
with you very much for letting us know
can't you are lost again here to give up
I don't think I can find it I don't know
what happened still lots oh sweet ok
let's let's move on Joe still still your
turn you know since I'm having
connectivity problems correct ok let's
go back to your first goal because I see
him waving at he probably solve his
problems mujhay jang or I'm sorry wu jie
zhang yeah hello we can go ahead we've
got yeah yeah hey nice to be back
finally uh google other than what's
happened after the update uh yeah the
google i/o i guess is next week and I
have a question uh do you think
anything's going to happen with Android
this time cuz you know nexus 4 has been
released not for
back so you think they're gonna release
something to do with Android or they're
gonna do something else with the i/o
this time okay okay so we kind of talked
a little bit previously about what we
expect from android the OS on it sounds
like your question is more towards the
hardware I I don't suspect that we will
see a nexus 5 or a nexus 4 refresh at
this IO however I would not be surprised
if we saw a refreshed Nexus 7 and that
might be extra ram M it might be faster
processor it might just be a big nexus
for whatever the case may be I suspect
we'll get a refresh of that and that is
where they will show us the the new
version of Android again probably 4.3
are you on the same page there Taylor um
I don't know I don't know if I want to
make a prediction cuz I I don't want to
say that there's not going to be Android
5 this time around I love for the tube
because we've been on Android for 42
years now so I'd like to see Android 5
finally I'd like to see what I'd like to
pick Matias Duarte his brain and see
what's going on because he's completely
radically changed Android from what it
was so who I'd like to see something
major of course I think we all do we
want that shock and awe but
realistically they did so much in jelly
bean and ice cream sandwich that I don't
know if we're ready for five yet so and
there there's not going to be a new
handset not a new android handset at
Nexus or at the Iowa Conference i
refresh on the Nexus 7 is very likely so
that's that's probably it it's going to
be modest and we're all going to be
upset but it'll be good but a lot of the
Magna services and the services that
allow us and get us find so we can
actually run it on hardware one thing I
really want Google to do right now with
andrew this defragmentation issue
so I'm hoping that next version of
android they finally address it because
my phone is in what 4.1 point2 and I'm
guessing it's not going to be updated
for next few months after new Android
comes out so that's what I was hoping
from I I oh yeah um that's that's a
tough one because you've got so many
different manufacturers and devices and
and strains of Android that it's not
exactly easy to just throw out a it's
all solution mmm they've done some great
things with you know the android update
alliance the android partner what was
that one Joe I can't remember what it
was but they they basically agreed to
send the updates before they're finished
to manufacture so they can start
building the updates before the whole
version of Android rolls out I think
they promised to send out updates at
least 18 months with 18 months after
yeah that was the the android update
alliance but there was one last year it
was partner update something I can't
remember what but they chose specific
partners that will get software updates
before the update is finished so say key
lime pie is still six months out
motorola samsung HTC and all the biggest
manufacturers will have it before the
update rolls out so it's ready to go
once it comes out but yes there it is
platform developer kit Thank you Thank
You Silas I expect we we're seeing from
HTC the leaks that we're seeing from HTC
I suspect that they Samsung LG who else
am I missing from the list but those are
the big three that I think are in that
alliance that are not only getting the
updates but actively working towards
being quote unquote launch partners for
the next version so they'll if Q imagine
that I haven't heard this in the news
anywhere but when that Oh
s is announced that all three of these
partners have products that are going to
either new products that are either
going to come with it or existing
products that are going to have updates
for it available within 24 48 72 hours
after the announcement of the new OS be
phenomenal that would be awesome the
downside like that is we get leaks like
HTC is doing where we we see hey there's
two new features that are probably going
to be in 4.3 yeah there's that and then
there's also carrier carrier approvals
which is a rigorous process that takes
months yeah that's the biggest that is
androids biggest issue is that every
update has to go through a rigorous
approval process even if it's a bug fix
it has to go through approval let's
please speeding along yeah so yeah um so
do you have another question one final
daughter anything to more day the by the
way I try to settle on one okay uh Tony
last time I been on the Hangout when you
were in mwc I showed you this phone the
original Galaxy S yes nice yeah that's
running cm 10.1 right now I Cape this my
brother and I got you this no 20 nice
that's nice and I'm saying this right
now this is the best one I ever had but
sadly is going to be my last Samsung
device for a while oh now you have to
tell me about why it will be your last
and some device uh well right now I have
this phone which is my first epiphone
which for samsung so love that yeah this
is my samsung jet so i abstain least
something for three phones in a row and
i really want to try other phones I mean
d I really want to try HTC oh yeah by
the way tired Taylor you're not the only
one who want it who want HTC to make
next Nexus I really want them to make
one all right I think Joe is also a huge
yeah yeah nexus one was amazing it
wasn't most it was really beautiful
phone anyway yeah so yeah this is
steadily going to be my last samsung
phone for a while is it because you want
diversity after so many phones or is it
because Samsung did something which you
don't like or no longer like well
diversity yes and also samsung they have
so many blog without the new stud is
cumbersome yeah there's the family right
there oh yeah galaxy s3 s4 in the note 2
is my family s long note as samsung jet
all right version so yeah go ahead take
it away Tony no I was I was just locking
my camera on Joe he was showing his back
and the QR code on it and that i'm
showing not the QR code but the HTC logo
no the HTC g2 i love her I love stuff
awesome phone anyway yeah hospital so
yeah it's my phone now and I'm stuck
with it for two years well hopefully
bye-bye 2015 when you get unstuck with
it samsung will be who knows where an
HTC will be who knows where do you have
any final thoughts you would like to
share with us not really that's all i

also showed me your HTC One I'm yo yes
hi hi so first of all my museum okay
okay show us Lumia 920's you see one and
the beautiful awesome plastic es4 with
the yellow color that yellow looks nice
yes it's so fresh and some are you know
what I like yellow so I like this these
two IL so you see are you another
console you get the same old iphone 5 so
that's all old school yeah last but not
least the I plans but no so I have a
question for you yes please uh nokia so
do you think a new flagship is really
needed now to bring back the name of and
prestige of Nokia in this period where
all
flagships have come out you know the s4
HTC one ok iphone will look on with the
new WWDC so really just note you need a
top shelf you know top tier phone model
or is it enough to bring up middle class
you know like Sen 2625 training and all
I basically I personally think that it
is now the time for a flagship because
the Lumia 920 was announced summer in
October last year so that's October
November December January February March
April May that's eight months back so it
is now time for a flagship I'm not sure
they will announce the flash and here's
why if the EOS which has been rumored
for so long we'll have a for you
40-something megapixel camera I'm not
sure windows phone 8 and its current
iteration supports that high resolutions
but again nakia might show the EOS off
and say hey guys this will be available
in august but yes the answer your
question I think it is time after eight
months we had a nokia windows for pledge
doing this famous or joe disagree or
agree please feel free to complete my
answer windows phone 8 will support
1080p by the end of the year does not
currently so there is that so it doesn't
currently only supports up to 720p if
i'm not mistaken right now so tell you
think that the for the market share
it'll be kind of problems 24 we just
want you know what do you think i don't
know i mean 1080p is it it's easy
fundamental are it's beautiful it's
beautiful it's not Isis airiness it's
not necessary but it is absolutely
beautiful in people are saying you know
you can't distinguish the difference
between something with 300 ppi and
something with 450 and you absolutely
can again side by side if you use them
you can see a significant difference but
it's not enough to get upset over
because 720p is still extremely high and
a phone and especially with something
not five inches or 5.5 so you have a 4.5
inch phone and 720p is really all you
need it looks phenomenal yeah I don't
have it here but i'm charging my nexus 4
and the screen is very good you know yes
so some Jenny p but that's more than
more than okay right so yeah you don't
you don't necessarily need 1080p but
yeah for the marketing that's one thing
that's gonna hold it back is you don't
have it it's not it's not the fact that
you need it it's that it's not possible
right now so you didn't have anything to
boast that's my show you mean phone
nokia it's different from google right
because google might not even push out a
new nexus in the i/o what do you think
is it really necessary for google or
they don't need it because they have the
whole mo sixty percent market share so
it's more important for second-tier
phones right like Nokia HTC yeah it's
important for nokia right now but
because they don't necessarily have much
competition the s4 is out the one is out
there's nothing pending that that really
stands in its way and that's what really
makes this important because they've
held off they didn't announce it at CES
they didn't announce it immoral congress
they opted to wait to have this kind of
shallow not shallow but calm before the
storm release so for them it's important
google not so much because they just
released something new and in november
so so they might not push out another
one right another nexus yeah yeah they
won't unless they won't push out an
update to the nexus 4 they may start a
multi nexus family like a brand a family
like a phone brand that's something that
we there were rumors of several years
ago two years ago saying that google was
going to create a family of Nexus phones
not Nexus devices but just phones that
you would see a Samsung HTC motorola and
LG Nexus all in one year and that would
be amazing I would have no I would
probably
hey I would probably faint in front of a
computer if that happened yeah you know
what report also why do you think of so
do you think you'll Taylor Oh Anton and
job what about the X phone is it really
becoming a legend or will you never one
day or the other or what happened to
this thing it's a unicorn I'd love to
see it I'd love to see another motorola
phone yeah they've kind of fallen off
the map lately so yeah I'd love to see
it but I don't know that's impossible to
answer it is and i agree with taylor
right now we have no idea I'd like for
it to become a reality but who knows
yeah there's a there's a question on
YouTube that I have to to bring up like
what about a 4k phone she said like 75
that's something that I said after the
first 1080p phone was announced I was
like so when is the 4k phone coming out
and so most focused loans will be
presented in TSU no nada not in Mobile
World Congress right yeah um you'll see
4k phones when we have 4k projectors in
forms and they project on a wall because
you need for K and something that's five
inches because then you definitely can't
distinguish anything you're just wasting
power and pixels and everything else
you're lucky brendan is not here because
he'll tell you that yes you need for K
on a fatty you'll need for cake and I
three inch phone I need for k on my
pebble I was just gonna say that Taylor
and while you install a pebble uh Taylor
Martin watch face yet hold on oh he's
dead I'm locking on you I'm so locking
on you now I was about what I sure when
I saw the picture and your valency as
before review I was about to leave a
comment saying that's so gay but I'm
gonna make it live here its undies you
miss good miss the Twitter conversation
that Michael had right probably yeah he
said we're growing apart and I said how
can we grow apart when you're on my
wrist
he's just like five words oh yeah that's
how that's how we work together as a
team with people like Michael all right
so if I good oh nice right thank you I
want to jump in and this is going to be
my my parting thought so if you'll
forgive me i'm going to talk for about
five minutes straight you're going back
to to android devices know if i were a
betting man we're not going to get a new
nexus at i/o or new nexus phone at i/o
we're probably not going to hear
anything about the motorola x phone in
fact the latest rumors are they're
pushing that off onto its own self
rather than kind of keeping it
underneath the Google wing so we might
see that that dovetails into what Taylor
was saying about having a multi om Nexus
family and and really I think that may
be becoming more of a reality we're
seeing more and more OEMs releasing
developer phones or unlocked phones HTC
just did that and you can use it on any
carrier including LTE I wrote a piece on
that what was it last week Tony that
there the OEMs are disconnecting
themselves from the carriers that's a
good thing in my opinion because it
means the carriers aren't going to have
less of a say in what the hardware is
and we the people are going to have more
of a say they're also going to have less
of a stranglehold on updates and patches
in that whole qualification to make sure
that the devices work on their network
because come on we've got standards here
it works they work and OEM is not going
to embarrass themselves by releasing
something that doesn't work well they
say it does on LTE well they could but
you know these are big names or not I'm
not gonna do that and if they do they're
going to fix it rate really fast hey the
jelly bean update was a jelly bean or
ice cream sandwich I can't remember but
there was an update for the
yes I think it was ice cream sandwich
bricked it it rich like tens of
thousands of units you upgraded and your
phone was done so so congratulations you
get a new one is that point it no it was
I late they get the silent treatment
from google wow your update broke my
phone oops okay so moving over to uh to
nokia now and i'll wrap up with that
windows phone doesn't support 1080p
right now however we might see a nokia
device that supports 1080p just not in
the core OS it may be 720 or whatever
they are in their OS but video including
whatever interrupt you here Joe and ask
you the following question yes if if
Nokia is the primary partner for
Microsoft what if Nokia already has
access to windows phone 8 point
something Windows Phone blue whatever
and they can test the EOS on it with
full 1080p screen and support for huge
sensors for a camera they might show it
off they might not allow for hands-on
and say this is what will be available
in September I think that's a very good
possibility I think without ticking off
everybody else who makes a windows phone
they may come out with a hybrid which is
where I was going where you'll have a
video you'll have both visible and and
photographic video available in 1080p
but not on the rest and that will kind
of be the stepping stone to get
everybody else up to 1080p and of course
nokia is going to be the first to have
full 1080p in the entire OS and i'm
hoping that's what we'll see at the
nokia event yo but it's quite sad that
that nokia has to undergo the decisions
of microsoft right so yes all in it
that's that's what you're gonna have
sacré soft and microsoft is the hybrid
between android and and the way android
does things are google blessings with
Android and the way
Apple does things like I OS with Apple
it's an apple OS on Apple hardware at
the end on Android it's it's google's OS
that they can change however they want
on whatever Hardware they want to change
however they want and right in the
middle you've got microsoft saying this
is our OS these are the things that you
can do to it and nothing else but you
can go ahead and put it on your own
hardware so that's that's kind of cool
and it goes all the way back to windows
mobile when they were doing the same
thing they're not going to change that
and really that I think allows them to
have the best of both worlds and it's
it's something that nobody's really
talking about it gives Windows Phone a
lot of leverage that neither of the two
competition has and they need to really
emphasize on that and build on that
strength if they want to succeed yeah
can connect actually circle back to
Google i/o really quick let's do that
before before we we say goodbye to Joe
because I know he has to go correct me
if I'm wrong Joe yeah I'm about two
minutes out from having to leave okay
can we can we have another observation
from theater and then your final
thoughts yeah i'm just i'm actually just
dropping this in EV Luke leaks just put
this on Twitter this is something that
that I mean an update we could see it at
i/o it's not really a beautiful new
phone but it's a smaller bezel on what
looks like the Nexus 4 of course we lost
your video and now we yeah yeah um here
see if this hopes okay now we have it
yeah okay so it looks like a nexus 4
with almost no bezel so if if nothing
else we could see maybe a nexus 4 with
less busy talking about the Nexus 4's
yeah basically LTE smaller bezel on
George with Siri what's with Siri and
with this I have to hand it over to Joe
please use the following minutes
whatever you like however you like i
just did i already had all that but I
the up
coming announcements whatever they bring
our they're going to bring new stuff we
don't want to to be too disappointed in
what they don't bring that we wanted and
instead let's look at what we did get
and and see how we can utilize those to
the best of our advantage regardless of
what platform we use or what platform we
like ultimately we're all one big
community and we want to better that
community independent of platforms okay
Joe thank you very much for finding the
time to join us you have to leave I'm
gonna lock my camera on you nine now
please follow joe at Joe Levi on twitter
if you have not already done so Joe
thank you very much for joining us and I
wish you will have a awesome weekend all
right thanks very much guys quickly we
get an ETA on the Joe Levi pebble watch
face that will be the very last of all
of the pocket now crew and it may never
happen okay yeah if you you want to see
a pocket now face on a SmartWatch let me
know on my Twitter feed at Joe Levi who
should be the next pocket now face on
the pebble I'll make that 10 at reply
Joe Levi and tell him you want to see
his face on your walk upright thanks
everybody take care gel letter to also
thank you very much debug if you have
thank you last final thought please let
us know one last final thought i watch i
watch well that's an interesting concept
everybody wants to get in on the
SmartWatch business samsung has been in
in the smart business for like three or
four years now of course pebble
revolutionized that I think if Apple
comes out with i watch they will
probably have an angle or a product
which will bring something new to the
market as they usually do but i have no
predictions on that because i have no
idea how i would use a SmartWatch so
very taylor who yeah maybe taylor who
has one can can say more yeah um there's
rumors that google there are rumors that
google is creating a SmartWatch and that
apple is so
um they're looking for an angle they
don't want to do exactly what pebble has
done or what anyone else has done they
want something that that really makes it
you know pushes it over the top because
getting your notifications on your watch
at school I wear my pebble every day I
don't go a minute without it but there
are so many other things that I wish I
could do with it for instance if I could
just not have placed a call but if it
had a microphone on it to where I could
Google search from my watch and be
amazing I would I would swim for days
over that I'm google now and Siri on a
watch would be phenomenal it'd be great
because they just used your phone power
that the data and all the other stuff
you just talk to your watching and
Google search without ever pulling your
hair would it bring up the results on
the display on your watch I don't yeah
yeah uncle or speak them to you mean you
would look more weird than I did last
time when I was with the s4 out in
public and I was like doing this with
the phone and this and this and
everybody was like laughing my control
desperately so yeah or your phone pad at
the club oh my god is open so please
don't get me started um and it would
look weird I admit but it's something
that I've thought about like you know
just look at my phone and think here my
watch and think you know just google
search from there vibha I don't know
okay thank you probably dies when you
guys take care have a nice weekend same
to you bye bye guys bye before I hand it
over to Taylor I have a question or
maybe it's a thought on YouTube what if
Nokia made eos with Android instead of
Windows Phone that's not gonna happen
nokia and stephen elop made that very
clear they have chosen windows film
because exactly they want to
differentiate themselves from the other
OEMs which android would not allow them
to so we're going to backtrack pleased
not in my opinion while Stephen Elop is
at the Helms and that yes Taylor it's
your turn you want to complete my and
choose yeah okay yeah that and Android
as i explained on was it though weekly
this week or last week I don't know as
some live show but androids image
sensing is subpar
it there are some features that just
simply are not coded into the
capabilities of Android such as shutter
speed and all sorts of other things that
make software for cameras better so
Google has a lot of work to do if they
want to be a reputable camera brand
which is no viable there are cameras out
there powered by Android but until
Google codes these things into the
operating system will see mediocre
results galaxy camera for example it's a
perfect example galaxy s4 zoom that is
what that ok tato ok so let's move on
we're gonna pick a regular because we're
gonna keep that ratio I guess it's like
you cool with that Tony I have to have
to go with jenessa because she said I
look great without a hat and everyone
else said my head looks weird without a
hat so thank you thank you everyone you
do not remember that I had actually I'm
doing this thanks a little it might be
those it might be the phone behind me
this it's making my head look a little
more normal it's really weird shaped
promise so um I'm going to turn it
around and actually ask you what do you
predict form from IO or even the Nokia
vent either one your choice or both well
for nokia i'm sorry but i have issues
with nope yeah then deciding to go
solely on Windows Mobile it's just I
don't know and I don't expect much from
them I mean they did I came up with the
phones but I don't I don't see them as
interesting or something that I will
keep up with and with google i/o i came
here in that there's not going to be a
mean and it's not going to be the key
lime pie update and they're gonna delay
it so oh my god the like sweet Jesus
yeah there's a lot going on right now
yeah and well I don't know that
why are they going to do like oh let's
give you this and that other update and
you're good okay bye so I don't know oh
wow whatever to the entire situation cuz
I'd rather wait for it to happen to see
if they're gonna announce something that
is worth you know time to talk about my
stuff I did forget about something I
think we all forgot about something and
it was I think last year maybe maybe
2011 I can't remember but it was I think
matias duarte and Andy Rubin maybe were
saying that there were game-changing
features coming to Android into the next
couple of updates so that was when ice
cream sandwich was first coming out or
right before it came out so there was
ice cream sandwich jellybeans and jelly
bean had some great features but not
necessarily game-changing so could this
be what they were talking about key lime
pie are they delaying it or playground
or the playground yeah there are a lot
of things that that Google is talked
about that we've I guess forgotten about
that hasn't happened yet okay official
announcement I'm going to lay back and
I'm gonna stop managing this chat
because whatever i do it is in vain so
please let's come let's see anarchy can
we sing a love song for Tony can
whatever we all collectively sing I
people out switching cameras it doesn't
work so well they said you're taking as
a joke you're just laughing it off I'm
suspecting for you to be like you know
what it's canceled this closes thought
this thing you can just forget it try
peace out no that's me because I usually
take everything the hard way and I put
it to the heart and whatever I do I put
a lot of heart and soul into it like
this bucket now live show and now I've
given up on it so please this is this
this week has been or this this podcast
or show has been kind of I don't know my
nerves are on edge right now I down my
call me like you have to just lay back
and just laugh it off and be like that's
what i doing right now because it is not
worth your energy I mean uh
has crashed on me like three four times
so far and I just say ah close or wait
for it I'm like let me click away for it
because it takes me a lot to get into
this hangout I can't say everybody I can
see a spinning wait beach bill and
everything I cannot see I can hear you
but that is also good it works yeah as
long as I can hear everybody I'm good
but oh my god this update is killing me
I thought I was gonna find a setting
that I could turn off all the animations
those little circles going up and down
was lagging the crapper you have this
this update is not Google's best hang
out update that's for sure it is um this
was totally broken hangouts were totally
broken last night so we weren't even
sure if we were gonna be on air today so
I was thinking cuz i never saw a tweet
like you guys always sweet something
really already like a day Oh before I
don't know but um do you have any
questions for myself for Tony oh well no
actually I can't I thought the was gonna
there wasn't going to be any hang out
today because again I didn't see any
tweed like yesterday or something but
guess it happened but I don't have any
pretty quick I don't have any questions
there's the ohio thing what I get one
you guys were posting things about the
Google Franco playground that maybe it's
a council may be something I was like oh
no oh sweet Jesus know how so cause no
man it's too hard to compete with Xbox
in the playstation 3 and even though we
the way is like to the side right now
and still is like selling pretty well
because everyone is you know liking the
whole playing with your body but you
have xbox what is it called live the
kinect yeah the kid yeah and everyone is
loving the kinect so ground think
console is not gonna work when i play
video games just because i want to be
lazy meat stuff like that it's fun you
just laugh your ass off at people that's
what I
it's fun to watch where yeah the hope
playground thing it's they're gonna if
they're gonna get involved in the video
game world I hope they do something
right because if they don't they're
gonna get they're gonna crash and burn
and everyone's they're gonna get help
from everybody some big companies that
fall flat on their faces with new
products facebook home for example oh my
god oh 1 million dollars banner what one
will you download because everyone
download the game it does the I'm sorry
the thing and then be uninstalling cuz I
got it I got I'm not big and I was ok
fine and then I kept getting the balls
i'm like no i didn't know i want this
what is it 1 million downloads with a
billion monthly active users is a very
small percentage exactly but it also
fell from top 100 apps on Android to
like top 400 or something it's like
tight it's in like 380 or something out
that's in like two weeks so yeah it's
it's a it's a flop um so I I'm guessing
that you were not a supporter of oh yeah
the the android-powered game console
that was independent I'm still waiting
on mine to come in I was one of the
first couple thousand of back earlier
couple thousand backers and there are a
lot of people who have gotten theirs and
I had not received mine yet well as
being wonders about patience my friend
yeah right patience for my pebble i
pre-ordered a year ahead of time
patience for leap motion i pre-ordered
for that a year ago and i won't get it
until the end of june or july oh I gotta
stop pre-ordering oh ok so any final
thoughts no I'm saying is that people
that like really excited about it vago
oil and the nokia ventures calm yourself
don't expect much because I expect that
was the last time I expect that a lot
was from
I'm song and I got punched in the face
really bad without a sport it is a good
phone for those who go fanboys because
my friend that I got into this and so
let's hang out he gives me all kinds of
hell because I don't I don't I'm not in
love with Samsung and it isn't their
phone but I was highly disappointed
because in SF first of all I have an
allergic reaction to the word fanboy
whenever I see the word fanboy and
comments i ban people so yeah that's
true and people come come at me like why
did you bear me I told you respect
people bamboo is not a word which I
accept no but seriously I have the s4
and I was one of the biggest critics of
the s4 on the pocket now team even
before the s4 came out and I have the s
for now and I'm saying the s4 is a solid
awesome phone if you like plastic haha
it all comes down yeah it all comes down
to to whether you you like a lightweight
phone versus a phone which is the HTC
One which feels more substantial but out
of the if you compared the galaxy s4
with the HTC One the s for kicks the HTC
one's ass in terms of camera quality and
then again the HTC One kicks the s4 SAS
in terms of audio quality and the feel
in the hand so no light flow like the
low light on masking tape nobody takes
low light pictures I mean let's let's be
real here out of one there use the flash
right just you just go outside out of
100 pictures to our low light so that's
two percent of pictures are low lightly
the rest is just pictures which I want
to see crisp in detail can I show or can
I share something that I did with the s4
please really quickly so in the review
the comments are like oh you didn't use
the night mode for the low light shots
oh you're you're stupid and I you're a
fan boy so um actually I did use the
night mode and I actually uploaded one
of those pictures into the review if i
can find that folder cheese i have way
too much on my computer um
so give me just a second okay go ahead
sir thing uh I don't like the word
either because um I'm considered a
career bitch Michael Fisher I think he
called me uh one of the hangouts i was
called HTC fangirl but I'm not I HTC but
I do recognize when other brands are
good we had a hangout with the min ago
which he's doing really well and he said
that somebody had to call Taylor taytay
I don't know why yeah we're talking
about it and it is true you in order for
it to be a friend person of a certain
brand you will have to have every
product in your house from that brand
and I have a TV that is from Santa I
have a phone that is HTC anna i have a
whole other bunch of things there are
different brands that i'm not branded Oh
totally to HTC I do recognize when other
companies do well on certain things
thaler you are locked all right this is
the one of the low light shots that i
posted in the review and this was taken
with the night mode and if you would
just take a second and look at my
friends arm it doesn't matter how much
this video stream is compressed his arm
looks like an oil painting oh I can top
that you know that was that was like the
the best low light shot I could possibly
get there's the value you have to teach
me how to share a picture here just like
you add your overlay your your little
own Idol thing doesn't just load the
picture in there instead of you're going
to go to hangout toolbox and instead of
custom overlay I'm gonna choose the file
which I have just downloaded and guys I
am all also tweeting this out if you
want to see it I'm not sure can you guys
see it no not yet I have tweeted it
anyways google hangout is not working so
i'm gonna lock my camera on you in case
you guys that's a low-light
picture-taking with the night mode on
the HTC One beautiful I know right
you look like you have like I don't know
pots or something if you go to my
Twitter account which is right there I'm
not sure if you can see it or not but
I'm gonna try to show it to you it is
right can we just say that low light on
most phones is bad and you know light is
not something which smartphones should
do they should automatically fire off
the flash and that's that should be
under the limitation of our phones just
go to my Twitter you have the full-sized
image and you can see this big pixels
yeah well to that end I hate flash I
never ever ever ever ever use flash the
first thing I do and I open the camera
app as I turn flash off and I make sure
it stays off but um the best way to deal
with a night shot is exactly what Nokia
did optical image stabilization and the
slower shutter speed yes that is also
correct but we have to agree on the fact
that and a small sensor size which is
probably smaller than your your little
fingers fingernail you cannot get some
ordinary low-light performance no this
thing this thing with a sensor that
Sagittarius hold on donessa first of all
there's there's the picture I've been
talking about and you can see awful
awful noise and pictures on my left hand
on my right hand on my face and you know
what it wasn't so dark either so it was
it was an interesting situation and then
now I'm gonna lock my camera on failure
due to show us yeah yeah yeah even with
a camera with a sensor this size which
takes phenomenal pictures i love this
camera but even with a camera with a
sensor this size many of the night shots
are pretty bad and noisy unless you have
a tripod so there's no you're not going
to get it out of a phone much less that
is karai 434 unless you know what you're
doing be nice out as much as I love
seeing my own picture will have to
portable hey do you have any final
thoughts I guess that's it I just and
I'm advising everyone to not get your
hopes up okay duly noted but still keep
your fingers crossed I will be flying to
London
to see whatever nakia has to offer and
I'll be probably busting my ass to get
you some hands-on videos and some
comparison videos so fingers crossed
it's something important and something
cool we know exactly why you'll be
rushing Tony so you can finish and go to
the open bar that's for alive
after hours but now looking much for
joining us and we know you'll come back
next week please do that thank you very
much nokia throws awesome parties by the
way have a nice evening and weekend
tater still your term before somebody
says taylor you are awesome but you
already know that somebody says man
Taylor Anton he said the F word I should
probably do that question for Anton why
did you choose a sous phone pad instead
of the samsung galaxy note 8.0 with the
earpiece because of the simple reason
that samsung galaxy note 8.0 piece is
not available in my region and samsung
did not reply to my request for
reviewing one very easy and very
straightforward and with that please
taylor take it away I'm gonna have to
choose Matt because I can pronounce his
name and he has some serious cans on his
head right now and he is it well not one
of the few people who has video-enabled
and are not place holders so that is
also a valid argument so have you
anointed yourself how's it going um Wow
going pretty doesn't look that way okay
hear me yes I can't I don't know if Tony
and I can I cannot hear anybody except
for Taylor no well I can hear you summer
and that's all we can we can talk
privately and they can just see us yeah
commute you still can't hear him Tony no
no I cannot until then let's let's try
to talk to ya knees he's from the great
resource a circle back matt is that
alright alright I have no idea how you
can hear them and i cannot i have no
idea that makes no sense all right
I'm not gonna try to pronounce your name
yes hello phone toes I yeah I'm doing my
best here from my Greek knowledge but
it's not good enough I'm guessing at I
try not to slaughter names as often as
possible um so how are you great I hope
looks fine you guys oh I'm doing
wonderful I've had way too much coffee
today and I'm great and you love the new
google hangout yeah I'm finding I night
with us that is awesome you're great so
what do you expect from google i/o or at
least what are your hopes even if you
know that there's not going to be a
whole lot or even though we don't think
there's going to be a whole lot what are
you hoping will be there ah the new
nexus 7 i've decided to my primary
devices in the view of 7 inch tablet
then or into the 4.5 inches I've via the
IO edition from last year with pink
stains all over it are you going to hear
well no I didn't go last year either I
just my my former boss gave me the
tablet so he was cunning so um I'm
actually hoping the in cream though
tablet-optimized apps and all that are
they updated the design guideline the I
saw your article but I really I'm really
disappointed because well ipod apps are
like it could implant more they are um
that's why i use this as my primary
tablet actually so unfortunately ipad
apps or a little bit less functional I
mean especially like when you're rooted
you get so many so much potential and
all that especially now with the chat
head that's going to be too hard to make
of and I'd like to ask you what do you
think whether Google should go introduce
a splash screen for every app sputtering
so the animation be smooth consistently
and especially a permit to your phone
just move the hell out of the whole
thing so are you talking a splash screen
for when you're resuming a nap so if you
switch to recent apps and you switch
over it it displays a splash screen just
shortly or you do you mean a splash
screen for when you open them at the app
initially yeah was that just that good I
think they did that they that was a
requirement i know it was a requirement
on iOS but i think they had that before
and then they said don't use splash
screens Watson um I don't remember
exactly what may have been a whole
durability a security vulnerability I
can't remember let me see flash creams
done right maybe it wasn't a
vulnerability maybe it was just because
all the developers did terrible splash
screens I think that was it um I don't
know but I know there were a lot of
people saying death to splash screens a
while back Sam I don't know the other
feature really really like to see
visions I love zhou gong makers and
android so looking like an S Pen Stylus
how wakem stylist instead of a wacom
wacom however you pronounce it yeah vs
capacitive stylus cos capacitive stylus
is just no better than your finger but
yeah that'd be great I'd like to see
that and welcome back to all the crazy
nonsense going on in the Hangout I'll
joining left and right I am actually
trying to bring some order into this
entire energy and I'm not managing and
kicking out the placeholders I have like
one person three
instances another person three instances
I'm trying to kick them out and they
come back again so i might as well just
get back to my leaning back enjoying the
Hangout like i was a regular YouTube
viewer but at least here I have the show
here yeah thanks sorry panic um ask Tony
a question yesterday yes yes please go
on um time do you think the average user
will a few more youth with the sport
megapixel or with the HTC one of movie
making software well the movie making
software is I'm sure you're referring to
the Zoe's and the highlight everything
they are awesome features for four
cameras and you can use them in so many
creative ways but if you are that kind
of person who goes outside whether if
it's high king in a club at a party or
just carrying your phone in your pocket
and you want to capture that one great
shot I would recommend the galaxy s4 the
galaxy s4 is much better than the HTC
One in terms of camera quality and yeah
if you're outdoors definitely absolutely
totally agree also if you do automatic
picture uploads through say Google+ or
Dropbox or any other automatic uploads
if you use the Zoe function you're gonna
get 25 pictures in a queue what a 30
other what so if you do like 345 Zoe's
back to back it's just it cranks them
out it's awful your battery just
plummets now I'm telling you guys I'm
seeing and I'm usually seeing myself as
on one side a reviewer and on the other
side a typical smartphone user and as a
smartphone user out of 100 pictures I am
usually taking up to five maybe up to 10
pictures in low light mode be the other
pictures are either with flash or and
bright outdoor
and these under these circumstances the
s4 is a much better camera yeah um I do
I have to have one part that just kind
of irked me with the s4 I I'm in my
office right now this is my home office
and it's relatively bright in here I've
got the window and I can open the shades
a lot more soon make it brighter I had
this the shade open and my desk is right
over here mm-hmm and I was trying to
take a picture of my I've had many on
the disc and it was like the phone just
could not handle it it just didn't
capture enough light and there's a
logical explanation for that and it's
actually that the the 13-megapixel
camera is the same sensor or at least a
similar sensor to the 8 megapixel sensor
and the s3 and basically all they've
done is slim down or make each
individual pixel smaller smaller so the
problem is that you capture less light
so in scenarios that aren't necessarily
low light you get this noise and
artifacts that was my biggest complaint
and this is very very strange you bring
this up because I have seen your camera
samples and I also seen Michael Fisher's
camera samples and I am rocking the
galaxy s4 which is the octa-core version
so it's not the Snapdragon version and
there are some comments on YouTube and
on the Internet in general that the
octa-core version has a different
imaging sensor so I've tried to
replicate as much as I could all the
scenarios and all your setups which you
had and and the galaxy s4 this one took
good pictures I mean this is the the
galaxy s4 is as close as it gets for me
and comparing it with the Nokia 808
PureView I mean it's not a tie but it's
as close as it gets to the PureView yeah
the the color reproduction is phenomenal
it's extremely accurate and true to life
i will say that um also the panoramic
shots Brandon was helming I have to
compare the same exact panoramic shot
with another phone but the panorama on
the galaxy s4
rivals the panorama on my nex-5n not not
it's not just a clear win obviously but
it doesn't do it doesn't downsample like
you get on a panoramic shot on the
iPhone 5 or and here's where I will
disappear the iphone via has the best
panorama taking capabilities and the
output among go phones it's good but did
you download the full resolution
panoramic shot at and put on the review
it's a 23 megabyte file yeah it's here
and it's it was 55.6 megapixels I've
never had a you know why because because
all the other phones the galaxy s4 and
HTC One and the other state panorama
shots in landscape like this and the
iphone 5 takes them in portrait so it
adds more more frames in portrait mode
to that same panorama like other phones
would have in landscape and that's why I
do all my pen rebbetzin and portrait if
possible because you just get a better
yeah better shot but I have never seen a
phone take such great panoramic shots
I've done it with iphone but I haven't
extensively used in panorama but still I
was extremely impressed just by the
color reproduction on the phone or the
camera um someone asked using both the
HTC one in the galaxy s4 which is the
smoothest phone with less or no lie it
was about I was about to ask you that
question yeah um okay it's it's hard to
say definitively because there are so
many different versions and tony has
used them both as well he's used the
octa-core s4 and the HTC One and I've
used the s4 and the one with both the
605 dragon 6-under processor and out of
the box with all the things just enabled
as they are straight out of the box the
HTC one x is less the s4 received an
over-the-air update that made it less
buggy and laggy while we were in a you
know in the review period and it
performs a lot better now if you turn
off all the features on the s4 such as
air view air gesture smart screen and
all those different things if you turn
all those off
they're about the same and I leave them
enabled it's going to be totally
different I will again a little bit
disagree here I just sent you guys a
couple of emails I have tried to keep
everything on the SS strange as it may
sound and I could not get my octa-core
to lag so it might all come down to the
number of homescreens you are using I me
already already using 2 i've bumped it
up to three still no legs but if you use
maybe four or five you might get that
one frame being skipped whenever you get
to the home screen but out of the box
the octa-core galaxy s4 and the HTC One
you cannot tell the difference there are
they they're both the same yeah I'm
gonna try to I don't remember how to
turn off s voice I get extremely
difficult long hold on the home button
and whenever s voice launches go to the
menu settings and then you tell it to
not wait for a lawyer on the home button
button and while you do that I'm gonna
ask yiannis if he has any final thoughts
or questions for me or for frontier I'd
like just ask you what you think will
happen to the Google integrations
between the services my youtube account
totally good weight this week it won't
be too long switch to my Google+ name I
don't want people to know like comments
and videos on YouTube and yeah all the
world clarion through this thing i will
be honest with you i have not understood
the question Taylor did you manage to
get the question yeah I think he's
asking um are you asking if you're going
to be basically forced to switch your
youtube account to your real name or I'm
not affect work what do you think will
happen with the Google services
integration integration with one with
everything whole cloth your YouTube and
all this candidate happen no I think I
got it I think that Google tries to have
everything unified under a single login
or a single profile so whenever you do
on one end it reflects on all the other
ends and I don't think there's anything
you can do to fight it yeah if that time
I I think you'll still be able to opt
out of you know the youtube name
changing thing but up to a point when
they'll force it over you yeah they may
eventually so that's unfortunate for
people who don't yeah thanks for being
here Yanni's thank you very much and
have an awesome evening I know you're on
the same time zone as myself so they
care good night I have a nice weekend
bye-bye dinner have you found it yes um
I was just going to show that before you
disable s voice and this was the same
case with previous galaxy s devices and
Galaxy Note 2 if you have s voice
enabled going home if you press the HOME
key if you're in a nap and you press the
home button it hesitates that's an
elephant's have two seconds yeah because
you have to double tap so I didn't
include this in the review I need to
upgrade or update it because I did
forget about that I forget about s voice
because I've just but if you do disable
that and you are an an app and let me
love my camera on myself and this is
again this is the octa-core version i'm
in google+ and i'm pushing the home
button and three two one there you go
it's below one second it's almost this
it's much faster than with s voice
enabled yeah so I do need to upgrade or
update keep saying okay take my review I
do need to upgrade it later we have a
major problem we have nobody to talk to
because all the people here are Google
hangout errors of or oh we have a no
bottom hey I'm above I'm glad that
finally a living moving person has
joined the Hangout all the others are
broadly aberrations and errors we'll
hang out guys you hear me yes we can
it's Taylor's turn right you so please
that was just so this you are we doing
337 we're going
we do whatever we can because others are
just static images can we can we check
really quick if matt has audio again
just quickly hey here I cannot even see
you can't see him or hear him I can't do
anything I can't there's no magic here
man oh my gosh this is okay I don't Bob
well he's like it better it's this is
what we had yes sorry we're apologizing
on Google's behalf because it's failing
us today which we shouldn't do but yeah
google you suck for some reason I can
see everybody on wisely you guys can't
see anybody on here speeds I can see
these boulders I can't see just generic
icons I see everyone except for it or
keyboard I don't know how to say from
people people the guy who trolled us
since the beginning of this thing this
is this is becoming more and more fun so
let's let's move on all right i don't
care i just want google i/o just for a
nexus 7 it's like a 1080 password upload
w wqxga display on and stays on nature
wqxga Oh My yes if everything is that
what I think it is 10 semana okay yeah
yeah talking to a oh my god that
would be hold on we have to do
calculations
a lot of boys I think that's uh yeah
okay thank you Tom I think you have a
problem with some huge echoing so I have
muted you right now so whenever you want
to talk just unmute yourself and then
please do meet yourself back because
we're gonna blow Taylor's years off yeah
um that would be 431 pixels per inch and
that would be yeah but in a tablet on a
tablet you don't necessarily need as
high PPI because you're gonna actually
hold it further from your faces and you
would phone oh um but I'm not wanted to
say no to extremely high resolution
intensity and I just want the off no
more tag random in the next seat or
probably 800 in there yeah that's
probably what we'll see that's a
prediction I'm gonna say probably
Snapdragon 800 but that's I don't know
you'll need something like that to push
them any pixels because the nexus 10 is
it performs fairly well but it does lag
in some cases because there's just so
many pixels for dual core processor ah
what impression do you think the neck
like whatever android 4.3 or five do you
think they're gonna start not like
killing their Nexus phones and start so
maybe by a miracle he put into the HTC
nexus what was the first ever nexus
phone nexus one all that stuff yeah the
nexus one they could just do that i
would be happy i was there i said that
on I we enjoy them with everything the
original iphone if I was watch it you're
reading the out hearing about you only
weakly is like they should really do
that no bring so much more things to it
I told that directly to HTC at CES sat
down with them and I said they said what
is something you would love to have from
HTC i said i would love I would almost
kill for another nexus one just upgraded
I would it was it was it with one of my
favorite films ever
I would love to see it again in you know
8 2013 fashion yeah oh that that was
about all my things I had to say about
my I Oh coming out yeah how about the
Nokia event I mean everybody seems to be
neglecting that and I'm acting like a
fanboy I'm hating the word but i wanna i
want to emphasize that nokia is having a
london event where hopefully we will see
something exciting what do you think
about that may I to me I want no kid too
I don't know have a 1080 screen when
Windows has a capacity to push out a
1080 screen it's not worry Freddie to go
that's all I will be the best thing ever
and apparently whatever for nokia and
iphone comparisons either cameras as
good as it they show it i would switch
off android to windows phone is to try
it out full state you to pocket now
because as soon as we get our hands on a
nokia lumia eos we're gonna have
everything compared out of it inside
yeah I might actually switch back to
Windows Phone my secondary line if if we
have if that happens yeah I'm locking my
camera on you alobam and people can join
you on twitter and at ad and eight th-10
is that correct yeah awesome thank you
very much for joining us and
all right why I no longer okay now I can
hear you i was only hearing some echo
take care okay take care and it's just
you and me now and the the youtube
commenter so i have a first of all
there's a remark they're like six people
in here Tony yeah but I cannot see
anybody I mean I can't see you I can see
myself and all the others are the
generic person icon comment on YouTube
saying I think it is more to do with
your current connection speed than hang
out software my friend my friend my
connection speed is 100 megabytes plus
it has nothing on this planet to deal
with my connection speed so it's gonna
definitely yeah and my mind fast enough
to its 50 down stir another person this
time on pocket now Nicholas says
question for Taylor I have the HTC One X
plus 64 gigabyte international version
running sense for plus do you think the
upgrade this ends five or sense 5.1 will
get rid of the lag i'm sure you have
experience on the HTC one x um that's
difficult to say i would say yes because
you're gonna have jelly bean which comes
with project butter but you're also on a
tegra processor which it's not the
Tigers bad is it feels more poorly
optimized than anything so i do i would
hope yes but i don't know for sure i
haven't used the one x+ and the One X
itself didn't like too much for me maybe
a little bit but it's hard to say um hi
mate would actually probably be able to
answer that because he got an upgrade to
jelly bean I'm here's and I have not yet
oh my well the one I asked him and since
since you are the person who are seeing
other people why don't you take the last
fall and even if I cannot see or hear
that person maybe the recording will
will eventually feature that person so
please if not if not then it will just
be me totally just be a monologue and
we'll all be fooled like you will be
talking to your alter ego yeah x
the only person I can see now is is it
Mads said how it's pronounced is the
only person I can see now so I cannot
see him so I'm trusting your guts and if
you can hear him I'm just gonna meet and
get out of here can you hear me I can I
can't can you hear him Tony I cannot so
I'm gonna mute and just don't mind me
I'm just here I'm kind of a decoration
alright hello it's it's you and me so
how's it going uh hearts awesome it's
going good it's going so we're gonna
switch it up and not talk about IO first
we're gonna talk about nokia NOK yup
like Google's how I was gonna about
nokia anyways oh there you go alright so
um any predictions or or things that you
would or things you hope will happen I I
pretty much assumed will see the 925
which is the 928 but the global version
I mean the 928 is priced right so that's
nothing to do with London or anyone else
in the universe yeah and the well i
don't know i mean i'm trying not to get
my hopes about any eus jewnicorn so I
tablet sewing things like that because I
remember a certain day cabrera called
the Mobile World Congress which I
skipped work to actually just ditched
everyone I told my girlfriend to go hike
I skipped work and just SAT there and
had like three computers in one surface
up with live feeds and it's like your
thesis is it we're taking over the world
map location that is called dedication I
would be I would be in line with the
Brenneman know a was Michael Fisher and
tell me if I'm correct there and suffer
the same consequences day because it was
an odd more failure and look great rooms
nonetheless than 720 was awesome and
it'll be great for people not living in
all when wig flagships go but yeah I'm
not trying to get my hopes up Google i/o
I'm very disappointed at
all the leaks about we're not getting
ice cream sandwich I I got a nexus 4
just for the premise of warming to play
with the handbook or 50 know before
everybody else but apparently that's not
happening so ya know well we'll see I'm
hoping I'm holding out hoping um it's
usually served me poorly in the past but
in a can't give up hope right no but
well judging from how would they update
to the hangouts going booths not doing
too well like yeah this is this is a
really terrible upgrade or update I
can't say update for whatever is an
upgrade and update or synonymous for me
but yes it was a terrible update I had
an upgrade switching back over the nose
gonna cut in for a short second it is so
weird Taylor did hearing you talk to
yourself yeah I'm better I'm gonna go
back and mute myself again but it is
weird I'm sitting here thinking like I
wonder what Tony you just thinks we're
talking about yeah you can watch like a
lot of thing after like well they might
not even here because most of the feed
the feed goes through him so they might
not even be hearing you they might just
hear me talking oh that but I need to
watch that just just see what you see
right now what is I think I'm strange
Sergey and I asked this question on the
YouTube channel and people are getting
back with comments that they can hear
you so obviously it is meet a strange
one so please proceed at least I don't
look like I'm talking to myself so um as
eos people are commenting and it's like
the first off i don't think they even
need an ATP screen for for that and the
resolution of the screen has nothing to
do it with it because stayed awake
PureView has n HD screen and if that
surprises to look at well 30 8 megapixel
images obviously 720p will be enough and
I remember
reading that nokia was testing out both
dual-core and quad-core because of
energy concerns so I don't think they I
mean you you don't have the pure you do
not know how much energy this camera
sucks up a bit the phone this phone will
it carry I have no idea where it is it
sounds there something it will last
several days but if you stop filming
with that I mean it's it it
actually CM the oversampling yeah it
worked in the video mode as well so it's
got a 41-megapixel sensitive over
sampling every frickin pixel in 1080p it
will kill your battery seriously I don't
imagine yeah so if you you want to
display that on 1080p screen as well as
recorded it would just you would have to
have like a samsung galaxy note 2
battery and it would still just died so
I think what they probably won't well it
depends on what display technology they
use because super LCD is actually more
power efficient been there 1080p panels
are actually more power efficient than
the 720p panels which to me makes
absolutely no sense yeah but to that and
you don't necessarily need 1080p like I
was saying earlier because you know
you're you don't have phones that are
that large unless they're going to
announce a 5-inch phone or a phablet 5.5
inch phone which I highly doubt then you
know there's no real need for 1080p 720p
is dense enough and it looks great so oh
also and in the thing about the grill
under the impression that nokia is
suffering because of microsoft marks or
slower they won't update the OS blah
blah but if i remember contract between
nokia and microsoft racket it's not like
what HTC and microsoft has HTC is simply
using windows phone nokia is licensing
Windows Phone to go further Davis is
slightly earth like a company that's
with Android yeah you can put up you you
really can go in and change things
because it's yours now yeah that's what
nokia has that's that's there
in they can and that's why they are so
much more active in producing apps and
making system changes and what much in
the day / OEMs they actually licensed it
to go further so they might actually
just change stuff in the old wood core
OS yeah well they can't change too much
it's kind of like a Windows 8 or Windows
7 license for for the manufacturers you
know they can add their own bloat and
stuff but they can't actually you know
change how it looks or something like
that I can't change the interface but
they can they can add services that
wouldn't otherwise be there okay and
also it's it's not it's not so much
about less right now isn't it the but
processor I mean you need a Snapdragon
800 to deal with a kind of resolution in
camera I won't you yes yes because um
your Snapdragon 600 only supports up to
22 megapixels and the Snapdragon 800
handles up to 55 I think it is 55 54
which which Rick takes that can't show
the EOS yet it'll have to come in the
fall unless they announced the the bed
phone with the 808 or not anyway listen
after i get 800 so I don't know do you
have any final thoughts or questions
we're gonna have to start wrapping this
up the fun final question is the
snapdragon 808 is it what is it ready
that's ready that I don't know it was a
was announced at Mobile World Congress
then that's her or not even then it was
TS I think it but that was it I'm going
to be with virtually and that's it I'm
kidding I don't know what I'm kidding we
too many I can help you if you Bess
already the question or the information
I'm getting feedback I don't know what
I'm hearing ok there we go um yeah but
that's that's impossible to answer i'm
hoping i know that there were some
rumors that a snapdragon 800 phone were
coming soon but i don't know what I
can't remember do you have any insight
on that Tony I'm after I can I think the
yeah there is already a Snapdragon 800
phone out there it is either from pave
or ZTE I I don't remember exactly but we
know we are expecting or at least hoping
to get the Optimus g2 with the 800 can
you hear Hemi or do I need to like pass
this through he doesn't kid can you hear
Tony of course I can hit okay okay
awesome so yes if somebody blocked me
good alright well thank you mad um can
we can you can we lock it on it while
you can't lock it only because I cannot
see him I cannot hear him he's not
existing for me yeah uh so can you tell
us where we can find you or follow you
that's the lemon okay we'll do it
another pot a novel idea okay yeah it's
just there's a common courtesy thanks
for joining us and we'll see you soon
maybe next time next week and maybe
it'll be better next time it better be
yeah or we'll have to start looking for
a new live show platform okay and with
that I think it is time to wrap it up
thank you everybody for joining pocket
now live so number 15 which we will
probably entitle the weird / enter key
edition of Google Hangouts I'm sorry
that we I'm sorry that this was a mess
at least it was for me I hope it was not
for you the answer is Tony yeah I'm
always the nice guy so I wanna because
I'm so nice I wanna thank mr. Taylor
Martin who with the on whom I had locked
my camera so that you can see you can
follow him at casper tech there are any
final thoughts google fix your hangouts

pie on the fifteenth that is my final
thought and that the X phone and the X
phone and the extra and another leak to
the LG bezel is whatever anything else

so i might please and doable things oh
um just fix hang out just thinking and
nokia please bring me my 41-megapixel
