calm next up we're going to take a
hardware tour of the Nokia Lumia 800 the
hardware on this device is extremely
impressive it's unlike anything you've
ever seen or held before unless maybe
you've had the nokia n8 in which case it
would be pretty much exactly the same
but this is all one piece of
polycarbonate plastic so there aren't
any seams anywhere let's take a look at
the device here we got the screen is on
the front and you see some seems there
so that's probably where they put
everything in up top of our sensors is
your speaker the bottom we have
capacitive buttons and on the n9 these
buns weren't there it was more screen
area and there was a front-facing camera
here but we don't have a front facing
camera on this device probably because
they had to put capacitive buttons there
on the bottom we have a speaker that's
not that impressive quality wise and if
you put your finger over it gets very
muffled so you won't be able to hear
very well so keep that area open this
side is totally free of anything very
smooth up top we have our only
connectors and slots there's your
headset jack and i left the stickers on
so that i could remember how to open
them you got to push this little knob
there like so if you try to push it
wrong like push it that way doesn't
really open so you gotta do it just
right it's going to be a letter and that
opens like that and see what's there the
micro USB port now this is a feels like
it could break it's pretty sturdy but if
you gave it enough force
probably break off so keep that closed
and what's over there that's the sim
card slot slide it and pops a little
spring there and sometimes it doesn't
happen there we go and that'll come out
but there we go and there's the sim card
and it is a micro sim card so if you
have a regular one you're going to have
to cut it there we go now over here are
the volume controls and the power switch
and the camera button kind of like
having all the buttons over there
because you can hold it like this and it
can put each finger on a button so
there's power power off camera and it's
going to go the camera so it's kind of
fun being able to just hold it and have
all your buttons accessible as volume
there's off so not much movement
required with your hand to access all
those buttons a a lot of phones have the
button up here the power button so you
got it Collin you're going to reach
around by having them all right here I
kind of like that now the back it's very
smooth kind of pillow shaped you see the
curve there we have a little strip this
is a nokia carl zeiss tesar lens that's
our 8 megapixel camera dual LED flash on
a at nine this was kind of in a little
different position but pretty much the
same and the screen has a nice curve to
it I'm going to get a request to
compared to the last year's most well
designed Windows Phone the dell venue
pro so you see the venue pro has a very
curve like that you see that curve and
it's pretty pronounced
bring nice nice looking curve whereas
this one kind of curves both ways we got
a little bit of curve this way and we
have a little bit of curve this way as
well but for the most part in the middle
it's pre flat but still very very nice
design nothing that amazed me given this
is all one piece how do they put it
together it seems like it would be kind
of like building a ship in a bottle you
got to put everything in from the screen
side maybe and then somehow get the
screen on top pretty interesting anyway
let's look at some screen comparisons
this is a Nokia's true black screen type
and I kind of want to know how it
compares with the focus s so we got
super amoled plus over here and we got
nokia over here right away i'm seeing
very good screen quality here i'm
supposed to be able to see all the
blacks but we have pretty much the same
as the Samson let's look at the color on
the color tests the banding I think the
banding looks a little bit more
pronounced on samsung and let's look at
viewing angle this color should stay the
same pretty much and it changes a little
bit but they're both pretty much the
same and let's look at blends you see a
similar amount of banding on both of
these devices the white seems to be
better on this one though
there's your white tests as far as speed
goes the Lumia 800 I got about a 92
score when I ran the test here and you
can see it's pretty high up there it's a
little bit slower than the Titan and the
focus Samsung devices but it's pretty
high pretty good speed and for battery
life we're doing pretty good I've had
this been using it for 20 hours and we
have forty-six percent remaining which
is estimated 13 hours so pretty good but
not as good as the focus s which has a
large battery and gets days and days
worth a better life on that and we had a
couple of requests to see a little bit
closer the case so that it comes with so
here's the rubber case it's a little
stiff but and nice and thin so it should
work nicely and that goes in like that
so you just got to prop it on there
there's a holes for the camera and
buttons so it looks pretty good we also
got a request to see how the headphones
work so this is not a tangle-free wire
see it does get tangled and the
headphones I really like this style they
just sit in the air they don't go inside
the ear canal which is really
uncomfortable sometimes but I was pretty
impressed with the sound quality and
here's your button and this little plane
pause music and if you hold it down for
a couple seconds it'll start the speech
interface where you can text people do
facebook chat all just from the voice
interface so pretty good different
iphones be sure to check the link in the
description for more specs on this
device and if you like this video and
the Nokia Lumia 800 gives a thumbs up
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
