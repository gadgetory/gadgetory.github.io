tens display and it will go from edge to
edge apparently new pixel renders are
emerging and we have a pretty good look
at what we're getting and the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 is also getting different
color options I'm Jaime Rivera
reporting from beautiful Guatemala City
and yes I know I said getting to many
times this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals of
here in the market for the samsung
galaxy has nine we've got two really
good ones if you go to be an H they've
got the dual SIM unlocked variant for
610 bucks which is kind of crazy but if
you also want to give us three to be
bundled Best Buy has got it for 725
speeding the combination of both which
is a definite good deal you can learn
more in the description
and speaking of Samsung gear
smartwatches we've been hearing so many
rumors of the gear s for for those of
you that are interested apparently that
s4 is gonna have a 20 something percent
larger battery 470 milliamp hours
compared to last year's model which
didn't have the best battery life
particularly if you left that display
always on so yeah hopefully that will be
the case maybe Aoife will be the
announcement time now sorry well Samsung
the Galaxy Note 9 we are expecting it to
launch somewhere around August 2nd or
August 7th
please Samsung let me know to buy my
plane tickets on time think about it is
we've got color options that will follow
most of the scheme of the galaxy s 9 but
apparently there's going to be this
Brown option and bear with me I don't
think it's gonna be brown I think it's
gonna be copper stay tuned because that
will probably be my favorite color now
let's talk about the Google pixel 3 and
pixel 3 Excel we've got some fan based
renders we don't really cover those you
know that but these are very credible
mainly because we've got the notch at
the top we've got the chin at the bottom
but the chin includes the stereo speaker
the dual firing speaker at the bottom
which for me makes a lot of sense if
google follows on this design then we've
got the glass back that looks great
whatever the case might be I can't wait
to see this phone let's just hope that
it looks just like this and that notch
doesn't look too bad and finally the
most interesting news today have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy
10 we had a lot of Samsung today but the
news were good particularly because of
this one where we hear that the display
is going to be covering most of the
front of the phone which is great
apparently Samsung really needs to make
a change with this phone because of the
way sales have been so yeah redesign is
great
but I'm kind of concerned over the
changes we will have a 3d camera at the
top so there will be a minor bezel at
the top but then apparently we're
getting bone conduction for the earpiece
meaning the dual stereo speakers were
probably died and you know in today's
question let us know what do you think
about bone conduction I'm not gonna lie
I've listened to it it it's different
it's it you can hear you can hear in
very noisy environments which is great
but it's different leave us a comment
