today we are going to unbox the motorola
droid razr let's get to it alright so
here we see the box of the motorola
droid razr almost square has a nice
motorola droid I in front very clean
sides here at the top we've got some
barcodes some verizon and motorola
branding on each side of the box right
there and over on that side as well the
back has some very brief information
about the phone and let's go ahead and
slide this off it's a sleeve like most
other Motorola phones are looking at the
box itself you've got the nice embossed
droid razr on the front again with the
branding on the sides the top and bottom
both have the verizon 4g LTE branding
and then on the back is surprisingly
blank there's nothing at all they're
very clean look and I like quite a bit
opening this up let's look at it first
the thickness it's very very thin a
little bit wider than most boxes that
were used to to fit all the stuff but
thin reminiscent of the phone that's
inside of it so taking the lid off we
can see inside and yes it's upside down
but you will give a point here nice
little tab to help you take out the
phone we'll set that aside for a minute
and then look at what we have we've got
the manuals master your device important
consumer information product safety and
warranty information and then we also
have this neat little booklet called
consumer information about
radiofrequency emissions and responsible
driving basically don't sue us if you
answer or crash while using this we've
also got a micro USB cable nothing out
of the ordinary there but then we have
this nice charging brick if you will go
ahead and open that because it's not
like the others we've seen first of all
it's a cube which is a little bit
unusual it also has these fold up prongs
now this is a u.s. device so it has u.s.
prongs that fold up and down for
traveling and storage very nice i like
that quite a bit but on the front you'll
notice there are two USB ports rather
than the the one so if you've got
another USB device another phone safe or
spouse or a Bluetooth headset you can
plug it in there and won't have to worry
about it very nice and then just the
empty Fox there as well let's go back to
the phone now this isn't a molded thing
it's just a folded piece of paper it's
very nice that holds the phone securely
we'll move that out of the way the phone
itself has a very nice screen cover on
it that does more than just protect the
screen during packaging and shipping
it's got all these different information
points on it up at the top you've got
your HDMI port your micro USB port and
of course your headphone headset jack as
well very light in the hand that you'll
notice how thin it is here got the bump
on the top which feels very nice
underneath the index finger but
ridiculously thin it's got a Kevlar
backing on it to give it some strength
but compared to the droid bionic here
you can see just how thin this phone is
a little bit longer and a little bit
wider much lighter weight and just very
very very thin ridiculously thin the
thing feels nice and hand it looks nice
overall it's an impressive unit the
motorola droid razr</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
