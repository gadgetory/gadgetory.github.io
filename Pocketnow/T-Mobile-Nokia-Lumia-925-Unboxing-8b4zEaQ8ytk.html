t-mobile in the US and I dropped by the
microsoft store to pick one up and we're
going to unbox it and see what's inside
and check out maybe what's a different
from the international version alright
sometimes it's fun to take a look around
the box a little bit before we open it
up here we have the nokia lumia 925
right here on the top is a gray tiles
instead of the pink ones usually see and
let's see what's no featured on the back
we got windows phone 8 puremotion hd+
8.7 megapixel PureView camera with
optical image stabilization HD
front-facing camera dual core 16 gauge
with seven Big Sky Drive nokia music
with free offline playback skype in xbox
alright so let's check it out and here
we are
there's the device at little labels for
the sindoor charger port USB port at
support so we know and where everything
is that's pretty good let's look at the
back little plastic there alright see
what else we have
wait for the hilltop to go by all right
we got under here is the sim dorky so
that's going to go in here and it will
open up I'm going to take the plastic
off
that's how that works and there you go
pops right open all right we'll try that
out later you're booting up there's a
sim card and we have some documentation
I'll leave that in there just to use a
guide and a charger and a micro USB
cable that's it not a bad size charger
okay we're all booted up and I'm just
going to do a little comparison with the
old nokia windows phone for tmobile the
Lumia 810 and you see the size is very
very similar
screen size very similar but the
thickness you see the 925 is much
thinner feels lighter to go to the back
quite different design of course the 810
here has the wireless charging shell
installed and we don't have wireless
charging on the 925 just yet you need a
attachment there let's look at what kind
of apps come on the t-mobile version of
this device now my accounting at t
mobile TV Wi-Fi calling that's going to
be a great feature app highlights
creative studio here city lens skype is
pre-installed weather channel is
pre-installed cinemagraph we also have
data sense that'll be nice once I set it
up there's no sim card in here yet dr
plus beta already pre-installed here
maps here transit lots of good stuff
there's name ID from t-mobile
and transfer my data so there you go
there's your weather channel lots of
good stuff on the Lumia 925 that's it
for the unboxing of the t-mobile USA
version of the Nokia Lumia 925 sure to
give this video a thumbs up and that's
it for now
