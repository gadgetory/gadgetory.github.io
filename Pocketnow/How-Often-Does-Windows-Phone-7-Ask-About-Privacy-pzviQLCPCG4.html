packing.com number of our readers were
kind of confused last week when
microsoft was hit by a lawsuit claiming
the windows phone 7 was uploading
location data to the market officers
without the users permission this is a
freshly reset HD 7s and we're just going
to take a look at where exactly were
asked for permission to upload like
location data and you know all of that
privacy stuff and Windows Phone 7 so
let's check it out
first off you got to do let's get
started and what's the English enough
sim card terms of use now if you're
going to sue Microsoft this is probably
something you should read so we're going
to look at that before we say accept or
reject there we go and we're going to
look at the privacy section you can set
you can send to the collection use and
disclosure of your information in
accordance with the MSA and the windows
phone 7 privacy statement there's
another one down here privacy we collect
certain information value use and
protect the information as described in
the blah blah blah okay so there's a lot
of stuff admitting to collecting data so
as soon as we say except that means it's
okay for them to do it alright and now
we have another thing the recommended
settings enable cylinder data and send
information to help improve when those
phones so if you're going to choose that
it's going to send information anyway
let's choose custom and here we are
again send information to help improve
one who's phone yes or no let's do know
and just a little time settings
whatever you can sign in I'll just skip
it style naps that done in it and here
we are all done so we already did give
it permission to the Senate aggression
arcsoft but now let's go into the camera
and here it is again allow the camera to
use your location anyway we're going to
say cancel your camera and take a
picture one finger and let's just look
at the settings
include location is shut off so that
picture should not have any GPS
information attached to it and there's
your privacy statement again and every
time we go to an app that wants to use
your location it's going to ask you
again so do I want to allow this to use
my location now after i took that
picture i loaded it onto my computer
here and i wanted to see if there was
any location information attached to it
so this is a bridge and we're going to
select it and here's all the metadata
attached to that picture so we see the
date we say Windows Phone OS 7 and there
is no location information at all
attached to it normally there would be a
GPS entry here and there be some
latitude and longitude coordinates that
is if you turned on the GPS option for
attaching the pictures so since I denied
the camera access to the GPS seems that
that is not there that's it for now
