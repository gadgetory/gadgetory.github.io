seasons after its launch we already
covered that in and after the buzz from
a few months ago wondering about its
durability specifically we covered that
too and a durability report a few weeks
back wondering about the wooden version
in particular there we've got you
covered I'm Michael Fisher with pocket
now and this is our durability report on
the wooden Moto X the ebony Moto X
became available alongside the other
wood grain options at the end of January
and since the arrival of my personal
unit on january thirty i've been using
the device almost non-stop alongside my
other daily driver the lumia 1020 in
that time I've carried it completely
naked as is my normal custom and the
phone has had a few run-ins with gravity
in particular with the hardwood floors
of my home in office but even before all
that I noticed something peculiar about
the ebony moto X's finish right out of
the box the device had an interesting
model bleyer sitting atop the wood grain
which I took to be a water resistant
sealant it's this finish that highlights
moisture when the device is wet and when
you're handling it with sweaty or greasy
hands it really shows up but it's not as
bad as a glass backed device and because
the material has the look and feel of
wood you might not mind giving it a
little character through moisture not
that you'd want to spray it with
furniture cleaner or a wax but a little
water from the shore ordered the shower
hasn't hurt mine at all the back panel
does show the occasional minor
imperfection but again those were there
out of the box and are not a result of
my clumsy fingers really the ebony
surface holds up better than the plastic
even though it's smoother to the touch
and the wood grain does a good job of
minimizing scratches that do sneak in
our friend Austin Evans confirmed
similar durability on his teak unit as
well sadly that's not a totally clean
bill of health just because I haven't
dropped this one on concrete like I did
our blue moto X review unit doesn't mean
it would bear up any better than that
device the frame of the ebony Moto X is
just as plastic as it is on the rest of
the line and it's glass is just as
susceptible to my
or scratches but the ebony moto X's
similarity to its cousins works for it
too it's fairly rugged it's well sized
so you're less likely to drop it and the
new custom decals don't look to be going
anywhere no matter how many pockets your
phone is slid into and out of best of
all it comes from a company whose name
has for years been synonymous with solid
hardware the wooden Moto X may still
have a shallower dimple than its
rubberized companions a bigger deal than
it sounds like to we Moto X owners but
in terms of durability it's sure not
sacrificing much and you should feel
pretty okay about carrying one of these
without a case if you want to know more
about how the Moto X is aged in a
holistic sense and since its launched
check out the description down below
there's a link to our full after the
buzz episode where you get a whole lot
more detail about this special device
