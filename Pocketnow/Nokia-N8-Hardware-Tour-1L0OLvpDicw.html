we're going to do a hardware tour of the
nokia n8 right here so let's check it
out now the nokia n8 hardware is really
incredible it's just beautiful we got a
metal and a nice shine to the logo there
so let's take a look we got a 3.5 inch
screen and that's the OLED up here we
have logo a ambient light sensor and a
front-facing camera that's 0.3
megapixels for the front and there's our
speaker grill down here we have a button
and a microphone on the bottom we have
our charging port very tiny little
lanyard hole over here we have volume
buttons nice little divot there so you
can feel it very easily here we have the
lock switch which is really cool just
hit I like that and screen unlocks or
locks back down so you can put in your
pocket really great idea right there
quick little switch and here we have the
camera button which is dual action
halfway to focus full the way to press
r2 shut it rather as a little screw
around the top we have our power button
and we have a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and what's that we have an hdmi
port yeah I know that's crazy right
and it comes with a cable you don't have
to buy a fifty-dollar cable over here we
have our slots for the microsd and the
SIM card you have to get them open like
that and you can see just slips out like
that and the microsd comes out like that
so you can add more storage but it comes
with 16 gigs of internal storage 512 of
ROM and you got 256 megs of ram here's
our micro USB port and on the back you
got a 12 megapixel camera with a Carl
Zeiss lens and a xenon flash and even in
little autofocus illuminator very
impressive there here's a speaker too
and that's about it for our hardware
inside you've got 682 megahertz for a
processor speed the screen resolution is
360 x 640 and for radios this is pretty
impressive it's got five bands of 3g
UMTS so that means it works on european
3g t-mobile's t-mobile USA 3g 18 2 3g
anything that has a sim card it'll go
it'll have 3g probably pretty crazy of
course as gsm bands as well Wi-Fi 802 11
n bluetooth 3.0 FM radios in there plus
an FM transmitter now assisted gps to
and a 12 hundred million per hour
battery however there's no way to get
the battery out so you can't replace it
on the go you gotta gotta bring the
charger in long and that spoke it for
the nokia n8 hard
really impressive great great build
quality hope you enjoyed this video give
us a thumbs up if you like the n8 and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
