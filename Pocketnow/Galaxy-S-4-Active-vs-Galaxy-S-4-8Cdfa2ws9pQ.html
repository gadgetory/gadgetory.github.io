a few weeks before Samsung announced the
Galaxy s4 active chances are your
feelings and feelings right now or if
you're still in the market for one or
the other you've probably got some
questions on how the two devices compare
well let's try to answer those I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Samsung Galaxy s4 active vs.
samsung galaxy s4 because we've already
given the act of a thorough look in our
quick review we're gonna limit this
video to directly comparing it to the
stock edition s4 in the usual three
areas hardware software and performance
to make sure you don't miss future
comparisons subscribe here on YouTube
and visit us at pocketnow.com and on our
social media feeds the galaxy s4 active
takes the chassis of the Galaxy s4 and
builds upon it the active is larger in
every dimension and even though we're
talking millimeters here the 15%
increase in thickness over the s4 means
you definitely feel it in the hand and
the increase in mass from 130 to 150 3
grams means you feel it in the pocket -
now that's not necessarily a bad thing
we ding - the stock s4 in our review for
feeling - plasticy despite its
relatively good looks and the actives
extra bulk goes a long way toward
overcoming that if you like it's in your
face rugged aesthetic it feels better in
the hand - its satin finish nicer under
the fingertips than the s4 is hyper
glaze and obviously you won't feel the
need to be as careful with the active
not because of any legitimate impact
resistance or milspec ratings but just
because the actives build won't show
scratches and dings as easily and then
there's the actives ip67 immersion and
dust resistance ratings which the s4
can't match at all without a case but
the active makes some alterations to
attain that capability the biggest one
is on the biggest component the 5-inch
display takes a kind of sideways step to
LCD from AMOLED a move we're not huge
fans of but which you might be depending
on your taste we're still talking about
a 1080p 441 PPI panel here so it's still
beautiful but we really hate to lose the
heightened saturation and deep blacks
that AMOLED provides the traditional
counter-argument
that is that LCD performs better in
bright sunlight but while that may be
true to a very limited extent in this
case it didn't make any noticeable
difference in our testing you pour
enough sunlight on these screens you
won't be able to see anything on either
one so the decrease to vibrance of the
LCD and its purplish tint is tougher to
swallow on the active
fortunately the internals stay largely
unchanged from the stock to the active
so you spec heads can put your pencils
down and take a breather for this one
we've got the same 1.9 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 driving
everything on each device with the help
of 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of built-in
storage because their Samsung phones you
can count on that storage being
expandable via microSD in each case and
you can also breathe a sigh of relief
that the 2600 milliamp hour battery
stays the same across phones and yes
even on the active it stays removable
the similarities continue in software
with both phones running a recent build
of TouchWiz atop Android 4.2.2 jelly
bean if you like TouchWiz you'll feel
right at home on the Galaxy s4 active
and if you hate it you'll still have
plenty to hate on on the active as well
it's the same software experience that
said apps like s-health make a lot more
sense on the active which is presumably
the more attractive phone to folks
who've spent a lot of time exercising
and Samsung's clever integration of a
stock torch app on the active is
something we wish every smartphone
featured it's very handy also ported
pretty much straight from the s4 to the
active is the camera suite which
features the same viewfinder format
itself a port of the Galaxy cameras
software the interface is a little
complex when you get down into the
settings menus but it's excellent
shooting mode carousel is easy to use
and understand in each instance the
active features a special aqua shooting
mode for underwater photos and videos a
mode that also enables the volume key as
a shutter release but it doesn't offer
the s4's
dual shot and maybe more importantly to
sum the actives camera is an 8 megapixel
sensor down from 13 megapixels on its
cousin now megapixels certainly aren't
everything and our brief testing bore
that out results were inconclusive
but certainly not a slam dunk in either
direction the s for sometimes delivered
warmer shots and it's 13 megapixel
photos are certainly more zoomable than
the actives 8 megapixel shots but both
cameras do quite well outdoors
especially with HDR mode enabled indoor
photos gave both devices a challenge
overall the stock s for s camera did
exhibit a slight edge in most photos
with a little less noise and a little
more detail in lower lit areas but then
the active can take photos underwater so
there's that in terms of video both
devices can film in full 1080p
resolution but the S 4's edge is a
little more apparent here with its video
quite clean and clear
while the active favours the purple end
of the spectrum and is much more
susceptible to wide swings in exposure
and white balance beyond the camera
performance there are some more concrete
differences here we've had another
chance to evaluate voice calling between
these two since our review landed and
voice does indeed take a big hit on the
active callers said we sounded muddy and
muffled on the active compared to the
stock s for which we didn't rate too
highly on call performance in the first
place
those results also translated to
speakerphone calls as well if you're
someone who relies on crisp call quality
you'll probably want to favor the stock
S four over the active the active also
takes a slight hit in synthetic
benchmarks but thankfully that doesn't
translate to software performance it's
just as responsive as the s4 and whether
that's a plus or a minus depends on your
feelings about the s4 s stock software
load
rounding out the performance differences
on a bright note battery endurance is
fairly equal between these units each
one will get you through a full day with
moderate use and cellular reception also
went hand-in-hand on each with the
Galaxy S 4 active Samsung has largely
succeeded in building a more durable
version of the base product without
sacrificing much if you can deal with
the less vibrant display lower
resolution camera and reduced voice
quality in exchange for a phone that can
put up with the rigors of a
rough-and-tumble lifestyle the active
will probably be the device for you and
it's a solid choice in that regard
but if you want the true no sacrifices
cream-of-the-crop when it comes to the
Galaxy S series the stock galaxy s4
still holds the crown here you just make
sure to get a case if you're going to
put it underwater and definitely try not
to drop it ever book save so much more
on the Galaxy s4 active the galaxy s4
