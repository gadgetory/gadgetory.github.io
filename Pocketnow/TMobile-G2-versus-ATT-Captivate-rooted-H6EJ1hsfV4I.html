location to show you a speed test
between the t-mobile g2 and a rooted
AT&amp;amp;T captivate running a custom rom
let's go take a look all right on the
right we have a stock t-mobile g2 which
is an 800 megahertz phone on the left we
have an AT&amp;amp;T samsung captivate which
comes with Android 2.1 as the stock
operating system when we Ryan quadrant
which is the the de facto standard for
benchmarking apps the initial time we
got nine hundred and nine points now you
remember from when we were running it on
the g2 we got significantly higher than
that well when we ran the cognition rom
when we flashed the cognition rom which
is a froyo or android 2.2 the first time
we ran that we got 989 points which
isn't a huge improvement we thought we'd
see a huge improvement when we went from
stock android 2.1 up to 2.2 and we just
didn't do that of course it's not a
stock rom anymore the interesting thing
is when we ran the cognition rom and
applied the one click lag fix and i
think you're going to be amazed at the
results so let's go ahead and see what
those results are all right so here we
go running both the benchmarks at the
same time
now if you'll remember the ATT samsung
captivate is a galaxy s series phone
which is running a 1 gigahertz
hummingbird processor over on the other
side the t-mobile is using an 800
megahertz scorpion processor so they're
not really one to one the hummingbird is
a 45 nanometer processor and so is the
scorpion but it's not like the one
gigahertz processor which was in the
nexus one that one is a 65 nanometer and
it's the older generation so we're
really comparing two side-by-side
similar chips here of course the
difference being 800 megahertz vs 1
gigahertz as you'll notice as these
tests finish up and we're just about
there right now go ahead and send our
results and send the results they
finished about the same you can see this
over here we're getting 1600 in some
points over on the g2 and on the samsung
we're seeing 1800 now when we ran this
the first few times we were getting into
the 1900s now remember what I said the
first time the stock rom gets 900 points
the stock well the the cognition rom
which is a froyo base rom doesn't
increase the speed that much that means
at least if we want to make this
comparison that froyo doesn't make as
big a deal as we all fought in the
benchmarks 909 989 that's not much but
where the huge difference is is in the
the ability of the device to access the
file system and that's where the
Samsungs are at a competitive
disadvantage they have their proprietary
samsung operating system but as soon as
we apply that proprietary lag fix the
speed of the samsung jumps up by double
so if there was ever a reason for a
manufacturer to stick to standards or to
allow people to flash their own custom
roms on it there you go if you want your
samsung phone to be twice as fast as it
is simply apply that lag fix and you're
off and running now that having been
said a 300-point difference between the
g2 and i'm sorry a 200-point difference
between the g
2 at 800 megahertz and the galaxy phone
at 1 gigahertz that that's not a big
deal 800 megahertz to 1 gigahertz 200
points that's kind of what I'd expect
especially since the samsung has much
better graphics and video handling then
does the g two but you've all been
wondering and you've all been asking so
there you go they're the numbers they
don't lie of course you'll want to run
these tests on your own phone run them
several times to get a good bench line
these numbers are right in line with
what I've been seeing in the past so
showing you the true speed or the
potential speed of the AT&amp;amp;T samsung
captivate versus the t-mobile stock g2
