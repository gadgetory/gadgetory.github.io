advertising focuses on giving you design
options and if it weren't enough we do
get a teaser for the droid ultra I'm hi
Mary better wondering why droids are so
vulnerable he stays this is poking out
daily let's say off with some cool news
is we've got some leaks of Android 4.3
and apparently it does bring a very
revolutionary feature as it seems that
the system will be able to listen to
your notifications play them back to you
and also allow you to interact with the
system to respond back to you sort of
like Google now on steroids which is
kind of interesting as you won't have to
actually be activating anything
according to the leaks apparently the
phone will talk to you luck to it creepy
but I do consider it awesome let's see
what it ends up becoming if it ever
leaves the oven but hey Android 4.3 does
he do you better than just a number now
sadly not everything today is good news
as HTC has just confirmed that they will
not be providing any more software
updates for the HTC One S and that is
kind of funny since first of all this
phone rocks the same sort of occasions
as the One X on AT&amp;amp;T it's not even two
years old an HTC promise that this phone
was gonna be one of the devices that was
getting HTC Sense 5 i'm really sorry for
you guys it shows that phone now the
budget iphone is up nexus we've got some
leaked photographs of the device and
three different colors which is pink
yellow and green men not the most
beautiful colors in the world but still
remember that apple does a lot of
prototyping and most likely these could
be just test units of what the colors
look like and we could probably
eventually get different colors on the
phone gets announced or release so stay
tuned for whatever happens as this
budget iphone does seem to be some
serious business even if it looks like
the HTC first which is actually not good
verizon is up next as the company is
officially teasing a droid ultra lineup
and according to them we are getting
glossy color options here but for those
of you wondering which company is
building these phones well they said
DuPont Kevlar so that's Motorola and
even though they don't specify any dates
as to when we are getting them there's
actually more interesting news regarding
this phone so stay tuned to the next
segment and finally for the hot news of
the day Motorola has finally sent out
there
advertisements of the Moto X and
according to the company one this will
be the first phone go fully in the
United States which is awesome news and
two well this will be the first phone
that you'll actually be able to design
on your own which we're still trying to
figure out because we also have that
droid ultra advertisement which teases a
phone with a lot of color options and
DuPont Kevlar so that's not really
designing a phone or tailoring it to my
desires but anyways that leads you to
the question of the day if a company
would allow you to design a specific
portion of a phone or something that you
would really want what would be the
number one feature that you would look
for or that you would add to the design
of your own phone in my particular case
if phones today are about to display I
mean that's the only way you can really
interact with the phone and for me the
quality of the display the color
accuracy is the number one feature but
leave us a comment down below what would
be your pick of course it's always for
an earlier scope of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and
telephone make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well you can also follow me
on Twitter and I'm underscore to be
better please give this video thumbs up
