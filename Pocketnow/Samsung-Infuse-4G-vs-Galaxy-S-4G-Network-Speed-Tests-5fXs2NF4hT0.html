calm i'm just going to show you a couple
quick speed tests between the 18 th
sampson infuse 4g over here and the
galaxy s 4g over here on t-mobile so
pretty much the same manufacturer both
of these are category 14 hspa+ so that
means they should theoretically support
up to 21 megabits per second download
but realize it's kind of different and
they're both made by samson so we should
have pretty equal footing here you see
right now i just did a test and you see
that this is a around six meg download
and over here we have 1.5 so what really
happens is it depends on what antenna
you're near and what the speed of that
is right there's an antenna right over
there in that direction let's just do
another test I'm going to do one at a
time so that they're not both trying to
do the network speed at the same time so
you can see this one's getting pretty
good
about for meg
and not so much not a very good download
speed really poor download speed I mean
upload sorry good download bad upload
there we go okay let's try the galaxy s
4g and you see both of these are going
to the same server and this one is still
hovering around 1.5 but look at that
upload speed a lot better
so there you go upload and download is
actually really close to each other on
this one now of course this depends on
your location is to let me look at the
results of my history from driving
around and we'll look at the infuse 4g
over here you see upload speeds are all
around pretty bad one day I got 66 Meg
download and 1.2 upload so here you can
see sometimes it gets kind of slow but
we're all in the tune for range except
for that one okay so that's that's your
18 teen network and over here on
t-mobile you can see pretty good range
too sometimes in the 400 k range those
are Wi-Fi
9 mag right there and some slower speeds
so you can see quite a range on these
results for speed tests on both of these
4G category 14 devices this one gets
some faster Mac speeds but this one
seems to be a little more consistent on
the 18 teen network I'll be a little bit
slower so there's your speed tests so I
hope you enjoyed this video give us a
thumbs up if you did and that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
