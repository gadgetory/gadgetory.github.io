firing stereo speakers it is so
incredibly loud and in this video we're
going to compare it against the galaxy
s3 the Nexus 4 and the iPhone 5 so that
you can see or hear how loud boom sound
is on the HTC One let's get to it
and so what we have here is a very
unscientific setup here we've got a
decibel meter running on the iPad its
baseline is I'm going to stop talking
around 40 so we're going to use that to
help determine exactly how loud all
these devices are they're all cued up to
the exact same video so let's start off
with a galaxy s3 now I'm going to do
something here because devices like the
Galaxy s3 and the Nexus 4 have their
speakers on the back so I'm actually
going to turn the phone over just to be
fair although technically I should leave
it on its back but will give it an extra
advantage there so we're queued up at
the same portion on a video right before
the pocket out intro is about to cue up
and we are at maximum volume so I'm
going to press play turn it over and
let's watch and see where it maxes out
at ready your smartphone okay so we were
at 70 there 70 decibels for the galaxy
s3 let's go with the iPhone 5 next the
iPhone 5 has an extremely loud speaker
in fact many Revere it to be the loudest
speaker before the HTC one came out so
we're going to play the intro and we're
going to leave it right here because the
speakers fire downwards so again we're
trying to beat 70 let's go and we're
maxed out of volume of course
okay also around 70 I saw it go a little
bit higher than that I went to about 71
or so let's bring out the Nexus 4 which
again has a speaker on the back so we're
gonna unlock it play it
make sure volumes up all the way and
let's go it really stayed around state
around 65 or so and let's bring out the
HTC One with the boomsound fan going on
so we unlock the screen same video we're
going to leave the phone face up because
we've got the front firing speakers and
let's see if there's much of a
difference we're trying to be 71 of
course this isn't a perfect comparison
but it helps us to make a point okay you
see that a peaked at 75 right before the
climax of our old intro this might not
be the most scientific test but we can
tell you guys without hesitation that
the HTC One has the loudest speakers
we've ever heard on a smart phone back
just the other day I was building a
piece of furniture and instead of using
so notes like I usually do to play my
music I actually took out my my Spotify
app here and the sound was just
incredible from the HTC One
anyhow we're so excited about boomsound
because it's a feature that we didn't
know we really needed which is louder
speakers on a phone we have it in the
HTC One and our unscientific rather
crappy test here tells us that it is
indeed louder the galaxy s3 the iPhone 5
and the Nexus 4 if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and keep an
eye out for more coverage of the HTC One
coming up soon that's it for now
