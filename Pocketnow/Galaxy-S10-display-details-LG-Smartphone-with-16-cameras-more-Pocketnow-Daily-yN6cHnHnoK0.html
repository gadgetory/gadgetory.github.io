us what to expect for the Galaxy S tens
display looks like huawei mate beat
Samsung to releasing a phone with a
punch hole on the display and LG you
just told other companies to hold their
beer and patent the phone with 16
cameras I'm Jaime Rivera and for those
of you asking for giveaways obviously if
you can speak in Spanish we're running
one in our Spanish channel so Spanish
comments are welcome this is pocket out
daily sponsored by swap up the official
dish do they start with cyber monday
deals though I doubt you'll be able to
watch this before you can take advantage
of it think about it is well we've got
different options if you want to join
t-mobile like getting a free Apple watch
free iPad and in addition we've got
Sprint's giving away iPhones obviously
there's a catch and we also have Google
and Project by offering significant
discounts or even giveaways in the case
of the LGB 35 and others you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about LG I mean we do need a segment
that's called the most ridiculous news
coz up okay we've got this patent and
the patent is for an LG phone with 16
cameras not 616 and the funny part is
that out of those 16 cameras there's no
selfie camera it seems that the back of
the phone is gonna somehow serve as a
mirror for you to use that hole fly ball
thingy of whatever LG is gonna come up
with I'm not saying it's ridiculous but
it kind of is I mean what's the function
are there so many different types of
lenses for 16 cameras to make sense now
let's talk about the Google pixel 3
light as it's currently being leaked by
the same sources that leaked the hell
out of the pixel 3xl sadly which means
it's probably a given and it's being
compared against the pixel 3 XL in
photos and obviously we've got mid-range
er specifications but the camera I mean
the camera doesn't seem to be bad 12
megapixels and apparently it's going to
be the same module or similar to the one
we've got on the other so that's not bad
now let's talk about Huawei as
the company has sort of sent out press
invitations for an event where it's
teasing a cutout on the display of a
phone and for those of you that have
been following the rumors we've been
hearing that the Infinity Oh display is
going to make it to the Galaxy S 10 so
maybe
Huawei beats them to the punch what
phone are we missing this year is the
question stay tuned and finally the hot
news that they have to do with the
samsung galaxy a8 s if they could make
the name any more difficult to pronounce
but you know that I don't cover mid
Rangers for the hot news but then here's
the thing apparently the Infinity L
display is not gonna make a debut on
this 10 it's gonna make it on the a 8s
and I hope I don't have to pronounce
this name again but the point being yes
that there will be some differences
apparently the module in the s10 is
gonna be smaller but I mean this is not
the first time that Samsung experiments
with the mid-range or for us to get a
phone you know a flagship phone later so
let us know in the comments I mean this
means that we're not just getting one
phone I mean what do you think do you
like the whole concept of infinity o or
not because if you saw my review of the
pixel 3 Excel it seems that Google is
even experimenting with a concept of
some dead pixels in a corner and
developer options and a recent software
updates so that's interesting leave us a
comment down below I I don't know how
I'll see them when I see them and before
we end this video we would love to
thanks WAPA for sponsoring this video
now that we have new iPhones out Apple
has discounted some of our favorite
models like the iPhone 10 the iPhone 6s
plus and the iPhone se you can still get
these phones and gently use conditions
over at swap ah check out the link in
the description below for swap a
selection of discontinued iPhones
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm talking about
comment subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you follow me on
Twitter hand down just go to be better
on Instagram at high together please
