at the FCC pre-orders for the galaxy
note 2 and the galaxy gear have begun in
the United States and Amazon is rumored
to give you a phone and I mean literally
give you a phone I'm high Meadow iveta
and trust me I am not wearing this
jersey for any particular reason today
this is out daily letters day
off with the official news as pre-orders
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the
Galaxy gear have begun on t-mobile
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T the case of t-mobile
deal is a little sweeter a hundred
dollars less than on the other carriers
but even more interesting is the fact
that the galaxy gear is as expensive s
can be so the question is if you're free
ordering this phone on any other
carriers and aside from that LG is also
offering the g2 on pre-orders on a TNT
as well leave us a comment down below if
you pre-order any of these now let's
talk about nokia we know about their
phablet project code-named bandit and
we've seen a couple of leaked photos of
this device that we kind of considered
fake because the whole Windows Phone you
I just did not look adequate for the
phone but as it turns out we finally get
the first press renders of the phone and
yeah this looks pretty much like a Nokia
Lumia 925 only on a bigger chassis and a
1080p display now that 1080p display is
probably in a delay this phone and so
Windows Phone 8.1 so stay tuned for that
the reports of Amazon working on their
own smartphone or older than dirt were
kind of bored of them but we've got some
more credible sources talking about the
company building a phone at actually
giving it to customers for free now yeah
notice I said customers there is no such
thing as a free lunch anywhere
apparently Amazon will be offering this
phone for free to amazon prime customers
which is still in the deal since you'll
pay eighty dollars a year and you're
still getting free shipping and
streaming videos and a free book and
spent everything it's actually a cool
deal let's just hope it happens and
let's see how we routed afterwards now
you know this whole deal between google
and nestle with KitKat you know android
4.4 is getting kind of hilarious I mean
we still don't know what to expect from
the operating system and as it turns out
google and nestle are teaming up to
offer free nexus 7's a thousand of them
and even free google play gift cards for
1000 specific
Android Kit Kat bars that are in the
market I think Google is kind of
forgetting what we're really after here
but as it turns out again you get a free
Nexus 7 so go get your break and finally
for the hot news of the day usually the
Nexus smartphone is not necessarily an
expensive phone because it doesn't have
the top tiered specs that other phones
have but as it turns out the LG Nexus 5
is already at the FCC or so we think and
well this phone has got a Snapdragon 800
processor it's got LTE connectivity it's
got a 5-inch 1080p display so there is
nothing about this phone that makes it a
pushover and if LG figures out a way to
get that optical image stabilization of
the g2 on this phone this phone is gonna
be the massive hit of the year if Google
could keep the price tag at three
hundred dollars at least so that leads
you to the question of the day after
everything you see in these links are
you interested in an LG Nexus 5 almost
probably seen in the next couple of
weeks in my particular case honestly if
they keep three hundred dollars for that
bone with those specs that is my next
device leave us a comment down below
what do you think friends as always for
an earlier scribble of everything that's
happening in a smartphone its outdoor
machine follow us on pocketnow comment
