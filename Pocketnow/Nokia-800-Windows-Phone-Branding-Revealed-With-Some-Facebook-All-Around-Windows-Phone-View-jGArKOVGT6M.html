location platform and the nokia 800
branding gets leaked all this and more
coming up right now hello everyone I'm
hime it'll be better with pocketnow.com
and welcome to Windows Phone view the
show we wrap up all this week's good and
bad inside the world of Microsoft's
Windows Phone platform let's start this
week off with what's good well if your
wallet was left ticking about either the
HTC radar or time have a look at our
recent coverage of the ACC radars video
showcase what brings you a lot of
information on what to expect on the
device the device brings a metallic
unibody design which is beautiful it
really stands out from the crowd so
there's a lot of things to expect from
it sadly we still don't have release
dates on the device in the US but hey a
lot of us are waiting for it as much as
you are so hey we'll keep you posted
whatever we learn about anything
remember we have our hands on videos of
the Titan and the radar when our friend
Anton d Maggie was in Berlin and the IFA
event so make sure you have a look at
those if you want to help yourself make
up your mind about getting it or not and
also make sure you look at Brandon
minimums recent editorial about why
Windows Phone 7 is winning and why mango
is going to set the bar for getting
windows mobile to come from good to
great so make sure you look at that too
and well-armed an Evan blass expert in
all leagues foreign and domestic did a
great job in pulling some retail imagery
of what we expect from the Nokia
prototype code 800 now what's
interesting is that Nokia seems to be
pushing a lot of Facebook within this
sale and well we're not sure if this is
going to be a Facebook branded phone or
not but it most likely will be the seer
a device that's been leaked that's
bringing information from that Nokia n9
that everybody already knows about
probably the design and everything else
now interesting enough it seems that
Nokia will also keep the Nokia 800 names
for this device in the end so really
interesting let's see what history pulls
in the end on the software front great
news for all of us youtubers because the
html5 version of YouTube now works in
mango for those of us that want to use
in mobile I could say finally but I'm
going to cut
engl some slack because first of all it
hasn't even been released so it looks
really good in my personal testing I've
tested it on an iPhone 4 a google nexus
one and the dell venue pro that i own
and trust me the dell venue pro blew
them away in html5 performance so this
really good news it seems that it loads
video a lot faster than these other
competing devices aside from that the
official mango ron for the HTC mozart
was leaked on XDA developers and well
some people are already getting it and
aside from that the samsung omnia 7
mango engineering rom was also released
for engineers apparently for testing so
these are all good news it seems that
mango is just around the corner and
while microsoft's new job posting has
them looking for a highly motivated
group of people to work on a core
location service platform to help
windows phone 7 now interesting enough
you know that Microsoft's really going
through this location gate lawsuit issue
so not really sure what they're
expecting with this but it seems that
Microsoft wants to use in sort of crowds
based system where when those phones
that except to share their location will
help them build their database on
information of your location whenever
your GPS is not working but whenever
you're not really using your radio like
for example if you're on a airplane mode
or something now not really sure what to
expect about this I mean Microsoft it's
already hot on your front so let's see
what happens in the end let's see if you
end up pulling it off and if you get the
team
now that doesn't for the good let's
continue on with what's bad Microsoft
has decided to respond on record
regarding the class-action lawsuit about
location gate and well microsoft said
that they are investigating because most
likely they really don't have any
problem now I invite you to have a look
at Adam lanes recent video regarding all
this lawsuit issue and shows us clearly
about 20 times or I'm probably
exaggerating but he chose us so many
ways in which Microsoft asked customers
if they're interested in sharing their
location or not including in the camera
application where Microsoft's being sued
now interesting enough Adam was able to
take a picture with location data shared
and the picture without location data
shared transported these images to his
computer and he was able to show us on
video that Microsoft does a really good
job in not sharing your location data
when you choose not to share it so I
mean I think this class action lawsuit
is done and I you know you just hate
people that are actually making a living
out of this but anyways that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high middle you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
