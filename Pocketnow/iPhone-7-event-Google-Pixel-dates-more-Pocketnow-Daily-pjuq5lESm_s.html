iphone 7 and apple watch series to line
up the LG G 6 might not ditch modularity
after all according to rumors and we get
the possible dates for the Google pixel
devices to come I'm hi Mary vera and
onto everything else that's not related
to apple news this is parking out daily
brought to you by Autodesk graphic the
official news today begin with some
interesting new products that just
reached the market for those of you that
like the Michael Porsche smartwatches
the ones that were built by the fossil
group that we featured Aoife 2016 well
they just reached stateside and if you
thought that the price tags were going
to be crazy $350 to start for Michael
course SmartWatch made by fossil that
retains popular designs that are already
known by michael kors you can learn more
in the link in the description now for
those of you that have joined dozen
being surprised over the design changes
of the 20 from LG and the fact that
modularity went out the door even though
we still get expandability in a smarter
way see that the g6 might not continue
that trend apparently the g6 will
continue doing what the g5 is doing
barely modularity will return let's just
see what the company plans to do about
that hardware now for those of you in
the market for the future and Nexus
devices that will now be called pixels
and not Nexus you can set your calendars
for October fourth for a possible event
apparently a possible launch for october
twenty prepare your wallets the rumors
claim that the price tags might receive
a little spike and it could make sense
given the fact that these devices were
probably made by HTC and HTC wasn't
really that candid when it came to the
price tag of the HTC 10 SB of nexus
devices we've got more rumors pertaining
the Huawei probable Nexus 7 we're not
exactly sure of the recent trademark
filings for the huawei 7p have to do
with this tablet but it could just be
because we've heard rumors of a
Snapdragon 820 processor 64 gigs of
storage that's probably expandable we're
not exactly sure here but the trademark
this point to a 7p Huawei working on a
feature Nexus 7 tablet our other rumor
there might be a lick here and finally
the very hot news today because we
simply cannot ignore it is apple's event
we've got a full separate video the
details the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus the
spec changes everything that we liked
about these new products in addition to
a new Apple watch which is series 2 the
fact that it's now got better
specifications I think the hottest news
today in addition to the new hardware
was the fact that Super Mario Brothers
is reaching iOS very soon and
exclusively which leads me to the
question of today out of everything that
was announced today what do you think
about these products which one are you
looking out for the most iphone 7 iphone
7 plus then they watch Apple watch sorry
