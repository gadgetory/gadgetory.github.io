larger iPad the whole HTC anasuya steel
might not be as close as you think and
Samsung takes a new dive this time and
with the SmartWatch market I'm hi Mary
then I'm back in the old studio and
ready for action this is pocket out
daily we've had a ton of official news
today so let's begin with HTC in that
hole assu steel if you are worried about
the company being bought by a shoes
turns out that HTC just came on record
to confirm that no it's not even looking
for a buyer which makes a lot of sense
since a cher Wang has a lot of wealth
and Taiwan and her father even more so
clearly HTC is planning to turn things
around we just don't know how or when
other official news have Apple as
they've confirmed how much money they're
paying record labels you thought that
they were getting a sweeter deal than
Spotify it's the other way around
they're paying 70 one-point-six percent
of revenues to record labels which is
interesting though up there's a catch
obviously record labels will not make
any money from that three-month trial
and I guess they sweeten the pot with
that full 71.6 percent which is actually
above what Spotify and the rest of the
industry pays and given the fact that
Spotify is offering a freemium model
that's not necessarily offering a lot of
money through the app based system we
wonder what'll happen going forward
there seems to be some hardware changes
with windows 10 coming up as toshiba's
just confirm that they are offering
Cortana button the top left up the
keyboard to make the experience easier
we're not sure if this is a Microsoft
requirement or this is just a Shiva's
way of doing things but it's cool it's
an idea that should be implemented by
other hardware manufacturers and that
will most likely be the way toshiba
innovates a lot and then others follow
us who we get and speaking of keyboards
a very trusted iOS developer has just
published what happens when you expand
the keyboard of the iPad on iOS 9
meaning if you have a larger canvas and
the one offered by the 9.7 inch iPad you
get other keys available and it keeps
expanding it offers you a chiclet style
key line at the top with the symbols and
everything making interactions easier if
you're wondering exactly what the point
of all this
is well it's because we're thinking the
ipad pro will use this new keyboard and
iOS 9 is hinting everything at least
that's what the rumor points links to
the description to see more details on
what you're getting and finally for the
very interesting news of the day if you
thought that Samsung being the pioneer
of smartwatches would be at the top of
the market share list it's actually the
other way around we're seeing some
statistic that shows the company owning
forty-eight percent of the market before
Android wear after Android wear it then
q1 of this year they barely own twenty
one percent and we have no clue how
things are going with the Apple watch
and the fact that we haven't seen gear
smartwatches only android wear offerings
lately does make a skeptical over what
Samsung is doing and obviously we have
project Orbis coming that'll probably
change everything for the company but
you know the fact that it's not going to
happen until Aoife that does lead me to
the question of the day if you had the
money right now what SmartWatch would
you buy you can't say nun you have to at
least pick one which one would you pick
in my case huh that is a very good
question i would go back to buying the
Moto 360 again oddly but leave us a
comment down below what is your case and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get it was earlier before this
video's filmer chief Oh wasn't fucking
out comment subscribe to youtube channel
as well in follow me on twitter
highlanders go to be better please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am hi I'm Eddie Vetter thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
