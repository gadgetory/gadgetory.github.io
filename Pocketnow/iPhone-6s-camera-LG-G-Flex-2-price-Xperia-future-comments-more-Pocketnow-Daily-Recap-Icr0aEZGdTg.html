you're apparently right even Michael
Fisher cannot pronounce your name right
I know I'm gonna start calling him
Miguel fiscal order your new name is
Batman and I'm not the one wearing
hockey pants that's right it's that time
of the week I am hi meri behna this is
pocket now and this is the pocket now
daily recap for last week so on Monday I
asked you at the LG G flex 2 is your
next smartphone we were looking at the
price tags and they are extremely
competitive we have 524 comments out of
which coo chic says no hi man actually
I'm not a fan of the g flex at all specs
or pump but i still don't like the curvy
looks I'll wait for the HTC hema AKA m9
i am expecting more from the m9 this
year hope for the best i guess you two
are waiting for it have a great day hi
men have a great day too i am actually
waiting for the HTC m9 but then again
the G flex 2 is probably one of the best
looking smartphones I've ever seen
regardless of the specs so I am
definitely considering it but Ryan says
I don't think the LG G flex is too hot
battery life is the biggest concern in
three thousand million powers it's too
little for power users like me blue
three thousand million powers is
actually a very big battery for a 5.5
inch display and in that same vein LG is
probably one of the best companies
dealing with battery life lately so I
think it's worth giving it a try then
Melissa Steven says i love my g3 and I'm
thinking this would be a nice logical
step up can't wait and love the red
although I'm not sure t-mobile won't
supply it hmm I don't like the g3 that
much glad you do I don't know I'm not a
really big fan of that display
particularly not just the over
sharpening of the display but the
sensitivity of the display just seems
off and I didn't feel these problems
with the G flex 2 so I am feeling that
this is not just the logical step up but
definitely a better phone than the g3 so
yeah I agree with you but yeah t-mobile
and colors they don't really match that
well but on Tuesday asks you if you
think that the given apples track record
would it be logical for the company to
bring a major design
to the iphone 6s coming later this year
given the recent rumors that Apple is
experimenting with dual cameras we have
436 comments out of which all e says
iphone 6s the S stands for the same s
and I agree with you it's been the same
case every single time then another
cometer says the success will be nothing
but a minor spec upgrades if Apple was
to do drastic changes to the iphone then
people would feel they were getting
cheated with just a few months of owning
an iphone 6 and 6 plus respectively you
make a major point yes a lot of people
don't like that Apple does that six
success thing or 5 5's thing but it's
worked so well for Apple that they're
selling iphones like hotcakes people
don't seem to like for redesign cycles
to go beyond that second year mainly
because they're stuck on a two-year
contract it makes sense the news a lot
of those says Apple is so innovative
can't wait to have my mind blown last
year i sold my house to get a 6 plus
this time my kidney should be enough i
guess now i think you're gonna need your
lungs as well but on Wednesday ask you
if you would like for Sony to sell off
the Xperia division as the rumors are
that the company is considering selling
it off in order to bring itself some
revival economically we have 879
comments out of which joshua kelly says
what if google bought the Xperia brand
the Nexus Xperia compact would be
amazing it would as long as Google would
do a much better job at selling it sadly
Google does a terrible job with the
Nexus lineup in meeting demand and it's
not like if they sell a great amount of
Spahn so yet would be a good idea but
that again even though they did bring a
lot of innovation to Motorola they
didn't sell well so I don't think Google
would probably be the best company my
opinion though and Joey Jordison you
brand I think would be very
disappointing that's a great device
that's a few tricks from being the top
android device for starters the display
so he needs to make that display just
wicked sick then just make it the next
google nexus for more publicity hmm
xperia smartphones ever since the xperia
z1 not the z the z
one had great displays it's been that
way every year ever since then again the
whole Nexus idea is a good idea but then
again we didn't have any success with
the whole will play edition of that
Xperia humongous phablet I didn't forget
the name because it was just so bad but
then again I think it was the product
then the whole google concept of the
google play edition so yeah it could be
a good idea and i think that a
waterproof Nexus would just be amazing
on Jennifer P says when i bought the
sony ericsson xperia arc s four years
ago they decided to leave ericsson now i
bought the xperia z3 compact and sony
wants to sell the Xperia line the hell I
hope it won't affect the updates and
support like it has been in the past I
think it's a pretty bad idea they're
constantly getting better but now they
suddenly want to stop I do agree with
your point Sony sold off or bought off
its Ericsson and the company made a
dramatic revamp to becoming the smart
phone company that we wanted great
designs great software experiences and
great software updates that was
definitely not the sony ericsson of the
past so yeah selling it off but leave a
lot of customers that are starting to
have faith and Sony you know in dire
straits it would be great for Sony to
just hold off like HTC is doing but then
again HCC only sells phones and Sony
sells everything else so it's really
hard for a company this broad to just
say oh we're gonna bleed money here and
not do anything about it it's just the
way these corporations work then on
Thursday I asked you would you like for
samsung to acquire blackberry er what do
you think as the reports were back then
attention was considering it even though
eventually we learned that the company
won't we have 435 comments out of which
Eric lang says blackberry blackberries
are great they are stuck in the past and
have lack of partners and funding
someone just needs to save them like
Samsung or insert OEM the question is
say what first of all I was a big fan of
blackberry years ago in the time of the
Pearl I love their designs and there you
I've and though a little dated it was
extremely fluid very practical the
problem is
they have not of all and the company
needs to you think that people are
diehard keyboard fans now but the
problem is a software keyboards have
become much better than hardware one
that's really the problem they need to
evolve and they need to implement
something better I'm necessarily stuck
in the past my opinion though that
Michael Jimenez says before the iPhone
Blackberry was the best of smartphones
after Android came in i phone was still
ahead but now most people prefer Android
what would save blackberry making an
android phone will save them selling to
samsung won't hmm good idea a blackberry
design running Android but could be a
good idea who knows an airy says there
is no way that BB OS or TouchWiz worked
fine they both suck so I don't care
fanboys click reply um yes TouchWiz BB
OS that would be a bad combination
indeed and then friday i asked you how
important our fingerprint scanners to
you as the rumors are that samson get
experimenting with a better fingerprint
scanner than the one we have on the
galaxy s5 but looks a lot like what we
have with touch ID on Apple's iOS
devices we have 106 comments out of
which hasanul e says not really I just
want a fast and easy way to unlock my
phone so things like the nut code would
work too hmm I'm not gonna agree I have
the LG g3 then our code requires four
different tabs and in the case of the i
phone you press a button and then unlock
your phone that's it and Chris armita
says no don't need fingerprint scanner
on my phone I usually don't keep any
sort of lock on my phone I've got
nothing to hide if it were to be stolen
I can wipe it and track it down hmm if
the burglar removes the sim card then no
you won't be able to wipe it and track
it down I don't know for me it's not
just about security you make a really
good point true some people don't really
care about that but for me it's just the
fact that slide to unlock and requires
you to press the power button then slide
to unlock when fingerprint scanners you
just press a button and unlocks the
phone it's just so simple that it makes
even slide to unlock look obsolete and
really it makes sense if you think about
it it just saves you time then
doula says the galaxy s5 plus no for
fingerprint scanner is the worst
honestly I would just stick to a regular
pin or password because that is more
convenient it would be interesting to
see how they fix these issues on the
Galaxy s6 you make a good point true
fingerprint scanners are cool as long as
they work Samsung has not figured it out
Apple has so hopefully yes OEMs will
because again it is more convenient it
brings you added security and have done
right it is quicker than sliding to
unlock but I don't know leave us a
comment down below what do you think
that is it for our pocket out daily
