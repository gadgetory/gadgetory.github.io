Apple's iPad air a lot of people still
ask as if this tablet is worth the money
because being the most popular tablet
doesn't necessarily mean that it's the
best one so we decided to revisit it
after a couple of weeks of use and hear
our thoughts I'm high memory better this
is PocketNow
and these are the things we love about
the iPad air and the things that we
think Apple should fix for the next
generation iPad air one of the things we
love the most about the iPad air is that
it's probably one of the most powerful
tablets out there for what it can do
notice the disclaimer the reason why I
say that is because obviously this is
just the bloated smartphone it carries a
mobile operating system and a mobile
chipset that can run mobile applications
on a big display and speaking of that if
we focus on that which is pretty much
the mainstream of tablets this is pretty
much the tablet it does it best it
doesn't matter what application you
throw at it it doesn't matter what game
you throw at it it pretty much launches
everything perfectly and it does an
amazing job at playing either multimedia
or whatever productivity application is
available for the mobile space so yeah
out of the mobile tablets out there it
is probably one of the best ones when it
comes to more bang for your buck if you
think about it and speaking of those
mobile applications again the iPad has
the best mobile selection of
applications out there there's just no
way around it if you want to do Twitter
experience you need an iPad don't get an
Android tablet unless it's a Samsung
Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 and that's really
the problem with Android it's a lot of
bloated applications that were not
designed for tablets and when it comes
to the iPad there's just no way around
it Apple has done a great job with
developers and making them adopt the
iPad and therefore there are hundreds of
thousands of applications that take
advantage of it
and pretty much almost every application
that you buy for an iPhone has an iPad
version that's free so most of the time
whenever you buy an iPhone you have the
advantage that the iPad will also take
advantage of these app selections and
that goes to the third thing that we
love about the iPad air and pretty much
every iPad the fact that there is a
benefit in owning an iPad if you're an
iPhone owner or if you're an Apple TV
owner meaning it integrates perfectly
with these products and almost
everything again that you purchase for
the phone is available for the tablet in
most cases so you do have benefits and
owning iPads and
phones whereas if you buy for example
the Sony smartphones there are really no
benefits if you buy a Sony Tablet most
of the applications are not designed for
it or the services that work on the
phone don't work on the tablet or in the
case for example of set-top boxes unless
you own a chromecast you really don't
have any benefits and owning a Sony TV
and a Sony Tablet whereas Apple has a
different mentality when approaching
their products now obviously there is no
such thing as a perfect product and
there is no such thing as a perfect
tablet so let's go through the things
that we don't like about the iPad air
number one is the storage model $500 for
a 16 gig tablet is too much money 1 and
16 gigs is too little for a tablet a
multimedia product specifically it
doesn't have any expandable storage and
then you have this problem where
applications have been bloated after the
whole grete display iPad was launched so
when you think about it but what's the
point about having this beautiful tablet
with a beautiful design and all this
horsepower
if 16 gigs is pretty much just a couple
of games and not a movie no music it'll
not help you with a lot of the things
that you want for 16 gigs and so
therefore you're forced to go to 32 gigs
or 64 gigs and that really makes the
iPad air very expensive another thing
that we do not like about the iPad air
is more specifically iOS 7 it seems that
Apple just push this out of the blue
because they have to push it out but
they weren't really ready to push it for
tablets iOS 7 looks good on the iPhone
but when you bring it to the tablet
experience it seems that everything is
blowing like for example the calendar
application when you think of the iPad
before it was a different experience to
what you had on the phone but now
everything is just loaded and different
it doesn't seem any better so it seems
that Apple really needs to go back to
the drawing board and doing what they
asked developers to do and it is to
enhance the experience for tablets when
it comes to their own operating system
the third thing that we do not like
about the iPad air is really this big
display that's not being used for more
than launching one application there is
no such thing as multi window support
and the time so we have Windows 8 doing
this and at times what we have Samsung
tablets doing this as well you wonder
why we do not have multi window support
on this tablet really if you want to be
productive on a tablet you need to this
canvas to be more useful and just to
give you a bloated version
of applications it really is not for
productivity whatsoever and that's
really one of the biggest problems with
Apple's tablets the fact that they were
just designed for content consumption
and they were not designed to actually
allow you to do work and a lot of people
buy tablets and they buy iPads with the
mentality that they could use them for
work and family they're not really for
that and then finally let's talk about
one of the things that we are mixed and
I'm talking about all the editors that
actually have an iPad air what things
are we mixed what things do we like and
what things we don't we're gonna talk
about design some people like it for
example Taylor likes it and then Brandon
feels that it's too heavy even for the
fact that we're calling it the iPad air
in my particular case I do love to build
quality of any iPad pretty much almost
every iPad looks great and the display
is great even though Brandon doesn't
really like the in cell technology on
the display Taylor likes it in my
particular case I do like the display I
do like the design I do feel that it's
the best looking tablet in the market so
then again that leads me to the question
of the day how do you feel about the
iPad air do you feel that it's worth the
money have you bought it do you like it
leave us a comment down below because in
my particular case again I do like it
but not every one of the editors does
that's it for the things we love and
hate about the iPad air after a couple
of weeks of use make sure you leave your
comments down below with your thoughts
