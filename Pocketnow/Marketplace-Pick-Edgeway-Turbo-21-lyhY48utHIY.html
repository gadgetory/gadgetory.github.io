parking calm and today miss you edge way
turbo 21 and it's kind of like playing
for blackjack games at once and will
help you increase your speed of adding
up to 21 and your proficiency at playing
blackjack so we're going to start a new
game right here and as you see we have a
timer that says 180 seconds and that's
how long we get until we can finish
playing the game so what we do is we
select with these cards one of the slots
and so as you see i have a king here so
that's 10 of course we add this one here
move that 10 there let's say you want to
put this 3 over here so now we have 13
let's see 16 so try this one 19 wait for
our 20 there's 21 so now we can move
this one here so we start with 6 let's
try this one here and then we have 20 so
now we have six so we can add nine so
now we have 15 if I put it there it's
going to bust any one of these will bust
I have to move this ten here if at any
point I want to skip I all I have to
just click on this card it will move the
next card so let's see i have 15 so
let's try this one here and move this
queen here and now we have our two so
the only place I can put this one is
right here try this one again oh of
course I busted on that one and I can
start in the four and we'll put a jack
there and a so you put it in one of
these ones it will make it 21 there we
go so we're going to move the jack here
and a so that's going to equal blackjack
with the King here let's see have
another five so well here 19 move this
one here so now we have 19 again on that
one now as you see I can't put this in
any one of these positions or else I'll
bus so I have to go here and
unfortunately it moves 10 from my score
so it removes 10 from thats course now I
have another eight so we'll need to go
again and it's going to move my score
down even further because i still need
other cards let's see put that one here
oh it busted on that one okay so as you
see so as you see the game is pretty
fast
paste course on going a little slow
talking on this video but after a few
minutes you will become very proficient
in adding up to 21 on these cards so
when you've finished with the deck will
actually load a new deck and the next
level can be unlocked when you've
reached a score of at least 500 so if at
any time you need instructions to play
the game all you have to do is click
this link right here and it will give
you a detailed description of how to
play the game so we can close that you
can also review high scores of course
there's nothing in here right now
because they haven't played it that much
and this is another marketplace pick in
the program is called edge way turbo 21
and it was one dollar ninety-nine cents
on windows mobile marketplace thanks for
