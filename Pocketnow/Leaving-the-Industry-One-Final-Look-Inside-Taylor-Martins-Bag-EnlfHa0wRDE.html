last day with pocket now I'm leaving the
mobile industry but I will be taking
some of my gear with me for months many
of you have been asking about the
devices i use and what i have installed
on them what's in my bag as i leave the
industry for the last time I'm Taylor
Martin with pocket now and this is
what's in my bag it seems like it was
just last week but back in May I
detailed what gear I carried in my bag
each day since much of it is still the
same and will remain the same I won't go
through all the intricate details again
but I will hit the highlights and talk
more about what has changed a link to
the original what's in my bag piece can
be found in the description below to
start the bag I carry almost everywhere
I go is the book bow a shift bag it's a
little on the expensive side but it's
worth every penny with a native lost and
found tracking system called terror link
and some of the best build quality I've
ever seen in a bag it's comfortable and
has a snake Joe like hinge hence the
name to easily access everything in the
giant single pocket it has tons of flaps
folders and pockets for organization and
I always know where everything is in the
bag it's an awesome bag with tons of
padding and a very rigid design but I
guess it's what's in the bag that you
care about most first cables lots and
lots of cables I have the Nomad charge
key in a similar micro USB cable for
quickly snapping charging cables on my
keyring have long and short microUSB
cables and a USB 3.0 cable for my 1.5
terabyte sorting hard drive also i have
several chargers have a motorola to USB
AC adapter in a six pork shark USB
charger for keeping all my mobile
devices charged as well as a few power
packs to choose from like the dark
energy reservoir and an ex storm 4000
and i have a two USB port three plug
phillips surge protector I never leave
home without i also have a macbook pro
power block with an extension cable that
never leaves my bag yeah if you couldn't
tell i don't like my devices to die ever
it's a pain to keep all those cables
organized though so I also keep about a
bajillion cable ties on hand just in
case as for headphones lately I've been
using the Nokia purity pro wireless
active noise-cancelling over the ear
headphones some Huawei active noise
canceling earbuds and I have some bows
mie too is that I always leave in my bag
there are other odds and ends I also
leave in my bag like the Gerber dice
multi-tool and mini screwdriver set pins
for whatever reason and sim adapters
most of my devices have remained the
same since May I still use the 2013
macbook pro with retina though it has a
few more stickers than last time and
still have the sony nex-5n for stills
end video the HTC One m8 on t-mobile
though i briefly switch to the google
play edition z ultra until I broke it
and i still have the ipad mini which i
use with the zaggkeys cover and i
upgraded the iphone 5 on verizon to a 64
gigabyte iphone six-plus and that just
about does it for all the gear in my bag
but I've also received a ton of
questions about what apps are on my
devices that could warn an entire video
for each device but I'll do my best to
keep it short I use many of the same
apps on both iOS and Android and on
phones and tablets like our do for music
streaming all fief or two factor
authentication last pass for managing my
passwords Evernote sunrise todoist vseo
camera hangouts mailbox copy if this
than that feedly pocket pocket cast
which buffer and SoundCloud I know it's
a lot on Android I prefer Phoenix for
Twitter and reddit sync pro for browsing
reddit and on iOS tweet but is my go-to
twitter client and alien blue the now
official client is my preferred way to
browse reddit and some other apps worth
mentioning our tap path and Link bubble
from chris lacy on Android product hunt
and reader 2 on iOS finally if you want
awesome games to check out give a loan
and Monument Valley on either platformer
look and roid rage on Android for some
great casual gaming sadly that's going
