prototypes being tested at the moment
Sampson begins pushing the bar with
software updates though in a very weird
way and cyber monday being upon us
doesn't mean deals won't last longer I'm
hi Marilee than and about the only cyber
monday deal that I have to deal with is
editing this video this is pocket out
daily official news today begin with the
cyber monday deals that you can still
take advantage of s they will continue
particularly with Amazon starting with
the Moto Z believe it or not if you go
for the 64 gigabyte variant you can get
it for two hundred dollars off making it
even less expensive than the regular
variant in addition to that you can also
find deals on garmin fitbit as well and
the list just goes on you can learn more
in the description and if you're curious
over how black friday went this is
rather interesting we've got some
statistics over the amount of purchases
made during black friday alone 3.4
billion dollars in the US but probably
the coolest part of the statistic is
that almost half that 1.2 billion
dollars was consumed using mobile
applications either mobile stores or
sometimes mobile applications as well
meaning buying mobile applications so it
does prove that the market is growing
into more and more of a mobile spec
let's see if it continues or when it
will level out now one deal you should
probably consider is a google play music
as google is yet again offering four
months completely free of a trial and in
addition to that it's also bundling a
subscription to youtube bread if you
want to give that a try and it just
proves just how bad it's going for
google play music if anything i would be
compelled to give it a try for youtube
bread and not for the music but anyways
you can learn more about what you have
to do in the description as well as well
the spotlight over to samsung and
something the company doesn't do right
which is called software updates we have
got some very interesting reports that
claim that certain users from the galaxy
note5 are already getting the grace view
x and that you x is probably my favorite
from the launch of the galaxy note 7
that is no more we've been waiting for
that to reach the galaxy s7 edge and
galaxy s7 but no the note 5 gets it
first and then every other device can
probably try nougat on these 7 devices
if you go for the beta and finally the
very interesting news do they have to do
with the iphone 8 and the rumors that
Apple is testing up to 10 prototypes of
this phone it's ten years of iphone and
definitely i'm sure the Cupertino wants
to get this one right but Apple has
always been famous for prototyping for
testing different devices that come
pretty much can build whatever it wants
in cupertino campus it's got everything
it needs for that and that's really cool
we hear that one of these variants
brings a curved OLED display which is
great but it leads me to the question of
the day if you want to sit down right
now and define what things you would
want to see from the next generation
iphone for you to want to buy them what
would these be in my case I won't lie
i'm actually going back to the galaxy s7
edge right now for a little video that
we're working on and yeah curved
displays I love him leave us a comment
down below we left to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video was filmed fellow was not backing
out are calm and hit that subscribe
button down below for more videos like
this one you can also follow me on
Twitter I'm underscoring that I run
Instagram it hi Mel iveta please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am high metally that I think
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
