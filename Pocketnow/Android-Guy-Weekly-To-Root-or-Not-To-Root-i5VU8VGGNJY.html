is it why do we need it and do we still
need it that's what we're gonna talk
about today on the Android guy weekly so
a couple topics
what is root what is super user and
something interesting that will save for
the end all right
what is root little root no we're not
talking about plans root is the ability
to run programs with low level
permissions basically you're running all
the way down you can do anything you
want install system files modify system
files delete system files
that's route now root doesn't operate
like you think it will unless you have a
user who can and who can basically take
advantage of the root level permissions
and that user is called super user so
behind me I've got a desktop computer
it's running Windows 7 and it comes
rooted out of the box or rather it's not
protected from being able to run root
level stuff Mac same thing now both Mac
and Windows and Linux 2 a little bit
different extent they all have the
ability to control what the user by user
I mean the logged in person not
necessarily the person at the keyboard
but the person who's logged in has the
ability to do now that in Windows is
called UAC
user account control or user access
control so I'm logged in as a
administrator so I have super user
rights my machine is already rooted if I
wanted to I could download and install a
virus I could download and install a
word processor and to the computer
there's really no difference
it's executable code one lets me write
you know the next great novel the other
lets people steal my bank account stuff
you're not getting much though just FYI
the same permissions and it's not cool
same on Macs and Windows not no the only
people in the game that are at risk
smartphones and tablets on the other
hand they don't give you root
yes and it's not just for this reason
they let you run only as a user not as
an administrator or a super user because
of that you're not able to do a lot of
stuff in the past you haven't been able
to say turn on the flash on your camera
and turn your phone into a flashlight
when you need it or turn on the flash on
your camera and be able to scan that
barcode in the dark or in low-light
because well you're not using the stock
built-in camera that has direct access
to those levels of things hey you do now
on Android because Google opened up an
API AHA api's that's a hint at what
we're gonna talk about later okay
what else I just got a tablet and for
some reason it would not keep time I
don't know why so I downloaded an app
that lets me synchronize the time with a
time server on the Internet great except
it requires route why is that well it
actually will operate in two different
functions one is if you don't have route
it will tell you here's the current time
now go change your clock manually okay
and the other is hey you've got route
let me go ahead and take care of that
automatically in fact how often do you
want me to check once a day once an hour
whatever it'll do it automatically
because it has root access now same
thing goes if I downloaded a virus for
example it could do all kinds of
malicious stuff by having access to root
so root and super user go hand-in-hand
administrator privileges and whatnot may
not be a good thing on a cell phone
because let's face it most people out
there aren't system administrators I
happen to be one for my day job and so
maybe I have a little bit different
perspective than everybody else and need
to be able to do other stuff because I
know what I can do so that may be where
I'm different than a lot of people in
the audience perhaps but I think you
guys out there you're you're a bit more
tech savvy than the average phone user
for example or the average tablet user
you want to do stuff and you know what
you can do and it's just this pesky
root thing that's getting in your way
that's where our little interesting
tidbit comes in and it's really the
topic of our video Steve Kondik cyanogen
you may know him as the guy behind
CyanogenMod recently posted just kind of
a thought what do you guys think about
taking out root whoa Steve what are you
talking about you've lived on root but
his thought was instead of having root
instead of requiring CyanogenMod to have
root to be able to run and do its
regular daily activities instead we've
got complete access to the source code
of this operating system and all the
stuff in the kernel why not write API
s-- api's our application programming
interfaces essentially they're hooks you
can say hey camera please turn on your
light and if your camera has a light
it'll say okay and it'll do it and it
will return back through the API okay I
did it my light is on and then you can
say okay camera turn off your light and
camera will through this API turn off
the light and respond back okay light is
off same thing with the clock same thing
with you know whatever you want to think
about exposing these api's lets you talk
through you know the system utilities
which need to have route like access
already and get them to do stuff and
that stuff is already predetermined
there's security put in place through
the API itself but you don't have to
have root to be able to do it you don't
have to elevate to super user to be able
to do this stuff really really cool so
Steve's concept was instead of requiring
that we have root and opening the door
up for malicious opportu be able to take
advantage of that fact let's go ahead
and scale back so we don't have to have
root to be able to run the core
functionality of CyanogenMod roms
instead let's write those api's so apps
can talk to the system utilities rather
than directly to the hardware or however
else they're getting it done
lots of way to do it no he did put in a
little caveat he said now no I'm not
trying to say we're taking away Route
forever and we shouldn't do that people
will still be able to route and run
routed stuff like normal what he's
saying is what do you think about
pulling out that requirement so you can
do all of that cool stuff without it and
really he's in the unique situation
unlike Windows if windows were to turn
off route altogether oh my goodness we
would be in a terrible terrible
situation because we can do most of the
stuff and the only people that could fix
that would be Microsoft same thing goes
with Apple they turn that off on Mac
only Apple could expose those api's and
make it work Android the source is out
there it's open we can literally write
those api's and do it ourselves and as
long as we're not opening up security
holes there it's probably a very very
good thing but that leads us into a
little bit of a quandary and we'll just
sum up on this in order to install
CyanogenMod I have to root my phone
install a custom boot loader or a custom
recovery and try to flash the ROM I'm
rooted to be able to do that
now we're talking about Unruh ting
potentially or are we talking about oh
maybe having some manufacturer out there
pick up CyanogenMod as the stock rom
wouldn't that be cool so that's our
topic what do you think do you think
that route is too much that we don't
need it and we should replace it with
api's what problems is that going to
bring up or what problems is that going
to solve comment down below and let us
know do you think that well CyanogenMod
might show up on a big brand name major
OEMs Tanuja may be CyanogenMod 10 I
don't know but wouldn't that be cool go
ahead and let us know your opinion on
that down in the comments below as well
if you liked the video of course give it
a big thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
done so already so you don't miss out on
next week's episode of the Android guy
weekly and head on over to pocketnow.com
so you can check out views hacks tips
tricks well all kinds of stuff and not
just on Android we cover almost
everything head on over there the
