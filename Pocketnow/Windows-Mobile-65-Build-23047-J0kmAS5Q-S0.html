pocket now calm and in this video we're
taking a look at the latest windows
mobile 6.5 build that is 2304 seven last
time we looked at 20 30 37 and there
have been some changes they're not huge
but they really led to a nicer visual
experience and kind of gives us an idea
of where microsoft is going with this
interim build of windows mobile that's
so mysterious so as we can see this is
the same screen we're looking at right
now and the little carousel the pivot at
the top is much smoother in the newer
version it's much more refined it's not
as crappy looking as it was in the
previous version and of course you can
swipe your finger to sort of move it
from side to side got the big menu
coming up here and also you can make the
swype anywhere on the page although you
could do that in the previous build of
windows mobile too so let's click on OK
and go back now something else that is
different in this new build is that the
bottom button that says back is actually
a back arrow now so it looks like
Microsoft is really trying to remove all
the text from the bottom bar let's go
into something like calendar and see if
we've got any any text in there
yeah the same thing applies here so in
the older 20 30 37 it says day and menu
but here in 24 0 37 we get an actual
little icon that Lao allows us to jump
from the view to view or go right into
the menu so we're going to have a lot of
buttons down here it looks like up to 5
soft keys at a time in this interim
build of windows mobile which is good
and it's bad it's good because all the
buttons are consolidated in one area
it's bad because it kind of gets a
little cluttered at times something else
that is different that we can see from
here is that the menu has been
consolidated a lot and it's really
cleaned up a lot no longer do we have
the grayed out items they've just taken
them away so that you get you get a
nicer view of just the items that you
can actually action on it kind of
doesn't make sense to have great out
items when you have to flick through a
massive list and you're on a mobile
phone you're trying to be productive but
it looks like they're trending towards
cutting out all of the stuff that you
can't actually use and of course if we
go into tools and options we see again
that pivot list and we see a nicer way
of having these drop-down menus versus
how it looked before now it's a little
more cleaned up and you can select it a
little bit more nicely so that was a
quick look at windows mobile 6.5 build
24 0 37 it looks like the builds are
evolving very slowly at this point but
with each incremental upgrade we're
getting sort of Microsoft's vision of
where Windows Mobile is going after 6.5
so keep a close eye on the next
evolution of windows mobile 6.5 to find
out when the next build is out follow us
