third iphone7 model just got shot down
Samsung's plans for going beyond gear VR
just kinda got revealed and Microsoft
doesn't seem to be celebrating it's
terrible results in Mobile I'm Jaime
Rivera and if Tuesday's were in any way
supposed to be motivational I'm still
not getting the joke this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin sort
of with deals if you are in the market
for a very good smartphone that's very
well designed and that also includes an
extra package the Alcatel Idol for
continues to be one of our favorite
devices it's currently an exclusive on
cricket which is AT&amp;amp;T subsidiary for two
hundred dollars and it includes the VR
headset yeah I wouldn't be waiting here
I'd definitely consider it
for that price specifically other
official news confirm Microsoft the
company has celebrated a couple of
quarters but this one was not that well
and 7% down when it comes to revenue 38
percent up in profits it's expected as
the company has downsized a little but
that downsizing hasn't really played
well the company is 71 percent town and
revenue in the mobile division I didn't
get that number wrong 71 percent is
terrible the Lumia 950 and the 950 Excel
have definitely proven to be terrible
smartphones and we cannot wait to figure
out what is ever going to happen with
Windows 10 mobile they're very
interesting rumors today have to do with
the recent prototype that was leaked at
the Galaxy Note 7 in its flat display
not the edge we've been covering rumors
of a device that has a flat display with
lesser specification something to be
expected but the very interesting part
is that the tipster apparently claims
that this prototype will not make the
light of day so what's the point of the
whole leak we're still scratching our
heads here
now speaking of Samsung we have heard
that the company has plans to go
standalone VR not like the current gear
VR experience that we have that's not
necessarily bad but not compared in any
way to what we get with the HTC vive and
as HTC has just created the live
corporation we hear that Sam Saenz
plants will be called the Samsung
Odyssey
apparently this is gonna be the company
standalone headset we wonder if it'll
compete as a separate company with HTC
or what the plan will be but obviously
given the fact that Samsung and oculus
kind of work together let's see what we
get finally the very hot minutes that
they have to do with the iPhone 7 the
hot news yesterday were that we had
three iPhones to wait the iPhone pro
iphone 7 plus and iPhone 7 but today a
famous tipster Evan Blastoise came on
record confirming that we aren't only
getting two phones
what does codenames sonoda or fine
sonora if you want me to pronounce it in
English and those Polo's or those Polo's
and to think about those follows as it
means two sticks in Spanish so we wonder
if this pretty much points to the dual
camera of the iphone 7 pro meaning that
apparently that Pro models making it and
the iPhone 7 and that plus variant in
the middle that we saw is apparently not
going to happen which leads me to the
question of the day would you mind of
Apple only launched two iPhones and out
of these you don't really get the option
for the phablet that is really just a
larger iPhone in my case I really don't
i think that the iphone 6s plus and all
the previous plus variants have been too
expensive for what you're really getting
I would rather get a pro variant that
actually brains innovative features like
the dual camera and that smart connector
for whatever it'll be but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
