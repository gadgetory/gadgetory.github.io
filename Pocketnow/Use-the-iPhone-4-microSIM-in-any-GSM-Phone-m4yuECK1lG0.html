pocketnow.com so you've got the new
iphone 4 which uses the new micro sim
card format and what if you want to go
back to your old phone or buy a new
phone that is unlocked like the google
nexus one well you obviously can't put
the micro sim inside of the sim card
slot of a google nexus one or an older
device because the iphone 4 is the only
phone to use micro sim so what do you do
well you get an adapter this video I'm
going to show you how it works okay so
here I bought an adapter off of ebay and
i'll put a link in the sidebar over in
the description it's very small there's
only six dollars and fifty cents but hey
it works quite well you quite simply put
the micro sim inside of the sim card
adapter and let's see if this works so
but take off the back of the google
nexus one pop out the battery and you
could be doing likewise with any
unlocked gsm phone or your old device
and now it takes a little bit of
finagling because this adapter is
actually a little bit thicker than the
standard sim card so it's going to take
me a second to just get the right angle
okay I've got it in got to push it kind
of hard it feels like it's going to
break but it's not I've actually tried
this a couple of times so I'm going to
put the the back battery cover back in
and put the backing on and let's see the
the signal and just double-check that
we're getting internet coming from the
iphone 4 and we're back we have the
micro sim with the adapter inside the
google nexus one coming right from an
AT&amp;amp;T iphone plan and as you can see we
have four bars and just switch to 3g
let's jump into the web browser just
double check that we are getting
internet even though this is not an
iphone this is a nexus one obviously
let's see there it is the internet's
coming through just as fast as it would
if you were using a standard sim card so
again i'll put a link in the sidebar if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and i think this is a tool
that everyone should have if you plan on
switching phones at all it's good to
have the adapter that lets you go from
micro sim to sim that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
