it safe ensuring essentials in design
the bullet pixel to is reportedly making
a jump of some basics for its price tag
and the front of the galaxy s eight will
change as much as it won't change I'm
high never leave it and I would scream
from the top of my lungs yes it's the
weekend if I didn't have to edit yet
another video this is pocket now exactly
the official news today begin again with
deals if you want to get yourself a moto
Z or moto z-force I highly suggest you
ignore certain of the deal to verizon
and go to B&amp;amp;H you will be getting four
hundred dollars off but there's a catch
well because you're pretty much almost
paying the same price for the foam the
difference is you're getting a hassle
Vlad moto mod so we don't really
recommend that has a la moto mod much
for its photo quality but it offers the
best optical zoom you can get for
modular things so yeah that's an option
and since Google makes a big deal out of
the speed at which you browse the
company is pushing out an update to its
Chrome browser it's happening both on
the desktop and on mobile and literally
it's fifty percent faster the company
isn't outing that exactly but from the
examples that we've seen on video it is
dramatically speedier so download the
update whenever you get it and yeah it's
great I want to spotlight over into the
smartphone that has not left the parking
out daily for weeks now the galaxy s 8
we are close to it bear with us here
it's probably the hottest news out there
right now that it's design is
revolutionary when it comes to screen to
body ratio but for those of you that
thought that the home button was just
the only thing that was moving to the
back well the Samsung logo is fairly not
going anywhere according to evan blass
and we do trust evan blaz in his leaks
so the Samsung logo is going to be at
the front but apparently the navigation
buttons are going away so oh well I
thought about one of my favorite phones
the Google pixel for those of you that
follow me on instagram and if you
haven't please do you will notice that
the film that I use the most for
photography is the google pixel I cannot
believe how this phone performs
when you don't have the hardware to be
able to do that the software's just
amazing and for those of you that didn't
like the fact that this phone is not
water resistant apparently that is one
of the things that will change with the
next generation Google pixel when will
it launch we don't know will it be HTC
we don't know but we do want is more
than the IP 53 that we currently get and
finally the most controversial news
today have to do with the LG G 6 why
because we've been able to trust LG for
years and being able to keep certain
essentials like a removable battery
expandable storage etc but we've got
sources that are claiming that
apparently the company wants to bring us
a water resistance and for that water
resistance to happen it seems that the
company will be ditching the removable
battery and that's a rather interesting
position I don't blame the company and
one thing that I do commend LG for not
necessarily for how long battery is left
on these phones ever since the g2 sadly
but the company doesn't amazing Java
dense battery technology hopefully they
can bring that g2 amazing battery life
back into the g6 my god how many
smartphones have happened in between but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day if you have to choose what would
you prefer removable battery or water
resistance believe it or not as much as
I've been complaining throughout this
segment I actually prefer the water
resistance why because i feel that fast
charging has come a long way and even
though i have spare batteries for my g5
or my v20 i rarely use them leave us a
comment down below we look to know your
opinion the frenzied of the way it goes
if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed so what was
our bargain now calm and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one it also follow me

run into the Graham at home it'll be
better please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I am hi
