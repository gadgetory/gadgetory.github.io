aperture 10 megapixel camera with
replaceable lenses I was 7 beta fibers
out and yep it patches your jailbreak
and microsoft names satya nadella as
their new CEO i'm high memory that I and
now that the search is over we can all
go back to LinkedIn and monster guys
this is fucking out daily let's just say
offensive official news as Apple has
just released iOS 7.1 beta farm to
develop wrist which means both good and
bad things on the good side this is
probably one or two releases away from
the official product that you'll be
getting on your phones and tablets so
that's great but on the bad side it does
fully patch of Asian so you will not be
able to jailbreak iOS 7.1 with the
difficult tools obviously it'll take
some time for hackers to figure out
another exploit for this to happen but
so far again stay tuned then you just
remain with iOS 7 point 0 point for ever
you want to keep your jailbreak and now
for some more official news if that's
even believable for us to have two
pieces of official news in one day
google has just launched their red very
ends of the google nexus 5 so it's now
available and it's the same price tag
it's pretty much the same phone only it
has a different color backing which is
great you get it today on the Google
Play Store and obviously there should be
carrier availability eventually but the
interesting part is that we were
expecting different colors of the Nexus
5 and we only get the red one so let's
see how that goes now let's talk about
Samsung as we've got some more pieces of
official news they've just announced
they're unpacked event for mwc 2014 and
this is big there is a number 5 on top
the unpacked so we are expecting the
galaxy s5 to be announced and Tony and I
will be covering mwc live so you can
expect all our full coverage of the
event but even more interesting is that
this is a do update that is kind of
necessary as gizelle is reporting that
people are returning and trading in the
galaxy s4 138 percent more than the
galaxy s3 so people are clearly bored of
the s4 for some reason leave us a
comment down below do you believe its
people getting bored or what now let's
talk about Apple is we get some more
reports of the iphone 6 this time from
taiwanese sources and also Japanese
sources they're talking about the iphone
including an f 1.8 wider aperture for
the next generation iphone aside from
the fact that
won't have these new resin-based
replaceable lenses and it'll be topping
from 10 megapixels up they can't really
confirm if it's 10 megapixels or which
but it's going to be more than 8
megapixels as a lot of people were
worried of no resolution bump on the
next iPhone obviously there is a lot of
time to wait but but the galaxy s5 being
named so early we could probably get
something you know surprising and
finally for the very hot news of the day
Microsoft is just names satya nadella as
their new CEO links in the description
if you want to read his bio and
everything you need to know about this
guy we've even got videos of everything
you can expect from him and they have
also named Bill Gates their founder and
technology advisor by request of Satya
Nadella according to Bill Gates he'll be
spending one-third of his time in
Microsoft now which is more than he was
before and he'll be focusing exclusively
on products which is great news up to
the point where Microsoft is already
down to business they have just nailed
the deal with foursquare 450 million
bucks where they're gonna get exclusive
things from foursquare that you can't
get on any other platform eventually on
Windows Bing and Windows Phone 8.1 so
stay tuned as things are getting hot but
that leaves you to the question of the
day what do you think about this naming
of satya nadella and Bill Gates because
in my particular case I love the fact
that Bill Gates is going to spend more
time I would just like to know more to
see Satya Nadella working leave us a
comment down below are you confident or
not I'm just happy that Ballmer is
retiring and friends you know the drill
