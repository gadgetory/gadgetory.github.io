another couple of months but the
software that launched width is already
available for the masses to try mi out
to Houston with vaca now and let's take
a look at the iOS 9 public beta from the
surface iOS 9 may not look a whole lot
different from iOS 7 or 8 but as it
turns out it brings a whole lot of new
features to the table some of the
biggest changes are made in serie
there's a new glowing bar at the bottom
and the familiar Siri tone has been
replaced with a quick vibration but
aside from the design Siri feels a lot
more contextually aware now you can ask
location-based questions and even things
like show me photos from last Monday the
task switcher is seen a makeover of its
own with a card style of you is similar
to web OS or Windows Phone and it makes
it a little easier to see what's going
on in your apps the keyboard has also
been slightly tweaked finally
differentiating upper and lower case
letters Apple maps now has transit
information at least in select areas and
it's fully integrated with Siri meaning
you can ask for directions via bus or
metro it's also a lot easier to find
places of interest with Apple maps now
with highlights to restaurants services
and more tapping a categories bubble
will expand into more specific options
and every listing is matched with Yelp
ratings when available the Notes app has
been updated to support more input
methods it feels like a much more useful
service now you can add photos from your
gallery as well as capture new ones
directly from the app and you can even
draw memos with your finger you can also
organize your notes into folders now and
there's a recently deleted folder just
in case you change your mind on a
deleted memo
a few settings have been changed as well
the battery section now offers a
low-power mode and a more detailed
breakdown of your battery usage jumping
into photos and camera you can now
manually adjust the resolution of your
videos with the option to bump from the
default 1080p 30 frames per second up to
1080p 60 frames per second in touch ID
and passcode you now have the option for
a six digit pin versus the traditional
four digits for a touch of added
security then there is the news app
which is in itself no just like
Flipboard you select from a number of
genres or even specific sites that you
visit most often and the service curates
your feed to suit your preferences of
course you can still explore other
categories of news as well and finding
exactly the right feed is just a quick
search away of course this is just a
quick hands-on and there are plenty more
features in iOS 9 so go out and download
it for yourself it's easy but before you
go subscribe to pocket now if you want
