just a couple of days away and we've got
a lot to cover here so I'm hi Marietta
from pocketnow.com and these are our top
five predictions of what we expect apple
to announce in their iphone 5 event
number five and of C and the reason why
this is at the bottom of the list is
because some of us believe that it'll
happen and some of us don't apples not
really a fan of dealing with things that
haven't really taken off like for
example NFC but what Apple does do is
grab whatever doesn't work and make
something completely different and try
to make it a market standards so it
could be that Apple will launch
something that looks like NFC but
doesn't work like NFC completely it's
their own new standard that will try to
patent license and then we'll get
something different that works with
passbook their stores let's just see
what they bring number four would be for
Apple to match the current generation
iPad when it comes to specs that would
be the a5x chip and 4G LTE now would be
great of Apple would somehow forget
about the a 5x and bring a real
quad-core processor in more ran to this
next-generation iphone in order for it
not to heat up like the new iPad does
but 4G LTE is a given i wouldn't even
doubt that that will happen number three
a better camera something that 12
megapixels is the mark but others know
that megapixels is in everything the
galaxy s3 has already shown that they
can match the iphone 4s camera when it
comes to quality and then we've got
nokia threatening with their Lumia 920
and it's PureView optical civilizations
so the next generation iphones camera
better bring something that's completely
out of this world different than that
lumia at least number to her and I'm
talking about thinner bigger faster
stronger and just about anything that
rhymes with her and the reason why is
because this device needs to be
completely different a new design as
Apple touts at least to change
everything all over again back in two
thousand seven when Steve Jobs launched
the original iphone he said that it was
at least five years ahead of its time
but those five years are over now this
device needs to be better and cooler it
needs to be different a bigger design
the 3.5 inch display is dated if Apple
doesn't bring a new
signed to the market this year it's
going to be dated now the top number one
prediction that we have for this next
generation iphone is that Apple will
launch it with one more thing and what
we mean by that one more thing is
something unique something that makes it
stand out from the previous models
that's not only designed an example of
that was the iphone 4s well we were
really disappointed of only getting an
iphone 4 with better specs but Apple
launched that would Siri and it did
proof to sell the same thing happened
with the iphone 4 we got a new design
but we also got facetime so the question
is what could this one more thing be so
that would be our question of the day
for you what do you think apple will
bring to the market with this new device
that's completely unique and
uncompetitive a scene in the market
because sadly iOS 6 is not enough so
leave us a comment down below now we'll
be covering everything that has to do
with the iphone 5 as it happens during
the event so make sure you follow was on
pocketnow.com be sure to give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
i'm high metal iveta thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
