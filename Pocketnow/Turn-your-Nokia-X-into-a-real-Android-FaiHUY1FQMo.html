although it's a little bit underpowered
compared to what we've become accustomed
to recently it also has a very
interesting launcher and by interesting
I mean weird what would happen if we
could put a Google experience onto the
Nokia X I'm Joe Levi with PocketNow
today we're going to do just that here's
our dual SIM Nokia X once we turn it on
you can see it's got the traditional
lockscreen on it if we swipe over to the
side though we don't have that really
weird launcher anymore instead we have
the Google Experience or Google now
launcher it looks just like you'd expect
it to complete with the auto flowing
pains if you put an icon over here on
the side it will automatically give you
an extra page and whatnot it's got
folders just like you're used to it's
got the app drawer that's really kind of
snappy
you can go back using your Universal
back button and then of course you've
got Google now over on this pane but
does it really work well let's find out
okay Google how tall is the Empire State
Building so we've got complete Google
now functionality including hot word
detection on the home screen that's
great
we've got hangouts that's even better
we've got the Play Store so anything you
want to download and install you can
including stuff that you've already
purchased as long as it's compatible
with the device which I haven't seen
much that's not compatible yet let's go
ahead and fire up Chrome now this is
much better than the stock internet
browser that comes with the Nokia X you
can see in here flows very nicely pocket
now looks great if we wanted to come in
and do a search we can use the Google
keyboard
let's search Michael Fisher why because
we can now this correct it to be Michael
fiddler which is Michael Fisher's
long-lost cousin but even still you can
see we've got
images we've got a nice scroll this is
loading up at my request in the desktop
version of the search results so we can
turn that off and get the mobile version
which looks a lot better and formatted
to the screen but of course we can show
off the pinch to zoom all that well on
the the mobile version because it just
looks wonky but other than being a
little bit slower than you're used to it
lays out the same it looks the same it
functions almost the same if you want to
go back home
press and hold on the back button and
that'll take you back to your home
screen overall this has just made the
Nokia X into a real Android with the
right tools and a bit of patience you
can do this too but that leads us to our
question of the day is this something
that you would do with your Nokia X to
make it look more Android like and allow
you to run the apps that regular
androids can run or if you'd previously
passed up the Nokia X because it didn't
look like an Android is this something
that would make you change your mind and
give it a try after all we want to know
head down to the comments give us your
feedback and let us know what your Nokia
X is going to look like thanks very much
for watching if you haven't done so
already make sure you give the video a
thumbs up and of course share it with
all of your friends on your favorite
social network for PocketNow showing off
cool stuff that you can do with your
devices I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
