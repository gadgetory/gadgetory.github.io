pocketnow.com mozilla just released the
alpha 1 release a fennec which is their
version of Firefox but for mobile
devices specifically this releases for
windows mobile and what would Firefox be
without extensions and add-ons that's
really what makes Firefox so robust is
the ability to customize the browsing
experience with thousands and thousands
of different add-ons and customizations
well Mozilla is bringing that technology
to fennec and I'm going to show you a
little bit about that it's not working
completely right now it's kind of buggy
but you can kind of get a sense for how
fennec will handle extension so let's
get a little closer on the screen here
and as you saw in the first video that
we did on the on the new release of
fennec and i'll post a link on the video
to get to their to get to the settings
you swipe your finger to the right and
you get this screen let me take out the
stylus so i can be a little more precise
okay and i'm going to go into settings
now since this is an alpha release it is
still slow it's still buggy this isn't
something you would want to use on a
day-to-day basis so here we are taken to
the add-ons panel and you can see that
I've already installed to add ons
Twitter bar which I'll demonstrate in a
second and Mozilla weave which is kind
of a competing service to x marks and x
marks is a great little add-on that lets
you synchronize bookmarks and passwords
across multiple computers running
firefox so give a laptop and a desktop
and in that book you can have them all
connected to the x mark server so that
you have all your passwords and all of
your bookmarks in the same place so this
is basically how you use the add ons
application you can tap on any of these
to get more information it'll give you
some recommended add-ons straight away
when you go into this section and it is
slow loading because again it's an alpha
so I just tapped on auto off and within
a few moments it'll give me here a
little preview or a little text
description on what it's all about and
if I go to the bottom of the text
description there's an install button
not going to install that right now
let's get back to the top
and we can tap on the ones that we've
already installed here and just like
firefox on the desktop we can get some
options here we can click on options we
can disable it we can uninstall it but
just as a sign of how alpha this is if I
tap on options watch what happens we get
this screen here that looks like it was
formatted for the desktop it's got a
huge ok and cancel button I'm not sure
what to do with that that said let's go
through what it's like to search for
extension so far I've only found about
10 extensions that you can download on
fennec of course there are thousands and
thousands available out there though I
don't think that there will ever be a
complete variety of extensions available
on fennec because a lot of the
extensions are made to work with other
programs or other technologies that just
aren't available on a mobile device so
let's get the the search box up ok here
we are and I might tap in the box and we
should get a pop-up keyboard here it is
up and I'm just going to type / that
because I know there's a slashdot plugin
available but that's pretty much hit
there's not that many more in addition
to that so it says searching for add-ons
and it looks like junk because again
this is an alpha so I'm going to scroll
down a little bit and here's the /
plug-in and it tells you a little
description will zoom in here so you can
see it / /a daughter adds the following
features to the / website so there you
have it now I promised a demonstration
of the Twitter plugin so I'm going to go
back to the the main screen here and
what what the Twitter plugin lets you do
is actually send a tweet right from the
the URL bar here so you have to
configure to be set up with your Twitter
account which was a very easy process on
fennec actually took me right to the
Twitter website so if I go into here and
I type hello world and then i do a
double dash and the word post and double
dash so we'll go into characters and
kind of cumbersome using this i know and
then i'll type post and if i press well
i don't even have to do anything state
says post successful so right now it is
on the twitter account on the pocket no
tweets twitter account
so right now the the add-ons
functionality authentic is really half
their or maybe even the quarter there
you really can't get that many
extensions and the ones that you do get
our kind of buggy but of course this is
an alpha release so you can expect that
to be the case that's it for now for the
add-ons and extensions of fennec for
more on Windows Mobile follow us on
