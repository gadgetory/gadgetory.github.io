you need to stop drinking that stuff
nice a March 2060 you need to get
yourself a hearing aid introducing hi
met beer twenty percent alcohol have one
of that in your pocket now gotta love
this advertisement that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Mary vetta
this this pocket now and this is the
pocket now daily recap the last week on
Monday we become the week asking you if
you would either buy a macbook pro a
surface pro 4 or a surface book as we
got some benchmarks and they revealed
that these Microsoft tablets are
superior to macbooks we had 709 comments
we start with macbook pro and you know I
kind of understand that I particularly
would prefer macbook pro because I could
run OS 10 on it and windows and
therefore I could get the best of both
worlds get a surface more or a surface
book and I also understand you these
products are actually very cool and if
you are on the windows ecosystem it
makes all the sense in the world when
those offers more compatible software
and the surface book has far more
battery life and much better keyboard
than the service pros so the choice
should be obvious but before that my
surface pro one has to malfunction you
know I have a lot of friends that have
the surface pro the original the surface
pro 2 and they are happy these were good
tablets of the day and yeah it makes all
the sense of the world for you to wait
as well on Tuesday the topic was mo LED
panels particularly because what we've
got rumors that Apple is shifting to a
mole of displays after spending years in
IPS and I asked you which was your
favorite display technology and why we
had 1459 comments thanks a lot guys we
start with for me I PS cuz it's more
true-to-life AMOLED makes you look drunk
I man I think anything like makes me
look drunk but then again you know I
would have agreed with you last year my
god this year the mo let panels are just
gorgeous and I'm a sucker for saturation
but then again it's a matter of taste
and although this Flav's look better
than IPS hands down it depends on your
taste I do agree with the other commoner
particularly in accurate color but then
Amal it panels are just the technology
wise I feel superior when it comes to
the things they can do welcome to 2012
apple and you know I'm not going to
with that because back in twenty twelve
AMOLED displays with the pentile matrix
were terrible they've gotten better but
back then it wasn't the case on
Wednesday we shipped it to talk about
iPads or tablets in general as well I've
had many sales are so low that they're
affecting the supply chain I ask you why
do you think it is we had 896 comments
we start with I think an 8-inch tablet
is just too small especially for
multitasking and yes there's a niche
market for small tablets but then again
you can buy one and then you're not
going to need another a lot of people
have an iphone six-plus so why a phablet
and a tablet too unless you just want
two different devices then that's okay
and I have to agree with you
particularly because the iphone 6 plus
is great in battery life but then again
the price difference is ginormous I mean
you buy an ipad for half the price so
it's a difficult topic that what sales
are dropping because nothing is wrong
with them those of you who wanted one
but one and don't need constant upgrades
and that is my argument as well that is
the biggest problem this iPad is two
years old and I'm not going to upgrade
now Thursday 1 plus announce the oneplus
X we went hands-on and I asked you after
everything you saw 1 plus X or 1 plus 2
we had 566 comments we start with 1 plus
X 1 plus 2 is too big five inches screen
is perfect and I'm getting fond of
phablets but yeah the majority of people
five inches on a display is enough well
as X all the way even if it doesn't have
a fingerprint scanner or even the latest
pacification is the one plus two you
will still get more for what you pay for
two hundred fifty dollars this is the
ridiculously affordable price that no
one can compete with unless they bring
out that invite system and I have to
agree the price tag is just so
compelling it's a no-brainer anyone else
a fan of the iphone for me well i was
and the oneplus x looks like it which is
a good thing personally i would choose
the one plus X over the 1+2 just for its
design alone and yes you have to agree
with Michael Fisher to the design of
that one plus X is gorgeous so there is
a point in favor and then finally on
Friday well the nose were that droid
turbo to its shadowless display motorola
publishing an infograph over how
constant it is for people to continue
using a phone after shattering it
and I asked you if you would buy a phone
just because it's display doesn't
shatter we had 639 comments that we
start with this technology should be
used to make screens for every phone and
I have to agree with you but it's not
the reality right now it's great the
motorolas bringing it to the table but
then again even that is not perfect of
course all smartphones should have a
shatterproof screen waterproof and the
IR blaster and yeah that would be the
perfect phone for me to do and a
destructible display is nice but when it
comes with a phone that's not as ugly as
that and yeah a lot of people feel that
the droid turbo 2 is a little ugly I
don't agree I actually like the phone
but then again yeah you remove that
Verizon logo I feel that design is up
right thing I mean if Sony Xperia figure
out a way to do this I would definitely
be a sucker to buy one but yeah I do
feel that the future should be like that
all phones should have a shatterproof
display in addition to other things like
being waterproof that's it for the
pocket now daily recap thank you very
