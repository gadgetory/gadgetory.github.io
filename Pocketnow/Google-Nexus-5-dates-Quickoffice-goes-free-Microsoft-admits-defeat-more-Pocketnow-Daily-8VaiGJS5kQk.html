kitkat a rumored for an October launch
Microsoft talks about their sad times
with Windows Phone and the surface and
believe it or not HP has launched some
more Android tablets I'm hi mera neta
and this is the LG g2 which and nothing
to do with this video but this is pocket
now daily let's stay off with the
interesting and kind of skeptical news
HP has just launched to Android tablets
and no I did not get the company wrong
believe it or not they're using this new
nvidia tegra note platform that we
talked about yesterday which is
basically just another Android tablet
with a couple of quirks and NVIDIA Tegra
4 being powered so yeah they finally
landed a US OEM to actually carry that
and well we just don't know what to
expect out of them and yeah there were
also some windows tablets as well links
in the description for details now let's
talk about Microsoft as the company has
now held their annual financial analyst
meeting and CEO Steve Ballmer has just
talked about how bad it has been with
Windows Phone 8 and also with the fact
of the Microsoft Surface did not perform
as they expected obviously they have a
huge backlog of products right there but
apparently he is very optimistic up to
the point where we now have more leaks
of Windows Phone 8.1 and apparently even
Cortana will make it to gdr3 so links to
the description for more details
screenshots and everything now let's
talk about the Moto X and republic
Wireless because they are now related
you know about that carrier upstart
that's trying to make a name for itself
by selling as affordable phones and
affordable plans well as it turns out
the Moto X can now we picked up there
for three hundred dollars no contract
and then you can obviously sign up to
one of their affordable plans where well
you won't find the 1999 plan anymore
apparently it's already twenty five
bucks but still it is a good bargain and
a good deal so look around for that if
you're interested in the Moto X and
speaking of deals you remember that
Apple pretty much gave away their whole
I work productivity suite for new iOS 7
customers well as it turns out google
could not hold back they are now
offering their quick office productivity
suite for that company they bought
recently completely free for android
customers and not just the new ones even
the current ones so links in the
description for what a download quick
this which could not necessarily be
great but being free who cares and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got some more credible leaks that
android 4.4 kitkat and a LG Nexus 5 will
be launched in october the reason why is
because nestle is going crazy with so
much publicity for this android 4.4
kitkat they're teasing that something
big will be launched some time with in
October obviously this means the
operating system and obviously this also
means the phone which we've got some
other leaks that state that the phone
will actually be priced just as low as
the nexus 4 last year so these are hot
news but that means me to the question
of the day are you holding off for the
Nexus 5 is this phone the one you've
been waiting for or you're holding off
for before you buy a galaxy note 3 or an
iPhone 5s or whatever in my particular
case you know honestly because this
phone is based off the LG g2 and after
holding this phone for pretty much a day
and actually liking it I am holding off
for that Nexus 5 it's gotta be a cool
phone but leave us a comment down below

tech world but she follow was on parking
