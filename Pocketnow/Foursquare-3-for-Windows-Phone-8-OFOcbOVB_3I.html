calm and in this video we're going to
take a look at the new foursquare
three-point app for Windows Phone 8 so
first off I'm going to press the
Bluetooth button in my car and we're
going to check out the speech I
interface here we go and so I'm going to
just go to the help real quick and we
choose apps and then there's four square
and this is what we can say so
Foursquare check-in show leaderboards
there's all your options Foursquare
check-in now this would have been really
cool if it had just responded with check
into stew leonard's stew leonard's wines
or the home depot and then i could just
say which one I wanted to check into but
instead it just loads the check-in
screen not terribly useful I definitely
not useful for hands-free checking in
hopefully they'll realize that they can
make this much better anyway there's the
chicken screen and you can choose
wherever we are and you can choose the
usual stuff post a picture you cannot
tag your friends that's not an option
still so let's go back to the full app
there we are of course has multiple live
tiles multiple tile sizes here's the
Explorer screen you do not get the
places closest to you these are just
kind of suggestions so popular for
dinner I'm a regular there and the
check-in button is down there of course
their settings all their menu options
searches up there you can see specials
so we can see what is going to give us a
nice discount their ex's activity now
unfortunately this does not load
activity based on proximity some of
these people are very far away and it
doesn't tell you so it's just your
friends and who did what recently
there's your profile of course and back
to explore now when you go to check in
you can you can pin your check-in button
to the Start screen that makes it really
easy to quickly go and hit the check-in
button and you're there so another thing
if you're in it if you're in a location
card you can see information about it
you can see the address you can actually
get directions call it visit the Twitter
account so if you get directions it's
going to look a here reach and it tells
me I'm already here so in the settings
you can turn on notifications for
comments and regular notifications but
it doesn't I haven't seen any
notifications that I've told me somebody
so-and-so truck checked in nearby so I
don't think that works now here's
another cool feature if you tap the map
at the top you get the full map these
are still just suggested places it's not
actually what's nearby but if we go to
the camera we get a augmented reality
view
obviously if i turn the camera you'd see
different locations and then we can go
to now what is in that general direction
and also pin these specific locations to
your Start screen save it to a list and
you see there's sometimes there's a menu
you can see so that's a quick look at
the new foursquare three-point Oh app
for Windows Phone 8 a lot of nice new
features some not available on other
devices sure to give this video a thumbs
up and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
