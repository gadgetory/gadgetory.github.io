calm and in this video we're going to
take a look at all the software
customizations that Nokia has put into
the new Lumia 900 if you're not already
familiar with all the features of
Windows Phone 7.5 be sure to search
PocketNow for the Windows Phone 7.5
review where you'll find lots of videos
and pictures of all the features that
you'll find in what is Phone 7.5 but in
this video we're going to talk mostly
about what nokia has done to change that
let's check it out ok first up we're
going to look at what comes on the nokia
lumia 900 by default now what apps are
bundled so here's our our default Start
screen so here's the layout that it
generates you see ATT u-verse Mobile if
your subscriber you can use that we have
ie Express so some of these are
Microsoft tiles and some of these are 18
TS you see a teen teen navigator this is
a GPS program that you can subscribe to
from ATT and you'll see you get three
days of free service and then they'll
start charging you $10 per month
similar with ATT radio another
subscription service or you can get
streaming music again you get a trial
and then you have to subscribe to it
after that and lastly there's a couple
of Nokia included apps as app highlight
this is kind of a separate app that just
recommends fun apps in the regular
Windows Phone Marketplace
so that might be helpful helpful
so that might be help for home
so that might be helpful for some people
I also have a surprise me button let's
shake your phone ok there's all right
let's go back
and local style is pinned also the ESPN
this is an exclusive Nokia app and it's
pretty nice-looking
it does support secondary pinning so I
can pin this right to the Start screen
but it doesn't have a live tile it
doesn't really show any more information
just a shortcut really and we have some
other bundled apps in the regular app
list ATT code scanner which is really
unnecessary since you have beam vision
right here which does the same thing
a teen teen navigator again radio
u-verse ESPN that's a bundle we also
have my 18 t so you can keep track of
your account information and tango video
calls is included so you get to use the
front facing camera and yellow pages
mobile is another bundled app
see how that works now let's go into the
settings and see what's new there yeah
ringtones we have some special ones from
18t we also have some special ones from
Nokia so you got a bunch of extra ones
to choose from internet sharing is here
and working so if you want to turn your
ATT 4G LTE internet connection into a
Wi-Fi network that's pretty easy to do
right here now in the camera
we have your front-facing camera switch
and let's look at the settings
for settings there's nothing special
from Nokia we have the focus mode is set
to normal which is good resolution
nothing a really innovative or exciting
like panoramic shooting or one huh
now you may have noticed not too many
Nokia apps are bundled with this device
however we have access to the Nokia
collection store and all all the ones
that you'd expect are free downloads so
it doesn't come pre-installed with Nokia
Drive but that is a free download ok
let's check out some of these Nokia apps
that you can download for free here's a
Nokia transit so from here you can
choose a location that you'd like to go
to using public transportation and it
will load a few options you can scroll
through this way and then select the one
you want and that will show you
directions and which buses or subways or
trains that you should get on as well as
how long it will take you now some
places you have to walk and there's a
little directions button right there and
this will show you where you have to
walk so that's really useful now we also
have Nokia Drive now this is a really
important one for GPS navigation in your
car and it's free so we can do a set
destination and we can choose something
and I can search online let's see this
one and you'll get a couple options you
can swipe to go to different sushi
places and then we can drive there
you're screwed here are settings you can
change the map color we can manage maps
and from here you can actually download
all sorts of other map data all for free
which is great and it also works offline
so we can see the connection is online
if you don't want to use a data
connection we can shut it off right
there or if it doesn't have data
connection and we'll just use the
offline stuff next let's look at Nokia
Maps and from here we can choose places
which will load all sorts of interesting
places to go to and you can tap it and
see what's there and with that little
arrow we can see kind of a local Scout
style interface next is creative studio
and this is a photo app so we have a lot
of cool options here we can do from a
panorama this will let you take a series
of photos and stitch them together
automatically into a panorama it's not
built into the camera software but it's
not it's nice that we have that there so
we can choose we have a all sorts of
different effects here so let's try one
so there you see our FX and let's try
this one adjustments sliders and this
button right here is pretty nice this
gives you a before-and-after view and
look you can slide it and see which what
happens on each end of the picture so
that's very cool we also have
adjustments crop rotate all the good
stuff and you know you're weird filters
the CNN app is also pretty nice as a
live tile there
we can see it loads all sorts of new
stories and it's really well designed
there's your videos so that's my
favorite nokia apps that you can
download free on nokia windows phones
such as this lumia 900 now before we
finish up let's just see what my battery
life is like so right down here you see
it's been in use for one day in four
hours about eight hours to the left the
brighter is at 30% this is a pretty
great battery life I've had maybe three
email accounts on there a couple push
apps and it's been on LTE the whole time
and I've been using it pretty normally
so that's a pretty impressive battery
life so that's it for the Nokia Lumia
900 software tour give us a thumbs up if
you liked this video and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
