and I've had the new gear 360 for about
a week I wanted to share some thoughts
with it first of all just it's always
kind of frustrating when we call
something the new product though I
totally understand that we couldn't call
it the gear 362 then it sounds like
we're adding two degrees to a circle and
that's just even stranger but again we
are talking about the new who cares 5060
this won't be a proper review we don't
really feel that fair to do an in-depth
review on this product right now we
think the hardware is pretty well
finished but the software experience is
definitely still super beta without
further ado here are our top five pros
and cons and using the new gear 360 to
shoot 360 degree photos and videos let's
start with the positives at number 5 the
redesigned hardware I really think
Samsung's nailed the look of this gadget
soft around the edges got a really
playful look to it a big inviting red
clicky button it just looks like it's
about to go on an adventure with wall-e
and I think that's great
number four the galaxy ecosystem like I
said beta software but the pairing
process between this camera and my
galaxy s7 was wonderfully easy and every
time you fire up this camera the phone
will auto connect over Bluetooth and
it's really easy to get up and running
using your phone as a viewfinder for the
camera you don't have to go through
opening an app or trying to go through
Wi-Fi settings these two talk to each
other really easily
number three 360 photos and video are
still super fresh if you're trying to
impress family and friends or you're
trying to create a new channel of your
own you want to fund hook to get viewers
in I'm a big fan of shooting panoramas
especially from phones where you can
just really easily sort of swipe your
phone across the scene but as you're
moving the phone around you can
introduce stitching errors or someone
can walk through and become some sort of
mutant beast
now instead of completing that action
it's wiping your phone across you pick
up your camera you hold it up you hit
one button just like that and that
captured a full 360-degree view of the
area I was in as a brief aside it's
always kind of funny when you hand
someone some kind of 360 degree photo
and they're just sort of looking at the
phone like well what is this that I'm
looking
and then you have to take your hands and
sort of move them and then they're like
oh oh I get a kick out of that I think
it's fun positive number two that 4k
quality the new gear 360 takes a
noticeable step up in improving video
quality again more clarity more detail
really helps flesh out the scene that
you're in those extra pixels go a long
way towards immersing someone into that
content I mean think about gaming the
fuzzier the image is the more
distracting it is to play that game
and the number one positive you capture
everything one button press and the
entire scene the entire environment
around you is saved for posterity it
really is kind of a head trip and it
definitely requires a different way of
thinking about how you shoot photos and
videos like normally I want to walk
around and point my camera at things or
pan over to things and you just don't
need to do that when everything around
you is captured with one button press it
requires nothing of you more than
holding it up and clicking the button
and that's it that's all well and good
but of course shooting on the new gear
360 isn't all roses so here's our top 5
cons for buting on this camera number 5
the redesigned hardware sure this looks
like a weeble and weebles wobble but
they don't fall down this thing falls
down really easy samsung's solution is
also not particularly elegant to give
you this sort of hemorrhoid ring that
you can put on the bottom of the camera
and it'll do a better job of just sort
of propping itself up instead I've got a
bunch of these little cheap bendy
tripods I just instead will screw this
into the bottom of the the gear 360 and
I've got a handle kind of like the
original gear 360 which can then be
splayed out into some kind of stand to
better prop up the camera if I ever want
to set it down con number 4 the samsung
ecosystem sure these two paired
ridiculously easy and I really do like
how this app will communicate with the
camera but as of right now this camera
only works with Samsung hardware we
should see some support for iPhones but
I'm a little worried that any future
support for competing two
Isis is going to resemble what Samsung
is doing with their Smart Watch strategy
are you sure it pairs up with other
devices but some of those features that
you would really want in a product like
this might be disabled if you're likely
to stay in the Samsung ecosystem NBD but
if you were hoping to pick up this
camera and use it with an LG or with a
wall away it might not work Kahn number
three 360 degree video is still pretty
fresh and by fresh I mean raw it's like
the very early days of film we're still
trying to figure out what the new
narrative or storytelling constructs
should be when the viewer has control
over where they're looking within the
scene even in just shooting a couple
silly little vlogs using 360 degree
cameras
I'm routinely confronted by comments of
people accusing me of not doing enough
cool stuff with the platform or not
pushing the boundaries on the platform
no one's really been able to articulate
what I should be doing with these
cameras but they all have very strong
opinions that I'm just not doing it
right somehow Kahn number two that 4k
quality so imagine if you will you're
sitting down in your living room looking
at your gorgeous 4k TV you pop on some
kind of 4k video stream or 4k blu-ray
and you see all of that crispy crunchy
detail it's all right in front of you in
one little rectangular box and it's
gorgeous that 4k resolution is stretched
all the way around your head so whatever
you're looking at in that one little
piece that one little field of view is
probably lower than HD quality video a
little extra education needs to happen
so that people understand what's going
on when they fire up a 4k video and it
still looks a little blurry or a little
softer a little fuzzy at least we can
start that discussion off and I wholly
expect that higher end cameras will
probably be released by the end of this
year pushing up into 8k territory just
for instances of content creation like
360 video and the number one Conda
suiting photos and videos with the new
gear 360 if you capture everything you
capture your hand and your arm and your
self so you know don't go picking your
nose while you're shooting 360 video you
capture this amazing scene all the way
around you
and you capture that obnoxious guy who's
always trying to make you sign petitions
outside your favorite Starbucks we've
got to be careful about not being
creepers with our new technology you
also capture that mother and that child
that are out playing at a park this
creates such immersive content but it
also introduces a few etiquette problems
that we're going to need to address so
folks those were our top five pros and
cons actually reading through the list
now the pros and cons seemed pretty
similar looking down each individual
list point which is odd almost like I
plan on doing that we're going to be
shooting some more samples with the new
gear 360 we have some links down below
this video with a few of the things that
I've already shot you can also check out
if you really want to dig in and you
want to try and see what this can be
used for in a long-form discussion we
did an episode of the pocket now weekly
podcast 90 minutes of podcasting with
hime a Jules and Ricky VHS from GSM
arena just all in sort of a roundtable
discussion literally around this camera
and you can kind of get a feel for what
it's like to be in the middle of a
pocket now podcast literally in the
middle of a pocket now podcast while
we're recording at 2:00 in the morning
after the Samsung unpacked event and we
want to hear from you I know I was
getting a little snarky some of that
criticism over people not expressing
themselves with things they'd like to
see in 360 now's an opportunity to to
kick up some comments down below this
video what kinds of things would you
like to see shot in 360 degrees you can
already find tons of videos like hey I'm
driving in my car or check out this
sunset on the beach but I'm sure you
guys have some other ideas out there and
we'd love to hear them and we've got
hardware that we want to compare for
some interesting tests so we want to
make sure we're giving you guys some
cool samples to look at drop that
comment down below those are the kind of
conversations
I love getting into as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our full coverage of
some of these hot new accessories coming
down the pipe and help us out with some
sharing on your favorite social networks

some gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram
and I will catch you all on the next
