everyone and welcome to episode 004 of
the pocket now VIP the interview series
from pocket now where the technology
itself takes a backseat allowing us to
get to know the people who report on it
I'm Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and today I'm joined by a man
I've never met in person but he's the
man behind one of the best known
publications on youtube in our field
mark from soldierknowsbest mark welcome
to the Attic payment hey man thanks for
having man is good to be here it is
awesome to have you here thank you for
taking the time to join us this one came
together at the last minute we're
running about 23 minutes late because of
some last-minute technical hurdles we
had to clear as everyone knows Google
likes to change up their hangout to you
I about once every what is it about 48
hours or so I think so they get it looks
likely just change it again yeah I think
it's cool yeah I like to do like it
actually does get better every time but
it actually gets much more difficult to
use every because I have to relearn it
every time and apparently I'm a 70 year
old man so anyway I'm glad that you're
here listeners I'm so used to saying
listeners for the podcast viewers thank
you for joining us and i'm rather
excited because mark we confirm that for
me we have not met in person right no no
i don't think so no yeah no I'm gonna
see justice well in January I was just
gonna say yes I'm gonna be in Vegas this
January you oh yeah I'll be there so we
can probably meet in person for the
first time I heard from another reporter
who is exclusively YouTube based that
she was having some difficulty getting
registered because apparently CES does
not consider YouTube no matter how big
you are in YouTube apparently CES
doesn't consider that an adequate
credential have you had my first year I
went to sea ES and I try to use YouTube
actually do on-site registration and I
had to show them they're like well prove
it is you how can you prove it and all i
said 'i'm like--that's my face right
there youtube channel and but just with
these video like this me right yeah all
right right and it's like you gotta have
like a post with like a thousand hits
per month stuff like that like I got a
video you known as you know forty
thousand a million yeah relays ago so i
had just really work with them and then
finally the manager approved it but now
i go through
I'm a network revision3 or actually
discovery digital networks right now so
they kind of just I'm able to put them
on there and have no problems but yeah I
said I understand why they just don't
recognize youtubers by themselves gonna
go through all those hurdles I don't
like that at all yeah when I was talking
to this other person about it I was like
what is this 2007 like YouTube isn't an
adequate credential like what are you
talking about did you discovery digital
is that I mean I assume that's the same
folks behind discovery TV yeah yeah so
so this basically just it looks like
they kind of transition to remove
business Rio ver to that so yeah I'm
still kind of part of both right now in
this this transition but yeah they take
care of me for all this other stuff or
CES and no I stopped so they good sweet
well that's awesome man I I want to
actually come back to that in a bit
because we I do want to ask you some
questions about the business side of
soldierknowsbest and how that that's up
kind of works but can I i want to start
this off kind of learning a little bit
about you because as we said earlier we
haven't met in person i have actually
walked past you once I at this moment
where I was like at the galaxy note 2
launch event for that Samsung through
New York City remember the one in the
the library mmm yeah that the thing that
was the Kanye concert one yeah I think
yeah that was a pretty cool concert
effort it was a cool yeah and I was I
was on my way to play ping pong with
Taylor and and Marquez and I was like
walking by and like that guy familiar
who's oh the soldier knows I shouldn't
anyway but I don't know you in person
and I think a lot of our regular viewers
would like to know some more about the
stuff and I'm particularly interested in
the military man aspect of you um you
may get tired of hearing it so thank you
for your service though and what branch
of the Armed Forces are you with and i'm
currently in the Army Reserves okay and
so like what what is your I don't know
if you want to go into details about
your rank and your positions that but
what keeps you busy most days is my
question and internal well i'm on a
reserve so just one weekend a month in
in the summer we used to go out of town
to a fort hood texas for two weeks and
do some training um but when i'm
actually you know in on the military
side we go on for the weekends we have a
lot of powerpoints an army product up by
powerpoints a lot of power
point slides on training and in all
these prevention classes that we do and
then we do PT test physical training and
then we try to we really are our main
units main goal is to actually help
train up other aviation units how to get
ready to deploy so we kind of helps
certify them make sure they're up on
their task and throughout the year with
the reserves you were basically every
every drill just trying to make sure we
prepared and we send teams out almost
every month of seven to ten individuals
that go out to different places that
help other people train really now you
said aviation unit know if it's army i'm
going to assume that we're talking
helicopters here yeah yeah that's really
cool so in what what is your role
specifically in that like when you are
in you know your be two years I don't
even know if they call him that anymore
i sees ok yeah my brothers in the Air
Force and I was an ROTC guy in high
school and I wanted to join the military
when I was younger but all my
information is there for like a decade
out of day but when you're when you're
wearing your uniform when you're
actually doing stuff what is what is
keeping mark busy in the field yeah
mostly on communication so I branched in
the Signal Corps so I'm working with is
right on my Alice I'm working with
computers or really anything I mean we
have events I'm the camera picture guy
when a computer breaks down I help fix
the computer or he'll fix the printer
when the colonel need something I'm
doing all these type of things we don't
have like we don't use radios that often
unless we're going out to do training
like our two weeks in all that but but
the most part I'm just handle all that
type of stuff then plus I just help out
around as much as I can Roger that I
just started in her up to this train of
thought here but I just noticed that the
three pictures that are normally on your
wall behind you were gone are you moving
or something no actually uh well no I
just moved up i'm in the same building
but i moved up and i haven't put those
pictures up yet so she loosened only but
you moved like you move to floor or
something like that yeah yeah it was
kind of a different layout and I just
really want the balcony so I want to go
out to sit out so is it i'm in the same
place but i just moved to a different
place and this is that almost the same
exact layout but yeah it's really creepy
it's like some alternate universe were
in the same room with the decorations
are different it's awesome alright so
I'm with you mentioned that your your
deal with technology a little bit in
your day job which seems to be a really
really really nice thing now hold on a
second if the reserves are a weekend a
year
there's no that would be great a weekend
a month uh and sometime in the summer
time what's keeping you busy the rest of
your day like when you're when you're
not recording videos um I'm mostly
playing halo playing video games to be
honest with you well let me tell what
I'm testing out these products oh but no
I'm um yeah mostly I have different
hobbies like here saying Louis I like to
play on a whole bunch of different
leagues so on the weekends sometimes
during the week I go play dodgeball
kickball all types of crazy stuff
hanging out with friends drinking like
normal but I'm trying to you know get
through emails and work on other
projects and throughout the day but
since I'm working for myself to be
honest which is not the hardest job I've
ever had so I'm not super busy
throughout every day unless it's like a
big launch the iphone or galaxy
something like that but yeah I just kind
of kind of pace off my weekend and get
the work done st. Louis I was I visited
there with my father on a cross-country
road trip and we we had a good time we
spent entirely too long at the arch if
you go into summertime some long odds
yeah there were but you know it was
worth it it was good we got to pay rent
allowed to take a lot of photos but um
so it I want to kind of kick things off
talking we're gonna gradually to start
talking about your business life here
and I'm most interested really in
probably the most dough question ever
but my favorite question always to ask
how did you get started and by that I
mean not not how did you kick off the
business and all that kind of stuff but
when did you realize that you wanted to
cover geeky stuff and gadgets and stuff
as a as a way of life um well I mean he
really started with the I was actually
Fort Gordon Georgia going through my
signal basic course and the very first
iphone came out and I'm just out of
college so I'm still broke and i really
want to set the news i was using the
single 8525 windows mobile phone and
with the the sideways fighter yeah yeah
yeah and so I would like that fo but I
was like you know I saw this I phones
all the buzz about him anyway I window
youtube and watch a whole bunch of
videos to decide whether I want to buy
it or not because it was totally
unsubsidized at that point and so I went
ahead and bought it and I put in my own
video review on youtube with my digital
camera was very crappy back then
I just put the video after people say
they liked it and then I kind of
realized that you know my family and
friends and I'm talking with them or I'm
at home like that i'm usually helping
them with their computers and stuff so
i'll say okay well maybe i'm going to
start making videos and I was
transitioning over to the mac at that
time as well and so I just kind of made
videos going through my transition and
then I just started liking and people
other people started liking it and
giving me support and then I just kept
doing it and doing it and doing it and
then when for making ten cents a day to
you know make it more than I was making
you know in my regular jobs and I just
went a net quit and just went full full
steam ahead with it that's a really fun
moment isn't it like I remember going
full time with with pocket now and I was
like this can't be this can't be real
like I'm serious like I you're paying me
to do something I would I would do
anyway that's that's another yea that's
a love for you know I think you know
some sometimes now since the word is out
about money on YouTube and stuff like
that and it's just money in general do
through internet business or whatever
but I really love that when back in the
day people started because it really was
just a hobby because you know something
that we really like to do and that's
unless my advice I try to get the people
when it first starts don't worry about
the money and all that stuff just just
worry about talking about something that
you really love and you really care and
then your viewers will come your viewers
will support you and then you know the
hard work will pay off and you'll be
able to hopefully if you want to make a
living with it or just make some side
change with it or whatever it's really
good advice and I'm actually going to
press you for some more of that at the
end of the interview here because I love
ending up on that note because we always
get those questions you know how can I
do what you guys do cover that in a
minute but you mentioned you watch some
videos from YouTube videos this is back
in two thousand seven when the first
iphone launch it do you remember whose
videos you watched because it was a much
much smaller sector then I have no idea
you know our part be able to check is
only another YouTube channel that I had
a long time ago now into college it may
be in the history of it who knows I may
be able to go back and check the history
I don't know it's probably been deleted
after all these YouTube changes but yeah
I don't remember who but they were just
kind of you know it wasn't you know
anybody from a big website of just kind
of regular look just like I am just in
my office or in my bedroom living room
just talking about it for 10-15 minutes
and yeah so that's something I'm gonna
look up until it be interested see will
actually watch
first yeah please do I this was I had
this noted to ask you a little bit later
on but I'll just go and ask you now and
went back in my preparations for this
time we have together and I was trying
to find the oldest soldierknowsbest
video that I could find and what was it
it was a mature relationship with iOS it
was a walkthrough of a game on what
looked like an iphone 3g or an iphone
3gs and it was like oh my god do you
remember what it was at all because I'm
it's it's in my notes here and I
absolutely cannot find it right now I'm
really annoyed anyway when I find it
I'll figure it out because the point was
I was bringing that up to to say that
you have managed to guess your camera's
changed yes your your delivery styles
change you actually appear on video now
yourself but that aside you've managed
to keep the tone in the atmosphere very
very consistent from this video that i
saw that was probably from 2008 and I
wondered if as we transition into
talking more about soldierknowsbest
itself is that a conscious choice that
you've made I mean dude did you just
stick with the formula that was working
I mean you have just this very
approachable you know kind of like hey
guys I'm gonna start talking about this
and then you start talking about it yeah
I mean like what have you have you felt
compelled to make any changes and have
you resisted that urge um you know I I
really just want to you know my whole
goal is just try to talk to people in a
way that I'll talk to my friends about a
product because my friends ask me a lot
about this phone and you know you can
get real technical and stuff but
sometimes you just didn't really need to
find out what do people really want from
this device and what's really going to
be the selling factor for it so really
just over all these years I just really
try to just keep my personality the same
with it and make sure my delivery like
you say it's the same but yeah trying to
get better at camera work and all that
stuff you got people like you know
Marquez who is killing it and with all
day on video so is this those type of
progressions that normally just kind of
make with YouTube but overall I just
want the whole feel like you said this
to beat us am still in my office not I
don't have a green screen and nothing
else you know up it's just really kind
of me
used I just want the viewer to feel like
this me you are talking about this
product and it works really well I mean
you have you have the epitome of the
minimalist approach there are no there's
no splash screen there's no there's no
intro outro roll you don't even go crazy
with the with the overlays I mean you
you are absolutely keeping it about as
simple as it can be while also keeping
the quality up now this is something
that a lot of people I've noticed in
your comments have asked you you're
usually gracious enough to answer what
kind of equipment are you working with
for the for the folks out there who who
are curious about that kind of thing
well I have a just a blue microphones
that I normally use yeah yeahs new
shotgun my edit got the Sennheiser that
I'm I'm trying to work out and get
everything right with it my product
shots yeah like a little shotgun mic
yeah yeah I don't know oh very gotta
step my game up but uh but yeah for my
camera working a product so actually use
the the canon 5d mark 3 with that and
just for when you see me my videos i'm
using the logitech c920 webcam for that
one oh when i go to events like CES and
i'm just on the fly like you use it just
a real camcorder and don't have the
foyer by focusing so i use the canít
xa10 with that and yes sony rx100 mark
to digital camera i take with me almost
everywhere great solution for video and
pictures no matter what you're doing
yeah and yeah that's that's mostly about
it that's pretty substantial arsenal now
when you have to take all this footage
in and the audio and stuff and when you
edit it and what are you using to edit
actually I use the same program that
I've been using from basically to begin
in ScreenFlow which is not even a real
kind of video editing app I still can
focus best very familiar with me and
it's really straight to the point in
symbol for how I like to present my
videos so ScreenFlow has been really
good to me over the years but yeah I try
to do one dabble and then I movie in
Final Cut but I just me feel just kinda
I understand believe me we we use Final
Cut Pro over here for video but when I'm
when I'm doing graphic stuff like for
editorials and stuff when I have to like
piece photos together and everything
like everyone else on the team uses
photoshop everyone else is a pro and I'm
sitting right over here with like
preview and and you know if I want to
get fancy I use like pho tour I use this
really really consumer level stuff
the same as I think you just said it's
because I'm familiar with it I'm
comfortable with it and it works for
what I needed to do so yeah usually yeah
yeah sometimes you can change too much
and then people like oh no go back to
the old you know I've been through that
transition even I started doing in video
ads with a revision 3 and it's so it's a
really delicate process you make a
change like that and make sure the
viewers ocampo with it so I just find
that you know using the same you know
familiar equipment and using you know
familiar program just to edit just keeps
for that overall feel of your content
absolutely yeah I did change can be can
be a scary thing and we've we've been
through a couple you know style changes
over here and then there's always that
element of the audience it's like what
did you stop go back to the way I liked
it the way and really again I know but
let's let's push forward sometimes it
works and sometimes it doesn't um we uh
by the way I found out I found in my
notes finally what that video was it was
called ragdoll blaster do you remember
that oh I do remember them no I was a
fun game I was gonna say you were pretty
amped on it you were like listen I've
been playing this game for like days on
end and that's what so sorry it took me
so long to find that let's go as we as
we move on here so that's that's your
kind of equipment stuff now you review
or discuss a lot of categories I'm
soldierknowsbest I mean you're doin
phones tablets gaming consoles like all
the way to like cameras and like ram
upgrades for desktop computers so I'm
interested in where you draw the line
because you have soldierknowsbest then
you have another channel just for gaming
right yeah I haven't done anything on
that channel like a year though really
yeah I want to bring that back up though
but yeah I've just been focused on
soldierknowsbest and also I did the tech
feed channel excuse me with John for
lakers and other people with a revision
3 well yeah yeah just but for
soldierknowsbest you know as far as you
know i think the kind of the most out of
the box thing that I reviewed was the
dyson vacuum cleaner that would be just
cuz the APU what's that look really cool
yeah so is that the threshold like is
that what it is where it's just like it
doesn't necessarily have to be it can be
something like a washing machine but if
it's cool then Oh then I'll do it is
that basically what it is yeah and
honestly I mean the real secret too wide
for
what I choose for my videos the stuff
that I actually want or I want to use
personally myself and so I really don't
go with trends it's just that okay if
I'm interested in this product I'm going
to review it not review things that I
know that are not going to get a lot of
views or most monstrous cry birds may
not be interested in it but I'm doing it
because I like it and so I'm gonna put
it up anyway inside is better than G so
really cool refrigerator combs and this
really cool techie wise i would i would
review it and i'll take the feedback by
but I'd review something that I like to
to use or interested in so sometimes I
mean that can be we do a couple projects
like that where we we did a video a
while back where I took a tour of a
sapphire plant we're like you know we
they made sapphire coatings for sapphire
display protection for smartphones and I
knew that the video views were not going
to justify the expense of the travel and
the day of not writing editorials stuff
like that but it was something i was
extremely interested in and a small
subset of our readers were very
interested in as well so i completely
agree with you it's like it I don't know
sometimes you just have to do what you
want and let that enthusiasm bleed into
the video and make it a better a better
product right yeah yeah I mean you you
don't want to feel forced to do
something because it was show you know
if you're not really happy or excited to
be reviewing the product a lot of people
feel you know one thing i get for my
viewers is that sometimes they say you
review a lot of stuff negatively like
you don't have a lot of errors that's
because i look at the stuff beforehand
and if i don't want it because it sucks
i'm not going to review it sometimes
sometimes i do that for the most part i
do that but sometimes i like to get a
product because if it is popular this
sucks I'll say something about it but i
like i like if your products are gonna
make me feel good and i'm gonna make me
happy to make me satisfied and i just
want to portray that to the to the to
the viewer so that's a really cool
perspective i like i like that i think
you're the first person on our VIP has
ever said that where it's like I mainly
review stuff i like because i don't want
to deal with stuff i don't like but then
what does that make you how do you
self-identify when you are on
soldierknowsbest calm you or list
yourself as a YouTube partner which is
you know it's yeah you remember the
YouTube Partner Program but like when
people ask you what do you do and you
get done telling them about the your
life and the reserves would you tell
them do you say you're a gadget reviewer
do you say that
your YouTube personality do you say that
you're a blogger vlogger what how do you
what do you call yourself yeah I mostly
go with you know you can say consumer
tech journalists if you want to that's
kind of like my official name but not
really just means a syllable title title
right but what I really do be somebody's
like like I make youtube videos and I
review a lot of consumer electronics
from cell phones tablets computers and
anything really consumer tech I just
make video reviews of them and put the
videos up on YouTube and that's that's a
really good take at it then of course
they have a lot more questions but how
do you make money and all that stuff but
that's usually what I say and that's
really good conversation starter it
really is but but there's no catch all
to it like I've my mother you know who
doesn't understand this business I like
a lot of our parents tone well it was
chasing after me for weeks after I got
this job to tell me some kind of like
elevator speech like the you that's a
good elevator speech but there's there's
no term that encapsulate SAT all you say
blogger it's like what was that does
that mean really am a blogger and that's
even more confining so I'm glad to know
that I'm not the only one who can't boil
it all down into the one word yeah I
think a lot of people they see you think
of vlogger they think of you know
shaycarl somebody who's vlogging their
everyday life right I really don't use
that I just I'm where I'm a tech
reviewer and make slides make video
that's that's as easy i can get it now
too I like it that's good I you
mentioned in a QA you today do you still
do these these q and A's on vocal or is
that a one-time thing yeah well I uh
I've been doing live shows for a long
time I started off on Ustream and then I
moved over to vocal because it was
really easy for the question to ask for
matt no that's something else I stopped
because I got really busy in the
summertime okay in just traveling but ya
did that for about a year and a half
maybe two years on vocal ustream I did
you know I used to do like a 24 hour
stream just like Chris Pirillo um so
I've been doing it is still alive
streams every Wednesday for the longest
yeah really so I mean this I think I
might have caught the last one that you
did or it may not have been I'm not sure
it was basically the first and only one
I found chasing whatever length I was
chasing and you mentioned in one
particular vocal interview that you tend
to review about five phones a year and
you
like to do more than five phones a year
now you know we we only cover mobile a
pocketknife so this really caught my
interest where I was like why is that
but why would you confine yourself to
such a small portfolios because it gets
repetitive or what well that's changed
because it's been a lot of stuff and
interesting phones that it came out
especially this year so I I'm now
reviewing a lot more than that but the
main thing rise because you know yet the
iphone once a year get the galaxy the
note or really the s3 or s4 back then
well s3 poverty back then um the next is
you know and all these other phones
which is changed over this year but back
then i'll most of the phones are really
just kind of playing catch up or just
changing things just a little bit and it
wasn't really that interesting to me
because you know even now sometimes
there's a new android phone out every
single week a lot of them aren't really
changing things you know to the point
where I I want to confuse the consumer
now or should I get this one or this one
because it has this so yeah but it's a
lot of time I let you know that they add
15 toggles to the notification shade i
mean that's that's worth 10 videos right
there right it's just kind of for it
sometimes frustrating like i really love
this android phone and then the next
month it's always it's just it's a good
thing and a bad thing ministers next one
that kind of kicks that one off the
pedestal and sometimes people forget
about it but yeah it's just a lot of
phones out and so by even now I'm
starting to I got the the m1 in this one
and the the G and then after that I want
to really start focusing on a lot of
this other tech that I have cool that's
it's I've noticed that your mobile like
investment has sort of experienced an
uptick recently and that's been cool to
say I I wonder what relationship that
you have with some of these vendors we
were talking to marques about this on
the last VIP and he's in this position
where he's actually buying a lot more
now than he was before you're in a
position where you don't review a lot of
stuff that you don't like so I assume
that means that you are buying more of
your own stuff for review what's your I
mean and yet we run into each other at
events all the time so I mean what do
you prefer do you would you rather get a
review device for a menu
sure would rather buy it yourself so
that you don't feel like there's any
implied you know any expectation of
coverage yeah you know both to be honest
with you I my whole have always done you
know soldierknowsbest is that i I really
don't wait on the manufacturing anybody
at all if I see something I like I'm
gonna go buy it if I never heard of it
i'm gonna buy instead of waiting for
whatever but i never really asked i
probably twice soldierknowsbest I've
asked a company hey I'm interested in
this product you know if you have any
review units I'll take one all the other
times I like to put the company's to
discover my content first and then shoot
me that email or tweet go tweet or
whatever and say hey you're interested
in reviewing this and then I'm like cool
you know you don't take payments for
reviews anything like that but I like
for that company to come to me and so it
really is no explicit they know exactly
what they're getting I don't have to
sell myself because they already watched
my videos and they liked it and they
want to see me the product and I think
it's going to be a win for both the
company and myself with me not having to
buy a product but to no not you know
feeling obligated to say anything nice
about it just because you know I want to
make the company feel good or something
right and one of the nice things about
buying it yourself is that you get to do
a genuine unboxing and sometimes if
they're getting a review unit early the
retail packaging won't be ready or
whatever but I want to ask you about
that you doing my research for this
interview made me feel a little bit
better actually because I thought for a
while we were the only ones with this
issue at pocket now where we will do a
an unboxing video for a hot product and
it'll get obscene amount of views and
then we'll do a review a week later of
that same product and it will get a
twentieth of the viewers review you had
an unboxing of the iphone 5s that guy
that earned 1.3 million views and then
the 5s review which I think was about
two weeks later or so earned 177,000
views so what do tell me if this
frustrate to you as much as it obviously
frustrates me and if it doesn't or if it
does tell me why what what are your
thoughts on this ish is yeah so we're
dynamic it's a weird dynamic what i
think is mostly you know we the reason
when you do an unboxing my best launch
day and everybody is just go
searching iphone they want to see it
first they want to you know just really
get the first glimpse of an online it
didn't you know yeah yeah I'll do my
review probably at least a week or
sometimes two weeks later they think the
bus is kind of died down a little bit so
that's the only reason I could really
explain that and but I've always told
people that unboxings just really porn
for geeks man you know you see somebody
take out a box it's like opening a
Christmas present for the first time and
you know i watched unboxing videos and
the same product that partner already
have but i just it's just a feeling that
I got just like watching the people
hands on stuff is kind of great isn't
that bizarre I mean you actually took
the words out my mouth I was going to
ask you if you sometimes feel like a
gadget porn purveyor because sometimes
that's that's what I do and when people
ask me like sometimes if people are
asking me what I do for my life and I
really am feeling you know not like
engaging them in that conversation I'm a
gadget porn I'm they call me a reviewer
but I'm a gadget point because yeah
people love watching that screen
protector come off and and all that
stuff and I understand that but it is it
really that um is it really a matter of
time in terms of why the unboxings are
so popular because their day of I I
think so i think you know it's just kind
of weird like a lot of people just
aren't interested in tech reviews per se
but they may be interested in just what
are people talking about what's this I
new iphone 5s they're talking about and
so that first day I mean really at first
couple days I'm pumping out a lot of
videos you know cover in touch ID or
covering or whatever out the cameras
yeah and that those first three days I
see a lot of views with those videos
within yeah when I put my review out
some reviews take off but some don't
they can be a combination things could
be search results how high up your show
and all this other stuff and when you
make that iphone review now when
somebody searches iphone youtube that
unboxing may be coming up first and then
your review may be downloadable oh I've
noticed that a couple times but yeah
it's just Randall E you know sometimes
youtube videos that I think may really
take off they don't and the other ones
that then how big a lot of you be
interesting edges skyrock and I'm like
okay it's amazing right yeah I know you
just sit there kind of looking at it
like well really okay I spent 10 hours
crafting this one and then it's got this
amount of you isn't it this thing was a
throwaway on the day like whatever like
Windows Phone for Instagram is yeah it's
just bizarre how the internet works I'll
of how that's completely unpredictable
before we move on to to kind of I do
want to talk a little bit about your
relationship with with iOS but before I
let this completely died I'm interested
when you talk to normal people that's
one thing maybe not normal people and
you talk to everyday folks that's one
thing when you are talking to your to
your co-workers in terms of the reserves
in terms of the military what what is it
do they do they think it's cool I mean
how are you perceived as like to do
people get like high off being being
internet next to somebody who's internet
famous or what's what's the what's the
story with that I mean you get
recognized on the street and in your
normal reserve work days and such well I
got a funny story that but yeah
obviously that I was with my friend
Angie and we was celebrating her
birthday with a few of our friends and
went to this bar and you know so we were
sitting there then all of a sudden I see
everybody look up behind me and I turn
around as his guys at standing behind me
Thank something me I watching videos
it's like what's up man I'm not my way
to get ready to the fighters of it but
yeah thnkx mansion oh man yeah and he
knew exactly where I live cuz he stayed
in the same place in the same building
before it was kind of weird and my
fridge was just like what but it was
kind of like I was like I yeah I
understand yeah yada yada yada but then
actually later on that night it's like
four o'clock in the morning i get a
knock on my door and some like what yeah
what the heck is going on i'm thinking
okay so i'm gonna got my gun and you
know I'm ready and there's some peace of
God that delivers you know at this piece
of that stays up two like I'll him or
something anyway that's of one of the
finest stores I tell people about
getting recognized on the street is
still weird but awesome at the same time
like I'm still really flattered and
somebody recognized my videos and no
matter where I am but you know we're
usually when I'm talking to my friends
to get back to the original question but
usually I'll talk to my friends or
somebody and explaining what I do they
just really interested like oh really
how asked me the same questions you do
you know how did you get started with it
you know I'm you know how do you
maintain it or you know then also how do
you make money how you make a living off
of it and is usually those same
questions and I'm is to me so joy use of
a skin those or answering those
questions because a few my friends now
have you to
channels and they may be workout
channels or maybe cooking channels but
they have YouTube channels and I kind of
give them advice on it so a lot of
people just find it very interesting and
then they start searching youtube for
content and stuff when I tell people
this usually something on YouTube that
you'll probably like to watch where this
epic meal time were my drunk kitchen or
a beauty channel or a gaming history or
anything like yeah now is it at what
point did you realize that you were that
you were a success that's kind of a lame
question but like you come to a point
where you're like okay I'm making enough
money at this now where it's like I can
quit my day job as you did but it mean
do you remember an exact moment at which
you were like wow this this could be the
the major focus of my life I almost
saves a couple moments I remember when
Chris Pirillo he he recognized me really
and I can't remember exactly what it was
was internet in and it was but Chris
Grillo someone that watched all the time
and also hotel I'm member it was for an
apple event maybe and I WWDC
announcement of something like that but
I was you streaming at the time and I
had like a whole bunch of years like I
had I came 100 over a hundred thousand
stuff like that viewers and then someone
I was like hey I saw you on you know leo
laporte stream and so he was kind of
just searching are you streaming he used
on a live stream as well so who's this
guy with except my hundred years cuz I
have more views than him at that time
and so I actually recorded that part it
was like oh man he's doing something
right and actually recorded that and say
that to my computer because leo laporte
patrick nord and all these other people
are like you know superstars to me and
when i when i started seeing them and
kind of you know kind of seeing them
just even looking at my stuff that else
no they made me made me feel good that's
a pretty profound moment there ya know I
love that I've experienced the same
thing at sort of press events where it's
like about a year ago or sometime
sitting down at a table and we're
getting ready for a press briefing I
kind of look next to him like oh wow
there's that there's that person whose
stuff I've been reading for ten years
that's that's awesome that's fun I was
kind of happiness like you just it snow
is just kind of you know you just just
realize one day okay this is what is
meant for me to do and then if you just
really work hard at it and you guess EF
success it's just kind of something
that's just a feeling that you get that
it just kind of never goes away you put
it exactly as I did I was a friend of
mine had called me up and asked me to do
a a theater project and he was a friend
from my period my life when I was acting
full-time and he and I was explaining to
him why I couldn't do it because I you
know it's busy with pocket now and I
said almost exactly the same thing I'm
like yeah listen I really think I think
I'm it's hard to explain but I think I
meant to do this right now I think that
I'm really you know well suited for what
I'm for what I'm up to at the moment and
that's a nice feeling when you you feel
like you're doing what you're supposed
to be doing right yeah that's something
that you know a lot of people don't get
that opportunity you know for whatever
you know life throws at you you know I
look at all time is my military path
took me this this way or I went with
this unit you know I wouldn't have the
opportunity to do this and so it's kind
of like you gotta feel blessed that
you're able to do something that you
actually love a lot of people have to
work just because they need the money
and they have to do this particular job
because nothing else but then you know a
lot of it sometimes you get that every
opportunity to see that opportunity to
go ahead and take that chance and do
whatever you really like to do and you
got to just really be fortunate to go at
it it's true that's awesome let's um now
that we've gotten to the to the deep
place let's let's talk a little bit
about something narrower I want to ask
you about your relationship with iOS hmm
you had a great video a couple weeks
back that was titled you use Apple you
suck and it was a comment on I love it
when people poke the fanboys I think
that's a lot of fun when you kind of
like rile up the extremists we're
basically were commenting on this
culture in our line of work that
innately d values people who buy Apple
products particularly in mobile and I
wonder if if you could talk a little bit
more about your relationship with that
like how often do people show up in your
comment feeds just like taking you down
for using an iphone all the time and
there's the people that see comment like
all this guy reviews as Apple products
I'm like these are we beam port android
products like over a time period and
and usually I I don't it's just kind of
confusing there's this whole fanboy
loyalty thing that I think people only
associate fanboys with apple and I'm
like dude I'd like to use degree
deodorant I've been using degree
deodorant for 10 years now straight A my
degree fanboy I'll guess you can say
that but is that really a bad thing and
I'm not bashing everything other all the
other daughters I just like to use what
I'll know it's going to work for me and
you drew another parallel to GTA 5 with
people waiting in line and you're like
well you're waiting in line you could
pre-order this and get it 24 hours later
but you're waiting in line so are you a
a rock star fanboy and the call of duty
people you know I wait for calling you
out of line even though I can go in at
nine o'clock at ten o'clock in morning
as soon as it opens oh just go over
walmart at any time and by it's just
that if you really like something and
your passion and you really excited for
it it's not a bad thing and you know and
I but a lot of people associated people
waiting in line you know for Apple
products s oh you're justjust I sheep
and all this stuff but it just it just
irks me the wrong way and a lot of
people don't speak up and like I would
speak up about it i don't care if these
some android people maybe enjoy
loyalists don't watch me now some people
say they actually unsubscribe from me
because of that I'm like okay but I'm
gonna speak up for what I think is just
ignorance it's just really stupid and
make people realize that a lot of people
who use Apple products they don't they
don't care about Apple stock price they
don't care about Android versus iOS I
mean your mom your auntie your
grandfather your brother and sister they
probably have iPhones but three do they
really actually watch youtube videos on
iphone stuff most people don't they just
use it because it fits their lifestyle
and it works in the same day for Android
the same thing for windows phone and all
those other os's people use them because
it works for them there's still people
using blackberries now and you can mock
them to make fun of them if you wanted
to but they use it because it works for
them and that's nothing wrong with it so
that's the reasonable person's
perspective yeah which I which I share
but as you know we deal with a lot of
irrationality on a day-to-day basis from
from everyone and you get those people
who are like apples unfollow but what
what do you think is the source of that
this has been something that's kind of
been rolling over in my brain for for a
long time where it's like yes you get
people who hate on Android and Windows
Phone and even get people who hate
over blackberry but there doesn't seem
to be the type of rage that exists in
people who hate apple I mean these these
people really really can't stand it and
I wonder if you can speak to what do you
think to be the source of that I think
it's just the source of something that's
very popular sometimes people if they
see something that's really popular I
know a lot of people that really like to
Instagram well I'll say this man
instagram was ios-only i know a lot of
people were saying all only hipsters use
that and all his other stuff but it
second with Android it was fine and it's
like I think people are kind of afraid
of something that may be popular and
something that they're not already using
and this scared to kind of go see what
it is because they don't want to seem
like they're a follower or I sheep and I
think that's best part of what it is
that happens you know throughout our
lives you know you see this you don't
want to do something that's popular
because you don't seem you're following
other people but I've always said that
Apple is a LeBron James attack you know
you can't deny that the guy is good and
have skill and it's really you know
almost probably the best player you know
in the league right now but there's a
second people that just really hate
LeBron James but whatever reason you
know the athletes have done crazier
stuff and I just always compare Apple to
be in the Brawn Jane you can't deny that
they're really good but only the people
can do to really just talks trash about
with visibility comes comes hatred and
that Instagram example you gave was apt
because for a long time Instagram wasn't
on Windows Phone and that was the
attitude in the Windows Phone camp was
like anytime I wrote a piece about
Instagram there's a guaranteed to be at
least one person shows was a guy
instagram well whatever and like what
phone do you use Lumia 920 like okay I
understand now that it's there it's like
okay we're all kind of understand but
whatever so that that's that's the Apple
situation what about what if you were
you carry a 5s is your daily driver
right what if you were to carry
something else you cannot carry an
iphone at all what if you were forced to
carry a device from another platform
what would it be have you ever given any
thought to that well you know um I i
would say that actually now may I should
made a video talking about switching to
android
because I was really loving android 4.4
kitkat is awesome I really love
everything with that OS and I actually
walk around with the Nexus 5 and iphone
5s now we're down one because i use i
use google glass a lot now so it has my
glass app and I could screen cast and
all that stuff but to I just really love
kik app but then I love the iphone 5ss
camera more and I'd love it yes slightly
better battery life than the nexus 5
which is amazing because I that's better
isn't all that amazing himself but if I
for what I'm safe here right now if I
had to pick one phone it would it will
probably be google play edition of the
HTC One or they really get one which one
which one would it be i would say i was
i would say the HTC One I loved I loved
that feel of it that aluminum feel it
just feels awesome your hand so you'd be
willing to sacrifice the the expandable
battery and the removal letter is kind
of water st for the build quality what
you're used to that using a knife on me
yeah yeah never you know really you know
use that at all unless i mean i was
testing out another device like this
forward i had that capability but yeah I
usually carry around a little mophie
juice pack with me anyway in my car just
in case my phone died so i think i'm
fine with the battery issue and and that
in the store its issue but and as the
cloud gets more improved improve you
know just store stuff up there it should
be fine yeah it's it's funny how that
was kind of insidious i did i found
myself all of a sudden very cloud
dependent but that's not the way i were
to say i mean very yeah cloud present I
suppose because all of a sudden I was
switching between phones and my normal
course of reviewing stuff I'm like wait
I don't have to move any media I don't
need a microSD card because all my stuff
is on Spotify or it's on google play
stuff or whatever yeah great convenient
uh it's got so cool i like that that's
about the answer I expected google play
edition HTC One the google play edition
was a nice nice twister and Stocking
android is just easily the best yeah
love it would you carry the Moto X um
mmm no I mean I like it but I'll
probably still choose a cc one uh-huh
that's cool i i i dig i understand it
would be it would be a tough choice for
me too i mean i'm a moto x super fan but
but i also love the one so
let's um we got to start wrapping up
here because we we each have other stuff
to get to but I really want to return to
a point we'd sort of brought up before
um advice there are so many people out
there now in the in the world who want
to do what we do and there are a lot of
people already doing what we do I said
on a previous episode the VIP that I go
to like CES or something we go to a
press only event where these events are
closed to everyone including like
spouses and things like it's just press
and there are literally thousands of
people there covering technology so it's
not the easiest field to get into
anymore as it once was back in two
thousand seven why all you had was a boy
needed was a camera a youtube account so
what what best practices would you
advocate for people looking to get into
it starting obviously with do what you
love to do and let that show right yeah
don't go after what you may think will
make you the most money just really find
a topic but no matter what is if it's
just cameras focus just on cameras if it
just cell phones or if it's pottery or
whatever you know find that topic that
you can talk a lot about and and you can
be really passionate about and and your
viewers will clean go on to that now
they latch on do that because they say
see you really like talking about what
you like so they'll like listening to
you you can really portray that and to
just really don't don't worry about the
money because it look it I did it for
two and a half years before making any
type of money so don't worry about the
money some people will be able to make a
living off of it some people won't you
just have to get into it start doing
what you alike and then you may not know
final cut like I did but I found a way
around it by using ScreenFlow it's a
little bit easier for me you know keep
working and your videos will get better
and just put out whatever you have right
now it may be crappy so what all
everybody's a lot of popular youtubers
you go back to the early videos or
crappy just like mine but you have
videos and you'll get better with your
equipment you'll get better with your
light and you get better with the audio
you get better with everything and and
how to talk in front of the camera and
it's on you're going to do that by
making videos on a consistent basis and
so yeah that's basically just find
something you love to talk about or make
a video about and then just keep at it
and if it's something you really want to
do you'll find that your success may not
be as big as some
I elses but the success within yourself
we're doing something that you really
like to do it will be more than enough
absolutely and do you ever consider
branching out to two different media I
mean YouTube is obviously or your bread
and butter I mean I mean do you have do
you use other video networks vimeo and
things of that sort I'm not for my
YouTube not for my tech stuff that's
something that I probably should be
doing but I revision3 so they they push
out my content or a lot of the different
networks like AOL and then add videos
and like the Virgin Atlantic flight and
stuff so then that work really takes you
know take a band it takes takes
advantage of all those other different
opportunities forming them really
gracious for that but yeah I'm open to
branch out to basically anything and
with this new year coming that hopefully
we'll be able to take advantage some of
that stuff that's awesome I I do hope to
see you there and do you ever do I'm
like audio only podcast we have our
antique pocket net weekly which I insist
remain audio only even though we have a
lot of hangout base series do you ever
do ever guessed on audio podcast I guess
