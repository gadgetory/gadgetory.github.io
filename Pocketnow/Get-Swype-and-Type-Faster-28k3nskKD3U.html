pocketnow.com
the new verizon samsung omnia ii comes
with a new on-screen keyboard called
swipe and swipe is kind of new because
it allows you to type without lifting
your finger on this touchscreen which
makes you type faster in my opinion I
was actually using it and I was quite
impressed by how much faster I was able
to type with swipe the guys at XD
developers have extracted swipe from the
omnia - so that you can use it on a
device like the HD - or the touch pro2
or the HTC pur really any device with a
WVGA screen so let's take a look at
swipe and see exactly how it works and
how fast it is I'm going to open up word
mobile here and I'm going to click on
new and here you can of course choose
the different keyboards by tapping and
holding on the keyboard button down here
so let's do a test let's type the quick
brown fox and I'm just going to slide my
finger along and not lift my my finger
off of the screen
the quick brown fox they got an extra X
there but I'm not being very precise
when I type which is really amazing now
I'm gonna type today is Christmas Eve
amazing let's try a longer sentence this
is going to take a little bit of
practice to get used to I think I'm
actually going to use this in my
full-time text entry method because it
just works so well let's type I wonder
what the Apple tablet will be like
there we go and it says Abel it made a
mistake but pretty pretty darn good for
just typing out a message very quickly
so again we'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get swipe I
think it's one of the best choices and
on-screen keyboards to come around in a
really long time that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
