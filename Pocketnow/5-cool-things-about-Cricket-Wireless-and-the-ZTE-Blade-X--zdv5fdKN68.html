again it's one of the main reasons why I
found Cricket Wireless software so
compelling to sponsor a video and test
their service out I've been using it for
a couple of weeks so far across a ton of
cities in the United States and it's
time for a verdict
I'm entering that with pocket now and
these are five cool things about Cricket
Wireless and the ZTE Blade X number five
has to be the company's coverage on
prepaid and I was able to test it out I
started this whole process in New York
City went to San Jose you then saw my
first video being in Maui I came to
Houston and then now I'm testing it in
New Orleans and I really have no
complaints on the service and then
there's the fact that you've got a ton
of plants to choose from you can go
inexpensive with limited data or you can
go unlimited data and even that option
is less expensive than the most maxed
out limited data options from competing
carriers really that's tough to beat
considering the fact that there are so
many options to consume content and
that's pretty much what everybody does
number four is their selection of
smartphones you can go fancy if you want
select an iPhone 10 iPhone 8 that's all
great you can also go for the galaxy s 8
as well but I decided to go and test
their mid-range offerings because I
think that's the best way to start not
everybody is a hardcore gamer not
everybody needs the best specifications
out there some people just need the
essentials and I feel it the best way to
test the service is if you try what they
offer in the mid-range and so far I
really have enjoyed the experience
number three definitely has to be the
ZTE Blade X again when we talk with
cricut about this video I have a
selection to choose from I again decided
to go for the mid-range mainly because
Qualcomm has done a very interesting
thing with their snapdragon 4 to 5
processor if you notice it is extremely
capable but most important the battery
life on this phone particularly is
insane and if you've watched any of my
reviews you know that I care about
three things number one being look and
feel number two has to be the battery
life and number three has to be the
flexibility the specifications on the
blade X are extremely capable the
experience is good and most important
you have expandable storage this is one
of the things that I care about most and
again you don't have to break the bank
to get a really good phone number two
definitely has to be DirecTV now this is
actually my first experience testing it
out and I am extremely impressed this is
where unlimited data comes really handy
the fact that you can start your movie
or program at home you can continue
watching it on your phone and the fact
that you've got a large display here
surely it's just 720p but that's pretty
much enough for video and then again the
advantage that you really don't have to
worry about consuming content and your
battery life which is something I really
care about a lot so I really like my
experience with DIRECTV now there are a
ton of flexible plants that you can
choose from again all this is obviously
optional you don't really have to get
this but it's great to have the option
available and finally the top number one
feature of my testing period of Cricket
Wireless and the ZTE Blade X has to do
with the advantages of prepaid this has
been my story for the past five to six
years I've relied heavily on prepaid
services mainly because I travel a lot I
love the flexibility of just swapping
another SIM card when I travel and then
coming back to the United States and
being able to just replenish the service
that I want I've heard so many sob
stories of people not being able to do
this because they're locked into a
contract or they pay horrible roaming
fees whenever they travel abroad I don't
have to deal with that problem I simply
replenish the service when I need to and
I love the advantage of all the
different data plans available I can
choose whatever I need depending on the
amount of time that I am in every
particular country and in this case
would be the United States again this is
my story I would love to know about your
case in the comments down below let us
know what you think of our Cricket
Wireless and would you be willing to
consider the service because listen I
know that a lot of people get worried
over us doing sponsored content because
that may deviate our opinion on a
product but if you notice
we rarely do sponsored videos the only
reason why we were willing to do this
one in particular is because this is one
service I would highly recommend let us
know in the comments what you think my
experience so far has been great friends
