past I've shown you an awful lot of
custom roms roms that aren't distributed
by the big name brand manufacturers HTC
Samsung and the like well my favorite
one has been cyanogenmod today i want to
show you aokp and it's full of pink
unicorns let's go take a look so this is
my samsung galaxy nexus the GSM variety
we'll go ahead and turn it on here and
you'll notice first of all I wasn't
kidding about pink unicorns it does have
a rainbow mane I don't know if that's a
redeeming quality or not but there you
have it it's a traditional typical lock
screen with a few cool additions first
of all we do have the date and time we
have the battery in percentage which is
cool and then we've got the weather up
here where it says where I'm located
what the temperature is and what the
weather's like right now Syracuse 48
degrees Fahrenheit and it is fair this
can also show you your calendar events
upcoming right down in here as well I
haven't wired up a calendar to show that
to you but it's got that capability now
down here in the bottom you'll notice
we've also got our little circle
unlocked we can automatically launch the
camera app or unlock the phone right
there so we'll go ahead and unlock then
do that quite fast enough go ahead and
unlock that and over here let's take a
look that was a bug report from a
previous take by the way this is still
kind of buggy and before we get too deep
into it this is the AOKP that android
open kang project you can look up tang
there are lots of definitions basically
it's making something work on something
that it wasn't really designed to do for
example a cyanogenmod rom might be able
to be Kang into a t-mobile g1 I doubt it
but that would be an example of what a
king is so that's what these guys are
doing their they're hanging this rom and
this rum is based on the AOSP so let's
take a look first of all up here at
top we've got a battery percentage which
is really kind of cool seventy-nine
percent down here you can see my
transition really kind of cool but
before we go into that let's take a look
down here now down on the bottom you'll
notice well what is that that's a phone
icon and that's a search icon down here
in my navigation bar how on earth can
that be well it's really kind of cool
and I can customize these I can make
them whatever I want I can I mean even
apps and i can add stuff remove stuff i
can have three I can have one I can have
five really really cool I can long press
on search and get my speak now stuff
that I haven't had before because you
know that search button has been gone so
now my voice actions are a lot easier to
get to and I don't have my persistent
search bar across the top so really kind
of cool there so we actually have two
things working together we have nova
launcher and this is the nova launcher
that comes with the ROM it's actually
been updated through a market update
since then and then we've got the actual
AOKP custom rom itself you do have to be
routed to install this it installs just
like any other wrong you've got rom
manager you can install that from you've
got your your custom recovery in this
case clockworkmod that i flashed it from
you do need to wipe any custom rom that
you have so you're starting fresh with
this one not getting things confused so
we've got the two things interacting
nova launcher there is a paid version
you can get that has extra features i'm
not showing you that I'll show you where
those paid features are and then of
course the AOKP itself so we were
talking about these custom navigation
bar settings let's go ahead and take a
look at that but while we're doing that
we're going to pass some things along
the way that I'd like you to take a look
at so first let's pull down our tray
here and you'll notice right away we've
got a really cool powered control
essentially we can turn Wi-Fi on or off
gps on or off all kinds of cool stuff we
can set the brightness of the screen
right there very quick and easy really
really cool i like it a lot we'll set
that
back to Otto and it slowly ramps that
brightness backups are really kind of
cool there but I can make all these
changes one thing I don't like when I
tap on settings it just hides that it
doesn't take me to the settings and I
don't know if you noticed or not but not
all of the settings are listed there now
there's a lot of cool toggles but not
all the settings are so I'd like that to
be the default settings app if you will
the control panel it's not we have to
live with it fair enough fast charge
we've talked about bass charging a
couple of other articles I think we did
a video on it essentially fast charge is
a way to push more milliamp into the
phone so it charges faster now this is a
samsung I don't know of any other
devices that do it but Samsung devices
in particular seem to like charging when
pins two and three on the USB USB down
there on the charger itself one pins two
and three are bridged or shorted it'll
tell the phone hey charge faster well if
you've got a samsung charger it works
great if you've got a generic charger or
you're charging over USB which is how i
charged it doesn't charge faster charges
just not super fast so using that
setting right there it essentially tells
the OS at the kernel level to just
ignore the fact that those pins are
jumped and you can enable fast charging
of course if you don't want to you can
toggle that off it comes off by default
so that's some cool stuff let's go into
more settings this is settings for the
ROM itself looks like your typical
settings dialog box we're going to go
ahead and come down here Oh actually
back up to the top a little bit you'll
notice under quick links we have rum
control so let's open up rom control and
in here it's got some information about
the aokp people that you can donate to
if you like it and want to contribute to
the the work and let me just say this
started out as well this was the first
custom rom that I ran on my galaxy nexus
because they didn't have Knightley's of
of ice cream sandwich for cyanogenmod
when i started getting in and hacking
around with this phone so
I went to the aokp I used it you know
and I couldn't get past the the pink
unicorns sorry about that but I couldn't
since then they've made a lot of
progress this is build 31 so make sure
that you're getting that i'll put a link
to that over in the article of
pocketnow.com let's go ahead and take a
quick look at some of the options that
you can set here there's a lot of them
so we're going to go really fast general
you I this is where we can disable the
boot animation yes it is a pink unicorn
you can disable that right there
disabled bug mailer I don't know what
that is I think that's if you run into a
bug it will email them like I kind of
showed you a little bit earlier I think
that's where you could turn that off if
you wanted to allow 180 degree rotation
lets you rotate your phone 180 degrees
even upside down really awesome in fact
I like that quite a bit sometimes you
just need to have it in a different
position like at my desk at work I have
the headphones and the USB charging
coming out of here and it's rotated you
can see just like that so i can now see
the screen and I've got better access to
my ports so really kind of cool there a
horizontal recent window this is not on
by default basically it lets you have a
webos style task switcher so we can look
at that and see okay this is what it
looks like here versus the up and down
you might like it you might not personal
preference you can turn that off if you
want to LCD density I haven't played
with that current density is 320 if you
want to set that higher lower you can do
that that makes stuff bigger and smaller
from what I understand the off animation
cr2 style you know where you turn off an
old style TV and it pinches and you've
got that bright white line just like
that that's what that does that's how
you can turn that on and off the input
method editor switcher if you've got a
keyboard open you might want to switch
to a different keyboard this is
particularly helpful when you want to
switch between say swipe and the
standard android keyboard you can do
that enable volume options i haven't
played with that i assume its options
that have to do with volume yes that's
stating the obvious for a little bit of
humor there custom carrier label
I've never seen this in action tell you
the truth I don't know where you see it
but I have set it to aokp they are quick
to warn you that once you set that it's
set the only way you can get rid of it
is to wipe the phone and start over with
a fresh install of the rum I don't know
where it is I thought that it would be
up here somewhere but you know what
there it is aokp it also appears on the
lock screen that's where that came from
too so learning stuff even while
shooting the video how about that hold
back to kill okay that sounds devious
but it's not what that means is if
you're in an app you can press and hold
the back button and it will end that
task and take you to the previous screen
really kind of convenient I find myself
accidentally toggling that so I have
that set to off let's go ahead and take
a look at the next section and that is
the navigation bar that's probably why
you're watching this video because holy
crap this is awesome so let's go into
the nav bar we can set the menu location
to right left both move whatever kind of
cool there I think what that lets you do
is you know when I rotate my phone I
like having my menu down here versus
over here and vice versa some people
might like it on the other side and
there are times when I felt that it was
on the wrong side when it rotated so I
think that might do that I'm not
entirely sure it's probably the three
dots though haven't played with it find
out let us know in the comments there's
your homework menu a visibility how and
when do you want the menu buttons to
appear right there very simple you can
have it all a show and that didn't
always show so who knows we'll set it
back to default navigation bar color you
can set the color to whatever you want
we're not going to mess around with that
too much right now the navigation barros
jumped ahead quantity I've set it to
five at defaults to three that's these
buttons down here I've got it to five so
we can do other cool stuff and I'll show
you that so let's say I don't want this
to be a phone anymore I want here's a
tip for you took me a little while to
figure this out if I tap over here on
the icon it will let me change the icon
based on a picture that I have in my
gallery if I have an icon folder that's
great I don't so it's not going to show
you anything that's worthwhile but it
does let you do crops and whatnot if you
have an image that you want to use and
you can crop out the section that you
want don't one in the meantime it uses
the default icon for the app if you tap
over on the left side you can pick what
the action is rather than what the icon
is we're going to choose a custom app
let's say we want to get something else
let's do all applications and instead of
phone we want to do people so just like
that now its people and when I tap on
that it launches my people app so very
very cool I can even set something too
long press so let's say I want to long
press this and have it be a dialer so I
can go ahead and come in here to phone
now when I long press it launches my
dialer very very cool so I can do the
same thing for all of those other
buttons down there including setting up
search which is just right there in one
of the default actions really cool i
like it a lot you can set a blank if you
want to have some spacing space it out a
little bit better for you you can set
the glow animation when you tap on it
you've got that glow well it turns out
by faster you set that the faster your
phone is so or at least when you're
interacting with that area i should say
so i've got this set to super quick you
can even set it to off quick and normal
normal of course is the slowest and it
gets faster and faster from there all
the way up you can set the transparency
of those buttons you can see that all
the way they're gone to all the way
super bright I like mine somewhere in
the middle and they're just kind of fair
it really kind of cool what happens in
the long press on home well I've got
mine wired up to go to my recent list
really cool there I can set the width
and the height I haven't done that I've
just set it to 42 DP whatever dps are as
the default no jokes about that guys ok
and if you get stuff all screwed up you
can reset the nav bar right there so
we're falling behind under timeline
let's look at the next in lockscreen
really fast we can choose the wallpaper
wallpaper Picard just like you're used
to you can change the style which stock
quad octo AOSP honeycomb it's set at
honeycomb right now you can play around
with all these it's just preference what
does it look like menu unlock so if
you've got a menu icon that can unlock
the screen for you a lot more helpful if
you've got physical buttons rather than
these guys we'll go ahead and turn that
off because I don't have that that
change does require a reboot the wait to
lock screen this is very very handy i
like this quite a bit when i turn the
phone off or when it goes to sleep i can
set a specific amount of time to wait
before when turning the screen back on
the lock screen appears I don't like it
when it's immediate because often times
i turn it off and i forgot something i
have to turn right back on then i have
to unlock its pain in the neck so i can
set a time out here and say don't show
me the lock screen for 30 seconds 45
seconds whatever it is just know that
I'm turn it right back on still me fair
enough really really cool feature i love
it i like it quite a bit standard
android has that when the screen times
out but they don't have it when you turn
it off by hitting the power button this
lets you do both and you can do that
with cyanogenmod as well los screen
battery percentage shows you the battery
percentage on the lock screen great it's
awesome it shows you up here in the
status bar too but it's nice to have
that on the the locks lock screen
whether if you've enabled the ROM
controls Weather Service you can use
that it does have to go out get your
location it is network-based location
that GPS so it takes less power than
turning your GPS chip on and off and
then of course it has to get the the
weather information for that put it on
your home screen or your lock screen so
it does take a little bit of overhead
for me it's worth it volume wake you can
use the volume keys to turn the phone on
I particularly don't like that and
why because I can have volume music
controls when I'm listening to music now
whether that's Pandora whether that's
google music or some other player when I
have my screen off it'll time off after
a time or timeout after a time and then
I can change to next track just by
hitting up or down with the volume
controls really kind of nice of course
that means it's not being a volume
control at the time so if you do a lot
of volume changing you might not want to
enable that mines disabled right now
just because but again you can't have
volume wake and volume music controls
operating at the same time if you're
listening to music you can if you're not
listening to music and then they play
just fine lock screen calendar this is
what I told you about I don't have a
calendar set up on this rom yet so it
didn't show me any appointments but you
can have it so you just turn your phone
on and it shows you to your next
appointment without having to get into
your phone without unlocking it it's
right there really fast really like it
you know that'd be super cool for say a
Windows Phone challenge maybe I don't
know anyway let's get back here time
range this is about the calendar how
many days do you want to look forward a
day three days however long use colors
color coded events and whatnot hide
ongoing events multiple events blah blah
blah bass torch I would love to show you
this but it wasn't working right for me
it were great off camera and when I try
to do it on camera it just broke
essentially what this is supposed to do
is when your screen is off and i think
it's also when it's locked i think that
was my problem you press and hold the
power button and just press and hold it
and the torch the LED will turn on and
it will stay on until you let go of the
power button and then it will turn off
really cool now your phone is a
functional useful flashlight it's not
like those apps that you have to turn on
your phone unlock your phone find the
app hit the button use the slider click
the thing okay great turn it off no you
just pull it out of your pocket and
press and hold you've got a flashlight
let go and the flashlights off it's
perfect it's the way it's supposed to be
why didn't we do this before I don't
know probably because it doesn't work
right but I'm sure they're working on
that
horizontal lock screen yes I can have a
lock screen and horizontal orientation
it's not going to show you because I
have that timeout but you can actually
have lock screen right there which is
nice when you have this set down in an
impromptu dock or set down in an actual
dock that uses the phone's pogo pins
really cool I like it I like being able
to rotate it and it's fast enough now an
ice cream sandwich that I don't mind the
extra time that it takes to rotate quick
pin unlock show lock screen before
unlock I don't like that one I think you
know yeah you can play around with it
and then you can set up some custom
targets to to launch apps right there
lock screen lots of cool stuff you can
do power menu you can add stuff to the
power minus like screenshot power saver
torch airplane mode navigation bar lots
of cool stuff turn them on and off as
you like them and that's just you come
over here it lets you set that very very
cool very fast a really nice way to to
get lots of stuff right there in fact if
you hit reboot it will ask you how you
want to reboot you want to reboot the
phone do you want to reboot into
recovery really awesome I like it a lot
here's the weather part that we were
talking about where you can enable or
disable the service use a custom
location just so you know what I'm in
Syracuse this is my zip code just don't
worry about me i'm always here or if
that's unchecked it will use your rough
or your course network location to find
where you are it'll show the location as
well so you know where you are and i do
that because sometimes getting your
network location can be done via your
Wi-Fi and depending on your Wi-Fi
sometimes it thinks that i'm in
scottsdale arizona which needless to say
is significantly warmer than syracuse
utah if you want to have it so that
helps me double check that i know i mean
syracuse or scottsdale or wherever again
using your course network not your gps
location that's why it does that there's
advantages disadvantage metric units i'm
in the US we don't use metric so i have
that on toggled you can enable that and
they'll show your temperature in celsius
and they'll show your wind speed in
kilometers per hour
and Fahrenheit and miles per hour
respectively refresh interval I've got
that set to an hour I figure you know
this is Utah the weather changes every
hour anyway so set that to 60 minutes
we're good to go nice thing about Utah
if you don't like the weather wait an
hour statusbar weather style we can have
a weather panel we can have it above the
carrier text we can have it disabled
I've got a weather panel I really don't
know where that is where's the status
bar I don't know but that's something
you can play around with and of course
let us know when you find out in the
comments power saver this is kind of
cool i like it and i don't like it at
the same time this lets you control how
you can save power based on the
condition of your phone so for example
when the screen is off what do I want to
do with my data well I want to switch to
2g because 2g takes less power than 3G
unless you're using it all the time and
then it takes more I know that doesn't
make a lot of sense but if i turn off 3g
and switch over to do g generally
speaking when the screens off I don't
care if the this data is going to come
in and it's going to save me some
battery life I can even turn data off
entirely or you know don't do anything
at all I can set a delay on how long
that takes so I've got it set to a
minute here after one minute then switch
over to 2g seems to be working great and
set it anywhere from immediate to 30
minutes up to you sink action do you
want it to stop syncing do you want to
do something else when your screen is
off you can set that here what do you
want to do with Wi-Fi I'm going to leave
it alone you can turn it off you know
whatever you know what let's turn it off
because we still have 2g something to
keep in mind is that does mean that if
you're listening to pandora it's going
to switch you over to your data network
and start gobbling away at your precious
cellular data instead of your hopefully
unlimited Wi-Fi data so I turn that back
on sync data usage we can leave that
untouched whatever sync mobile data
preference we can prefer 3g whatever
lots of stuff that you can set set it to
how you want what works best for you LED
options that's your notification LED you
can change it to how long do you want it
to pulse on I've got it set to one
second we can leave it for 5 seconds
anywhere in between how long do we want
it to be off between pulses I've got it
set to 5 seconds so it'll be on one
second off five seconds on one second
off five seconds you can customize that
however you want you can even change the
color and there's a huge broad you can
change to any color that you want in
here it it's ridiculous you find what
you want set it you're good to go so
I've got mine at a nice blue and then
I've got it set to flash that led while
the screen is on so even when i'm using
something i want to know if i've got an
alert it's just a consistent you I thing
you know I'm a web developer so I like
consistency in you I if I've gotten
alert yeah I know I've got you know
notifications up here but I also always
have that regardless just something I do
and I like it if you don't you can
uncheck it whoo lots of stuff down few
things left and we're going to buzz
through these because they're not quite
as in-depth as those status bar we've
got general stuff we can auto hide the
toggles after you toggle something in a
lot of hide the bar so again up here if
you switch something it'll auto hide I
don't like that so I've got it turned
off you can enable the brightness
control I haven't really gotten this to
be able to work I don't think unless
it's that one let's see that's supposed
to let you slide across the the status
bar which I thought was up here to
control the brightness and you know it
just doesn't do that is that down here I
don't know I've got it right there any
way I like it there so I'm turning that
off if you don't like your USB debugging
icon come on we're developers we hook
these things up to our phones and we run
adb and whatnot across them all the time
so you might not want to have that
debugging icon on all the time you can
turn that off right there you're still
in USB debugging it just doesn't tell
you that and that might be nice if
you're a developer or if you're using
this rom and don't know what it is
because you're not a developer go ahead
and turn that off
transparency this is kind of cool you
can set the transparency of I believe
this area right here I have left it at
no transparency because it says turning
this on might affect performance and
battery life so I don't want to do that
can also change the notification tour
lay out just how do you want it to be
laid out regular reverse traditional I
like it the way it is so there we go
moving on to the next thing toggles we
can make these toggles first of all we
can enable or disable them which ones we
want which ones don't we want lots and
lots of stuff in there I don't know what
swagger is if you do let us know in the
comments down below and you do have
tether down here so that's kinda cool
let's turn that guy on and then look at
that there's my Wi-Fi access point I can
turn that on or off I can change the
order that they appear in pretty easy
there can change the toggle style from
the icon only to icon and text I can
also change it to be buttons with a
little line underneath instead of toggle
switches I like the toggle switches they
take up more space but you know it's a
better be you I in my in my opinion and
then of course if you screw something up
really you can reset that really fast
right there with a reset all toggles
clock that's pretty much basic anything
you want to see they're no good moving
on battery the cool thing i want to show
you about this you can change the
battery bar location you can also change
the icon style i like the circle mod
that tells me up here here's the circle
it's got that percentage right inside
it's easier to see for me that way to
know what the percentages and go from
there i can also turn on the charging
animation but it warns me that it may
result in a poor user experience and i
should enable at my own discretion i
haven't done it because I my discretion
says I shouldn't so I'm agreeing with
that you can set colors and the bar
thickness and whatnot there as well
signal if you want to change your signal
over here and your signal meters to show
you know percentages or to show how many
decibels instead of how many bars you
can do that
you can use text right there so I've got
eighty-two percent on my Wi-Fi all kinds
of cool stuff performance here's where
you don't have to have set cpu which is
a separate app for root users you can
set your scaling I've left this at
default which is 350 at the minimum 1200
at the maximum using an interactive
governor I haven't changed anything so I
don't need to set this at boot but if I
wanted to I could change those and then
check that box it's going to revert
those changes the next time i boot up
voltage control I can do that too I'm
not going to go into what voltage
controls are in this this video because
it's just an entirely different topic it
has to do with power savings and heat
savings and a bunch of other stuff look
up voltage control AOKP and you can find
out if you want to give us a quick
summary go ahead and do that down in the
comments below and just share your
knowledge with us as well you can also
come in here and do some some memory
based performance optimizations so free
memory you can say how much is the
minimum amount of free memory that it
should keep alive you can set that to
pretty much whatever you want in here as
soon as your free memory drops below
that threshold task killer will start
killing stuff off you can set that at
boot scrolling cash the the more
scrolling cash you have the better
scrolling looks but the more memory it
takes more memory it takes unless you
have to run out of stuff and the slower
things are so you can I've got it just
set to default you can change that
around and get in my experience just
marginal performance increases but you
might have a different experience so
that's how you can do it this is a
kernel tweak in another place where you
can set up fast charge I showed you the
other place before you can turn that off
turn that on there you go color
multipliers and gamma tuning that has to
do with the screen and how the colors
look if you want this to be night mode
you can do that and set it to kind of a
red that theoretically will also save a
lot of battery life because you're using
one out of the three pixels of course
those being are
gb you're only using the red and the red
is the most power-efficient of those
three pixels so you can save some power
there if you like doing that I only
really like that at night when i'm out
stargazing or whatnot last one is
startup tweaks and you can set all kinds
of stuff I've got it turn on it's turned
off by default I've got it set to
zipline apks so if you've got any any
apps are installed that are not aligned
zipline that'll do it on boot you can
enable SD boost which is essentially
caching to the SD card this phone
doesn't have an SD card so doesn't do me
any good there I can run fix permissions
sometimes when we're doing all this
stuff installing custom roms and whatnot
the permissions get screwed up this will
fix it the fix permissions process takes
a while so I've got that turned off it
only happens at boot but and not screen
on but actually boot up if I have a
problem I'll man manually run it I do
have it set to clear cache any cash that
was left over assist control don't know
what that is if you do let us know in
the comments down below and enable
schedule test yes cron jobs I haven't
got any I don't know what I'd use is a
cron job but maybe I need to upload
something every day at two o'clock I can
theoretically do that by enabling cron
right there okay so that's the ROM
control control panel the settings
essentially everything else is pretty
much the same let me show you right in
here about phone this is android 4.0 for
this is the aokp mugguru and it doesn't
show you in here but this is the it's
billed 31 actually it does right down
there don't 31 so you know what I'm
looking at one last thing we have to go
through and we're just going to touch on
it because this is really a good topic
for another video up coming in the
future and that's innova the launcher
that I've been showing you here is nova
launcher take a look at the stuff in
here i can do cool stuff with what are
my new apps or am i downloaded apps i
can come over here it has widgets that
are included in there and use a drawer i
can use a picker like the old style the
gingerbread style come over here to a
menu manage
cops going to nova settings directly so
i can go nova settings that are rather
than having a shortcut on my home screen
but it functions pretty much like what
you'd expect but there are a whole bunch
of other settings these settings are
really fun you can see this little
ribbon over here that says prime if you
can't read it and it is essentially what
you get if you upgrade to the paid
version which you can do via an in-app
purchase through the market or excuse me
the Play Store desktop how many screens
and wallpapers your grid the margins you
want to persistent search bar on the top
how many home screens do you want and
their location what kind of scroll
effect do you want cube card snack none
you want a faster device choose none
wallpaper scrolling you can set it to no
scrolling on static meaning only static
wallpapers on the images will scroll
whereas live wallpapers won't scroll
delayed which may help performance
scrolling with live wallpapers I've
never had a problem but if you want more
performance you can play around with
that infinite scroll if you want to just
keep scrolling to the right going to the
left I guess I got those backwards
didn't I you can keep going and going
and going it's just a loop so instead of
getting to the edge and then having to
scroll back the other way you can just
keep going and it will loop around and
around and around really kind of cool I
like it I haven't turned it on for this
wrong if you don't want labels
underneath your icons turn them off
right there your folder preview you can
set it to stack a grid a fan however you
want that to look the default is stack I
have left it there kind of cool set it
to whatever you want folder preview we
just look at the folder background you
want that to be a circle a square a
platform platform sounds cool or
something custom can do that too drawer
this is basically your your app drawer
do you want to show widgets in it yes or
no you do need root so yes you can get
this launcher and run it on a phone
without root you just can't get some of
the Rue dish features this is one of
them scroll effect this is the
transition when you scroll betraying it
do you want card sat cubed none whatever
well card stack works for me then if you
want to hide apps you've got apps
installed
you just don't want to see you can hide
them again that's a paid feature doc
that's your doc down here above your
navigation bar ok you can have doc pages
so you can have multiple scroll left and
right how many icons do you want in
there four five six two whatever you can
set that in there how much margin do you
want do you want a divider between the
doc and the rest of the icons on the
page I don't and then if you do have
multiple dot pages infinite scroll on or
off and if you want a shadow at the top
and the bottom of the screen I'm going
to turn that off just because I haven't
noticed it and if I haven't noticed it I
don't think I need it hey gestures I
haven't played with gestures because its
prime it's a paid-for thing you can
either enter a code or buy it through
the playscore play store or cancel
behavior just show you some stuff in
there back up all your settings or
restore them that you can do that right
there so really kind of cool like I said
this rom came with version 1.0 point one
there was a market update to 1.0 point
to that came in automatically for me I
can check for a new update just like
that if I want to says the current
version is the same version that I have
so okay good deal I can set my default
home if I don't want Nova Launcher
anymore I can come back in and just
choose regular launcher and we go back
to nova launcher because that's what i'm
showing you and then of course we showed
you the back up in there if you run into
bugs problems this is how the developer
knows you're just enabling error usage
and reporting or error and usage
reporting so that the developer can make
it better for all of us you can turn
that off if you don't want to
participate do you want to reset it
there you go and then of course another
plug to upgrade to the paid version of
nova launcher now I know I went through
that really fast just to kind of show
you what you could do with nova launcher
it is the launcher that comes with aokp
it is very nice I like quite a bit and
as long as I believe you have to have an
android-based excuse me an ice cream
sandwich based rom to run nova launcher
but it will run on even unrooted phones
just without the ability to run some of
that
rooted features that you saw in there
okay really really long video I
apologize for that guys but there was so
much stuff in here to show you if you
can get past the pink unicorn in fact
let's go ahead and change this to
something else how about there we go
much better Andy riding a unicorn with a
rainbow coming out its butt yay I don't
know why they picked unicorns but they
did you can turn them off you can get
rid of them do what you want it's an
awesome awesome rom it's very stable
except for some of the more advanced
weird features that you don't see our
normal phones like the power button to
turn on the flashlight and whatnot just
you know have fun with it and I would
highly recommend this if you don't want
to have a you know cyanogenmod rom or if
there's not one out there available for
you again apologize for the length lots
to show you what was your favorite part
let us know in the comments and if you
like seeing all this cool stuff you can
do especially a persistent search button
right there on your navigation bar give
the video a big thumbs up and ignore the
wounds on my fingers from working in the
yard leave us your comments let us know
head over to pocketnow.com so you can
see all kinds of cool articles and get
some links on where you can get this rom
and the nova launcher from the Play
Store for pocket now showing off aokp
custom rom i'm joe levi
