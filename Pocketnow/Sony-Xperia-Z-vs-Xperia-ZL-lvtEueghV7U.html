compare I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the Sony Xperia Z
versus a Sony Xperia ZL Sony announced
both the Xperia Z and the Xperia Z L at
CES in January both feature a closely
matched set of specifications that put
them among the top contenders in the
mobile market and both are built on the
same principle experience the best of
Sony in a smart phone
the most notable differences between the
Xperia Z and the ZL are in their design
Xperia Z as a taller narrower device
sandwiched between two slabs of scratch
resistant glass its design is much more
industrial a machined its edges are hard
and corners are sharp Xperia Z L is
shorter and more compact yet thicker it
also features a more ergonomic design
the power button is still in the middle
of the right edge but the volume rocker
is at the top a much more convenient
location for one-handed use it also
sports a physical shutter button while
its next-of-kin does not the faces of
the two devices look quite similar but
under close inspection there are some
minor differences the Xperia Z features
a tiny LED notification light in the top
left corner the Xperia Z L on the other
hand has a Snow dafuk ation LED at the
bottom of the face the front-facing
camera on the Xperia Z is also at the
top in the upper left corner while the
Xperia Z ELLs front-facing shooter is on
the bottom right corner where the Z L
truly differs from the Z is in its
industry-leading screen to bezel ratio
there's very little wasted space on the
face of the device around back the
Xperia Z L features a door where you can
access the micro SD card slot micro SIM
tray and a hard reset button unlike on
the Z the camera module on the Z L is
raised and the loudspeaker is found to
the right of the camera on the Z the
speaker is found on the right edge at
the bottom and it's easily covered up
that's not a good thing although the two
devices are very similar they feel quite
different despite the fact that the
plastic doesn't feel as substantial as a
glass panel on the back of the Z the
Xperia Z L fits more nicely in the hand
the slightly curved back and soft touch
finish on the Xperia Z L lends a better
grip to the user and gives the illusion
that the phone is smaller than it truly
is
making the 5-inch display feel more
manageable the Xperia Z L on the other
hand has a completely flat back these
hard edges make it feel larger than it
actually is the biggest difference in
terms of hardware is water and dust
roofing the Xperia Z comes with an ip55
and ip57 dust and waterproofing ratings
meaning it can withstand some abuse from
the elements it's watertight for up to
30 minutes at roughly a depth of 1 meter
there is a caveat though all the ports
are covered with watertight seals the
Xperia Z L on the other hand is not
waterproof so it's best to try to keep
that one dry under the hood differences
are few and far between they both
support the same 5-inch 1080p TFT
reality display with Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 they both have a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage they also both feature
the same 13 megapixel camera shipped
with Android 4.1 beneath Sony's
proprietary interface and the usual list
of connectivity NFC Bluetooth 4.0 and
Wi-Fi b/g/n the Xperia Z is listed as
supporting only up to 32 gigabytes of
expandable storage while the ZL is
listed as supporting up to 64 gigabytes
both equipped HSPA+ and LTE connectivity
but support for specific bands varies by
market and model the zo also gains an IR
blaster so the phone can be used as a
universal remote for your home
entertainment systems and lastly the
battery capacities are ever so slightly
different the Xperia Z has a twenty
three thirty milliamp hour battery while
the Xperia Z L carries a capacity of
twenty 370 milliamp hours
when it comes to software both the
Xperia Z and ZL come equipped with
Android 4.1 out of the box and both are
expected to receive updates to 4.2 in
the not-too-distant future the software
on both devices is virtually identical
they come with the same applications
pre-installed all the same wallpapers
icons and themes but only after casually
cruising through the settings
application did we notice one small
difference the white balance calibration
tool is present under the display
settings on the Xperia Z L while it's
entirely absent only Xperia Z
out-of-the-box the Xperia Z ELLs display
was noticeably more warm than the Z's
display considering they both used the
same panel is safe to assume they are
calibrated differently so that
calibration utility could definitely
prove useful all in all the designs of
both the Xperia Z and Xperia Z all are
fantastic though they have nearly
identical spec sheets and look and feel
differently they offer a similar
experience and portray the same message
Sony is not messing around
both are possibly the best work we've
ever seen from sony from a manufacturing
standpoint and this appears to be what
could be the turning of a new leaf for
Sony and mobile so that's all for our
comparison of the Xperia Z and the
Xperia Z L be sure to LIKE the video if
