hounds new voice assistant hound can do
but how does it stack up against similar
services I'm high as a human with pocket
now and let's compare hound with Google
now Cortana and Cirie schedule a meeting
at work on saturday at 8am yes what's
the title meeting ok do you want to say
this yes ok
here is your meeting perfect what do you
want to call it meeting sure I'll have
meeting at work for saturday at 8am is
that right yes sure thing what is the
distance between indianapolis and tokyo
in miles the distance from Indianapolis
Indiana to Tokyo is 6459 miles the
distance is approximately six thousand
four hundred fifty eight miles from
Indianapolis to Tokyo it's the only one
that doesn't do that who directed
Jurassic Park
Steven Spielberg according to wikipedia
Jurassic Park is a nineteen ninety-three
american science fiction adventure film
directed by steven spielberg it is the
first installment of the Jurassic Park
film showing search results for who
directed Jurassic Park quite so Steven
Spielberg split a 75-dollar bill three
ways nice now split it five ways doesn't
even try sheriff the total per person is
$25 now split it five ways okay using a
party of five people share of the total
per person is fifteen dollars very nice
so there you have it all the personal
assistants have their own pros and cons
and which is the best is ultimately up
to you to decide it's important to keep
in mind that this test was exclusively
focusing on voice input using natural
language other features like Google
Mouse contextual cards are also very
important to factor in and we may cover
those in a future video if you enjoyed
this video be sure to give us a thumbs
up and leave a comment down below and
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already for pocket now this has been hi
out to Houston and hey thanks for
