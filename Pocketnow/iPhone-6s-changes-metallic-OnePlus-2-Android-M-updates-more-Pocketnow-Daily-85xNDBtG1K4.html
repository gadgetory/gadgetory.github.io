might get a little thicker one plus CEO
teases some metal in the design of the
oneplus 2 and it seems we might get an
android and preview on legacy Nexus
devices I'm hiding that I and I don't
know about you but I need a break so
tgif this is pocket out daily the
official news today could start with the
corporate battle on Twitter that's more
like TMZ territory i'm not going to be
reporting on you know John leisure and
Mozilla flouse it going at each other
t-mobile CEO and sprint CEO but the cool
thing is after reading those news that
the t-mobile CEO is teasing that there
is something major gonna happen next
week we're not sure if it's another
uncarrier coming but he does tease that
it does have a lot to do with Apple
music joining music freedom stay tuned
for that and speaking of corporate
teasers particularly from one plus the
company has been doing a tremendous job
with that even though we're pretty much
a couple of weeks away from the product
1 plus CEO Peter lavis just come on
record to state that we could expect a
metal enclosure for this product
something which would be really cool
with the 1+2 we're just not sure how the
price tag is going to handle that but we
will be looking forward to this in the
next few days after those of you die
hard blackberry fans that would love to
see it running on Android and we've got
two very interesting renders of android
running on two existing products pretty
much one of them is the blackberry
passport the other one is a good
question we're not really sure which
exact blackberry it is it could be that
new blackberry that's coming but yeah it
looks terrible on the passport but it
could be that we are getting just a
touch screen blackberry here which is
not necessarily something we want it we
wanted a keyboard here but hey that's
just me and even though we have lost
hope for the possibility of Android app
running on legacy devices like the Nexus
4 Nexus 7 or nexus 10 it does seem that
the source code for Android M does prove
that there is a built for these products
we're not sure if this will ever get
released we're not sure if this is just
a testing phase but it could be that
there will be a preview for these
products again we don't have a timeline
but if you still have one of these
products you never know and finally for
the very interesting news of the day
even though we were disappointed
ended with the leaks of the iphone
success because the chassis looks
identical to the iphone 6 case makers
are already shining in and it seems that
these products are actually thicker by a
hair point 1 millimeter each but it
seems that the thickness and it is a
well some of us are assuming that it
could be battery life I wouldn't get our
hopes up I think that it has a lot to do
with the poor such technology which
apparently needs a thicker this way and
that's the general consensus for mothers
so it could be that apple will make
these iphones thicker which is a first
ever since the third generation iPad
this has not been common but it could be
the case right now and it does lead me
to the question of the day would you be
bothered by a thicker iphone is it
something you would care about because
in my case I wouldn't but if they
brought us better battery life leave us
