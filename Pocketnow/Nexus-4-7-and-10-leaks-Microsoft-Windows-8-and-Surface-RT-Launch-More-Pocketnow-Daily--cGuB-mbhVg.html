microsoft launches windows 8 and their
surface RT and the samsung galaxy note
reaches verizon and AT&amp;amp;T I'm hi never
iveta wondering what the Nexus 5 and 6
are going to look like and this is
poking out daily that's right the batch
of Nexus device rumors continue first of
all the LG Nexus 4 was leaked by a
retailer apparently you'll get it in
black and white and I'll be ready for
shipping on October thirtieth which is
just a day after launch date then the
nexus 7 shows up at the FCC with their
cellular model though you know how
that's going to be hidden october 29th
we've also got some leaked user manuals
for the nexus 10 which apparently is
built by sam sing again though I'd like
to believe that thing until I see it on
october 29th now even though the u.s.
variants of the samsung galaxy s3 were
slated to be last to receive android 4.1
jelly bean a recent leaked memo from
sprint shows that apparently the upgrade
is available today now the upgrade
hasn't reached our review unit just yet
so we'd like to ask you commenters any
of you have a sprint galaxy s3 can you
please check if you get the upgrade
leave us a comment now whether you like
the verizon logo on the home button or
not verizon has just confirmed the
samsung galaxy note 2 on their network
and it's available for pre-order
starting today and you'll get it by
November 27 that's right that's a full
month from now but AT&amp;amp;T is doing the
same they're offering the AT&amp;amp;T variant
of the galaxy note 2 starting today and
they went for the more conservative
price of 299 after a two-year contract
which just makes the pricing from
t-mobile astonishing you have to face
369 for the device you don't get out to
eat on t-mobile now speaking of AT&amp;amp;T
they've just announced the pricing and
availability for their James Bond sony
xperia TL it'll be available for a
hundred bucks after a two-year contract
it'll start selling on november second
now if you asked me this is a real steal
here i mean you get a top tiered
flagship sony smartphone that doesn't
have anything to envy on other top-tier
smartphones you'll only get it for 100
bucks that's kind of a good deal and
finally for the hot news of the day
Microsoft is just unwrapped windows 8 in
their surface RT tablet in New York City
our own Adam Lane was there and got a
ton
hands on coverage on every Windows 8
device that was there and that includes
the surface RT tablet our own review
unit should arrive tomorrow to Brandon
so expect a lot of coverage they're not
leads me to the question of the day that
you go for a Windows RT tablet or are
you waiting for the windows 8 pro device
in my particular case i'm waiting for
the pro unit but leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks
