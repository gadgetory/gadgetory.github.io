this time I'm going to show you a
comparison between the copy paste
feature on a bunch bunch of different
platforms so here we are we have the new
blackberry torch the samsung galaxy s 4g
it is one of the latest Android devices
we have a ipod touch 4g so that's some
iOS we have windows phone 7 we have the
nokia n8 and you're probably looking at
this and what the heck is that so yes
this is a device from 2002 2003 so i'm
going to use that to show you what copy
paste was like note within the last
decade let's try that one first this one
comes with a great little stylist so you
see it's just like a regular computer i
select the text copy and then i can go
into something else like a note and just
paste it right there so that's pretty
easy of course this works in anything go
to a calendar appointment that's very
much car alarm and you can put into the
notes and if you had a keyboard you
could also do control V and I can do
shift I can do selections like this okay
all that could be done with a keyboard
as well so there's your old this is
actually windows mobile 5 in 2005 it's
on a 2003 device but there's copy face
for that one next let's look at the
latest Windows Phone 7 and see how copy
paste works on this one so what we do is
we tap a letter or a word rather and get
a little selection handles
and you can just drag it to select
whatever amount of text you want then
get this little button to some users it
might be confusing what does that mean
you know some kind of icon but most
people will recognize that as the copy
button from office and many other
Microsoft programs so you just copy that
and then I can go into something else
and there's the paste button you can
recognize that as a paste button and it
goes in pretty easily one paste again
there's no keyboard shortcuts for this
but the blend is pretty nice pretty easy
to access that next let's try iOS so on
iOS we tap there's my little selection
Hale bars and I can drag them out you
can also get to the whole blocks so that
one jump to the whole paragraph and got
a little zoom so you can really
specifically choose which characters to
select ok and then we do copy and go to
any other program
tap an old and paste
do it again so there you go is pretty
easy I step let's try Android so here we
are what we do tapped on the wrong thing
and tap them text hold it there and then
we get the little handle bar and you got
the zoom up so you can see exactly which
letters you're selecting and then we
have some buttons up here and that one
looks like copy and it says it was
copied to the clipboard so there we go
and we can go into a new message
and tap and hold and then paste pretty
easy there too and do that anywhere
next about the nokia n8 okay so what you
do when you get an email open you gotta
tap and drag and then the little copy
button comes up but it is kind of
difficult to get everything in there you
don't really have much control so this
copy button just keeps popping up a loop
I really want to select different things
there we go now county here i can paste
it
I go into this menu so that's kind of a
pain not terribly easy and it's even
worse when you're trying to copy stuff
from a webpage so kind of difficult new
Kia and eight and lastly we have the
blackberry torch so let's see the
browser so the blackberry we can tap and
hold and you can get the select button
that gives us two big handlebars where
we can drag exhuming you don't have to
drag like right on top of it you can see
the edge a little bit through the window
same with up here okay then we can tap
and hold and there's your copy button
you can also get the selection mode from
the menu and I can use the little
trackball thing and copy like that so
that's pretty nice and then we can go
and I can go into a twitter app or
whatever type of holes and paste or i
can do the full menu and paste so there
you go so we've got a lot of different
ways of doing the same kind of thing on
mobile devices hope you enjoyed that
comparison of copy and paste features on
blackberry Android iOS verse 17 old
windows mobile 2005 and the nokia n8
that's it for now
