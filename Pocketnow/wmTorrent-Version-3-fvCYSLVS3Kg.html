now calm and today I'm going to show you
a useful application that will download
bittorrent directly to your windows
mobile device and the program is called
windows mobile torrent it is created by
at asada and has just been upgraded to
version 3 and for those of you that
don't know Torrance work the same way as
older peer-to-peer networks but are much
easier to use to search through and
today I'm going to show you using opera
mobile 9.5 we're just going to that I've
already pre-loaded the web page right
here and this is legal Torrance Kong and
of course everyone at pocket now only
downloads legal content we don't condone
the use of this product to download
pirated music movies software and etc
okay so after we have loaded the torrent
search on a web browser we can then find
a torrent that seems interesting and I'm
just going to pick up some pictures
because there's many seeders which means
that there's a lot of people that have
it and it's easier to download and I can
show you that on this program okay so
this is just a wallpaper collection and
click over here and to download this
torrent and the cool thing about this
program is it actually gives file
association so unlike a lot of
BitTorrent programs out there this one
will actually automatically launch when
you open the file so so we don't need to
actually save the file because it has
that file association we can just click
open it will automatically open windows
mobile torrent so here it goes it's
going to launch okay so as you can see
here it's pretty small but you can see
it says download and gives us our
download speed and how many kilobytes
since our session so it's been about a
megabyte so far and will give this our
time until we're done see this is
estimated time by eight minutes and 17
seconds and we can also get more
information on this torn if we go down
to the menu we can see the details so if
we just start from general it will give
us general information as to where it's
saved and where what the torrents name
is the size of the torrent and how many
pieces it has as well as when it was
created and who is created by so we can
just go next
and we'll give you the transfer
information downloading how much you've
downloaded the time elapsed and download
speed more they'll give you all the
pieces inside that file so since it was
just wallpaper they've lots of pieces in
here lots of files it'll show you the
peers along with their IP address and
the pieces this is a neat little grade
because it will show you how many pieces
you have left if you're a more visual
person it will show you how much time
how many pieces you have left for the
torrent to be downloaded so we'll just
go back close the details okay so this
little gear icon right here will give us
all over settings so we can go into our
general settings our connections how
much bandwidth we want to set for each
file and how many uploads and downloads
you want our advanced features protocol
encryption in case you want to encrypt
some of your files the server name
username password and the number of
connections so that's pretty neat just
go back to downloads which is the arrow
so if you are the type of person that
likes to download torrents on the go
which is pretty neat because if you're
on the road or whatever at an airport or
whatnot you can always download a movie
or music file directly to your windows
mole device and i'll post Linkin Park
intercom is how to get this the program
does come with a trial but the normal
price is twenty-five dollars thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
