new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's take another gander at a
smartphone that some might say hasn't
even gotten off the ground yet I'm
Michael Fisher this is the Samsung ativ
S and this is episode 16 of pocket now's
after the buzz
we've been doing after the buzz for
about a year now which gives us a pretty
good sense of how well different
platforms ripen over time with a larger
ecosystem more visibility and near
constant stability on most devices
Windows Phone 8 appears to be aging like
a fine wine and the achieve s Hardware
continues to prove itself a good match
for Microsoft's underdog OS the problem
at least here in America is that no one
knows what this device is because it's
not currently offered by any major
carrier and despite the novelty that the
status of a hot overseas phone normally
carries the phone is so understated and
designed that no one really even notices
it on the street the achieve s may well
be the most under celebrated flagship in
Windows Phones history if that hardware
isn't too groundbreaking on the inside
as we told you in our full review in
December the 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm s4
SOC 1 gig of ram HSPA bluetooth 3.0 NFC
and 16 gigs of on-board storage are all
pretty vanilla by Windows Phone
standards though the atif s stood out
then and continues to stand out thanks
in part to its large 4.8 inch Super
AMOLED display micro SD support and a
removable 2300 milliamp hour battery
that makes it a lot more versatile than
the Lumia 920 and HTC 8x the device is
comprising the bulk of its competition
since the landscape hasn't changed much
since December the atif s continues to
dominate the Windows Phone 8 space in
terms of sheer specs and adaptability
unfortunately the phone is covered in a
thick sheath of unimposing normalcy that
obscures those powerful innards after
five months of exposure to newer better
hardware design the chassis that we
first considered elegant in its reserved
faux metallic sheen now appears somewhat
staid and dull it's still beautiful in
its own way that hairline aluminium
finish on the plastic battery cover is
still far and away the best fake metal
we've seen but it's aging more rapidly
than we expected and the glossy finish
definitely doesn't do the device any
favors in the in hand feel Department in
the long term you'll be wiping it down
constantly as it acquires more and more
skin oil
from a build perspective the atif s
stands out from the pack
less and less with each passing month
that is until the screen flares to life
it may not pack the pixel density of
today's 1080p goliaths but this panel
continues to serve Windows Phone
beautifully in all its super saturated
720p glory it's still the biggest screen
out there for Windows Phone from a major
manufacturer and we think it still does
the best job of bringing Microsoft's
Metro UI to life as for the OS itself in
Windows Phones effectively skinless
environment the only thing
differentiating devices is the custom
app selection here there's bad news and
good news the bad news is that Samsung's
app repository in the Windows Store the
predictably titled Samsung's own is just
as fallow as we left it in December
having added only one or two titles over
the five months in between that's a
pretty weak showing and perhaps it's
reflective of the somewhat passionless
relationship between Samsung and
Microsoft at least in terms of Windows
Phone the good news though is that in
the time since our review Nokia has
released its excellent here sweet to all
Windows Phone devices including the
achieve s that means here maps here
drive beta and here transit all run on
the Samsung device and they run quite
well that's not a development unique to
the achieve s but it significantly
improves the utility of all Windows
Phone 8 devices so it's a very important
and welcome development we just wish
Samsung would start bringing its own
improvements to the Windows Phone
portfolio one of the takeaways from our
previous review was that if you like
Windows Phone you'll love running it on
the achieve s and that continues to hold
true today
Windows Phone works well together with
Samsung's beefy hardware and the fact
that you can carry spare batteries and
memory cards to enhance the device
continues to set it apart our GTI 8750
version of the Atif S doesn't pack LTE
but we're not gonna dock points for that
as we're sure the American carrier
version will assuming it ever lands on
us Shores performance over HSPA+ and
AT&amp;amp;T was slower than our experience on
t-mobile's network though we had
coverage in more places and almost never
fell back to edge which was nice talking
on the achieve s is fine though we were
remind
the unit's light and insubstantial build
quality every time we spoke as our voice
resonated with something inside the unit
giving us a somewhat hollow sound in our
own ear callers said we sounded fine
though and noise cancellation appeared
to work well given enough light and
color to work with the achieve s camera
which is the same as the galaxy s 3 s
and Note 2's continues to hold up well
even against modern competition like the
HTC One Lumia 920 and Galaxy s4 the lack
of a 13 megapixel sensor isn't hurting
it much this 8 megapixel unit can really
turn out some wonderful you have
slightly oversaturated photos given the
right condition the camera offers nearly
the same expand ability as other windows
phones via its lens functionality but
there's very little in terms of Samsung
specific customizations overall the
camera module continues to do well
despite being over a year old after
nearly half a year the atif s is a mixed
bag we're concerned that Samsung hasn't
released fixes for a few nagging issues
like the display auto brightness
fluctuation problem and we're pretty
sure the phone will never truly get its
day in the Sun here in the states even
if the rumor of Sprint picking it up is
one of its first Windows Phone 8
smartphones is true it'll be an older
device on a third place network that's
not a recipe for a blockbuster that
lasts it's a momentary stay of execution
for a could have been superstar about to
be relegated to the mid-range the ative
s is a great example of what could
happen if Samsung and Microsoft ever
decide to team up in a big way
considered alongside the rest of the
current Windows Phone lineup the team s
more than holds its own it brings a
touch of conservatism and pragmatic
utility to the otherwise bright and
colorful Microsoft Windows Phone
portfolio and that in itself continues
to be valuable we just wish the phone
had really had a chance to shine in the
States and we wonder what it's probable
fizzle means for the future of Samsung
windows phones folks that's going to do
