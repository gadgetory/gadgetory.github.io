resistance and even wireless charging
galaxy note 7 S Pen improvements claimed
major changes to come and it seems that
there's even a nexus SmartWatch in the
works or maybe two I'm hi meri behna and
when was the last time that any of you
received a flu shot yeah they're
horrible this is out daily I
know I know either the excessive noise
or the excessive noise cancellation of
the video editing will give it away it's
a terrible storm out there let's begin
with the official news starting with the
verizon changes today which officially
made it not only the most expensive US
carrier but make it even more expensive
than it already was as a result
obviously competitions out there sprint
up kind of you tweets about it but in
the case of t-mobile John ledger came on
record to offer an iphone as e 64 gigs
if you follow a hashtag game that you
can learn more on the link in the
description and since we're talking
interesting deals if you're still in the
market for a last year flagship at a
great price tag LG g4 that's probably
one of the ones we recommend most
currently on ebay for a hundred and
eighty dollars that is a steal for the
LG g4 that is a crazy steal you can
learn more on the link in the
description I was willed to spotlight
over in nexus rumors but this time we're
not going to talk about Google HTC nexus
smartphones we're actually going to talk
about smartwatches because apparently
google is working on its own blend of
products starting with one that'll be
the full-blown gps in addition to LTE
and also heart rate sensor capable smart
watch and then another one that's more
conservative now we don't have any
details on which OEM it'll be hopefully
its motor allure Huawei which are our
favorites so far when it comes to
android wear but yet we can expect
Android wear Nexus device is very super
I was will just fall out over to Samsung
as we hear a very interesting rumor
regarding the S Pen for years we've
known that Samsung acquired Wacom with
the idea of bringing the s-pen
technology only to Samsung we know
that's not necessarily the way things
work but a very interesting change comes
from rumors that claim that the next S
Pen
will actually be bluetooth LE capable
and I assume it has a lot to do with the
amount of accuracy it's provided to the
Apple pencil with the iPad pro probably
Samsung wants the up the ante in what
the s-pen can do and that's really great
news apparently this S Pen will be
amazing in battery life etc etc which is
not something were used to me you don't
really have to charge any turn s-pen
let's see what Samsung comes up with and
finally the hot news that they have to
do with the iphone 7 plus we've got some
very interesting leaks of a presentation
within Foxconn that claims to very
interesting changes coming to the iphone
7 plus not the iphone 7 for reasons
being notice there is no pro moniker
here but apparently number one what
we're getting is wireless charging
something we weren't expecting to see
from Apple but then again we have it
with the Apple watch so why not bring it
to other products and the second most
important one is water resistance now
we've known forever that the iphone 6s
is some sort of water resistance even
though apple doesn't out it to be but it
leads me to the question of the day if
Apple would launch the next iPhones with
water resistance with that compel you to
buy them and if Apple only launched it
in the plus variant would that make you
buy the plus because in my case it
actually would but leave us a comment
