it's your boy gadget guy and as most of
you know by now I'm a pretty serious
semi-pro enthusiast amateur photographer
maybe y'all don't know my almost booked
a gig last week it was pretty hot and
there's nothing that kid Chloe I should
pick up the Berlin and there's nothing
like compute the tasty delicious focus
coming off some proper glass on a real
camera that's how I roll I'm a natural
light never used the flash crank the is
Oh hipster douche bag and we all know
that I'll blur on smartphones all suck
and they can't be as good as real blast
so here's the showdown to show you how
much these four phones suck at taking
gold a trash big picture look that's
better but seriously folks we are going
to take a quick look at software blur
we've got two phones which use a single
sensor and enhanced software to blur the
backgrounds of your photos and we've got
two phones which utilized additional
depth information from multiple camera
sensors to try and recreate the look of
a proper DSLR while I am actually kind
of a natural light prime lens knob when
it comes to my proper camera it's not
difficult to see the vast improvements
to software image processing on our
phones we're far removed from the days
of those terrible circle blur filters on
Instagram so for this list ranked
entirely subjectively by my eye we're
starting off at number four with the
Google picks on Google's process for
creating software blur involves the user
focusing on a subject and after hitting
the shutter button tilting the camera
vertically which kind of makes sense if
your subject is significantly closer
than the rest of your background then
the software should be able to see
bigger differences farther away from the
lens so why is the pixel suck for
creating background blur well
introducing that movement does make this
process a bit less consistent the pixel
processes images ridiculously fast but
introducing that tilt means ur is a
greater likelihood that the phone is
going to miss read the scene or that
there will be some introduction of hand
movement blur in the shot especially in
lower light condition at number three
the galaxy s7 also a single sensor phone
Samsung solution doesn't involve any
movement so that's a positive but to
create a blurry or background
songs camera app scans through the
entire focus range of the phone when you
use that selective focus feature what's
cool is this provides a little extra
flexibility in post where you can have
your subject in focus the background in
focus or the entire shot in focus which
is actually pretty sweet so why does the
galaxy s7 suck well the downside here is
the extra time spent capturing the shot
the user has to hold still and the
onboard optical image stabilization
should do a pretty decent job of
minimizing any handshake but if your
subject is moving at all well there's
not really much you can do to salvage
that shot at number two and moving up to
dual sensor phones we've got the iPhone
7 plus now portrait load on the iPhone
actually uses the zoom lens to really
create that nicely separated subject
from background look an Apple delivers
the most streamlined approach to
creating a blurry background photo slide
into portrait mode line up your subject
and the effect should just pop into
place when you've met the right criteria
not a lot you can do in post but Apple
will save a normal version of the photo
and a photo with a blur effect in place
so why does the iPhone 7 plus suck well
with this experience being so on the
rails you're pretty much at the mercy of
Apple's camera app not enough light in
your shot no blur too close or too far
nobler and relying on the zoom lens mean
some folks won't have arms long enough
to take a rear camera selfie while
utilizing the system and at number 1
we've got Huawei in honor all right this
is kind of a cheat as we're highlighting
the entire range of Huawei phones from
the 6x to the mate 9 but using two
sensors with matched focal length lenses
really does create the most flexible
system for dialing in the amount of
software blur we want to see in the
background in operation from your main
composition window you hit one little
icon and then you just kind of shoot how
you normally would in any other auto
mode then when looking back at your
photos you can dial in the amount of
blur you'd like to see with this handy
little slider which tries to emulate the
aperture that we'd see on a DSLR once
you've got it where you want it the
phone saves a new copy of that photos
leaving the original int active you
decide you want to edit it again in the
future so why is it mate 9 suck well
like most things on the Huawei camera
app it really does involve just a little
bit more user participation than some of
the other systems we've taken a look at
yet kind of do need to play around with
it just a little bit more but it
having finer control means we should be
able to achieve that happy balance
between your subjects popping off the
background and not having too much of
that really fake looking software blur
degrading your shot it's still totally
true that a camera with a larger sensor
and good glass will still win out over
smartphones with multiple sensors or
software tricks but I wouldn't be so
quick to write off software blur on any
of these platforms once you understand
the strengths and weaknesses that each
phone has to provide I think you're
likely to find you can capture some
really interesting images and if you've
been playing around with the blur
features on your smartphone drop us a

like what don't you like I'd love to get
into an exchange of people creating

fun as always thanks so much for
