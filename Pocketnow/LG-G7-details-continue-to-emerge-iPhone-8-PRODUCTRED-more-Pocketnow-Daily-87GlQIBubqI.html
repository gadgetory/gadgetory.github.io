confirming most of the rumors that we've
heard already new reports claim that ZTE
is bringing two notches to a flexure
phone for a logical purpose actually and
Apple watches another batch of red
iPhones though this time following user
feedback I'm high metal Iveta and it
seems that Monday shows its true colors
with the devices that get announced
during the day this is rocking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for a SmartWatch
I continuously recommend the Apple watch
Series three is one of my favorites it's
probably the best combo of fitness and
apps that actually work Best Buy has got
them certified refurbished starting at
295 depending on your variant yeah I
highly recommend you consider now let's
talk about Apple s Cupertino has just
announced its product red iPhone 8 and
iPhone 8 plus no iPhone 10 by the way
they've got cases for the iPhone 10 in
product cred but then in the case of the
8 and 8 plus they're pretty much the
same phone with a new coating though I
actually do like that Apple finally woke
up and smell the coffee about their
white bezel this one brings black bezels
I feel the convo actually looks like
something that I'd be willing to use so
yeah now let's talk about ZTE we were
expecting to see some sort of axon at
MWC we got a blade in the blade is
actually a very good-looking entry-level
smartphone the company is apparently
working on a phone with two notches and
you know it's funny when I read the news
at the beginning I was like what the but
as it turns out apparently that second
notch is for a stereo speaker at the
bottom and if you think about it and
we're waiting for the axon 8 this makes
a lot of sense let's see exactly what we
get now let's talk about essential for
those of you wondering when the
essential 2 is coming out we don't know
all we know is an apparently Business
Insider and the company have been talks
and the company is working really hard
on getting the camera right for the
essential phone - what exactly will the
company bring I hope they continue with
that whole little monochrome sensor
combination but that's yet to be seen
again essential hey they're going by
their second batch of phone right there
we've seen companies 2
three four batches before they get
things right meaning smartphone launches
so we'll see and finally the very hot
news is they have to do with the LG G
seven for those of you wondering exactly
when we're getting this phone we're not
sure we just have more credible sources
claiming most of the leaks that we've
seen Snapdragon 845 from Qualcomm we're
seeing that there's a variant with four
gigabytes of RAM now by the way instead
of six but there will be a variant with
six and you know starts at 64 gigs of
storage expandable apparently it'll
bring that whole thing Q with a button
again a lot of the stuff that we've
already heard but you know in today's
question mainly we've already seen the
s9 we've already seen all the phones
that will pretty much launch during the
spring of anything I don't even know
exactly if there will be a point for
this phone to be announced particularly
if we're already getting close to the 1
plus 6
let us know in the comments would you
still consider I mean how many LG fans
are out there from you guys is there
