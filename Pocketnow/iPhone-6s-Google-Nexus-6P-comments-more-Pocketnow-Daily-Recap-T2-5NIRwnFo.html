guy no let's drink and celebrate hey
imma stop complaining you look better
with a tan and I'm gonna have to agree
with that is it just me or he spoke
slowly and calmly this episode of pocket
out daily it's just you and yeah it's
just you that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Mary lit up this this
pocket now and this is the pocket out
daily recap last week monday was about
iphone 6s and 6s plus pre-orders i asked
you if you ordered one because analysts
were predicting a lot of success in
these pre orders and we have 1167
comments thanks a lot guys we start with
no i didn't pre-order but i'm definitely
looking forward to the 64 gig silver
success and a lot of people are actually
going for the gold because does the only
way you're going to know you're actually
using a success up to the point where
you actually strapped a case on it so
hey nice choice i'm gonna order an apple
product that has outdated hardware or
copy other innovations from other
companies number one because the other
companies did the same at some point
number two because that outdated
hardware performs better than the
currently date hardware on new phone
sadly i'm excited to get the iphone 6s
16 gigabytes said no human ever and you
got so many likes because it's true it
is just unbearable but some people live
with that on Tuesday we discussed
foldable displays and the possibility of
Samson bringing us a product like this
next year and I ask you of you are
interested we have 748 comments we start
with I will have a phone like that it
would actually fit in your skinny jeans
pockets ah skinny jeans oh yeah I'd like
a phone that folds to half its size a
foldable tablet would be great too and I
find that amazing for tablets but hate
her phones I used to love phones that
could flip the problem is you have to
use it in a holster because they kind of
become kind of thick for all those who
say that foldable phone is the same as a
flip phone you're being dumb in my
opinion it is revolutionary it could be
let's just see what the point will be
again you don't really need to fold the
phone right now and there is some added
functionality then hey would be cool
let's just see on Wednesday I asked you
about the blackberry Venice we saw it on
video leaked that's now the blackberry
prev it's now official and I asked you
if you're interested in it
we have hundred 73 comments we start
with I actually want to buy blackberry
Venice if it has horizontal keyboard
like the Xperia Pro and I used to hate
horizontal keyboards I no point in it
there was just so much finger travel all
around the keyboard that I really didn't
like him but hey this vertical slider
seems to be cool let's see I think this
is going to put blackberry back in the
game there's definitely a market for
Android power users and business having
a tactile keyboard there is a huge
market of companies interested in phones
like blackberries that have added
security up to the point where
government officials are still using
blackberries as their daily drivers so I
do feel that this is a great marketing I
do feel that this is a great strategy
for blackberry let's just see if it pays
off I'm not interested in the Venice
because i just bought a passport a few
months ago and since i have it i
definitely don't want to put up with
android again I only hope that this
still maintain bb10 because for me it's
the best mobile operating system out
there said only you dude and 16 people
that like your comments everybody else
that's tried blackberry 10 doesn't
really like it including me my god on
Thursday it was about the LG class we
had seen some teasers we thought this
was the LG super premium phone and it
turns out to be a dud it does exist
that's just the mid-ranger almost
low-end phone with aluminium then I
asked you back then with it Caesar what
do you think we have 355 comments out of
which it starts with it looks like a
two-year-old phone so ugly yes it does
know that phone is pretty ugly I just
want the g4 with stock Android and hey
just slap on the stock Google launcher a
Google now launcher on your LG g4 you'll
pretty much be getting a very close
experience to that would some added
value the LG class looks like an escape
from 2012 all right all right we get the
picture the phones ugly bye and then
finally on Friday it was the rivers of
the possible name of the Google huawei
Nexus 6 apparently it's going to be the
nexus 6p and i asked you if you like the
name or what suggestions should you
bring we have 771 comments out of which
we start with Nexus 5 2015 edition Nexus
6 2015 edition perfect name for me as
well let's just call it Nexus 6
seriously it should be the nexus 5 in
our Nexus spot a nexus 6 sent to sing
by the version of Android its release
with true but then it will be the
version of Android that will launch with
the feature Android end so I don't know
well I think that Nexus xpro would sound
better doesn't copy the plus from Apple
and Samsung true and I do feel that it
makes a little bit of a point given the
fact that this is not just the bigger
Nexus 5 it's actually a more powerful
Nexus 6 so yeah you do have a point I
actually do like the name but then again
it would be cool they stuck with the
plus or let's just see what they do in
the end that's thought like if there's a
typical Nexus 6 and then the Nexus 6
plus so I'll see what they do that's it
for the market out daily recap thank you
very much for watching a couple of those
of you want your comments to be featured
number one keep them short number to
stick to the point number three try to
get some thumbs up hit up the spot a lot
