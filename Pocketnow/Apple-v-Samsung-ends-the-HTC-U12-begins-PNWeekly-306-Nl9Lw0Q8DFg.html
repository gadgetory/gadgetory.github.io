and wearables it's all the stuff you
wished existed when you were a kid and a
phone wasn't quite an essential piece of
your daily lifestyle activities I'm Juan
Carlos bag now contributing editor
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mister Jules Wong on
Jools Wong once again made it through
the spiel fumbled on your name hey I won
i won i winning it life man
congratulations to me I'm a little
shocked at how many people have liked my
tweet this morning about being able to
fry an egg over easy the first time ever
in my life I'm kind of a man
food motivated so that smoked out at the
kitchen a few times so I'm proud of
myself I'm not sure that this many
people should be proud of me for that
know I'm always gonna give the thumbs up
you mean people come into food later in
life and like you know just getting out
of prepared meals or eating out all the
time to it it's a fun experiment it's a
fun life experience like I know it was
never able to put the right amount of
oil on the pan just like get eggs to not
stick or if they're swimming in oil or
if when the freakin spatula skills like
we used to have this stupid plastic
spatula but it wasn't even like it was
like just a stirrer thing it didn't even
have like a proper edge to like get that
egg flipped over and I was like wow this
is uh yeah third hour in the podcast
where we're gonna go over our favorite
recipes I have a wonderful vegan risotto
to share with people it's a vegan
mushroom risotto and I think people are
gonna be very impressed by it
lots of grazing going on no good reason
I really feel like braising some
smartphone news I chose we've got to
jump right in under this one
conversation yeah definitely hashed IP
and clear on Twitter YouTube chat
everything that we need to be talking
about in strata at pocketnow.com we're
actually going to be holding off on our
mailbag because of this new story which
just broke this week replacing this
whole news or this mailbag thing is the
news that apparently according to
congressional aides to use both the New
York Times and Reuters the Commerce
Department has telegraphed what they
want to do with ZTE now you realize that
ZTE is under basically an imports band
for seven years because they violated
both the terms of the whether you have
violated trade sanctions first of all by
doing business in Iran and North Korea
but also the sentiment that they reached
after they work things out with the
Commerce Department the first time
around and so instead of that instead of
that ban
they're now going to perhaps do a fine
perhaps as large
as 1.3 billion dollars and that's it's
not clear whether that's in excess of
the 800 billion or if that's being added
on if that is the total amount that they
will have to pay for this these
infractions and they would also have to
install u.s. compliance monitors and
execute big shifts in their management
and the announcement has not been made
official just yet we expect the White
House to be talking about this perhaps
in a Friday night news dump who knows so
well we'll have to see about it
obviously a lot of the privacy the
cybersecurity Hawks very eager to pounce
on this especially with the the claims
that ZTE haul-away a lot of Chinese
manufacturers have been stealing
intellectual property as well as coming
under the influence of the authority of
Chinese governments and perhaps doing
some of their bidding or using some of
their data the data collected from their
users at their will so lots to talk
about here and I guess well what do you
think about this whole state the state
of things because this was kind of
imaged in many corners as a trade peg
this was going to be working with a
whole bunch of farm subsidies and farm
goods orders and whatnot between US and
China and otherwise we wouldn't be
talking about this but like this
it's we have the layers here just so
completely and a lot of layers on this
on this story now I there this has been
a very delicate a very sensitive and
concerning topic to try and just to
discuss because it lands on so many
different aspects of technology and
technology politics watching people with
an insane amount of power over this
industry basically playing games with
the outcome of how this stuff should be
regulated monitored and how penalties
should be assessed was I thought it was
very concerning
watching punitive actions that could
have completely decimated a fairly large
corporation worldwide again because
we've had some pretty positive
experiences with some of their
individual consumer products you know
Eric there was some good feelers there
would have been upsetting to see them
completely evaporated then to see like
chest puffery with international
diplomacy happening over this only only
to then see strategies get walked back
that this is this is likely getting
walked back in favor of US agricultural
imports I don't see where Chinese
telecommunications and United States
agricultural products are on the same
footing in terms of future industry and
future jobs discussions and how are our
how our economies work getting back to
this point I mean from the from the
personal standpoint I'm I'm hoping this
means that we'll we'll see some cool
phones like ultimately I don't want to
seek a cool phone I want to see an axon
9 I'm sort of selfish there I want to
see the freakin concept where they have
the exposed glass on the corners yeah
well yeah no no I don't want to see
design award 2018 bro well in the nah so
it's like why make a glass sandwich when
we can also make just on our glass a
glass tortellini no it's not a portal
it's a ravioli but but I mean like get
getting back to this story again I mean
there's the tinfoil hat wearing part of
this where I'd be concerned about
Trump's personal business interests in
in what's been going on with some of the
the properties that are his properties
that are gonna benefit from Chinese
investment in infrastructure and then
what's also been hilarious
you you actually leads to this in your
write-up here was also been linked
hilarious is watching some of the
backlash happen on things like other
politicians Marco Rubio coming out to
talk tough about how Oh Trump is is is
you know given this as a favor to the
Chinese I've got his tweet up here is a
quarter Rubio setter a Republican
senator from Florida also share on the
or
we on the select committee on
intelligence and so his tweet quote yes
they have a deal in mind it is a great
deal dot dot for ZTE in China China
crushes US companies with no mercy and
they use these telecom companies to spy
and steal from us many hope to this time
would be different now Congress will
need to act again like the
sabre-rattling is kind of intense and
we've been we've been allowing general
news not technology news but general
news to sort of get away with some of
these open-ended accusations of things
like spying
I know law-enforcement FBI CIA NSA had
advisories about Huawei and ZTE product
saying they could potentially be used to
traffic and user data but I don't know
to date that anyone has actually
uncovered any any specific wrongdoings
outside the normal issues that we faced
with numerous companies not handling our
data with the sensitivity the privacy in
the security that it should so so again
like we've we've sort of allowed general
media and politicians to walk away with
a part of this conversation that China
equals bad in a way which I don't think
is is really contributing to the overall
like it feels like security theater it
doesn't really feel like we're really
discussing things that are gonna help
protect consumers and an ever evolving
technology landscape instead we're
trying to just equate oh it's a Chinese
company it must be evil and that again
that us versus them or that is that sort
of xenophobic approach to diplomacy I
don't feel is gonna be a good long-term
strategy for our economy well I mean
they're trying to find a way to
undermine and you know certain aspects
of the Chinese government such as land
ownership claims in the South Pacific
Ocean or human rights violations and you
know they're it's a multi-faceted scheme
the fact of the matter is in the topic
of trade there's just no getting over
that they are the second largest economy
in the world and they're pumping right
against us so there is if they want to
play ball
then Trump will play ball he wanted a
trade war he campaigned on that promise
during his
presidential run up and now he's getting
it and he wants to be able to come out
of this with a good face I mean that's
his style we've seen it throughout his
career even though the this may or may
not end up being a loss in some other
categories such as cybersecurity and
whatnot he is gonna cut this as carrying
out a promise that he made I mean he
tweeted about it therefore it must be
you know in order it must be de facto in
not the fact real well it's gonna be
that you're right in the Trump Ledger
that that will go down under the the
column of I achieved look I did the
thing what I said no you're totally
right there and there's gonna be a lot
of gamesmanship going on in in this as
sort of an evolving Oh totally and I
should also mention we had that report
back a few months ago about that the
nationalization of the 5g network and
some intelligence heads talking about
that
and the White House officials had to
walk back that report it didn't sound
like that was going to be a Trump thing
in and of itself that was more of a
Washington more of a you know machine
kind of deal that would have been that
would have had to take place and all
that again was to combat against Chinese
influence on the grid even though there
is very limited reach in terms of
Harleen ZTE in our grid I think the
numbers are in the single digits low
single digits even so in terms of the
share of equipment that is held so while
we like under five percent in terms it
was like 4:00 and then maybe ZTE was
even like 1% I would have been surprised
of ZTE was like within margin of error
yeah to be fair I mean it doesn't you
know quantity is not is not necessarily
what they're going after it may be giant
data that they can extract from the 96%
total and you know because they have
that one cell tower and Pepsi they can
hack your mainframes now this is from
Renato Laporte using
p/n weekly hashtag if the EU or the US
had any proof the smallest hint that
Chinese telecom companies were spying on
us they burn those companies to the
ground because then Ericsson Qualcomm
Nokia and Siemens wouldn't be facing the
this is his words not mine
the Oriental Giants anymore I this this
is like this is a very complex set of
fields that I have on this story because
of some of the positive experiences I've
had with the consumer-facing
section of these brands and then also my
desire for competition I don't believe
we see a healthy consumer market unless
there's some play where companies have
to face each other where they actually
have to compete for consumer dollars I
this is I think gonna be another one of
those where there's a lot caught up in
the in the in in the the sort of
tribalism you know what we're chanis
industry seems to get a significant bump
and boost maybe an unfair advantage in
some markets because of the way the
government backs certain corporations
but at the same time we also want to see
products that actually improve upon the
condition that we have right now and I
don't believe we get that if we in an
America have the opposite approach of
trying to lock down our development and
our infrastructure to only one or two
players here we're artificially creating
something that we're accusing the
Chinese of doing if we only let Qualcomm
do business in the United States yeah
that's true but I mean they have been
found by Chinese courts to have breached
some sort of antitrust threshold and
they've been forced to make good with
many of the Chinese manufacturers that
okay absolutely agree because this is
also one of those conversations where I
feel like I feel like government our
current collection of governments and
the regulate regulatory bodies within
those governments seem ill-equipped to
handle a new breed of juggernaut
corporation of really like light-touch
regulation doesn't really seem to work
right now and I fear as a capitalist I
fear a significant pendulum swing
to try and overcorrect for the situation
that we we currently see where it's
difficult to ring that in you talk about
a company like welcome and they're there
in this conversation for conservative
politicians the United States they're
gonna be the golden child
to to point to this is the company we
need to let do most of our
infrastructure for 5g that's become a
whole bunch of talking points and buzz
terms that I don't think our politicians
know or understand anything about what
they're talking about for this
collection of technologies but at the
same time as tech enthusiasts we can
point to Qualcomm and certain types of
business business tactics that they've
employed which don't necessarily paint
them out to be good guys in every single
conversation that we have and we look at
other mega corporations like Apple
trying to get away from using Qualcomm
products to soso this again it becomes a
very tangled web of different types of
conversations and different types of
stories to unravel what is it that we
even just hope to achieve
you know some point what what is it that
we hope well Jules let me actually just
throw this this point out to you for our
infrastructure and for our consumer
gadget landscape like what do we hope
that this will look like over the next
five years stream well for an industry
that is kind of ironically reliant on
connectivity to be able to grow and
prosper in the case of America I mean
again I have to go back to it it's
America first Republicans have been very
keen on keeping Qualcomm in the u.s.
they were fighting off any attempts to
see Broadcom singapore-based Broadcom
have anything to do with Qualcomm at all
so for the time being at least in the
start of this 5g race I think we're
still in it to win it but as we go along
we see better players nokia ericsson get
into their gear possibly through
Qualcomm zone undoing be it the forcing
of si P a standard central patents
or whatnot perhaps there will be some
leveling of the playing field just
because it has taken on so much of this
animosity and so much of a it's in part
of its its own blame partnered part of
its its own uh structuring of its
business that has really not helped them
out at all they're trying to change that
but it's going to take a while and in
the meantime there's definitely going to
be a tidal shift going on here so
definitely something to look out for I
really think that we'll be able to see
something over the weekend so this
podcast might be a little bit old by the
time you listen to it after the fact but
I was gonna say you heard it here first
folks the axon 9 the most amazing yes
this July sure let's all say that or
August or something I want to go over to
Apple V Samsung the aeverine it's almost
been seven years right it's seven years
since the the start of this or even like
2010 so eight years that is so long and
we've had these series of lawsuits
determining what's Samsung owed in terms
of design patents that word that were
held by Apple and have been infringed
upon and we're talking about these
galaxy s Galaxy S 2 copying the the
basic design of the iPhone which is just
that home button that screen and that
bezel that you see right there there's
no there was also the freakin co full
grid of icons for apps and the home
screen and what that and one other kind
of things though they stuff like um
pilot matters who has the patent and
yeah well and there were a few utility
patents too like the slight unlock
feature but those were not the main bits
of contention here because these three
patents
generated approximately five hundred
thirty three million dollars for in
lekha foreign tongue and untangling the
whole conversation this was the lawsuit
which originally posted a 1 billion
dollar penalty for Samsung which has
been whittled back on appeal after
appeal after appeal yes last this last
case was trying to determine if even the
533 million was somehow up for grabs
well I mean so like that it was welded
down between packaging disputes so like
if the packaging was infringed able also
a few patents got thrown out of the case
and it was you know so it went down to
like 400 million at one point and
through the appeals process it went up
to the Supreme Court and well the
Supreme Court took a look at it and
basically tossed it back to the district
court to determine what is the article
of manufacturer when it comes to these
patents what does it apply to does it
apply to the parts or does it apply to
the whole of the product and we'll take
this case here from law 360s dorothea
Makin's the one juror told her that they
found the the facade patents to have
applied just to the part said the
physical appearance of the phone is just
the parts of the phone whereas the the
grid the icon the home screens that was
indicated of the whole phone and
therefore it should be so that's where
you see a whole bunch of these variances
in terms of which phones were you know
generated the most damages so if we go
to the document over at five patents
thank you - Florian Mueller for
publishing this we see that the top
raking device here is the Galaxy S 4G
which raked in 75 million or nearly 76
million dollars just because of you know
that design just it had everything to it
that basically made it an iPhone
in regards to those three patents so
yeah this is a I mean was able to get
their way and say that only the parts
apply to all three patents right they
wouldn't last for it would only have
been thirty million dollars whereas
Apple wanted the full million dollars
are full billion dollars and this house
somehow splits it along and there's some
debate as to what's software design
patents as to applying to software
really do and or really are like or
really representatives I mean like we in
in how we're trying to protect certain
types of intellectual property and what
should we be able to protect is another
long-running question that needs to be
untangled by legal experts over
successive generations of products it's
just after a point we all need to do
like is this finally done
is it is it finally done are we done can
can Apple and Samsung finally move on
here and Apple is happy with the payout
and yeah doesn't sound like Samsung will
be mustering up the effort at least for
now to go through post trial procedures
or file appeal and that's that's what
I'm really worried about like will we
see that last that last Hail Mary appeal
from Samsung because I always have to
wonder that since this has been going on
since what like the galaxy s3 was
launched actually has two Galaxy S
lawsuits have been going well well the
verdict was in 2012 so so so we're
talking six years of lawyer fees I
almost have to wonder like the legal
team at Samsung how close are they to
matching the remainder of the payout
they would have had to have paid if they
just paid it upfront because this five
hundred million dollars worth of what
your fees for for corporate III I just
it needs to be done and I feel like we
can kind of move on our chat has already
run away with HTC u 12 Congress
which we'll get to in just a bit but
we're gonna cover a few news stories
first yeah indeed speaking of HTC not
speaking of HTC yeah but we stick with
Apple and talk about bendgate
again yeah that we're covering all the
stories from the past it makes all the
hits this news sound like it's all
coming it's frickin oldies 98.5 on your
dial let's talk about this the same deal
here we're talking about the same court
because Judge Lucy Koh hello to you
again is apparently on this case and
we're dealing with a couple of these
tech these tech lawsuits cuz I don't
think she's super sees those web super
expert I guess well I mean all judges
have to be will they have to at least
read and get some knowledge seeking on
the topics that they cover I don't know
and any case we're talking about this
lawsuit that's attempting to gain
class-action status and it has failed
now this lawsuit would be over both
touch disease which was the which is the
great pixelation issue at the top of the
display of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
plus also the reduced touch sensitivity
thereof and also been gate which also
applies to the iPhone 6 and 6-plus where
it was just easily bendable as compared
to that iPhone 5s we're hearing from
Lucy COEs opinion here that Apple's
internal testing determined that the
iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to
bend than the iPhone 5s while the iPhone
6 plus was seven point two times more
likely to bend and there was also talk
about a more epoxy on in response so
they were going to apply more underfill
to the logic board to prevent anything
happening to the connection of the
display panel which caught in part
caused the touch disease to happen
underfill is used to prevent the
manifestation of chip defects and
display bending because as it reinforces
the connections and prevents them from
getting away from the substrate the
plaintiffs explained Apple had used
underfill on the preceding iPhone
generation but did did not start using
it on the Nissan chip which was the
applicable display controller chip on
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus until May 2016
which is 20 months after those devices
debuted and while the actual full
testimony the actual full disclosures of
Apple and the plaintiffs are still under
steel I mean this gives us a good
insight into the world the fact that
Apple knew about these issues before
they would happen but or they they just
they do I mean if we're talking about a
class-action lawsuit just the very first
quote that we have from the papers at
Lucy COEs referencing Apple's internal
testing determined that the iPhone 6 was
3.3 times more likely to bend the iPhone
6 plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend
than the iPhone 5s having their legal
team come out and then make claims oh
well we don't believe that Apple has
publicly denied that bending was caused
by a fault in its designer materials
like well your own internal testing is
showing a trend towards this being an
actual manufacturing defect and that's
rationally and I'm sure again you need
lawyers to untangle all of this and
class actions never really appropriately
deliver the the justice that they should
we're gonna have to go through rounds
and probably multiple Appeals and then
everyone who owned an iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 who still has their receipt
their original box and like all of the
papers that came in the box and all the
consumer protection laws a state-based
which makes the whole model confusing to
whoever is blind is all is is finally
determined like if you have everything
that you can show to prove that you had
an iPhone 6 then you'll get you know
seventeen dollars from this class-action
lawsuit and well boy we showed Apple on
that one
this to me looks pretty damning and
again I want to give that shout out to
dude like Lewis rossman who's been very
aggro about his conversation about Apple
build quality he's really made me
rethink things like the MacBook whether
or not I'm recommending the MacBook to
certain family members and he was years
ahead of that discussion and now we're
also seeing class-action lawsuits about
MacBook keyboard defects you know so
again we're going through this process
again for a manufacturer that prides
themselves on just working and making
premium products and and and being sort
of a gold standard for a consumer
experience I think that they have more
to live up to than they currently are
for satisfying the consumer experience
yeah I mean yeah I mean the I have
nothing more to say to that now let's
move on to the next topic again I like
folks are actually lit up and want to
talk about the HTC so let's see if we
can hit the rest of this news yeah sure
so yeah bezel is phone vivo apex it was
a phone that we saw during MWC or at
least vivo showed it to some people
doing private briefings and immediate
public thereafter and now they're going
all public saying that it's gonna be
debuting june 12th and the bezel is full
almost full facade display and therefore
it would have a pop-up selfie camera
coming out of the top and yeah i mean it
looks cool all the specs you need
snapdragon 845 and whatnot so yeah good
thank you thank you via for this
hopefully in the United States thumbs up
yes let's talk about bad things I'm not
sure if I think you've had a you've
owned a Martian or at least used of
Marcia and smartwatch haven't you yeah
Martian was actually one of the first
watches that I reviewed on my own
personal channel yeah way back in the
day was a Martian then I think I got my
hands on a qualcomm talk and then a
pebble I had a lot of really fond
memories of using that Martian and I was
very upset to hear that they're they're
killing this well I was pissed that they
were doing a Kickstarter it's kind of
the big sin of pebble you know like
you're an established brand you're an
established company don't use
Kickstarter as a pre-order system make
your own free Rooter system just be a
grown-up and when I saw Martian was
doing a Kickstarter it made me a lot
less interested in what they were trying
to do and now I'm not terribly surprised
that they're basically killing it and
walking away yeah I mean they've had 11
years to do what they wanted to do time
to figure this out yeah so the M voice
jeetu which was back to well packed on
cake starter for all intents and
purposes is cancelled and it's yeah it's
it's gone only 480 units were shipped
because the other the other the other
big one in in that same vein manat its
Android wear army excuse me where OS I
still want to see some positive action
there and I think Google needs to rejoin
this conversation with a pixel watch so
they can they can at least have all
their branding under the same umbrella
but in killing this this goes right
along with the news this morning that a
lot of us were picking up on and reading
through of Andy Rubin pulling the plug
on an essential phone - yeah no worries
because that actually lines up perfect
with Martian you know again it's it's a
brand kind of pulling the plug on a
product this one's gonna be even higher
profile and I had a lengthy Twitter rant
about it if you want to check that out
at some gadget guy on Twitter just this
notion of like taking your ball and
going home you know he he Andy Rubin
spent so much time and energy at the
beginning of the essential launch
talking about how he intended for this
to be a niche product it wasn't going to
be about trying to blow down you know
sales goals or you know start cracking
into the overall smartphone market it
was about being disruptive and building
up a fan base in a community and doing
it organically and then everything that
the company did wreaked of the same
mistakes that every single tech brand
has made in trying to launch a new
product of
assuming that they were gonna have a hit
on their hands in the very first
generation and not and not preparing for
multiple years of struggle in the
marketplace I have said this for years
now that it takes about three
generations of a product of consistent
updates of improvements of launching new
hardware and of having savvy advertising
before consumers will take you seriously
Andy Rubin pulling essential out of the
race after the first generation of a
product is only going to reinforce in
tech reviewers tech enthusiasts and
consumers minds that you should never
take a risk on a new company you should
only ever buy products that are already
popular so this is another one like I'm
pissed I'm mad essential had so many
things that they they made so many
missteps in launching their first phone
but it was such a compelling device for
a first offering and they completely
missed the conversation about it being a
luxury premium gadget they spent way too
much time trying to court tech
enthusiasts who tech enthusiasts are
gonna be your worst critics don't go
after the tech enthusiasts go after
lifestyle people that wear fancy watches
with a phone that's made out of titanium
and ceramic and then getting to the end
of this to then go well we didn't really
mean it we kind of lied about all this
organic community building and and being
in the market and being a niche player
and trying to appeal to different kind
of Sensibility that was all a lie so
instead you should only buy an iPhone or
a galaxy because those are the only
products that you know are gonna last so
peace out is is so upsetting is so
frustrating and again it makes me just
it makes me want to take my ball and go
home I guess every I guess it's
predestined that we're always gonna have
just a Samsung Apple dichotomy well it's
definitely a shame especially with the
software update scheduled they had they
have been on I mean if there was any
great savings star for them that was it
that was they were doing month by month
and adding new features all along and
being really responsive and let's be
clear here
even though Andy Rubin
you know he doesn't deny or confirm much
of anything from the Bloomberg reporting
that he may be selling the company I
mean they they hired a bank to help them
find a suitor so that's that I think
that's a pretty good assumption right
there and then later on
Ramona later on in like and in like he
freakin uh you know sent a memo to the
employees and talking about how the
bloomberg piece says you know would not
position the company well for optimizing
fundraising because you know the option
is that he could go just raise money for
the company to at least continue on so
no it's it's it's I mean you might be
able to have some of those internal
conversations but it's this like the
public tweet of we're putting all of our
efforts towards our future game-changing
products well the name is tarnished I
don't have any faith that you're gonna
stay in the market if you do have
something cool for mobile always have
multiple products in development at the
same time and we embrace canceling some
in favor of the ones we think will be
bigger hits implicitly I guess
confirming that the essential phone to
would was canceled we are putting all of
our efforts towards our future
game-changing products which include
mobile and home products just wrap this
all up with his last piffy little quote
I'm gonna focus on winning and not
whining and really grow up like
seriously either join this conversation
in earnest and know what the reality of
trying to make these kinds of products
looks like or just stay out of it and
just rest on your laurels of being the
dude what made parts of Android before
Android was super popular so great and I
guess that's that for the moment
in the meantime moving on to some of the
impacts from the Sprint t-mobile merger
we talked about this last week and we're
gonna talk about it again this week just
because there been a couple of big kind
of jockeying moves going on so with the
Sprint t-mobile merger prepaid markets
in the US the prepaid cell you mark in
the US would be controlled mostly by
this new team t-mobile they would have
fifty-four percent between Boost Mobile
Virgin Mobile and metro pcs
and what some people are doing right now
or at least freedompop
is doing is launching Unreal Mobile
which is a new mobile MVNO operation
that it would start at fifteen dollars
per month for unlimited data unlimited
texts and talks but and also some more
advanced features from the big carriers
like VPN or a single number for multiple
devices and such and this is because
they say that Sprint and t-mobile are
playing nice and making sure that they
are able to offer the concessions that
they need to offer in order for this
merger to pass regulatory muster so for
them from freedompop I guess this is
gonna be an early summer start
officially this is just gonna be a beta
trial for now but $15 per month trying
to exploit some of the business deals
going on around them cool yeah well but
I think I think that's kind of
interesting though is seeing like the
VPN becoming a bigger selling point for
for tech companies right now I I saw a
press release in my email this morning
that for VPN hub yeah even pornhub the
the backers behind port HUD are looking
at creating their own VPN service to so
take that UK but yeah again positive
positive moves there but this tying
right into that that notion of Boost
Mobile the founder of Boost Mobile
wanting to take it back from Sprint and
t-mobile you know competition in this
space should be a bit more worrying to
regulators and I think it has been I
think they look at the main contract
style market and where t-mobile and
Sprint would make you know sort of like
if you combined all their subscribers
they'd still be third place yeah they'd
be around a hundred thirty years they
look at that and they say oh well that's
not scary but then
looking at 54% of the prepaid market is
kind of scary so I'll be curious to see
if who is it Pete Atherton the the
gentleman who started Boost Mobile in
Australia in the year 2000 is we right
they're gonna become a Conan O'Brien
sketch here but yeah so so I'll be
curious to see if that kind of
conversation has any legs because I
think people are under estimating the
economic force of that much weight in
the prepaid market yeah especially the
dependency on that kind of thing when
you're making less than $40 $40,000 a
year and you're relying on those
services so definitely lots to talk
about there and also lots to talk about
Apple again we're going back to that
topic but to the App Store and these
independent developers that aren't big
enough to do a subscription-based things
subscriptions on their apps and but
they're asking for free trials just as
much as the free trial exists for those
subscription-based apps and they're
saying this because they just want to be
able to push past the framing of model
where a crippled app on display on demo
for many people is just not good enough
and perhaps just a free trial of the
full experience this helps them
establish value with the user so this is
not the only effort they're going in on
I have not checked since the last time I
visited their website but it looks like
we're closing in on 600 apps and nearly
550 developers behind this cause yeah
they're also working for increased
commissions so 15% which is the amount
that Apple takes on subscription per
year after the year mark so they just
want to extend that 15% rate to everyone
yes true yeah no I'm actually just kind
of surprised that there's I mean not it
makes sense you know Apple can can do
whatever they want on their platform
it's their App Store and if they want to
position their own services where you
can use them for free and entice the
consumer into using that then I you know
again
why should Apple have to give the same
benefits to other developers right it's
all about having a free market can't
tell Apple what to do okay you can't
can't can't make them be fair to
everybody it's their platform yeah I
mean yeah their platform their apps or
well not their apps
the publishers apps and you know maybe
not develop iOS apps again and just
leave it to the big big people the you
know CBS and you know ABC or like
freaking I don't even know the big yeah
I mean again I absolutely being
facetious there it's it's one of those
things where we were going to run into
the power of the corporation and how
much influence it has over other
people's abilities to create new
products and services you know so that's
a that's a sticky conversation at the
ISP level where you know a Comcast is
gonna make an argument that they should
be able to throttle or prevent you from
looking up content or charge you more
for certain services it's going to
extend into information services where
Apple the app store is an information
service not a telecommunication service
so what-what control should Apple be
able to to to exert what leverage do
they be able to exert over the market as
a whole especially as they have a
monopoly technically on iOS you know
it's not like there's any other
competition for for iOS for apps and
services and and stuff like that and
this is also where I really hope that
web developers get severe with things
like progressive web apps that maybe we
can take some of the power out of these
mobile platforms democratically by just
going back to a web browser like instead
of having all these tiny little boxes
that we that we we install all these
tiny little square
we install in our phones maybe there is
a solution where we can we can
circumvent app stores entirely and I
would absolutely love to see a future a
near future where that happens yeah yeah
and could be the blockchain could be HTC
doing it hey-ho quickly wrap up with
this story about the GR s4 or perhaps
it's the Galaxy watch it could be the
first Android wear watch that Samsung
has produced since 2014 that Samsung
gear live remember that one well I mean
this we were I mean it's only been
whispers but we've been hearing about
people walking around Samsung campuses
wearing this watch so yeah you know 2018
you know I I'd be very surprised if
there weren't a if there hadn't been
Samsung Android wear powered Samsung
wearables out in the testing ecosystem
Samsung started with you know Android
wear as a watch OS and then moved over
well no they started with their own gear
OS and then moved over to Tizen didn't
they have one variant though that was
Android wear powered the want to say
there was a Samsung Android wear powered
watch all the gear live from 2014 yes
thank you thank you oh there it is right
right at the top of the article oh it
was trying to use my brain and we all
know how well that goes if there hadn't
been other Samsung prototypes floating
around being utilized just to see what
the lay of the land was I think this
definitely speaks to the issues Google
has been having and keeping we're
updated and keeping the software
relevant making new features keeping
manufacturers excited and informed as to
what's going on at the same time if you
want the I can wear a phone on my wrist
experience I actually do think Tizen is
probably the best option for that so
I'll be curious to see what what this
means I I think a lot of people would
agree that Samsung is probably making
the best SmartWatch Hardware right now
and then you just have your own personal
preference as to what metaphor of watch
usage you enjoy I I seem to be on the
losing side of this argument where I'd
love to get back to the pebble like an
utter clean simplicity of user of user
experience and not trying to add tons of
more features I want a companion to my
phone not a separate phone like device
that I have to manage so I don't know
what Samsung stands to gain from this I
think they're probably one of the more
successful non Apple devices and I think
they probably make one of the best
non-apple arguments for being in the
Galaxy ecosystem so if if they can bring
some of that magic to where OS I think
that would be great for Google but I
think it would dilute what makes a where
watch special mmhmm yeah I mean the
rotating bezel I feel like is B main
characteristic of any gear watch at this
point I want that real bad for Android
wear I want that real bad for wear OS
Android wear has sorta more wear or less
a sort of implemented date with that you
know button crown thing but it's just
you know I feel like just that being the
ease of use for that and you know being
a watch that's worn on your wrist and
you have to actually fuss around a bit
like the manual UI is kind of very
important to whether or not the whole
experience is pleasurable or not so I
feel like you know you get them in on
the ground floor if that and you'll be
fine with software as long as it doesn't
crash and you know slow down on in
explicably like Android wear 2.0 but I
mean man wear OS has been has been
nothing but issues lately I feel like
these most recent updates on my watch to
not been good man I'm getting
notifications crazy late I'm getting
duplicate notifications that it it gets
really funky when you switch back and
forth between being directly connected
to the phone and trying to update over
Wi-Fi I've not been impressed I I am
having a progressively less good time on
the wear OS platform as it evolves and I
just don't have anything that really
fits that
whole right now I want good
notifications interactive notifications
things I can actually reply to I want
good voice actions so I can do speech to
text to reply to a text message if I'm
if I'm using it out and about I and I
need notifications off my phone I do not
like checking my phone to see what a
notification is I just don't like I hate
absolutely hate the experience of
looking at my phone for notification so
all of this leaves me kind of you know
without a country I'm not gonna go to
Apple watch even though it's probably
the best overall platform right now I'm
not currently using a Samsung so moving
over to a gear really isn't isn't a
compelling option either
pebbles dead Fitbit isn't very
compelling for all of the SmartWatch
features and that still leaves me with
where OS being my default like I'm on it
by default which is the worst place to
be if you actually care about this kind
of accessory technology and I don't even
read the notifications that I wear
freakin where am i watch so it's like
what's the point you know there it goes
into ellipsis and I have to actually tap
into it to read more well greats yeah so
much for glance ability but well in from
like the Huawei what would I have the
huawei fitness tracker and it's like the
watch way I get forwards and then it
cuts off the notification and it's not
Android wear it's not wear oh I keep
saying Android wear it's not wear OS so
I can't like touch it and then get more
information it's just that was the
notification you can't do anything with
it you're like ah this would be so much
it was so close to a pebble it was so
close you know an ePaper digital ink
style display awesome battery life
always on heart rate monitoring it was
so close but then it like had zero
features for the SmartWatch side of the
occasion of the of the situation and I
was just so disappointed
yeah well and we'll have to wait and see
if all this actually stirs up and
becomes a real thing I mean you know
it's a year on they'll probably have
something there's just what's it running
so at this point we're still in the
guessing stages and in the meantime we
have something new we have something
bright and fresh but also pretty much
the same thing as last year I mean we'll
give it it will give it a little credit
here I mean it does have one more no it
does have two more cameras because the
u11 had one camera last year right
I couldn't glean from Jules is very
wishy-washy introductions this year's
we're talking about the HTC you 12-plus
bring him back boom sound speakers edge
sense a lot of upset people there has
been a quite a bit of debate going back
and forth between individual features
and what manufacturers are carrying them
out better going on in our live chat
right now which is much longer
conversation that I can really owe to
the rest of our podcast here but let's
start with a goran petrovic here hi guys
I am sad HTC revealed everything I
feared they well of course you have been
paying attention to the leaks so good
good for you for doing that for cameras
and tons of gimmicks and on top of it
all they've heard Apple won't include
the 3.5 millimeter adapter soon so they
did the same 4.0 quick charger not
included - instead it's gonna be support
for point you know but it's gonna be
it's for Plus which Qualcomm you need to
get that sorted out because this whole
thing about standards and branding and
whatnot it just stupid and also the
adapter issue it's a quick charts 3.0
again Qualcomm sort this out but also
I'll give HTC credit because they do
offer a freaking set of earbuds u.s. we
see here but it's in it the freaking
thing it's active noise-cancelling
and even though it's a form of lock-in
it's it's a decent mattress form of
lock-in well that's exactly why I don't
want to give them too much credit though
because the ear buds that have been
coming with HTC phones are not USBC
audio devices they are proprietary
headphones that work on HTC phones so
it's so this is also one of the big
fails if I'm on an lg g7 which has
objectively the absolute best headphone
experience available to any smartphone
manufacturer today I did personally
produce an lg g7 audio review which you
guys can check out if guys want it's my
own personal little side revival of
talking about smart phone audio yeah so
I that that is an amazing experience
that I unplug one cable from the phone
and I plug it into my laptop or I plug
it into my desktop and I don't have to
worry about adapters or
fiddling with different USB audio
devices or proprietary connections that
that's amazing it works exactly like a
standard should if I had at least a USB
C audio device a true USB C audio device
like you get with the Huawei headphones
are USB C audio and then the adapter for
the pixel is a true USB audio device
then at least I could unplug my
headphones from my phone and plug them
into the USB C port on my laptop and not
have to worry about compatibility
HTC solution unfortunately is locked to
the phone so I'd say you're walking
around with a phone you've got your
really great HTC earbuds they are great
your buds but if you want to use them
with anything else you can't you're
stuck it's that that to me is is the
absolute worst possible solution for
moving us away from the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack I am very very not
impressed with them not including an
adapter and also if this is true that
the that the fastest quick charging
solution is not going to be included in
the box
then that to me is consumer gouging that
that to me is a very is a very
disappointing trend where our phones
used to come with a whole bunch of
accessories you pull out you
Huawei and it comes with not the best
but it comes with a case and an adapter
and earbuds and the super charger and
the cable that you're ready to use that
phone out of the box right now glass on
glass with no accessories it makes you
feel like you're seven to eight hundred
dollar purchase is completely incomplete
that you're gonna have to spend at least
another 50 or $100 if you don't already
have solutions for those for those
missing items in the smartphone purchase
I don't feel like I can't agree with
most of those opinions first of all
because well let's hold off on the USBC
adapter thing because we haven't had
enough hands on time as of right now to
determine if that's the case if the I
said if it's true that the adapter and
the quick charger aren't in the box and
that to me would be that that's almost
no deal-breaker for for a premium phone
but yeah I mean if the use well even if
the you sonic buds are Locker still
locked in device so we'll have to really
dive into that and in the meantime
they're also struggling to again go with
carriers on this because again it's
gonna be unlocked it's gonna be at $7.99
or 849 depending on what you get and
they're dealing with a galaxy s 9 plus
in that territory right there which is
already hard enough I mean in terms of
like the sales split it's like a 60/40
or 7 take that between like a regular
and a plus-size model so they're really
lot of this really does look like it is
trying to go up against the larger
versions of these phones I don't think
HTC has much design on trying to hit the
smaller the smaller phone's battery the
battery size on the u12 plus the screen
size it looks like they have the galaxy
s 9 plus in their sights which means
pricing is going to start somewhere
closer to that territory yeah yeah so
definitely a lot of stuff going on let's
talk about boomsound for a quick second
I mean it's back in the form that it has
been since with HTC 10 you got the
woofer down south and the tweeter up
north on the earpiece so
and apparently that's going to be louder
than before they always claim this sort
of thing so again something to see
hi-five happy to see that return I mean
that was something that the HTC ten did
really well there there were gonna be
your personal preferences as to whether
or not you liked the true stereo
speakers from the HTC One m7 m8 m9 or if
you liked the split high frequency low
frequency from the HTC ten but having
two speakers in that place unless you do
something fundamentally different to a
mono speaker like what LG did for the
boombox feature on the g7 unless you
really redesign a part of the phone to
enhance a chamber of audio like what
they did then the split speaker solution
I think was probably one of the best
compromises a manufacturer has ever made
it divides up different frequency
response abilities and helps fill fill
out the sound but they got rid of it for
a generation was a bad move so I'm
really happy to see that back
yeah that's back from the HTC 10
although I mean I have the Moto G 6
right here and it's got doubly enhanced
front-facing speakers and I'm loving it
so yeah again like Muskaan verse a ssin
about us having impossibly small bezels
on devices that means we do sacrifice
certain types of complimentary design
you know like Alcatel front firing
speakers sound really good on two to
$300 phones like they sound really good
and it's because not necessarily because
they have the best possible speakers in
there but because they have two speakers
on the phone and they're both pointing
at your face which is the right place to
point a speaking I mean you're not
supposed to point it at your nose but I
mean the nose is pretty low the nose
nose the nose nose what's up you don't
have to do it you don't have to like
pull like a sideways ear bending kind of
posed with our
so now it's only been until the g7 that
I feel like a phone has actually is
actually powerful enough for me to not
just shrug at a mono bottom firing
speaker like okay we finally have
something that I think is worth 17 times
residents chambered whatever
uncomfortably loud when you hold it up I
mean it's it's pretty shocking and then
it sounds even better when you put it on
a table and then it sounds even better
when you put it on a big hollow box and
it feels like something that HTC would
have done back in the day
sounds pretty woody move mine originally
for my for my test when I did test the
g7 is like it sounds kind of cardboard
II suck I didn't have any really good
like I didn't have a good speaker cab I
could put it on I didn't have like a
keepsake box or a guitar I play the bass
guitar I don't have an acoustic bass
guitar um
so instead I just put it on an old UPS
box so looks super janky but like as
soon as you put it on they're like oh my
god that's ridiculous
I want to be excited about HTC audio
like that again but this feels like okay
we're just returning to a sensible HTC
like HTC shouldn't have gotten rid of
this feature so really I'm just relieved
that it's back on on one of their phones
again so one step forward after so many
steps back I guess I mean we said we
should praise that I mean that is a
smart recovery I am happy to see that
it's just knowing how LG has sort of
taken up the mantle of high quality
audio and boom sound branding used to be
the gold standard for smartphone audio
it's just something that I feel has it's
that differentiate er that I feel HTC
has lost that used to set them apart and
now you know it puts them right back in
there with like a mate 10 Pro yeah
that's essentially what we're looking at
now the the H the HTC you 12 plus what
really makes it a different or
compelling option from a phone that was
out at the end of last year and so it's
something that can keep your ear canals
happy and I realize that but what about
the Front's when you're not
the nose with the eyes this time and
what it can capture with its eyes let's
talk about the camera here dual cameras
on the front yeah let's jump in well
dual cameras on the front build cameras
on the back the dual cameras on the the
selfie side apparently helped with face
ID and depth perception for that okay
feature no there was also a wide-angle
one wide-angle camera on the front so I
don't know how if I were to
approximately 84 degrees as a as a angle
as a field of view I mean that's okay
that's decent but you'd have to you know
if you were to go for like a group
selfie then you would have to push the
people way back and I don't know but you
know it's a good step and then there's
the front two or the rear yeah the rear
and we're talking about what's the
combination here twelve and sixteen and
the 16 megapixel sensor has optical zoom
of one point eight five two two times
I'm guessing part of that's got to do
with focusing perhaps they have a like a
actual focused motor in there which
would be interesting to see although
it's at an F two point six aperture you
kind of shifty at that point even though
they're they're proclaiming big pixel
sizes on the sensor so it would be
concerned about that I would be very
surprised if the zoom sensor on the the
u12 functions any differently than
Samsung or Apple that once you get into
indoor and lower light conditions that
it's just pulling from the main sensor
anyway well I bet you would be surprised
then that the freaking you 12 plus has
received a DXF mark mobile score of 103
officially beating the Huawei P 20 but
not the p20 Pro which stands at 109 so
I'm not I'm not terribly surprised by
the overall the overall camera score the
HTC 10 they've been making good cameras
anyone who's been who's been deriding
HTC
cameras I I I would be very worried that
they just don't know how cameras work in
cameras they just haven't been like you
know you know groundbreaking they always
just seem to rise to the trend and to
the performance expected of a flagship
of that year but they've always been the
especially getting out of the one m9 the
the one m9 was a terrible experience but
getting back into the HTC 10 and moving
forward
they've been perfectly competitive in
high-quality performers so I'm not
surprised to see them beating out the
smaller p20 here now that they're
finally getting on to this multiple
image sensor system in there they're
processing is likely influenced by some
of the recent software changes that
Google has been making - I would imagine
that some of that conversation from
previous pixel manufacturing has likely
rubbed off on on HTC proper I'm not just
the engineers who left HTC to go to
Google just you know that back and forth
this was a phone that was likely in
development a year and a half ago so I
would imagine that they've learned a few
things from helping make pixel phones
that that to me makes perfect sense but
it's also the zoom sensor is my least
favorite way to do a dual camera phone
so well I mean that's what I'm going to
with the hold EXO mark thing because
they do prioritize that zoom factor even
if a phone has a wide angle sensor
they're still going to proclaim hey zoom
is going to be an important factor in
our testing here we're talking about 54
millimeter equivalents here on that zoom
and it what this produced more detailed
photos at a two times crop or something
like that as you know compared to an
iPhone 10 or a pixel 2 we do sacrifice
that brightness that we've been talking
about but also there's just a little bit
more of that sharpness enhancement so
it's trying to extrapolate details that
yeah I'm looking I'm looking at their
samples and I actually trust that DxO is
internally consistent it says that I
think trying to sum up the overall
camera xperia me 20 minutes to talk
about a smartphone camera just a camera
g7 audio review is a 19-minute video I
mean it's it's it's tough to get into
the depth of this stuff and properly
explain the experience and not just have
it be 30 seconds as a part of an overall
phone review you know so the same thing
has to hold true for DXL you can't sum
up the camera with one score you
actually do need to go to their review
and look at some of their their pros and
cons but when I look at you know like
they compare the HTC you 12 plus to the
Google pixel to in a 2x zoom crop and
there's a lot of extra sharpening going
on on the you 12 to try and pull out
that detail especially compared to the
to the iPhone X which also has a zoom
sensor on there I compare some of their
results to some of the experiences I've
had on say like the LGV 30 with a glass
lens element and I kind of feel like
you're not that much better going with
the zoom sensor you know it it is better
but only if you're doing like a 100%
crop pixel peep of that detail I don't
think it's so much better that we need
to have a whole second sensor on the
phone just to get us a little bit closer
to our subject from far away because
once you fully zoom in the the quality
on these shots goes to garbage anyway
yeah I mean we they point that out in
terms of artifacting you know whatnot
but those are just minor circumstances
that we can you know forgive autofocus
seems to be one of the big selling
points for HTC's cameras this year and
apparently it lives up to with short you
know delays of their auto focusing
system which is comprised of both this
dual pixel our phase detect excuse me
face detector autofocus and the laser
sensing system yeah that's apparently
been very well for them it's been very
very fast and accurate so no so I mean
yeah you get you get what you give I
guess right there
yeah all this is happening I quickly
take on the slow motion they're only
still at 240fps you think it's a big
loss that they're not in the 960 game or
I think we just like to see them step up
to what is it one plus is at 484 this is
this is another bummer that I've had
with with some of these smaller players
like LG 2 I
they might focus on a handful of
features and do them really well but
then they'll let some of their fun
features just sort of wither and and
this is one of those things it's it's I
don't believe that slow motion video is
something that people are really
motivated to make a purchasing decision
off of but it's nice when you have it
it's fun to play with and then when you
don't get that or you don't get a
serious improvement to it that's one of
those things that just sort of sticks
out is a little bit of a letdown like Oh
bummer I really wish this had like that
crazy burst mode from a Sony phone or
you know 480 frame per second burst like
from a Samsung or from from oneplus not
not having it just feels like I'm not
getting I'm not getting everything I
want to get everything so I I guess I
don't know that it should be heavily
weighted in an overall review though I
mean even for when I'm trying to capture
photos and videos of my daughter I'm
almost never thinking oh this crazy
Tasmanian Devil toddler I should try and
get her in slow motion no I'm really
just trying to struggle to keep up to
capture the highest quality images in 4k
video that I can to really preserve
memories I'm never thinking oh this
would be really cool if I could get her
shenanigans and then do like a slow-mo
speed ramp or something like that it's
kind of when you look at that are you
thinking like hey I really want slowed
down 720p footage of my kid playing at
the park or do I want like really
high-quality crispy juicy vibrant images
or photos or stills and I can share with
the grandparents and have them go and
look and see and and show that off I
think I think recover bring you know
pepper mix you know do both and it's
like kind of cool like that because
differ things up III think occasionally
it is but but I think the
correct to focus on the core photo and
video experience and not to get overly
hung up about some of the fun features
it's just those fun features make you
feel like you're missing out on stuff
when you don't have them so that's also
why I think like you have the DxO mark
score again even for not having a crazy
awesome slow-motion feature I think
their scoring is internally consistent I
think they've been covering these
gadgets consistently and I think the
overall score there that's emblematic of
what the HTC camera that's how it should
be ranked but you would want to go
through and pick out you know maybe you
value certain types of video performance
better maybe you value certain types of
photo performance better and that's
where you get into trouble if you only
look at the EXO's top score
yeah the JCB mark score is coming out
soon right and the what scores the JCB
mark I will see man I unfortunately I've
been trying to wrap up the g7 camera
review and the last week we've been
having the worst maigre and June gloom
in Southern California so I haven't
gotten any daylight shot since I took it
down to San Diego so I'm waiting to get
my last couple really good daylight
samples and then I'll be able to talk g7
and then I'm gonna be moving on to the
one plus six sir look at the boss
Barstow and freaking I don't know that
he wanted I might have to because again
I don't need much I just need a handful
of my consistent test setups to get
those last couple review points done and
it's just bugging the crap out of me
that it's like the lighting is way off
from how I normally produce my camera
reviews but not you know if HTC wants to
join that conversation I would be happy
to take the u12 plus out first bin but
the next phone up on my list is gonna be
the one plus six yeah yeah James W in
the Utah YouTube chat quickly saying I
do trust HTC's camera the U 11 was the
top camera before the pixel 2 and the
iPhone eights complained and again like
I think they've been consistently solid
performers since the HTC 10 I had you
know whether or not you you have they
have the bells and whistles that really
light you up
that that really appealed to you I can I
can definitely understand that
subjective argument but the core push
shutter button get get photo get video
performance has been has been top-tier
like they've been no complaints
solid premium flagship grade experiences
for the last several years well we've
had our meat and potatoes but as we move
away from the camera towards the fun
features that we've talked about they're
building on this fun feature our own
maybe it's fun maybe it's not but ed
sense too with the squeeze mechanic for
the you know doing not only triggering
apps just with a squeeze or like a
certain level squeeze you can squeeze
and activate a macro like a tap on the
screen of a certain app so that you can
have easy access to whatever function is
right there so and they've expanded that
so now it's a you can do a double
squeeze or a double tap or something
like that or and you also have detection
of when the hand is there so that it
just stays in portrait mode even though
you're kind of lying down reading
something and still have it on auto
rotate which is alright that's fine
you'll have more of that screen to look
at to buy one display the first
mainstream HTC device even we're not
talking about the yell oven plus which
ding make it them North America it's the
first one here so I guess that's that
for us side bezels look pretty thin I'll
say that top and bottom I just kind of
want to ask like your experiences
because I've gone out of my way to
disable like on the pixel on on Samsung
devices on the g7 I disable any kind of
hardware that only points me to an
assistant or to you know smart features
like that like if it can't be remapped
like it used to be on galaxy active
phones then it's a button that's
completely useless to me you've been
rocking a pixel do you squeeze your
phone to do stuff ever Hey
kuan talking about i'm not sure hey oh
but no seriously I mean like is that
something that you use over the voice
action if you have to talk to your phone
and literally I did that and like I've
been doing that every so often just
because I can't be arsed to go in and
you know say hey Google or or like go to
the freakin text field and you like that
I pull it out and it's just boom and I
asked what I question so but that's kind
of what I'm talking about though is
again is this really worth building and
dedicated hardware to support an
interaction which already has a
meaningful organic interactive quality
to it through a hot word again I can't
be arsed to say the heart word like
that's that's part of it like it's like
hey Google oh you can't you Mike
oh you can't recognize that but you
recognize when I say hot pizza and
suddenly you're like oh let's talk about
hot pizza
fine great that's that's great so I I
don't bother with the hot word and just
rely on something more reliable like my
my hands okay yeah no seriously I mean I
think a part of this is all sewed and I
had to give up on squeezy features
because it would trigger whenever I put
my phone in its car cradle really yeah
that's I mean it would it would trigger
and then it would just stay off because
it's being constantly squeezed the
entire time but if I'm driving I'm not
gonna push a button I'm not gonna
squeeze the phone I'm gonna use my voice
which yeah that's true but makes makes
sense and when you're driving but I mean
I'm walking around and going through
transit and you like just running and
holding fifteen things at once sometimes
and that's another thing too is is like
I've started relying on on headphones
more you know long press on on a
headphone button to get to basic call
features or the basic voice actions that
way so again oh my god are we talking
about like sippy phones and country
phones we're like no yeah this is a city
mouse and country mouse but but it's
also like um you know
I I've been really working to minimize
how many times I need to pick up and
handle the phone to get things done that
I can do without breaking my focus on
some other aspect of the world around me
in front of me and if I'm walking around
and I'm usually wearing a pair of
headphones if I'm walking around and the
basic stuff can be covered by
long-pressing on a headset button or
some type of voice interaction that way
and I don't even have to pull my phone
out of my pocket then that's something
that's been appealing to me more - so
again i-i-i i guess that is again it's
more of a subjective experience but I'm
really curious I'm what what what does
squeezing a phone bring as a gesture or
an interaction that we need that kind of
hardware increasing the price of the
phone to cover stuff which already has
another solution I don't know I mean
between like going through the headset
just the deal with playback controls I
don't have I don't happen to have a
assistant button on this thing because
it's a well this is not it but somewhere
in this room is is the Bluetooth headset
that I used to go outside but yeah it's
like it doesn't have an assistant button
and it's just like it's a cheap low
thing that I got because I lost my other
pair of headphones in a like you know
while I was traveling and even then it
was a tiny little thing it was a little
nub and or like it was something that
was like you know you have to do hand
out acrobatics just to get it and press
it in a certain way so that it actuates
so it's like well okay fine then I'll do
something that has more surface area
that has more you know of less of a
margin of error to using sorry you rest
of the audience Jules and I are just
gonna run a little headset tech support
here right now yeah yeah totally
I'm mr. Wong if you could you know just
describe to me what headset you're using
let's say over the years it's that as
long as you had some kind of like phone
answering button that you just could
long press and that would activate the
assist no it's it's it's not it doesn't
have an embedded mic but even then it's
okay okay what-what does have a mic but
even with my job my job I never really
actually well first of all I don't I
don't really get calls and Moammar spam
so well kind of like waited for me not
for answering calls what I mean is is
even when I want to do something tactile
to activate voice assistant it's I still
don't want to get my phone out of my
pocket I just push the button and then
voices then the Google assistant
activates again like I'm not gonna
squeeze my phone when I'm walking around
because I usually have headphones on
yeah but totally and you've been
habituated to do that because it's you
know it's kind of like the controls that
you go to more often than I do and
whereas I I'm kind of like well I don't
even take calls and I just end up at
like holding the phone out anyway it's
like a stupid person with a bluetooth
headphone like you like the phone out
and well it's like it's like I don't
Jules I write
we've untangled something I feel like we
could make your life easier man I think
I have to actually search for it like
which but am i turning the headset off
like just like hold the button I mean
like you know well for your particular
one it's right there and and I just
found it again
again why would I you know but I just
don't see it like that it's not it's not
an assistive button when I'm walking
around like I don't want to be handling
my phone anymore because they're all so
flippin fragile now it's like dump
anything done just just by going to my
the headset mic on my on my headphones
then I'm moving into my motor g6 for a
review and this is Saul glass so I have
to be very kind to it before I have to
send me back to the person so it's again
on this whatever finish it this is the
paint what not there's low glare but I
don't care the pixel I mean I was I was
very upset with how easily the black
picks
chipped but man that felt good going
back to more of a matte finish feel in
the hand
I was just go back through a bunch of
old phones and picked up my Lumia 930
man this is a good feeling phone I miss
this this this was a phone that I was
excited to handle and I never had a case
on it going back to the u12 plus
Raffaelli from the YouTube chat HTC u12
has a dim display we're talking about
Super LCD 6 marking a return to the
upgrade cycle for that kind of
technology I'm not sure what go into is
entailed with that so I'm gonna you know
brush up on that but we have all the
support for the standard color gamuts
srgb DCI p3 also supporting HDR 10
streaming so hopefully we see Netflix
and YouTube follow suit in supporting
the device over there and yeah this is
it is it is gonna be HDR compliant yeah
though III guess I I don't know what is
the brightness on Super LCD 6
I mean LCD technology mostly used by HTC
but I mean it there's no real kind of
thing going on here in terms of well who
makes it I mean how it there is some
comparison to amyloid but it's a you
know it's kind of an anonymous kind of
thing going on people are assuming a
brightness just somewhere vaguely beyond
600 nits which that puts it behind the
g7 so definitely but I'm not sure where
then you know the skin and also I would
like to see minimum brightness too
because this thing has the the moto
active display but this is an LCD the
Moto G 6 so it has to turn on the whole
display in order to deal with that so
yeah that's uh it's kind of a bother for
that kind of thing yeah I don't get
super so I prefer him
LED displays I just like the contrast
ratio and how ridiculous ridiculously
oversaturated the colors get on on EMA
LED screens but I haven't been super
cranky about picking up LCD screen phone
so I've never really completely
understood the people that walk around
with an assumption that LCD is garbage
the g7 has actually been a pretty good
argument for how you make an LCD display
brighter like it works for TVs and yeah
I guess when I'm when I'm really looking
at like movie content I can kind of see
blacks or dark Gray's instead of being
completely off pixels but the overall
daily phone usage has been great so as
long as I can read an HTC u12 screen in
California daylight then I'm gonna be
fine it's gonna be fine
and it'll also bring some other
advantages too like if we started
getting some more of these like super
high refresh rate displays I'd love to
see that become more of a trend to you
know that the the razor phone was
disappointingly dim but then when you
fire up content with a high refresh rate
like that looks awesome so I'd love to
see if we couldn't combine those two
somehow with crazy fast refresh you know
refresh beads with a super high
brightness mode I mean if they get the
right supplier for that kind of thing
out now supera whoever makes Super LCD
might not want to look into that in any
case I'm hearing I'm seeing this number
319 it's being pulled out which is kind
of I don't know like it would be too low
yeah I see I see the tweet goran
petrovic
on the p-n weekly hash tag says 319 nits
I I would I would be very surprised if
it were that low III
I can't believe HTC is gonna put out a
phone screen that dim but either if I'm
wrong I will likely not acknowledge it
and say that you know as long as you
don't look at it freaking
uh daylight are like direct sunlight
it's good we fine people well it's gonna
be fine folks 319 nits that would worry
me that it wouldn't even be it would be
very difficult to read in indirect light
in daylight outside that that to me
would be very concerning if it were if
it were really that dim and it didn't
have any kind of burst or high
brightness mode when you were using it
in Auto mm-hm
yeah so I mean medev brightness going on
there as part of the you know their
software suite which is a still light as
ever still kind of just very decent very
plain I guess I mean since well it's
been since since five but it's been a
little bit long in the chief now so
hopefully nobody from the more garish
you know HTC and and emui
LG and EMU I could learn a few things
from HTC walking back the more garish
design elements of previous phones but
um you know there's got to be a lot
running under the hood if you've got
custom hardware like squeezed features I
mean one thing that I am good am
grateful for is the six gigs of DDR 4x
ram standard I mean that's that's
finally you know we'd have to freakin
deal with four gigs on the freakin
galaxy s nine or you know I mean you're
playing less turns but like we always
make that like the weird mid I I would
really just don't don't change the
performance of the phone for different
tiers of the same phone just make the
storage the deciding factor between like
a device that's your entry-level gadget
and then you bump it up from 64 to 128
or 256 and that's that's how you
determine how the phone's cost it for
whatever reason that makes me super
cranky when I see a phone come out well
I mean the base model has four gigs of
RAM and 64 gigs of storage and then the
nice version has six gigs of RAM and 256
like even with that molten you know that
much more storage you're not going to
you know utilize all of that ramp
you be able to have you know certain
sections of that in instant memory just
so that you can do tasks though you've
been fine with four gigs in 128 or four
gigs and well not it's not been common
with 256 but you get my point like
that's not something that is really
storage dependent or I mean it shouldn't
be but for whatever reason manufacturers
tend to link those so I'm just happy to
see that six gigs is standard so what
will say that that's at this price of
course it has to be standard all right
well but I mean again what did the
Galaxy S 9 Plus launch at this is the
phone that they've likely got $725 I've
no no no the s9 + didn't OS 9 + 840
right so for $50 less than an s9 +
that's that's the argument HTC is making
so you know you don't need that this
price doesn't guarantee you 6 gigs of
ram and so totally but I mean you know
you have to look at the market that is
buying into the larger phone market
still are we still looking at that same
market from 2015 where peoples tend to
favor 6-inch phones for whatever reason
and people are still very happy to see
text I'm saying is that was that was
another opportunity for HTC to fail and
they managed not to so I'm saying is
just because the phone's expensive
doesn't mean that the manufacturer knows
that those hardware components are gonna
make a difference to tech enthusiasts
Lois straws here to you know save HTC I
feel like that you know they've done
pretty ok I'm not I mean we haven't
talked about the the translucent blue
color because I think well I have
visuals and a freaking audio podcast but
yeah like the hands-on video so if you
were watching the YouTube livestream of
this then you at least got to see some
of I may get Iveta molesting yeah yeah I
I think this is a fine phone and and
really I'm gonna put this up in the same
thing like when we had a conversation
with with Nick a couple weeks back we
were talking about the g7 I the the
the situation isn't you know what are
they doing is that enough is it good
enough do they deserve to get attention
like that's not the question it's this
is looking like it's gonna be a great
phone it looks like it's going to be a
very good phone I think the biggest
problem facing a lot of these
manufacturers is that they seem
completely unwilling or unable to join a
consumer conversation with traditional
advertising with good marketing and with
a consistent approach to telling people
about why their products are interesting
and HTC is still in a position where
they can't really do that
and I for the life of me I can't
understand why they're gonna go after
some gimmick with like a celebrity in
their commercials and they will probably
have a whole bunch of aspirational
marketing which doesn't really focus on
what makes their product different or
interesting or fun and then a week after
the phone is actually launched all of
those ads will disappear because they
don't want to spend money on ad buys or
billboards or magazines or anything like
that and then they'll wonder like well
why isn't anyone talking about our phone
two months after it's launched you know
it's you talking about your phone you
months after you launched it it's almost
been a decade since speaking of you the
years bringing back the all-time best
smartphone brand advertising campaign
that he should have been building on
that this entire time and I think they
would be a lot more successful or at
least have a bit more consumer mindshare
than they currently have you're getting
into the third generation of the pixel
and Google spends a ton keeping the
pixel active in in advertising in
marketing it doesn't just disappear
after the phone launches you see pixel
billboards and pixel commercials after
the phone has been has been released I I
imagine that we're going to see some
significant growth in pixel sales after
the first two had some teething pains
getting to the market and consumers are
gonna see Oh Google really means it
they're actually sticking around they're
improving upon these things and you're
gonna get a lot more good well
from tech reviewers and enthusiasts
there so when you search for that
content it's going to become a lot more
SEO friendly and everything is going to
go their way
HTC keeps disappearing from the
conversation LG keeps disappearing from
the conversation and it gives consumers
a reason to ignore them like there's no
reason to invest in that ecosystem if
the manufacturer doesn't look like they
have faith in their products yeah yeah
and that's the question that the whole
HTC Google deal has left us with what
will they do with that billion dollars
will they just leave this behind and
focus on the niche blockchain and VR
phones that they have planned for us or
well they actually make a good-faith
attempt at keeping this thing around
into 2019
time it's it's a brand on the ropes and
I think everyone has their quick-fix
solution on what what would make HTC
compelling again I think my big argument
would be be big be public get this phone
into consumers hands outside of LA San
Francisco in New York be aggressive in
talking about this product in every type
of media I mean get those ad buys up
expose consumers to this and then also
have a have your talking points down on
what differentiates this from from a
galaxy if you were only because everyone
likes to have this argument like oh well
they should have priced it cheaper than
it would win like that never works if
your argument is you should make the
product cheaper and then I would buy it
that person was never really going to
buy that phone anyway not in a way that
would have made the company the
manufacturer a profit which means that
that's unsustainable that that company
is eventually going to wither and die so
you know you can make a compelling
argument the same thing that happened to
essential you can make a compelling
argument for why a phone costs more this
has been the big win for Google the
Nexus was never going to be a consumer
focused device because consumers were
going to look at it see
that was cheaper less expensive than the
iPhone well that means it's not as good
making essentially a prettier Nexus
which doesn't really impact the cost of
manufacturing the phone to a significant
degree instantly made that the Google
iPhone and consumers were far more
willing to take it seriously as
something that could compete against an
iPhone the HTC has all the right stuff
it has all the DNA and then they just
whisper like LG has some really
compelling reasons for why you would
want to pick up a g7 over a Galaxy S
nine but then they just mumble instead
of like standing up and saying here is
our thing if you like this kind of stuff
you should buy it it just flabbergasting
I do not understand why they're going
through multibillion-dollar corporations
are going through making these things
and then ignoring that consumers don't
know that this is horrible you freaking
got people on the whole you know
freaking hot words and buttons now and
then this guy reaches like complaining
couldn't you just use the okay Google or
hey Siri well like half the time they
don't respond to me like that so oh gosh
I mean I just leave me alone
leave me alone with my phone right
but yeah so um we're gonna have more
coverage obviously on the HTC u12 plus
coming up we have a video up already you
can check out sort of our initial early
reactions some stories about other you
know HTC u12 plus coverage including a
brief right up on the DxO score that you
can check that out too I might
eventually get around to reviewing it I
don't know
it's HTC is becoming a company like Sony
where they seem to hold off on certain
reviewers and then they just sort of
disappear from the conversation again
so again it's it's tough to
tough to spend time with the phone
really feel get a feel for what it's
like to use it suggest who the phone
might be a good fit for and by the time
you've gone through that whole process
like the company's already sort of
pulled out of that conversation anyway
that's so it that's been a difficult
moving target for HTC in some of these
conversations also yeah yeah well well
we're gonna have to see where that
target moves to and we'll where we'll
try to hit it as we can into our reveal
process and hopefully we get some more
discourse going on because I mean HTC
can't do it alone I guess well either
thing is they can't rely on us they know
the game or themselves but I that's
probably as good a place to wrap this up
as any apologies because we were we were
kind of talking about trying to get back
to a normal schedule for our listener
mailbag but we did want to spend some
time talking about that ZTE story right
at the top of the show kind of pushed
our schedule around so we will get back
to that I promise we will get back to
that because we do we do have one more
week in May we might as well you know
really kind of focus on that next week I
my calendar in my brain is off for some
reason I thought this was our last I'll
