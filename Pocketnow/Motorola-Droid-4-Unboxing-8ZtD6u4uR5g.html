Motorola Droid 4 is the latest in the
droid family and it's also the latest
Android powered smartphone with a
slide-out keyboard what comes in the box
let's go take a look this is the
packaging that the Motorola Droid 4 for
Verizon comes in it's relatively simple
you've got barcodes on one side some
basic FCC disclaimers and recyclability
on the other over here we have some
information that it's TV compatible and
trademarks and all kinds of stuff along
with a notice that a device restocking
fee may apply if you return or exchange
this device up on the top packaging
contents what comes inside the box the
front is a very simple Droid 4 and on
the back is really what makes the Droid
4 stand out which is this nice slide-out
keyboard so let's go ahead and open it
up and see what we get so inside the box
my verizon rep put the Verizon 4G LTE
micro SIM package then we have the phone
itself we'll get to that in a minute
underneath this kind of folds up we have
a wall wart with looks like the USB plug
is down in the bottom so this plugs into
the wall and the power plug comes out
there next we have our nice USB cable
this one is a little bit dissimilar from
what we've become accustomed to with
previous droids but still it'll do what
it needs to of course it has a micro USB
on one end and traditional USB on the
other we also have our backplate and
something else inside there which we'll
get to and of course our obligatory
manuals product and safety warranty
information yadda yadda yadda all that
stuff that nobody ever reads so that's
what's in the box let's go ahead and
open up this backplate
and opening that we have a kind of an
instruction sheet here telling you how
to put everything together and then down
at the bottom of that package this
little pink bag and that pink bag is
simply a little pokey thing looks kind
of like a oppressor now why do you have
that eye I don't know is there a reset
who knows it doesn't say but there's a
barcode on it we'll find out and let you
know in an upcoming video but let's go
ahead and plug this in we'll open up our
micro sim now this phone does have a
microSD slot some of them are coming
without them there's our micro SIM go
ahead and just pop that off the card and
set it aside to insert that we lift this
side and that lifts up this little kind
of rubberized gasket shows a picture of
what it's supposed to look like so we'll
go ahead and put the SIM in like that if
we had a micro SD which there was not
one in the box that would plug in right
there one other interesting thing of
note this battery it says right here is
non removal don't attempt to remove it
dad I don't know quite how I feel about
it
it looks like it's removable you just
have to kind of cut this warranty tape
to get at it but it's very clear telling
you you know don't do that on the back
let's go back to the instructions to
insert the micro sd we already did that
there's the grommet cover the Micro SIM
micro SD and it notes again the battery
is not removable shows us how to install
the backplate so let's take that little
instruction sheet off go ahead and set
this down now there is a nice little
tabby thing right there you set the
backplate down has kind of a nice
texture to the back and then that little
thing goes up now that's where that
little pushy thing comes into play
now it's locked in place till you take
this pushy thing and push it in this
little hole which releases that little
plunger that's holding the backplate on
so kind of an interesting design fairly
novel that you have to have that little
piece and I think a paper clip would
probably do just as good in there so
that's the unboxing in the next video
we're going to give you a hardware
walk-around and first boot of the phone
so make sure you stay tuned for that
four pocket now showing off the Motorola
Droid 4 I'm Joe the Android guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
