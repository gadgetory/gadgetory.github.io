market may never see I'm high as a huge
mother pocket now at Evo 2015 and this
is the Sony Xperia z5 I know I know we
barely even saw the Xperia z4 but the z5
is the new hotness from Sony and despite
looking a lot like previous iterations
there are a few changes to make note of
for starters the fragile glass backing
of Xperia S has been replaced with a
more rigid aluminum plate that looks and
feels just as premium the 32 gigabytes
of internal storage should be enough for
most people taking photos or listening
to music through the front firing
speakers and for the rest there's
microSD expansion onboard so long as you
can put up with Sony's fragile and
tedious card tray the 2900 milliamp hour
battery while non-removable supports the
quick charge 2.0 standard and sony
claims that should last users up to two
full days per charge but there's still
no wireless charging to be found
Sony's very proud of the camera
experience in the z5 which uses an
improved 23 megapixel sensor with a
handful of preset camera modes including
the same augmented reality mode found on
older models and you can still quickly
launch that camera with a long press of
the two-step camera key you can also
take that camera underwater since the
Xperia z5 is ip68 certified for 1.5
meter water-resistance pricing has yet
to be determined at the z5 is set for a
global release this October we're
working hard to bring you as much ether
coverage as possible so stay tuned to
pocket now on youtube and apakah now
calm so you don't miss it this has been
high out to Houston reporting from
Berlin thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
