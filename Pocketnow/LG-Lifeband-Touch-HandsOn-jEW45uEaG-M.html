PocketNow and we're here at CES at the
LG booth taking a look at the new LG
life band touch so basically this is the
LG's take on the new wearable the
fitness tracker that has been kind of
the the hot thing for the next year or
so this is very similar to everything
we've seen it's got a OLED display on it
here and it's actually touched it
as the name suggests but you can swipe
through menus here this button is kind
of like your selector for different
menus and you can swipe through the
menus to get to different things
I accidentally touch that instead of
swipe so we're starting a timer for our
workout here and to get through that we
can actually top tap it and hit stop to
stop or we can resume it by tapping
again and you can swipe left here or to
the right here to get to your different
menus
we're different things so your heart
rate which it actually reads your heart
rate through and earbud that it connects
their Bluetooth this is your distance
traveled and you can tap through these
different things to get to goals if we
can swipe through here
seems to be a little sensitive but if we
swipe through you can tap to get
different goals on different types of
workouts and things are doing like steps
that tracks your steps and your calories
burn the distance and it also actually
keeps the time if you switch over to
this time view here it gives you the
time and you can also swipe through to
get your battery status and the date so
if you swipe over here from the clock
you get to the battery status this gives
you kind of just a visual representation
of the battery
we were told it gets either/or anywhere
between two to five days on battery life
so you can expect to charge it every so
often and actually if we come right over
here you can see the charging dot for
this live band touch so with this we
could actually get notifications on this
as well you get call notifications you
can't actually answer a call if it comes
in you have to end to pull your phone
out of your pocket or grab your phone to
answer the call but you can't dismiss
with a very simple gesture simply cover
it up to silence to call so that's very
you also have music controls on the live
in touch basic function of play Paul's
volume and you can also use third-party
apps so if you don't want to use LG's
stock app for the life and touch you can
use other fitness apps like RunKeeper
MyFitnessPal or polar and different
types of applications there are party
applications which you can do with other
wearables with fitness trackers so it's
very basic in functionality it has a
companion app which is available on
Android and iOS and it seems to be
basically along the lines of what we've
been seeing with the competition here
this is the Fitbit flex so it doesn't
have a display the force the new Fitbit
does but this one just gives you your
updates on your goals but with a
DoubleTap with the little LED
notifications so this is the LG live man
touch you can very simple there's no
price given right now the expected
launch date is string
and this is the LG life band touch nine
Tanglewood pocket now Anton behind the
camera and Michael's off editing video
somewhere in the press room or somewhere
else so stay tuned for more CES coverage
from pocket now LT I'm Taylor Martin and
I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
