colors leaked photo show us a probable
LG Nexus 5 and if you thought the
Samsung Galaxy gear was a phone well not
necessarily I'm hey Mary mehta and i
wonder if Samsung's next refrigerator
will also carry the galaxy name this is
pocket now daily today everything is
going to be about rumors everyone the
start Windows Phone as we remember the
Nokia Lumia 820 five reports of their
probable phablet to come in the future
well apparently this will bring the 5.2
inch display that we talked about 1080p
display as well which would require gdr3
the windows phone update that we're
waiting for as well but aside from that
the interesting news here is number one
a polycarbonate chassis and aside from
that a 20 megapixel camera so let's see
if there's some PureView technology here
stay tuned for that and speaking of
Windows fell let's talk about HTC as the
company is apparently working according
to credible sources on a Windows Phone
burying up the HTC One as it turns out
the reason why it's not launched yet is
because they're waiting for ddr3 in
order to bring the same specifications
that we currently know on the Android
bearing the same 1080p display the same
processor etc just fetched to wonder
when we're getting this phone or the
software update as well but on the
negative side apparently the company is
getting divorce with Beats Audio or the
other way around actually apparently
beats doesn't find it to be a good
business or according to analysts that's
probably gonna be the case so stay tuned
these are just rumors by the way now
let's talk about LG and Google's Nexus
program apparently we have the first
leaked photograph of the future LG Nexus
whatever apparently it's going to be the
5 and we've got some good news here
everywhere first of all you don't get
the back buttons of the g2 and second of
all you get a replaceable back so
apparently we are getting a replaceable
battery thing we hated about the nexus 4
so links in the description for full
details on this phone let's see how it
goes now on the sad side of the rumors
we've got some more credible reports on
the Samsung Galaxy gear you know that
SmartWatch that we're waiting for and
apparently well this is not going to be
a phone apparently it'll be another
parasite to your smartphone as Google
glasses which we know brings a lot of
technical limitations like the fact that
you need a tethering plan to actually be
able to use that thing so let's see how
Samsung
this whole SmartWatch concept off though
I don't believe it'll be anything
different to the current SmartWatch we
already know from Sony and finally for
the hot and not so hunting's of the day
we've got Apple in a combo of three here
first of all the iphone 5s will
apparently bring more colors than we
know that golden iPhone that we saw is
apparently just the tip of the iceberg
on the other hand iOS 7 will apparently
be delayed for the ipad models just as
it was on the beta looks to the
description for details on that and as
it turns out we get more fingerprint
scanning rumors but anyways that leads
me to the question of the day would you
like color in your iPhone or any phone
that you have is it something you
actually look for in my particular case
honestly I stick to white or black
because cases just make everything
better but leave us a comment down below
how do you prefer your phone of course
as always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and he'll prob mushy follow
us on packing out comment subscribe my
youtube channel as well you'd also
follow me on twitter and hind underscore
iveta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi meri
beta thank you very much for watching
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
