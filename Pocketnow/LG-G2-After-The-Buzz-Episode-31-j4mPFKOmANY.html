new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take a look at a device several
months after its release when it's not
shiny and new anymore I'm Taylor Martin
with Pocket mal this is the lg g2 and
this is episode 31 of after the bus this
particular episode of after the buzz
posed an unprecedented challenge our
role Michael Fisher reviewed the g2 back
in September and gave it a 7 point 7 out
of 10 the community however disagreed
with the lower than usual score and
posed some convincing counter arguments
for a higher one michael reevaluated his
stance decided the community had a point
and he changed that score to an eight
point four shortly thereafter jaime also
spent a couple weeks with the g2 and
fell in love with the camera performance
battery life and even the hardware and
my first experience with the g2 was
sorely tainted by a defective unit that
quite literally had a mind of its own
now I've been tasked with revisiting
this controversial phone several months
later in assessing the situation after
LG has had time to collect itself here
goes obviously the hardware hasn't
physically changed so that's the perfect
place to start at the time of its launch
the g2 specifications were essentially
the best combination of internals money
can buy and honestly they still stand
tall today only surpassed by a handful
of premium smartphones it's fitted with
a Snapdragon 800 with a quad-core Krait
400 CPU clocked at 2.3 gigahertz that's
accompanied by 2 gigabytes of RAM and
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of fixed
storage the fixed battery is rated at
3000 milliamp hours and the 13 megapixel
image sensor comes with optical image
stabilization it also comes with the
basic connectivity options Wi-Fi AC
Bluetooth Low Energy
LTE NFC and USB on-the-go support
and the display it's still just as
gorgeous as it was six months ago
but your HD IPS plus LCD bares of 1080p
resolution and measures five point two
inches corner to corner that gives it an
overall density of 424 PPI it's crystal
clear and the colors pop accordingly
viewing angles are great contrast and
black levels are acceptable and it's
still among the very best smartphone
displays around more importantly than
that the 5.2 inch display is packed into
a comparatively small frame the bezels
alongside the display measure a tenth of
an inch and the top and bottom bezels
are brother slim - there's something to
be said for the level of engineering
that made this possible to this day the
g2 still has the highest displayed to
bezel ratio 75.7% of the front is screen
and it certainly makes a notable
difference on a device with such a large
display but that's only part of the
hardware story flip the phone around and
you'll see it one of LG's newest
defining features the rear-facing
standby switch and volume rocker after
multiple stints with this button
configuration it hasn't gotten any less
awkward to use unfortunately the
knock-on feature hasn't gotten any more
reliable either only working about 75%
of the time meaning you'll find yourself
angrily tapping a blank display or
picking the phone up and filling around
for the standby key just to check
notifications or use the phone the
concept is neat sure and we get why it's
useful in at least one use case voice
calls but it hasn't provided any sort of
unique advantage to justify their
placement or to offset the aggravation
and we're still not sold on the slick
plastic build this would otherwise be an
ultra premium handset but thanks to the
Samsung S plastic housing the phone
feels less luxurious than it should
after just minutes of use the phone
begins to feel slimy and slippery due to
the oils on your hand
it's a shame since the front of the
device is such a pleasure to look at but
if you didn't have a problem with silica
last Explorer you won't now either in
short LG did a great job of future
proofing its smartphone and in many ways
the hardware still surprisingly competes
with even today's flagships the software
situation it was easily the worst part
of the g2 out of the gate
LG fumbled hard LG shares some of the
same principles as Samsung in the
software front pack in every possible
feature
the customization features stretched far
and wide from the quick settings layout
in the notification shade to the system
fonts and even the navigation bar layout
much of Michael's initial thoughts on
the software hold true today it's almost
overwhelming and many of the concepts
don't hold water
qslide apps aren't really all that
useful nor is the slide a side feature
but LG clearly listened to the initial
complaints of reviewers and users that
layout issues of your were snuffed out
as was the lag our t-mobile test unit is
currently running Android 4.4.2
jellybean just one minor point update
behind the most recent version of
Android 4.4.3
and since those issues have been
resolved the software vault it's still
cluttered and overdeveloped isn't
horrible to use in fact we like some of
the touches like the customizable navbar
and the ability to tone down some of the
animations the Settings app however is
still a disaster
sometimes phones begin to slow down over
time we can't say for sure how the g2
performs through extended months of use
but we can't confirm the phone as a
performing considerably better than
before that's likely due to the
jellybean update optimizing and making
full use of the monster SOC that is the
Snapdragon 800 almost every element of
the software experiences buttery smooth
now we have however encountered some
issues when activating the slide a side
feature or when over encumbering the
system with a handful of tasks but it
manages to cut through the muck and pick
back up rather quickly gaming is a
particularly outstanding aspect of the
g2 the beautiful display paired with a
Snapdragon 800 is an amazing combination
however the phone does tend to warm up
disturbingly fast sometimes while doing
more basic things like heavy tweeting or
just browsing news feeds and that brings
us to battery life the 3000 milliamp
hour battery has been for the most part
great except those times when heat
becomes an issue you can jump it to a
game like Need for Speed Most Wanted at
70 or so percent and 10 to 15 minutes
later you might be at 63% through normal
uses the battery is fine lasting upwards
of a full day but if you push the phone
too hard you'll pay for it in stamina
call quality and network speeds have
still been mediocre on t-mobile's LTE
network in the Charlotte metro area
we've been hitting speeds as low as 1.7
megabits per second down consistently in
places we're used to seeing double-digit
megabit speeds and that yon where the
call quality hasn't improved since the
last time we checked it out the optics
on the other hand is still one of the
standout features of the g2 the 13
megapixel optically stabilized camera is
still one of the best Android shooters
you can currently get your hands on the
colors are rich the low-light
performance is still not quite as good
as Nokia's Lumia handsets but better
than practically all its Android
counterparts and the camera application
comes packed to the brim with countless
features it isn't perfect but if camera
quality is of importance to you and you
like Android this will likely be among
your top choices so how has the g2 held
up over all innocence its aged like a
fine wine it's gotten slightly better
over time
which is rare these days its
specifications and hardware are
interestingly on par with even HTC s and
Samsung's 2014 flagships even today the
g2 is a viable contender but it does
have its quirks like the rear mounted
buttons and overheating issues chances
are if you've recently picked one up or
are planning to in the near future
you'll be pleased with the device so
long as you're forgiving of busy
