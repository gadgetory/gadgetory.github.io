pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna take a look back at a very
important smartphone called the Palm
Treo 700w that some of you may remember
this device came out in late 2005 early
2006 on the verizon wireless network and
it was a really big deal because it was
the first time that palm put Windows
Mobile on one of their devices this is a
palm device running Windows Mobile
it was totally unheard of until this
device came around prior to the 700w
there were the trio line of palm devices
which ran the old palm operating system
that a lot of people actually liked and
used a lot the trail of devices came way
before the iPhone and way before Android
and way before the fancy form factors we
get in Windows Mobile and it was the
true smartphone of the early 2000s that
had a really great form factor so let's
talk more about the 700w this device was
selling for about $600 without a
contract back in late 2005 early 2006
for with a two-year contract you can get
it for about $400 which by today's
standards is very expensive for a even
high very high-end smartphone in terms
of other specs the device has a CPU
clock of 312 megahertz it's run running
the old intel xscale processor not too
fast of a device it also is a huge
deficiency of RAM that only is 32
megabytes newer devices have you know
256 to 512 megabytes of RAM it also only
has 128 megabytes of ROM so you're not
going to be able to store that many
files on this device the screen is a
small 2.5 inches diagonal with 240 by
240 resolution the smallest or the
lowest resolution that Windows Mobile's
can support and in a minute you're gonna
say how grainy the screen is it also has
bluetooth 1.2 it's got a 1.3 megapixel
camera on the back with soft portrait
mirror you don't see those too often
these days it's got a very large 1800
milliamp hour battery one of the great
things about this device was the battery
life and it also has a video one of the
earlier devices to have this 3G
built-in so let's take a look at the
hardware what made this device so famous
well it's really comes down to the
keyboard and the hardware keys here
which were known very well in the trio
world so we have a very nice spacious
keyboard with a nice ergonomic curve we
have a lot of hardware buttons that
makes the device very one-handed usable
so you didn't have to really lift lift
up your thumb to press on the screen you
had the start menu button and the OK
button and the d-pad and soft keys here
all within reach of your thumb which
made it very easy to to use the device
going over to the side we have volume up
and down rocker and this button which
probably is a record button down here we
have extremely unstandardized X it's
great that most OEM s have standardized
by now looks like we have a 2.5
millimeter headphone jack here instead
of 3.5 which isn't very standard going
over the other side we have nothing on
the top we have support for a standard
SD and here they don't see that it's all
microSD now and of course that palm
feature that they still employ on their
devices of today the silent quick switch
up here here we've infrared to transfer
data elbows mention this does have
bluetooth we have a very predominant
antenna here all antennas of today are
fortunately internal we have a speaker
1.3 megapixel camera and then the large
battery back there the stylus is
actually quite nice it is a non
collapsible metal stylus very high
quality
fortunately with the hardware buttons
you really didn't have to take out the
stylus too much and this device was
considered to be a nice looking sleek
device but sort of as a comparison let's
take a look at this next to one of
pomace more recent devices the palm pixi
so they've come a really long way and
what you can really tell the difference
is in is depth it's really remarkable I
think you could probably stack three
Pixies or maybe two and a half and reach
the depth of the 700 w 700 W is a very
thick device palm has come a long way
they still
that sort of chiclet style keyboard
although they took away the curve here
for the for the pixie and on the back
there's not many similarities they've
totally changed the design internal
antenna very sleek very not sleek and
sort of crude so let's turn on this
thing and see what it's got it's running
Windows Mobile 5.0 this is the days when
they called this the Pocket PC Phone
operating system so we have a nice
backlight here all of the keys are
backlit and they're kind of backlit
unevenly I don't know if you can see
that in the video let's get closer in on
the screen we're gonna see this ugly
ugly Windows Mobile interface with no
enhancements and it's funny because you
can take a windows mobile device of
today and make it look like this if you
disable all the homescreen plugins so
let's get in here a little bit the
screen actually was very sensitive
because it was recessed and because the
two layers that needed to touch each
other were so close together very
sensitive screen we can go into programs
obviously no finger friendliness you
have to use the scroll bars all the time
or you could use the d-pad and the icons
look very grainy because it's a low
resolution screen we still have the same
game as we have today in Windows Mobile
we've ActiveSync calculator camera which
doesn't take too great of pictures and
we have this sort of default in Windows
mobile camera viewer and so I can take a
picture there probably isn't gonna come
out too well and we can exit that and
continue down the line all the stuff we
still see in Windows Mobile devices of
today File Explorer of course we can
browse your device going into the
windows directory take so longest but
that was actually pretty quick overall
it's pretty snappy so far it's just when
you multitask things get very slow we
have the verizon wireless sync program
we have word mobile which let's try this
keyboard and see how how how quick it is
so a very nice keyboard a lot of space
to work with and and it has a nice bit
of tactile feedback very responsive as
well so we just did a little bit of a
test of the keyboard and let's get out
of this
and see what else we have let's go into
the settings and accidentally hit that
is why you cannot use your finger in an
older version of Windows Mobile it's
really not made for finger friendliness
so let's get a little bit closer in on
the screen and take a look at the old
settings of Windows Mobile 5.0 so we can
customize the buttons and there were a
fair amount of buttons that you could
change on the 700w which was nice you
could launch programs without having to
dive into the interface we've keyguard
owner information phone this came with
microsoft voice command which was
actually unheard of for a device of the
late 2005 era 2006 which allows you to
control the device with your voice
today's screen we can really have all
the standard windows mobile stuff there
we go into system we get to see a little
bit more about what we're dealing with
backlight we do not have a a light
sensor here and obviously not a
proximity sensor so here you can
manually adjust the brightness at full
brightness the screen actually looks
pretty good
but of course your battery life is gonna
suffer hugely see what else we have in
here error reporting standard stuff
let's take a look at memory we are down
to 11 megabytes of RAM if I open up
another program it's probably not going
to perform very well forget about
running something on the internet and by
the way we've got the old old version of
Pocket Internet Explorer here which did
a horrible job at a trend during
websites I mean you would get extremely
long scroll bars and really nothing
would render very properly so and then
they have made improvements hugely in an
Internet Explorer mobile and going down
the list we have some other stuff
aligned the screen of course enable
cleartype which really helps to to make
things look better and we can align the
screen a lot of newer devices really
don't require this but maybe once every
year or so if that but some of these
older windows mobile devices really
requires you to align the screen in fact
when I use this for the first time it
had been about a year and the screen was
totally out of alignment and finally you
can go into connections we see the
standard stuff that we're used to this
device did not have Wi-Fi it looks like
it didn't even have a connections
manager as we find an ever
windows mobile device disorder manage
all of your connections and here we have
beamed so to get someone else with a
similar device you could put them
together and send a file over it's
pretty cool back in the day so that was
a quick look at the Verizon trio 700 W a
device that was really really big
especially for the smartphone
communities the first time palm took
their legendary hardware and they were
kings in the early 2000s for smartphones
and used the power of Windows Mobile we
were very happy in the Windows Mobile
community I was just reading the review
from Chris spera back in 2005 about this
device he was extremely excited about it
we look back at it now it's not so
exciting but it definitely was at that
point in time so that was a look back at
the Verizon trio 700 W that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
