v10 was a beast of a camera phone and
now several manufacturers are playing
with dual sensor setups we've dug deep
into our usual run of test setups and
it's time to take a closer look at the
LG v 20 buckle up folks we have a lot of
ground to cover and I'm gonna move
pretty quick first for you specs junkies
you can pause the video here to see what
hardware we're working with now with
that out of the way right off the bat
we're a bit disappointed in LG's auto
image processing the phone tends to veer
a bit overexposed and unlike previous
LG's the saturation seems to be bumped
up a bit higher than we might like
Southern California has beautiful blue
skies and warm afternoon light but this
blue is certainly exaggerated the phone
redeems itself on greens and earth tones
very accurately captured here and
yellows are stretched just to the
clipping point but we don't quite lose
fine details in this flower
unfortunately where the v10 was
fantastic at capturing reds the extra
saturation and exposure here pushes the
b20 slightly away from the accuracy we
used to enjoy we can still see the
difference between these blossoms better
than on many other phones but the v20 is
starting to sizzle these warmer colors
lastly the phone does an excellent job
metering for this white flower and it's
easy to see the details and the pedals
which are just slightly off white
getting around the extra saturation the
phone does a very good job handling
white balance these photos look
appropriately warm given the afternoon
angle of the Sun a thankfully in shade
the V 20 doesn't seem to overcorrect
often or push the shot to cold
output is still consistent with the
surrounding afternoon light looking at
the photo files JPEGs range from three
to eleven megabytes in size with most
landing around four RAW files are just
under 23 Meg capturing RAW files as
helpful as LG's JPEG compression can
make your images kind of splotchy
editing on your own will preserve fine
details much better also raw gives you a
safety net for those times you might
over or under expose walking back an
image even two whole stops we can still
recover quite a bit of info we've
covered the app layout in a separate
video and this is still one of our
favorite phone camera layouts
it's a shame that some features like the
simple capture mode are buried in
settings but with a focus on manual
controls and options the v20 camera app
is easily one of the best for people of
all skill levels our biggest complaint
has to do with the second screen ticker
display in the camera app this hold
shortcuts to your three main mode but if
while you're shooting you get
notifications you can't switch modes
until this screen clears them we don't
remember the v10 hijacking camera
options like this now looking at the
zoom LG is continuing the dual sensor
experiment from the g5 instead of
Apple's second sensor zoom we get an
ultra wide view it's well integrated
into the zoom range but there is a bit
more of a pop when you transfer from the
normal view to the wide this wide-angle
shooter is fun to play with but there is
quite a bit of barrel distortion you'll
want to keep your horizon near the
middle of the frame and watch how it
pulls into a smile as we move the ground
lower the smaller sensor and aperture on
this wide-angle shooter means night
shots will be darker and gray near as
for the practicality of this hardware I
likely wouldn't use this for any
professional output but for my own
family photos and videos wide-angle
shots have proven more useful chasing
our daughter around than zooming in your
mileage will of course vary speaking of
zooming in the v20 only has a software
crop zoom at full reach we get an overly
sharpened mess but somewhere around half
the zoom range the camera still has
enough resolution to play with from the
sensor to deliver some pretty clean
looking results on paper the v20 sensor
is slightly smaller than the v10 but the
change in aspect ratio seems to have
made up some of the surface area
discrepancy when looking at macro shots
both have nearly the same minimum
focusing distance almost tying the
galaxy s7 for getting up close and the
background blur is nearly identical you
can achieve some really pretty bouquet
from the main camera and you'll only see
the Samsung pull ahead when you zoom in
really close
even when pixel peeping it's tough to
see practical differences now no one is
catching up to Samsung this year for
focusing speed but the v20 remains
sure-footed and accurate we rarely face
problems with miss focusing and the app
was responsive trying to shift focus
quickly between these two objects the
only issue seems to be the extra focused
pull we see when moving focus farther
the phone will overshoot
and roll back in which makes this a
little less useful for folks who might
want to Rack focus between two subjects
the Achilles heel for LG's has always
been the lens quality and the v20 only
subtly improves on that issue this glass
is still quite prone to fringing flaring
ghosting and small distortions this is
most noticeable when cropping and it's
markedly better than the g5 but we'd
still like to see a little more
improvement moving forward but we are
happy to see noticeable improvements in
HDR output even though the phone is
still prone to over exposing the
multiple exposure processing does a much
better job of preventing clipped
highlights and will more consistently
balance shadow detail against brighter
areas of the frame LG hasn't quite
caught Apple or Google here but this is
much more useful output okay so you can
shoot panoramas from the ultra wide
camera but you probably shouldn't it's
just too wide to stitch together
properly a panorama is from the main
camera our solid if a bit mid-pack no
really egregious stitching errors but
some transitions are still a little bit
more abrupt than several flagship
competitors now spending a little time
with the selfie shooter and I still hate
selfies LG only has one front-facing
camera on this V which seems to be
another ultra wide which can be cropped
in for a more normal field of view
expect most shots to be a bit
overexposed and video is somewhat poor
oddly we're seeing dropped frames and
quite a bit of rolling shutter jello at
least we have this great auto mode I
mean beauty mode to turn you into a
horrific plastic mess of a mannequin
looking at nighttime performance this
camera is a solid low light option the
optical image stabilization works really
well for Stills and I was able to
consistently pull off handheld shots at
night down to 1/5 of a second when
trying to hold steady left up to the app
though again there's a consistent
tendency to overexpose which means
jacking up the iso noise much higher
than we need to dialing back a half to a
full stop depending on lighting can help
a lot in preserving image integrity the
v20 almost nails are creepy gate output
is just a little cooler than the scene
looks like in real life and shooting
auto I wasn't able to get a clean shot
of this flower in almost no light but
man you
setting the shutter and ISO we end up
with a much sharper image which can then
be brightened a little for an overall
better effect and I always have to show
off that manual controls allow for some
fun effects like long exposures of
streaking taillights you can't do this
with an iPhone or a pixel out of the box
moving over to video the v20 captures a
shockingly high bitrate at maximum
settings which eats around four hundred
and sixteen megabytes of storage per
minute and the color processing doesn't
seem to be quite as aggressive as when
compared to shooting still photos from
the main camera we see few compression
artifacts molesting the uniform blue of
the sky but switch to the wide camera in
the afternoon and the noise is somewhat
distracting overall we're treated to
some terrific video but this camera
really wants you to control the scene by
adjusting the manual settings it's
actually pretty easy to work this
footage into projects somewhere around
70% of my iPhone coverage was shot from
a V 20 as was our entire axon 7 mini
unboxing the big benefit is shutter
speed control where you can properly
lock exposure like you can for Stills
like on this water scene cranking the
shutter up to one four thousandth of a
second we get this razor-sharp water
spray in every frame of footage slowing
that shutter down to one 80th of a
second and using my cheap sunglasses as
a filter we see how much blurrier each
frame is being able to control not only
white balance but really dialing in
specific exposure settings makes this an
excellent companion camera to a proper
mirrorless production setup but the
story on stabilization will likely
disappoint some who were curious about
this phone the V 20 is better than the
v10 and LG has reigned in some of the
jello wobble of last year's phone using
only optical image stabilization while
walking there's still plenty of a but
it's not as seasick inducing switching
down to HD recording means we can use
software stabilization to help but the
final output is still a fair bit twitchy
er than what Google or Apple is
currently supplying
also it was fairly uncommon and
impossible to predict but for a couple
shots while trying to hold still the
hardware stabilization started acting up
and getting a little funky
out of over 20 gigabytes worth of files
this affected three very short clips and
what would good video be without good
audio the v20 continues LG's
improvements utilizing a three
microphone array which can be tuned
directionally and adds a low-cut filter
to help reduce Rumble and a limiter
which can be used as a safety net
against sudden loud spikes in your
recordings also new for the camera app
when shooting the audio mode not only
delivers meters you get a proper
waveform of the audio being captured
this is incredibly handy for monitoring
your results
now an exposure test moving from dark to
bright and back the v20 handles changes
in light fairly well making even-handed
adjustments and subtle white balance
shifts none of which are jarring its
returning to dark that we see some
shutter speed adjustments that give off
a buzzy quality but overall this is
better than most flagship phones and is
a nice improvement over the LG v10
unfortunately slow motion is still kind
of a mess 120 frames per second 720p
really shouldn't be this taxing but we
still see dropped frames in the final
edited output from this phone is pretty
blurry with abrupt transitions moving
from real time to slow-mo LG still has a
lot of work to do here lastly there are
some fun features using the multi camera
setup the pop-out feature will use the
wide-angle camera as a backdrop for the
main camera creating an interesting
shadowbox effect you can also create
easy collages directly from the app
using all three cameras but these are
only saved at the resolution of the
phone screen it's fun working directly
from the cameras in the moment but
standalone apps to create a collage
might deliver higher quality results so
let's wrap this up where's that leave us
with the cameras on the LGB 20 it's
overly simplistic to say this phone is
only for people who like adjusting
manual settings for the most part images
delivered under full auto are very good
if falling shy of the excellent auto
photos we get from a Galaxy s7 or the
extremely consistent image processing we
find on iPhones slow motion video
landing is the only truly unusable
aspect of the V 20 what this phone has
that few others can match is as broad a
scope embracing photographers of all
skill levels no one else really seems
interested in offering a simple mode
anymore even if LG buried it this year
it's still in the app many phones will
hold your hand through Auto modes but
few will grow with you as well moving
through intermediate and advanced
photography concepts it is true that
this camera comes to life once you start
adjusting a few settings on your own
instead of leaving every aspect up to a
computer but that's pretty much true of
all cameras we might grin at that friend
who brags about their nice camera but
only shoots in green box mode the b20
might ask for your input but it reward
you for participating in the process of
making your own photos and videos while
I have a lot of fun with this camera
personally I've never used a phone
camera or microphones which could as
seamlessly blend into my actual work I
don't claim to be any great
cinematographer but seeing not a single
comment that there was anything
different or distracting about this
footage compared to how I normally shoot
well that was very encouraging the v20
easily fulfilling a role I could never
count on a samsung pixel or iPhone to
achieve as always thanks so much for
