the settee Sonia and now we have the
sexy orbit a new windows phone which is
running Windows Phone Sango let's get
quickly over the specifications it's got
a 4-inch wvga screen strategy around
five megapixel main camera at the back
with the LED flash
it's processor gigabytes of internal
storage yes you can see that's not much
because you have a huge library of music
you want to take that to do you have a
lots of pictures but this will be a
budget film and there's 512 megabytes
ram we have been able to go even further

of RAM put the more the better let's
just see exactly what the settings talk
about in terms of the windows phone
version about it's got the Qualcomm
mimosa processor and as you can see it's
windows phone 7.5 but it is built 8755

we have a speaker will there is no
front-facing camera so I'm sorry I fans
I won't be able to video chat there are
the three capacitive buttons back start
and search are compulsory for every
windows phone and then we will have the
dedicated camera shutter release button
volume rockers for volume up and volume
down 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
microphone for noise cancelling power
button a micro USB for syncing and
charging and nothing on the bottom
except a secondary part actually
this is the main microphone in the bag
aside from the camera you have your
speaker grill it looks a little a little
bit sheepish but again ZTE is aiming to
sell volumes they are trying to get into
a market it will be the main competitor
for Nokia's low-end phones as as well as
other HTC devices which will come
lower and specifications this presented
