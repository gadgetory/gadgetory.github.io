the Samsung gear s2 there is a newer
larger and badder kid in town I'm Jaime
to be better with pocket now reporting
for me for 2016 here with a quick look
at the Samsung gear s three and here s
three frontiers all of pocket now Ziva
2016 coverage is brought to you by
ex-con global the adoption of the
Samsung gear s2 was very interesting
with half the market being completely
new to the platform for that reason
samsung has decided to leave the gear s2
as an option for those of you looking
for a smaller watch and launching two
new ones the Samsung gear s 3 is all
about design Samsung worked in
conjunction with luxury Swiss
watchmakers to build a gorgeous new 46
millimeter watch lineup with names
mentioned like designer Ivan ARPA for
the devices body and Eric Levi's in
charge of the watch bands now both
devices were designed to blend as
regular watches built with 316l
stainless steel and both use standard 22
millimeter watch bands to help you use
whichever ones you want certain
variations of the watch include an index
over the bezel and beneath it it's it's
the 1.3 inch Super AMOLED display that
is just gorgeous to make matters better
the always-on display has been enhanced
from only supporting 8 colors to any of
16 million color options the rotating
bezel makes a comeback with a new
texture on the Border's think of it a
more traditional watch look and feel
there is ip68 water and dust resistance
along with military great durability
though the specifications haven't really
been mentioned specs include an Exynos
72 70 processor 768 megabytes of RAM and
4 gigabytes of storage there's a 380
milliamp hour battery that targets
between three and four days of endurance
according to what they claim obviously
we will have to review it but there are
some very interesting power saving modes
to support phone calls SMS messages up
to 5% of battery and then you only get
the time after that
new features mentioned our speakers
across the lineup sensors like an
altimeter barometer a standalone GPS
also make the cut and also being
mentioned is a new sheet of Corning
Gorilla Glass SR Plus which really means
a sheet of Gorilla Glass with additional
coatings for scratch resistance now the
software improvements are minor it runs
a new version of Tizen 2 point three
point one that's more enhanced to take
advantage of the rotating bezel UI
though that's not really noticeable the
9000 applications that already work with
the gear s2 will work with the new gear
s3 pretty much the improvements are the
fact that you can now answer calls
reject them snooze and dismiss calendar
appointments all with the rotating bezel
with no need to use the touchscreen the
gear s3 includes MSD technology allowing
you to use it for Samsung pay and it
includes Knox protection in addition to
a very simple user interface or payments
Spotify partnerships also allow music
streaming to the watch through LTE or
Wi-Fi depending on whichever model you
choose other partnerships mentioned
include BMW which allows you to control
your vehicle from your watch as well the
Samsung gear s 3 will be available in q4
2016 though price points really weren't
mentioned at the event and again if
you're considering that the gear s3 is
probably a little too large or too
expensive for you the gear s2 will
remain as part of the lineup instead of
paying horrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another sim why not try a smarter
solution
