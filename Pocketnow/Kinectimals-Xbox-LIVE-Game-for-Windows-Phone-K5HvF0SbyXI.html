we're gonna take a look at this week's
new Xbox Live game for Windows Phone
let's check it out now you've probably
heard of kinectimals before it's
available on the Xbox with Kinect and
probably have noticed that it's more of
a kids game and he just vibrated when he
tried to jump into the screen there but
it's got some entertaining features that
you might like as well see it's mostly
for kids all right here's the first
screen you can choose your cub you can
transfer connect them all from the Xbox
360 or two in Xbox 360 there's your
choices it's going to load a QR code
that you can scan and transfer either
through Kinect or the camera on this
phone let's go back jeeve mints leader
board all the good Xbox Live stuff so
choose a cub we have some choices and
you can name them I named this one Benji
and you can also unlock new cats as you
move along within the game and of course
you can transfer them from the Xbox or
whatever this button won't let me change
the name of one of the pets there let's
go back and normally you just go right
into the play button on this load your
connectome old pet have a nice blurred
out background there
and there is and he's ready to play you
can't touch him Oh where'd he go okay
you want some food or drink so let's
give him some of that there's the
inventory what do I have here let's give
him some water
and he's gonna drink that so sometimes
he gets dirty from playing in the dirt
and you have to wash them or you can
just pet him and he likes
I just behind his ear there and he I'm
prayer we can also choose other things
to do let's see there's a ball we get
four balls and you can catch them let's
show you that and every time you do this
you get more points and you get money to
buy him other stuff like food or a
collar you know pendants things like
that let's try them the coconut it's
pretty easy the trophy button has been I
give you challenges so this is like the
real game kind of stuff and let's see
these are all ball related challenges
and here we go get ready three two and
there's a time limit you got to see how
many catches you can get all right so
let's get back
there's more challenges so you have
tutorials on how to teach him tricks and
then you have challenges for the tricks
so let's go into trick mode and let's
just show you a couple of these tricks
let's see this one back they roll
over roll over there we go doesn't do
voice commands but I'm just talking
anyway there's sit and I think this one
is a play dead so there's some amusing
stuff here's an app people choose
different locations from go back to
there and you'll unlock different
locations as you progress in the game
with more points now is dirty you can
wash them off with a sponge let's just
take a picture with them so this is a
pretty fun little feature and take a
photo found out right there
now we're gonna be able to superimpose
him on top of that picture and so you
can pretend that he's laying on top of
the table there we can change his pose
may be sleeping he is actually really
really dirty there and then you press
the camera button and I'll take picture
so that's pretty fun you can take
pictures of your friends and put the cat
on their head lots of fun to be had with
that feature anyway that's a quick look
at connectable for Windows Phone 7 I've
got some really great graphics and it's
kind of amusing but it's going to cost
$2.99 in the Windows Phone Marketplace
and it will be available on Wednesday
November 2nd
it was the thumbs up if you liked this
Kinectimals game and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
