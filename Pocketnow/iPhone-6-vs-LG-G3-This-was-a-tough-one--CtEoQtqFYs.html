favorite smartphones last year was the
lg g2 mainly because of all the features
and its design but what happens when you
give me an LG g3 for a week and make me
compare it to the iPhone 6 I'm Jaime
Rivera this is PocketNow and this is
iPhone 6 vs LG g3
both the iPhone 6 on the LG g3 have
proven to be some of our favorite
devices this year
what is the cream of the crop when it
comes to the design and comfort and the
other is one of the best powerhouses you
can buy about the only thing that's
similar when it comes to the hardware is
that both displays are made by LG and
boy are these a sight to see the LG g3
manages to fit a gorgeous 5.5 inch quad
HD display into some of the thinnest
bezels in the market while the iPhone 6
keeps it more conservative with a 4.7
inch display colors on both displays are
amazing the iPhone 6 being a tad
brighter and easier to use in direct
sunlight though and even with the crazy
200 pixel per inch difference between
these displays stop looking for pixels
on either because you won't find them
that said both display suffer from
growing pains as applications that
aren't optimized for either display
resolution can look fuzzy on its
respective platforms where things are
most different is in their designs Apple
took a more elegant route with anodized
aluminum a thin profile and gentle
curves while LG is a more substantial
phone with faux metal finish and a
plastic chassis the g3 is eight
millimeters taller seven point six
millimeters wider two millimeters
thicker and twenty grams heavier than
the iPhone six though it's not like of
LG cares about not being thin and light
the g3 was designed to be the best
flagship you can buy and its lack of
compromise with things like a
replaceable 3000 milliamp hour battery
and 32 gigs of storage with micro X the
expansion make the iPhone 6 look bad
when it comes to specs at least the ones
that actually matter the iPhone 6 is no
slouch when it comes to the spec sheet
for the average user but the g3 was made
with more of a demanding user in mind
where the iPhone 6 excels is that its
feel in hand but this is not a beauty
contest and both devices have a
futuristic design here the differences
continue in the software though not at a
very huge degree last year's LG
proprietary Android skin was the worst
thing that I had ever seen but this year
everything has changed for the better
what's funny though is that the deeper
that you look within the more you notice
that the UI resembles iOS 8 with its
coloured
ours at the top and the level of
minimalism in the icons this is actually
a good thing since it makes the
experience of using an elegant
smartphone design only better on both
devices iOS 8 is definitely the dullest
UI for those searching for customization
and in that degree
LG's UI is probably the most
customizable experience I know from
additional buttons at the bottom for
notification tray and multi window
supports to an insane amount of options
in just about every LG application
bundled most of these options just feel
like gimmicks for some but for other
people these might be useful where I was
8 handles things better is in sheer
performance which is odd compared to
such a powerful g3 it's not as
customizable as LG's UI but what it can
do it can always do perfectly you'll
notice that the LG u I constantly
redraws widgets on the display something
which is rather annoying at times and
where i OS flows without stutter every
single time you can fix these things on
the g3 with third-party launchers though
and just keep in mind that options
aren't the best deal though again the LG
g3 UI is cool so you might want to put
up with it
speaking of performance handling these
two devices side by side as a true
pleasure if you ignore the spec sheet
and choose the most graphic intensive
game that you have there is no way they
can go wrong with either of these
devices the iPhone 6 is a 8 ship handles
everything you throw at it with ease and
the Snapdragon 801 does the same for the
LG g3 obviously the experience consuming
media is better on a bigger display but
that doesn't mean that the iPhones
display is small where I'm surprised to
not be impressed with the LG g3 is with
the camera I praise the g2 heavily last
year because of its photos but only the
g3 isn't as good you will notice some
extra pop and daylight photos when
compared to the iPhone 6 where colors
are a tad more accurate the laser focus
on the g3 makes taking photos just as
fast as with the focus pixels on the
iPhone 6 which is great
sadly when you compare these at night
you'll notice that the odd reddish tint
on the LG g3 using HDR is not normal
when compared to the iPhone and keep in
mind the g3 does have optical image
stabilization
call quality was good on both devices
though oddly people did complain about
some odd muffling on the g3 every now
and then and where no complaints were
given about the iPhone 6 the one watch
speaker on the g3 is significantly
better than last year's though the
iPhone 6 is still louder at the bottom
battery life is where the g3 beats the
pants off the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6 will
get you through the day just fine but if
you want more than a day the g3 is your
device to go this is probably one of the
toughest comparisons that I've had to
make on one hand the iPhone 6 is one of
the most elegant smartphone experiences
I've ever had and the LG g3 is clearly
one of the most powerful smartphones of
the year depending on your specific
needs you really can't go wrong with
either device I've decided to be smart
about this I'm forced to carry two
phones anyway so why choose say hello to
my two new daily drivers that's it for
comparison of the iPhone 6 vs LG g3 make
sure you leave us a comment down below
with your impressions and also follow us
on social media it's a strep trading
channel as well you can follow me on
Twitter high mound or squattery better
please give this video thumbs up if you
like what you saw I am hi Matt Rivera
thank you very much for watching we will
see you on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
