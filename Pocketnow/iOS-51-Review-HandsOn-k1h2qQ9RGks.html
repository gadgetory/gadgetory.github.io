Parker now common well after apples
March seventh event where they just
announced their new iPad without a
number while Apple has also announced
their launch of iOS 5.1 which is now
available for download and it's
available for the iPhone and obviously
the current generation iPad so let's
talk about it
you know it took so long for Apple to
bring iOS 5.1 out of beta that many of
us actually believed that they were
gonna ditch the whole project and go
away with iOS 6 or something that was
even better than 5.1 sadly the story is
different 5.1 was barely even announced
at the event but it brings a couple of
the changes that many of us were
expecting first of all and number one is
the fact that we can finally delete
photos from photo stream it's kind of a
no-brainer not really sure what took
them so long but it's finally there it's
a simple user interface all you have to
do is go into the photo application go
into your photo stream and then within
there just hit the button at the top and
simply select the pictures you want to
delete from your photo stream and once
you have them then just delete them the
cool feature here is that if you're
using your iPad it doesn't really matter
where you took the photos you simply can
do the same thing on your photo stream
on any iOS device that's synced to your
same iCloud account so that's a pretty
good deal aside from that what we
finally get Japanese on Siri not really
sure that's something compelling for the
rest of the market over here don't even
Google with Siri means in Japanese but
another really cool feature is that now
the lock screen camera button is
available permanently you no longer have
to double tap the home button to select
the camera all you have to do is simply
hit the camera button and swipe it to
the top and it will automatically launch
the photo application for you to take
your photo now don't expect that in the
iPad and first of all who takes pictures
on their iPad now the camera face
detection now highlights whenever it
detects more than one face whenever
you're taking a photo at least on the
iPhone 4s and then on the iPad -
probably one of a gimmick feature but
it's kind of cool is the fact that now
the camera button rotates whenever you
rotate your screen aside from that well
iTunes Match now gets genius mixes and
also genius playlist kind of a cool
feature there that was much expected and
audio TV shows and even movies now it
get enhanced audio on the iPad really
cool feature because currently it wasn't
doing that good podcast controls now
giving you playback speed and even the
30-second rewind that you're used to
seeing in movies and one thing we
weren't expecting but it's there is the
fact that well it seems that AT&amp;amp;T won
the battle with Apple and now as we got
an AT&amp;amp;T iPhone 4s you'll get a 4G
indicator instead of 3G even
will came on there keynote for the
iPhone 4s launched and said well it's
not really 4G which we agreed to and we
are getting some battery improvements
for the iPhone 4s apparently can't
really test that right now it's too soon
so far we haven't seen our battery drain
so much after the update but it's only
been a couple of hours so hopefully it
will improve we'll keep you posted on
the I review in the future to tell you
yes it's worth or note hasn't worked and
well
finally there are fixes to occasionally
drop volume whenever you're making an
outgoing call though we're not really
sure if that's actually some way to go
around drop calls that we always get on
AT&amp;amp;T but well I was 5.1 threes not
really those big updates not something
that everybody was expecting but again
can you really expect anything else from
Apple going through the fact that they
don't really want to get rid of their
iconic UI probably will have to wait for
WWDC in the future doesn't really matter
as Apple's gonna keep their same icons
but still the iPad or the new iPad
should we call it brings a lot of really
new ground with their Retina display so
it would be cool to see new features
instead of just the same icons that were
used to but again we'll just have to
wait for it that's it for a hands-on
review of iOS 5.1 for Apple's devices if
you have any questions or comments leave
us a comment down below and well don't
forget to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
