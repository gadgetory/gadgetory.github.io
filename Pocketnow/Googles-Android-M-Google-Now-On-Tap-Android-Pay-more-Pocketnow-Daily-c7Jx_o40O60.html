get a glimpse of Android M services like
Google Maps and cardboard add some cool
new features and believe it or not the
whole google photos update was cooler
than we expected I'm hi Mary vetta and
let's not beat around the bush this is
the google i/o edition of the pocket now
daily everything today is official and
our website is packed with details of
everything you want to read in case you
want to know more about what we're going
to talk about obviously i have to
condense everything in three minutes so
let's talk about google i/o starting
with google maps we get an update that
is going to be launched later this year
and the coolest thing is that even
though offline maps have existed for the
longest time this will now allow you to
have turn by turn navigation when you're
offline in addition to the fact that you
can still search for things and know
things are open or closed know places
and there will also be transit updates
to support new cities like mexico city
cities in india etc etc really cool
things coming to Google Maps but we
don't have a date another cool new
update is that Google cardboard is going
cross-platform and yeah I know it's not
just the cardboard thing it's really the
whole concept of being able to use a you
know a proprietary headset to give you
virtual reality features and the cool
thing is that yet it's now going to
support iphones as well so the there is
going to be an API that will allow
developers to port games in order to
support google cardboard and there are
also some updates as to how third-party
developers can create google cardboard
compatible headsets in order to give you
something affordable not have to pay so
much money to get vr headsets in the
future one of the major updates is
google now currently it's great at
predicting what you want to know but now
it's going to use more of the knowledge
graph from google and pretty much detect
what you're doing as well and use
contacts for it for example if you are
currently browsing the web site about
baseball what it'll do is if you long
press the home button it'll
automatically detect what's on the
display and give you more information
about what's on the display if you're
listening to a song that will give you
information on the artist or anything
that you ask it to give you and it'll
just expand its functionality to pretty
much everything that you're currently
doing not necessary
just predicting what you want to know
which is a great update to come we just
can't wait to test it but it's a Android
M feature I believe it or not I'm going
to use a full segment for Google photos
because it has a surprise it is
definitely cooler than we thought mainly
because number one it's cross-platform
now works on iOS as well number two well
you get fully unlimited storage for you
to back up everything you want but the
disclaimer that's for photos up to 16
megapixels or videos up to 1080p but
even though they will be compressed
you're still getting a limited storage
for you to keep your stuff which is
extremely cool for backups it's also
smarter you can now search for photos if
you took photos on a baseball game you
could just write baseball and it'll know
what photos were taken on baseball games
and it's got this really cool sharing
functionality where you no longer have
to upload stuff and then share it'll
back up things and then you can just
select these share them with somebody
these people can view them on a website
or actually transport these to their
Google photos application without the
need of downloading and uploading again
there are ton of cool features that are
coming it is currently available but if
you want to know more links in
description and finally the hottest news
up the day we're Android M it finally
got announced and the Developer Preview
is out today for Nexus devices it brings
a lot of cool features it looks like
lollipop in every way but it proves
everything that lollipop did bad like
volume controls RAM management battery
management for example there's this new
dose feature where if you leave your
phone for an extended period to find a
table it'll detect that and not give you
notifications or use the battery until
you pick it back up just cool addition
to that we've got granular app controls
for security just great it'll now ask
you whenever it can access your photos
or your messages etc but the coolest
features come again with the gulu Google
now on tap features in addition to the
fact that Android pay now becomes
official which is pretty much just a
revamp of Google Wallet but for me the
coolest feature was the fingerprint
scanning support there's an API now that
will support all the fingerprint
scanners in the market now and that
enables Android pay in addition to other
things but it does lead me to the
question of the day what was your
favorite Android M announcement today or
any
and from google for that matter in my
case I'll admit it's the fingerprint
scanning API mainly because that's the
reason why I like using iphone so much
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case friends you know the drill
