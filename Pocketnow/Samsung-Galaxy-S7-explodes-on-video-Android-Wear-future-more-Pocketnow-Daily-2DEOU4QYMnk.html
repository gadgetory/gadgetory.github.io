7 is not the only Samsung phone
exploding stanczyk show us that Spotify
has a huge subscriber margin when
compared to Apple music and it seems
that there won't be more Android wear
devices this year I'm Jaime Rivera and
I'm already wondering if the next
accessory we need is a power glove for
our phones this is pocket out daily
brought to you by autodesk graphic
official news today begin with Amazon as
the company has just announced its
Amazon echo or should I say the company
has already launched it to the market
$50 will get you this new speaker that's
obviously Amazon Alexa capable and just
about everything that a lot of people
are really liking I haven't given mine a
try yet but I probably will soon Edition
the Amazon echo the traditional large
one is now available in Europe you can
also pay a lot of money for that now
some interesting stats have just emerged
for those of you that remember Apple
touted 17 million subscribers for Apple
music which is great I mean it's a great
start if you think about it thing about
it is that sets the Spotify CEO just
came on record on Twitter just States 40
million subscribers 40 million active
subscribers on Spotify me included I do
prefer Spotify over Apple music hands
down over a lot of things as well the
spotlight over to Samsung this is rather
interesting as we've got a full TV
publication showing us CCTV that covers
a galaxy s7 exploding yeah a galaxy s7
the customer eventually showed it it's
kind of creepy it doesn't really look
fake but it's hard to even confirm
obviously there are two angles of the
video I highly suggest you watching them
like in the description and this is
interesting because even though yes my
Galaxy Note seven that heat up a bit
ever since a recent software update
that's reached my galaxy s7 edge and
galaxy s7 those phones have been heating
up a lot you never know if that could be
the case and speaking of Samsung and its
recent drama for those of you that are
looking to replace your Galaxy Notes
I've been with another Galaxy Note 7
seems that Samsung is already gearing up
as of tomorrow and Canada we don't have
a confirmation on this obviously we will
have to wait and the predominance of
carriers in Canada is kind of different
to the United States but apparently
Samsung is ready let's just see if they
deliver and finally the very hot news
that they have to do with Google and the
fact that we've got some trusted sources
claiming that there will be no more
Android wear devices for the rest of the
year apparently manufacturers like moto
huawei LG all these companies are pretty
much satisfied with what they have and
apparently we will have to wait until
probably early 2017 to see the new batch
of Android wear and this kind of makes
sense I mean timepieces don't
necessarily change much or there isn't
really much to add to Android wear
devices right now in addition to the
fact that they need a speaker in the
case like for example the Moto 360 but
it does lead me to the question of the
day
are you currently waiting for the next
batch of Android wear devices to buy one
or are you satisfied with the fact that
these companies are waiting yet another
couple of months in my case I feel it
makes sense and I do like the Android
wear offerings that have just emerged
from companies like polar for example or
Casio we'd love to know your opinion in
the comments down below though this
