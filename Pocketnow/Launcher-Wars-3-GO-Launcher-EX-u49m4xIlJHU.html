I've got our third installment of
launcher Wars this time it's go launcher
ii x let's go take a look okay to
introduce things a launcher for those of
you who don't know is the app that runs
on your system that launches all of the
other apps it also takes care of your
home screen your dock bar your app tray
just all kinds of stuff that it does and
we've shown you recently launcher pro
which is a very nice launcher we've
shown you ADW launcher ii x and just
recently we showed you a TW launcher to
which was an early beta of the the total
rewrite that they're coming out with
well here it is I've been using this for
a few days now as my my stock launcher
and it's been great there are quite a
few little caveats and an awful lot to
dig through so let's go ahead and show
you now just before we dig into that I
want to give a big THANK YOU out to our
viewers there were several of you who
recommended that we added this to our
launcher Wars series so thank you for
that participation I took a long time
coming because I wanted to wait for one
of the updates to come out and that just
came through this morning and I also had
to have some time to dig into it so
without further ado let's go ahead and
take a look first of all this is a
launcher just like any other launcher it
has home screens it has nice transitions
i'm using the windmill transition it's
got the little witch screen of my own
indicator dots up at the top and it's
got a continuous rotation so here i'm at
the end if i keep rotating I'm all the
way over on the other side so very nice
feature very fluid and I like it quite a
bit this is where it gets a little bit
interesting I've left this screen open
for us so let's go ahead and open up the
app drawer now you noticed a kind of a
pinwheel effect animating into the app
drawer that's one of the cool things it
does now you can set that to be pretty
much any animation that you want they've
got half a dozen
or so then it comes pretty loaded with I
just chose that one because it kind of
showed off what this could do you'll
notice that this is tabbed and it's
paginate it let's go two tabs first so
right now I'm looking at all of my apps
if i tap that i can go to my recent apps
and you can see which apps I've run most
recently and then you can see which apps
i have running and in this case you can
even see what my free and total memory
are so it's really nice and really kind
of well thought out to give you more
information than just ok here's your
apps blah but since we're back here
let's go ahead and talk about this one
of the things that I don't like about
the stock amp android launcher is when
you've got a lot of apps in here this
list becomes very long and when you
scroll down through it it's a big long
list of icons that's not all that
friendly and you can get lost really
easily for example if I scroll this did
I already see this row once it's up here
or did it get off the screen it's hard
for me to take in everything that's on
one screen because it's just all over
the place so that's why I kind of like
this this is a paginate 'add view so if
i go ahead and scroll over you can see
now I'm on page to page three and the
little dots up here tell you what screen
you're on it is a horizontal pagination
rather than a vertical scroll so that
might take a little bit of time for a
few of you users myself included to get
used to but it's very nice because now I
can look at everything on this page
decide whether what I'm looking for is
there or not and move on to the next one
so and I launched that inadvertently so
let me go ahead and get back all right
so that's where we are now the app
drawer and the home screens interplay
very tightly for example let's say I
want to take this pluralsight app and
put it on my home screen I'm going to
tap and hold now you'll notice kind of
very iOS ish once I've tapped and hold
held on that all of these little guys
are now wiggling to tell you that I can
do some
with them kind of to prompt my
interaction with them very very much
like what happens on the iphone so let's
go ahead and long press on this down
here at the bottom you can see then
message changed now it says move to
screen so we're going to change down
there we're going to just drop it now
that takes this over to and doing this
in slow motion is relatively hard so let
me talk you through it I tap on that I
drag it down to where this Home icon is
which will change into move to home
screen it will then bring up a series of
thumbnails of my screens where I can
choose which screen to put it on and
even the positioning on that screen so
that's what I'm going to do just really
fast because I can't narrate and do it
at the same time okay just like that now
that's one of the easier ways to do this
you can put anything that you want from
that app drawer on to any one of your
screens quickly easily it's a piece of
cake does take a little bit of time to
get used to but it's still nice
nonetheless now when I long press on
this you can see that I can either
replace this I can rename it I can
delete it or i can even uninstall it
from here which is very similar to what
we saw previously with ADW launcher to
the early beta there are a few things
that that does that this still doesn't
but you can see with stuff like this
those two launchers have really had to
step up their game and we're still
waiting to see what launcher pro does in
response to this but let's move along
what I've got down here is my little
gmail icon while I was filming this you
notice i got a new gmail and i now have
an unread gmail indicator down on the
bottom so i can go ahead and tap that
and go into my gmail it will do the same
thing for missed calls and for text
messages and whatnot so very cool but
that's not included in the launcher in
fact that's where this launcher is kind
of interesting but we'll come back to
that first let's go into our preferences
so we tap on menu settings as the phone
settings preferences is the the settings
for the app so we can change display
settings we can hide the status bar we
can hide the icon labels we can
even make our grid size tighter we can
make it five by four or even five by
five where the default is four by four
wallpaper scrolling we can either have
the wallpaper fixed and everything float
on top of it or in traditional Android
since we can have that wallpaper stroll
with us this is where I mentioned that
you can rotate between the screen so
once you get to the furthest on the
right you might begin and it will take
you to the furthest screen on the left
so that's very nice transition effect
that was the windmill effect that i
showed you can see there's a whole bunch
here that we can do very nice let's go
ahead and change it to flip and we'll
see that in action in just a minute the
fling speed I've bumped that up to
maximum so it looks more responsive
elasticity I've also bumped that up so
it's very elastic screen indicator up on
the top and auto hide the screen
indicator I don't want to see it all the
time so I've got it set to auto hide so
that's the display settings screen
settings basically it takes you to your
thumbnails of your screens if I want to
add a new screen I add a new screen if I
want to add in your screen I add a new
screen just like that and I can keep
going and going and going so very cool
there's even another page where i can
add more this is the first time that i
have seen something where you can add
more than seven screens and I don't know
why one would want to but you can which
is really kind of cool so to remove them
it's just as easy just tap on the little
X up there and do the same thing and if
you tap on it right it will work right
and if you tap on it wrong of course
they'll take you back to the home screen
so there we go I've got ahead and put
that back to the same way that we had
you can also change if you want your
home screen to be that one or that one
and again my fingers are a bit bigger on
camera than anywhere else but I can just
tap that little home button and make
that screen my home screen so really
kind of nice next let's move into dock
settings now the dock tray down at the
bottom is very nice bread and I both
like it static meaning i want the icons
in that dock to be there regardless of
what screen i'm on that's kind of
purpose of the doc however you don't
have to do that I can have up to three
rows so I can just swipe left and right
to get more and more docs down on the
bottom and and I can have basically
three times as many icons down there as
I normally would there are various
different styles that you can set either
the default style or transparent I've
got transparent because I kind of like
that the doc background I can set a
custom background if I want right now I
just want it to be transparent then then
loop mode if it were in if I had more
than one doc down at the bottom keep
going there's lots of stuff in here but
it's really really well thought out so
scrolling orientation this is how the
that app drawer Scrolls i showed you
horizontal page by page we can do
vertical continuous i'm kind of
disappointed that they didn't do a
vertical by page as well but that's a
feature request that if they're watching
this video they can go ahead and do for
us we'll keep it horizontal page by page
will come down here again we can change
the grid size we can even set a custom
background we can show the labels or not
show them we can hide the app icons if
we want this is very convenient if
you've got bloatware on your on your
phone if there's an app or a bunch of
apps that you don't use you can hide
them which is very nice you can change
the icon sorting to alphabetical the
latest installed earliest installed
seems kind of redundant here because we
have those tabs I'd like to see this
done more on those tabs rather than in
here but it gives you the options which
is very nice transition effect this is
when you open the app drawer what
transition will it do well I showed you
windmill there's also zoom and random so
zoom and random will kind of do either
default when Miller zoom it'll pick one
out at random we'll go ahead and change
that to zoom just so you can see it and
then show locked apps if we want to as
well we won't go too deeply into that
operation settings we can enable or
disable screen rotation I don't like
screen rotation on my home screen
because it takes up you know extra
compute cycles to be able to flip that
screen around into landscape versus
portrait orientation
and usually I do it accidentally so I
have that turn to off the pop-up quick
menu that's what happens when I push and
hold on an icon it has that quick menu
of things that you can do we can map the
home key have it do whatever we want
from that list the glide up action so
there's actually a gesture where you can
glide up or glide down and you can set
up what you want that to be we'll go
ahead and leave that as it is go ahead
into advanced settings assist a
persistent now that's something that
most modern launchers allow you to do
but they do have this warning says it's
experimental and may cause instability
basically your launcher is just an app
which is a good thing and a bad thing
it's a good thing because you can
install a new and just like you can
install a new app it's a bad thing
because just like other apps it can swap
in and out of memory whenever the system
needs more memory okay so what does that
mean if I'm in the facebook app and then
I want to switch over to the plume app I
can go ahead and do that and if I don't
have enough system memory to be able or
enough RAM if you want to use that term
to keep both of them in memory at the
same time it will swap one out which is
fine basically it's kind of closing that
app but remembering its state until I
want to switch back to Facebook and then
it has to go back and reload Facebook
and apply that where did you leave off
information so it takes a little bit of
time to do that versus if it were
actually still in memory it would just
swap over to it wouldn't be a problem
well apply that to your launcher so if I
launch plume and then I go back to my
launcher if for some reason I've got
enough stuff running in the background
that I've run out of memory it could
have swapped out my launcher to give me
extra ram for whatever the foreground
app is whatever's running right now so
that can add extra time when asked to
pull that a pin and populate it with all
the screens and widgets and icons and
whatnot so it can take you know not very
long but even still a second or two when
you're just trying to
at your home screen is relatively long
so if you're running into that type of
condition you might want to try the
system persistent which will basically
make your launcher apps stay in memory
even if you know it needs it now that
means that other stuff is going to have
to swap out but if you do a lot of work
on your home screen and going back to it
quite a bit you may want to try that out
if you're noticing that it's closing and
reopening so next thing is prevent force
close this will attempt to prevent force
closes when running out of memory it
just kind of goes hand in hand that's
something that I think should be kind of
built into the operating system but for
some reason they give you that option
right there clean rubbish data obviously
a more Queen's English translation this
I believe is a Chinese company that's
making this and we'll talk about that in
just a minute but this will go ahead and
check and clean for overlapping
shortcuts or widgets on the home screen
so I just kind of cleans up things when
you start getting into tighter grids at
five by five you can get stuff
overlapping this will attempt to clean
it up as I understand font you can
change your font to pretty much whatever
font you have installed on your system
it will go through and do a scan to show
you what fonts you have it's found for
so far five total and I can then come in
and I don't know what that does change
my font so there you go there the fonts
that it found I can leave it at default
or change to one of the others this is
where i was mentioning before so i can
display an unread text message count or
a missed call count or an unread gmail
account but to do that I have to have
these separate apps the apps are free in
fact everything that I've shown you so
far has been free you can go out to the
android market and get it or head over
to pocket now calm and i'll give you
links to get you started but you go
ahead and go out and download and
install these and it extends
functionality of the launcher to include
that so let's see what else we've got
there's also themes that you can do back
up your configuration so if you need to
reload like I do a lot because
flashing all kinds of roms and whatnot I
can restore that configuration and then
all I have to do is reconfigure my
widgets because you can't just restore
widgets so kind of kind of neat and
interesting then of course there's a
reset to default but let's get back over
here so here's this you can see my new
transition that I put into place now you
can see the zoom effect on the app
drawer so kind of cool but now since
we're back here let's talk about widgets
now you've probably seen a couple of
widgets on here now here is my my feeder
widget here's my news widget my plume
and Facebook widgets and some other
stuff this is called go whether it's by
the same company and this is actually a
let me back up just a minute one of the
things that you can get with a custom
launchers custom widgets and those
custom widgets can do all kinds of neat
things on HTC Sense probably being the
the best example where they've got this
animated flip clock you know the
animated flip clock and and other
widgets that come with HTC sense take
advantage of stuff built into HTC Sense
and extend it to be able to do cool
things in the widgets but those widgets
only work on HTC Sense well launcherpro
widgets only work on launcherpro
adw.launcher widgets only work on
adw.launcher Samsung's TouchWiz widgets
only work on TouchWiz Motorola's
motoblur widgets only work on moto blur
well this has the same thing let me go
over here to a blank area and you can
see I've got a go widget section so I
can tap that to either load up my
contacts widget or task manager widget
and that's really all the the widgets
that come prepackaged with this launcher
but you can also load up other widgets
for example this is you know what I've
forgotten the name of that so let's go
ahead and take a look this is separate
from the launcher itself it's called go
weather and there are three different
styles a two x 14 x 1 and 4 by 2 so
let's go ahead and put a four by one on
here just because it looks a little bit
different than 4 by 2 on the other
screen
now it's just a regular old widget this
will work on any launcher you don't have
to be using go launcher so there's the
smaller one there's the bigger one and
it looks an awful lot like the HTC Sense
widget or beautiful widgets or whatnot
looks really cool but here's what's cool
it comes with go whether it's not just a
widget it's an app that has widgets with
it so let's go ahead and launch it and
it takes a minute to fire up which I
don't like but once you're in there this
just got an update this morning like I
mentioned so let's see what's in here
bug fixes fixed a video display defect
other minor fixes and you I adjustments
yada yada yada ok and it's tmobile so
that's cool ok and if you look now
you'll see I'm flying through the clouds
it's a partly cloudy day it looks really
cool last night when it was raining I
was looking at a rain puddle this is
what it looks like it night view and
it'll automatically select between the
two so really cool effect there I was
looking at a rain puddle with the the
rain drops hitting it and I was seeing
the reflection of stuff above it so it
was really really cool I can come in
here and get more information including
the parameter all kinds of stuff I can
pull that drawer up so I can see what my
detail local forecast is so lots of cool
stuff really cool the way that they've
done it and then of course that
information is fed forward onto the the
home screen so really neat what you can
do ok that's a ton of stuff I mentioned
that this isn't just a launcher there's
lots of plugins forum and just to try
and wrap this up for you if I come in
here to my dialer you can see and I've
left this on not defaulted if you will
so you could see normally it's going to
launch my phone app but I can install go
dialer which is also free in the market
which kind of Rhys kins my dialer and
you can see it looks very very different
in here my contacts also look different
my groups it's mega and get down to that
are cool now I can go into friends
family coworkers businesses
all kinds of stuff right neighbors
co-workers so lots of cool stuff and I
can go into favorites as well very
different view from what you're used to
but it's starting to now turn into less
of just a launcher and more of a
entirely new theme or skin to the
Android experience than doing it bit by
bit by bit let me see if there was one
other thing that I wanted to show you is
that's what I wanted to show you so
let's go ahead and see what I'm going to
do here go ahead and fire up Gmail and
will compose a new message now in this
new message there's my on-screen
keyboard now this is go keyboard they
also have a keyboard again this will
work with any launcher so if you like
this kind of keyboard it's skinnable
it's the mobile so if you apply a theme
to one part of of go launcher it will
apply over here to your keyboard into
your other stuff your widgets and apps
and whatnot as well so everything has a
consistent look and feel to it really
kind of a cool approach to go in and
systematically replace bits and pieces
of the stock Android experience with the
new go experience for lack of another
word so fabulous great i love it now
let's get the things i don't like in the
list is very short number one this one I
tap on letters doesn't always do a
screen vibration in fact this is the
first time that it's done a vibration
for me I don't know why I don't like
that it's kind of intermittent said good
when I'm up here typing in an address
bar I don't have a space I have a
dot-com button which is nice unless I
need a space and then I've got to go in
and switch I would much rather have that
button split or have a dedicated button
because when i'm doing a google search
from the address bar i might want to do
Joe space Levi instead of Joe calm Levi
that just doesn't work and yes I have
done a couple of those searches and
they've not worked well next thing
translation isn't great okay they've
they've gone through and translated some
of the stuff and it's very obviously not
English native speakers who are doing
this translation that's going to improve
with time of course and that's about it
I mean for those two little nitpicky
things the launchers fabulous it's
really really good it's something that
really definitely warrants being
included in our launcher Wars it's not
quite up to the same level of
completeness and polish as launcher pro
and ADW launcher but it has bells and
whistles that those two don't so it's
very worthy of inclusion in this sorry
it took me so long to get this review
out there but as you could tell this is
a long video because there's a lot of
stuff not only in the launcher but in
the widgets and the other apps that come
along with it and I didn't want to just
rush through and do a quick review I
wanted to get in and get deep and really
do this launch or justice so for those
of you who recommended adding this to
our launcher war series thank you very
much we appreciate that kind of feedback
if there's something that I missed in
the review and I'm sure there is please
leave us a comment down below so that
those who either read the article or
watch the video after you can be
enlightened with that information as
well and of course this is just one
version stuck in time they're going to
make improvement so if you see this in
the future and they've improved on on a
feature or fixed one of the bugs that
I've pointed out please go ahead and
mention that for us as well so there we
go launcher wars part 3 now complete I
need to know what you want me to do for
lunch or worse part 4 go ahead and send
me a contact request over at
pocketnow.com just go to any one of my
articles and click on contact Joe Levi
right there on the article in the byline
and that you can then send me a message
saying hey launcher Wars I want to see
this launcher and this is why and I'll
go ahead and dig into that and see if
it's worthy of inclusion in our top
android launchers and see if we can
shoot a launchers war video for it as
well if you like seeing this kind of
in-depth stuff go ahead and thumbs up
this video of course if you haven't
already subscribed to our video channel
you need to do so now you need to
recommend it to your friends
and of course leave those comments
complaints or requests down in the
comments below for pocket now showing
off all kinds of cool alternate
launchers I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
