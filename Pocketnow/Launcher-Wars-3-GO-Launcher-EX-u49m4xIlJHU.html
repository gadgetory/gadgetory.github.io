I've got our third installment of
launcher wars
this time it's go launch or e.x let's go
take a look okay to introduce things a
launcher for those of you who don't know
is the app that runs on your system that
launches all of the other apps
it also takes care of your home screen
your dock bar your app tray just all
kinds of stuff that it does and we've
shown you recently launcher pro which is
a very nice launcher we've shown you a
TW launch or e^x and just recently we
showed you a TW launcher - which was an
early beta of the the total rewrite that
they're coming out with well here it is
I've been using this for a few days now
as my my stock launcher and it's been
great there are quite a few little
caveats and an awful lot to dig through
so let's go ahead and show you now just
before we dig into that I want to give a
big thank you out to our viewers there
were several of you who recommended that
we added this to our launcher wars
series so thank you for that
participation it took a long time coming
because I wanted to wait for one of the
updates to come out and that just came
through this morning and I also had to
have some time to dig into it so without
further ado let's go ahead and take a
look first of all this is a launcher
just like any other launcher it has home
screens it has nice transitions I'm
using the windmill transition it's got
the little which screen of my on
indicator dots up at the top and it's
got a continuous rotation so here I'm at
the end if I keep rotating I'm all the
way over on the other side so very nice
feature very fluid and I like it quite a
bit this is where it gets a little bit
interesting I've left this screen open
for us so let's go ahead and open up the
app drawer now you noticed a kind of a
pinwheel effect animating into the app
drawer that's one of the cool things it
does now you can set that to be pretty
much any animation that you want they've
got
four dozen or so then it comes preloaded
with I just chose that one because it
kind of showed off what this could do
you'll notice that this is tabbed and
it's paginating let's go to tabs first
so right now I'm looking at all of my
apps if I tap that I can go to my recent
apps and you can see which apps I've run
most recently and then you can see which
apps I have running and in this case you
can even see what my free and total
memory are so it's really nice and
really kind of well-thought-out to give
you more information than just okay
here's your apps blah but since we're
back here let's go ahead and talk about
this one of the things that I don't like
about the Stockham Android launcher is
when you've got a lot of apps in here
this list becomes very long and when you
scroll down through it it's a big long
list of icons that's not all that
friendly and you can get lost really
easily for example if I scroll this did
I already see this row once it's up here
or did it get off the screen it's hard
for me to take in everything that's on
one screen because it's just all over
the place so that's why I kind of like
this this is a paginate 'add view so if
I go ahead and scroll over you can see
now I'm on page 2 page 3 and the little
dots up here tell you what screen you're
on it is a horizontal pagination rather
than a vertical scroll so that might
take a little bit of time for a few of
you users myself included to get used to
but it's very nice because now I can
look at everything on this page decide
whether what I'm looking for is there or
not and move on to the next one so and I
launched that inadvertently so let me go
ahead and get back alright so that's
where we are now the app drawer and the
home screens interplay very tightly for
example let's say I want to take this
Pluralsight app and put it on my home
screen I'm gonna tap and hold now you'll
notice kind of vary iOS ish once I've
tapped and hold held on that all of
these little guys are now wiggling to
tell you that I can do
something with them kind of to prompt my
interaction with them very very much
like what happens on the iPhone so let's
go ahead and long press on this down
here at the bottom you can see that
message changed now it says move to
screen so we're going to change down
there we're going to just drop it now
that takes this over too and doing this
in slow motion is relatively hard so let
me talk to you through it
I tap on that I drag it down to where
this home icon is which will change into
move to home screen it will then bring
up a series of thumbnails of my screens
where I can choose which screen to put
it on and even the positioning on that
screen so that's what I'm gonna do just
really fast because I can't narrate and
do it at the same time okay just like
that now that's one of the easier ways
to do this you can put anything that you
want from that app drawer on to any one
of your screens quickly easily it's a
piece of cake does take a little bit of
time to get used to but it's still nice
nonetheless now when I long press on
this you can see that I can either
replace this I can rename it I can
delete it or I can even uninstall it
from here which is very similar to what
we saw previously with ADW launcher to
the early beta there are a few things
that that does that this still doesn't
but you can see with stuff like this
those two launchers have really had to
step up their game and we're still
waiting to see what launch or Pro does
in response to this but let's move along
what I've got down here is my little
gmail icon while I was filming this you
notice I got a new gmail and I now have
an unread Gmail indicator down on the
bottom so I can go ahead and tap that
and go into my gmail it will do the same
thing for missed calls and for text
messages and whatnot so very cool but
that's not included in the launcher in
fact that's where this launcher is kind
of interesting but we'll come back to
that first let's go into our preferences
so we tap on menu settings as the phone
settings preferences is the the settings
for the app so we can change display
settings we can hide the status bar we
can hide the icon labels we
even make our grid size tighter we can
make it 5 by 4 or even 5 by 5 where the
default is 4 by 4 wallpaper scrolling we
can either have the wallpaper fixed and
everything float on top of it or in
traditional Android sense we can have
that wallpaper scroll with us this is
where I mentioned that you can rotate
between the screen so once you get to
the furthest on the right you swipe
again and it will take you to the
further screen on the left so that's
very nice transition effect that was the
windmill effect that I showed you can
see there's a whole bunch here that we
can do very nice let's go ahead and
change it to flip and we'll see that in
action in just a minute
the fling speed I've bumped that up to
maximum so it looks more responsive
elasticity I've also bumped that up so
it's very elastic screen indicator up on
the top and auto hide the screen
indicator I don't want to see it all the
time so I've got it set to auto hide so
that's the display settings screen
settings basically it takes you to your
thumbnails of your screens if I want to
add a new screen I add a new screen if I
want to add in your screen I add a new
screen just like that and I can keep
going and going and going so very cool
there's even another page where I can
add more this is the first time that I
have seen something where you can add
more than seven screens and I don't know
why one would want to but you can which
is really kind of cool so to remove them
it's just as easy just tap on the little
X up there and do the same thing and if
you tap on it right it will work right
and if you tap on it wrong of course
it'll take you back to the home screen
so there we go I've got ahead and put
that back to the same way that we had
you can also change if you want your
home screen to be that one or that one
and again my fingers are a bit bigger on
camera than anywhere else but I can just
tap that little home button and make
that screen my home screen so really
kind of nice next let's move into dock
settings now the dock tray down at the
bottom is very nice Brenda and I both
like it static meaning I want the icons
in that dock to be there regardless of
what screen I'm on that's kind
purpose of the dock however you don't
have to do that I can have up to three
rows so I can just swipe left and right
to get more and more docks down on the
bottom and and I can have basically
three times as many icons down there as
I normally would there are various
different styles that you can set either
the default style or transparent I've
got transparent because I kind of like
that the dock background I can set a
custom background if I want right now I
just want it to be transparent and then
loop remote if it were in if I had more
than one dock down at the bottom keep
going there's lots of stuff in here but
it's really really well thought out so
scrolling orientation this is how the
that app drawer Scrolls and I showed you
horizontal page by page we can do
vertical continuous I'm kind of
disappointed that they didn't do a
vertical by page as well but that's a
feature request that if they're watching
this video they can go ahead and do for
us we'll keep it horizontal page by page
we'll come down here again we can change
the grid size we can even set a custom
background we can show the labels or not
show them we can hide the app icons if
we want this is very convenient if
you've got bloatware on your on your
phone if there's an app or a bunch of
apps that you don't use you can hide
them which is very nice you can change
the icons sorting to alphabetical the
latest installed earliest installed
seems kind of redundant here because we
have those tabs I'd like to see this
done more on those tabs rather than in
here but it gives you the options which
is very nice transition effect this is
when you open the app drawer
what transition will it do well I showed
you windmill there's also zoom and
random so zoom and random will kind of
do either default windmill or zoom it'll
pick one out at random we'll go ahead
and change that to zoom just so you can
see it and then show locked apps if we
want to as well we won't go too deeply
into that operation settings we can
enable or disable screen rotation
I don't like screen rotation on my home
screen because it takes up you know
extra computer cycles to be able to flip
that screen around into landscape versus
portrait orientation
and usually I do it accidentally so I
have that turn to off the pop-up quick
menu that's what happens when I push and
hold on the icon it has that quick menu
of things that you can do we can map the
HOME key have it do whatever we want
from that list the glide up action so
there's actually a gesture where you can
glide up or glide down and you can set
up what you want that to be well go
ahead and leave that as it is
go ahead into advanced settings
assistive persistent now that's
something that most modern launchers
allow you to do but they do have this
warning says it's experimental and may
cause instability basically your
launcher is just an app which is a good
thing and a bad thing it's a good thing
because you can install a new one just
like you can install a new app it's a
bad thing because it's just like other
apps it can swap in and out of memory
whenever the system needs more memory
okay so what does that mean if I'm in
the Facebook app and then I want to
switch over to the plume app I can go
ahead and do that and if I don't have
enough system memory to be able or
enough RAM if you want to use that term
to keep both of them in memory at the
same time it will swap one out which is
fine basically it's kind of closing that
app but remembering its state until I
want to switch back to Facebook and then
it has to go back and reload Facebook
and apply that and where did you leave
off information so it takes a little bit
of time to do that versus if it were
actually still in memory it would just
swap over - it wouldn't be a problem
well apply that to your launcher so if I
launch Plume and then I go back to my
launcher if for some reason I've got
enough stuff running in the background
that I've run out of memory
it could have swapped out my launcher to
give me extra RAM for whatever the
foreground app is whatever's running
right now so that can add extra time
when asked to pull that app in and
populate it with all the screens and
widgets and icons and whatnot so it can
take you know not very long but even
still a second or two when you're just
trying to
your home screen is relatively long so
if you're running into that type of
condition you might want to try the
system persistent which will basically
make your launcher apps stay in memory
even if you know it needs it now that
means that other stuff is gonna have to
swap out but if you do a lot of work on
your home screen and going back to it
quite a bit you may want to try that out
if you're noticing that it's closing and
reopening so next thing is prevent force
flows this will attempt to prevent force
closes when running out of memory it
just kind of goes hand in hand and
that's something that I think should be
kind of built into the operating system
but for some reason they give you that
option right there
clean rubbish data obviously a more
Queen's English translation this I
believe is a Chinese company that's
making this and we'll talk about that in
just a minute but this will go ahead and
check and clean for overlapping
shortcuts or widgets on the home screen
so it just kind of cleans up things when
you start getting into tighter grids at
five by five you can get stuff
overlapping and this will attempt to
clean it up as I understand font you can
change your font to pretty much whatever
font you have installed on your system
it will go through and do a scan to show
you what fonts you have it's found four
so far five total and I can then come in
and I don't know what that does change
my font so there you go they're the
fonts that it found I can leave it at
default or change to one of the others
this is where I was mentioning before so
I can display an unread text message
account or a missed call count or an
unread email account but to do that I
have to have these separate apps the
apps are free in fact everything that
I've shown you so far has been free you
can go out to the Android Market and get
it or head over to pocketnow.com and
I'll give you links to get you started
but you go ahead and go out and download
and install these and it extends
functionality of the launcher to include
that so let's see what else we've got
there's also themes that you can do
backup your configuration so if you need
to reload like I do a lot
I'm flashing all kinds of roms and
whatnot I can restore that configuration
and then all I have to do is reconfigure
my widgets because you can't just
restore widgets so kinda kind of neat
and interesting then of course there's a
reset to default but let's get back over
here so here's this you can see my new
transition that I put into place
now you can see the zoom effect on the
app drawer so kind of cool but now since
we're back here let's talk about widgets
now you've probably seen a couple of
widgets on here now here is my my feeder
widget here's my news widget my plume
and Facebook widgets and some other
stuff this is called go whether it's by
the same company and this is actually a
let me back up just a minute one of the
things that you can get with a custom
launcher is custom widgets and those
custom widgets can do all kinds of neat
things HTC Sense probably being the the
best example where they've gotten this
animated flip clock and all that
animated flip clock and and other
widgets that come with HTC Sense take
advantage of stuff built into HTC Sense
and extend it to be able to do cool
things in the widgets but those widgets
only work on HTC Sense well launcher pro
widgets only work on launcher pro ADW
launcher widgets only work on ADW
launcher Samsung's TouchWiz widgets only
work on TouchWiz Motorola's motoblur
widgets only work on motoblur well this
has the same thing let me go over here
to a blank area and you can see I've got
a go widget section so I can tap that to
either load up my contacts widget or
task manager widget and that's really
all the the widgets that come
prepackaged with this launcher but you
can also load up other widgets for
example this is you know I've forgotten
the name of that so let's go ahead and
take a look this is separate from the
launcher itself it's called go weather
and there are three different styles a 2
by 1 4 by 1 &amp;amp; 4 by 2 so let's go ahead
and put a 4 by 1 on here just because it
looks a little bit different than the 4
by 2 on the other screen
now it's just a regular old widget this
will work on any launcher you don't have
to be using go launcher so there's the
smaller one there's the bigger one and
it looks an awful lot like the HTC Sense
widget or beautiful widgets or whatnot
looks really cool but here's what's cool
it comes with go whether it's not just a
widget it's an app that has widgets with
it so let's go ahead and launch it and
it takes a minute to fire up which I
don't like but once you're in there this
just got an update this morning like I
mentioned so let's see what's in here
bug fixes fixed a video display defect
other minor fixes and UI adjustments
yada yada yada okay and it's the mobile
so that's cool
okay and if you look now you'll see I'm
flying through the clouds it's a part of
the cloudy day it looks really cool last
night when it was raining I was looking
at a rain puddle this is what it looks
like at night view and it'll
automatically select between the two so
really cool effect there I was looking
at a rain puddle with the the rain drops
hitting it and I was seen the reflection
of stuff above it so it was really
really cool I can come in here and get
more information including the parameter
all kinds of stuff I can pull that
drawer up so I can see what my detail
local forecast is so lots of cool stuff
really cool the way that they've done it
and then of course that information is
fed forward onto the the home screen so
really neat what you can do okay that's
a ton of stuff I mentioned that this
isn't just a launcher there's lots of
plugins forum and just to try and wrap
this up for you if I come in here to my
dialer you can see and I've left this on
not defaulted if you will so you could
see normally it's gonna launch my phone
app but I can install go dialer which is
also free in the market which kind of
Reis kins my dialer and you can see it
looks very very different in here my
contacts also look different my groups
so I couldn't get down to that are cool
now I can go into friends family
co-workers businesses
all kinds of stuff right neighbors
co-workers so lots of cool stuff and I
can go into favorites as well very
different view from what you used to but
it's starting to now turn into less of
just a launcher and more of a an
entirely new theme or skin to the
Android experience they're doing it bit
by bit by bit let me see if there was
one other thing that I wanted to show
you is that's what I wanted to show you
so let's go ahead and see what I'm gonna
do here go ahead and fire up Gmail and
we'll compose a new message now in this
new message
there's my on-screen keyboard now this
is go keyboard they also have a keyword
again this will work with any launcher
so if you like this kind of keyboard
it's skinnable it's the mobile so if you
apply a theme to one part of of go
launcher it will apply over here to your
keyboard into your other stuff your
widgets and apps and whatnot as well so
everything has a consistent look and
feel to it really kind of a cool
approach to go in and systematically
replace bits and pieces of the stock
Android experience with the new go
experience for lack of another word so
fabulous great I love it now let's get
the things I don't like in the list is
very short number one this one I tap on
letters doesn't always do a screen
vibration in fact this is the first time
that it's done a vibration for me I
don't know why I don't like that it's
kind of intermittent Sega when I'm up
here typing in an address bar I don't
have a space I have a dot-com button
which is nice unless I need a space and
then I've got to go in a switch I would
much rather have that button split or
have a dedicated button because when I'm
doing a google search from the address
bar I might want to do Jo space leave I
instead of Jo calm Levi that just
doesn't work and yes I have done a
couple of those searches and they've not
worked well next thing translation isn't
great okay they've
they've gone through and translated some
of the stuff and it's very obviously not
English native speakers who are doing
this translation that's going to improve
with time of course and that's about it
I mean for those two little nitpicky
things the launchers fabulous it's
really really good it's something that
really definitely warrants being
included in our launcher wars it's not
quite up to the same level of
completeness and polish as launcher Pro
an ADW launcher but it has bells and
whistles that those two don't so it's
very worthy of inclusion in this sorry
it took me so long to get this review
out there but as you could tell this is
a long video because there's a lot of
stuff not only in the launcher but in
the widgets and the other apps that come
along with it and I didn't want to just
rush through and do a quick review I
wanted to get in and get deep and really
do this launch or justice so for those
of you who recommended adding this to
our launcher war series thank you very
much we appreciate that kind of feedback
if there's something that I missed in
the review and I'm sure there is please
leave us a comment down below so that
those who either read the article or
watch the video after you can be
enlightened with that information as
well and of course this is just one
version stuck in time they're going to
make improvements so if you see this in
the future and they've improved on on a
feature or fixed one of the bugs that
I've pointed out please go ahead and
mention that for us as well so there we
go launcher wars part 3 now complete I
need to know what you want me to do for
a launch or worst part for go ahead and
send me a contact request over at
pocketnow.com just go to any one of my
articles and click on contact Joe Levi's
right there on the article in the byline
