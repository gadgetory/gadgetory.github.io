pocket now
calm and this is a review of spb online
version 1 point 0 it was actually
released today what this program is
supposed to do is bring together a bunch
of different kinds of online content
into one program such as TV radio and
that sort of thing so let me go through
the program with you now okay so here we
are on the main screen which is
comprised of eight different tiles and
quite simply if you want to enter TV for
example you just tap on TV so I'm going
to do that and you get the kind of spb
mobile shell animation with the cube
flying into the center of the screen
which is kind of nice now we get a
choice of about 15 or 20 TV stations but
there nothing really good there there's
no common station like CNBC or Comedy
Central or NBC or ABC it's a lot of kind
of French channels and German channels
and you've NASA television which is kind
of cool but there's nothing really that
I want to watch so let me show you what
it looks like when you when you get a
channel that you like you press on the
play button then you can rotate the
device and the motion is pretty fluid
I'm doing this over a Wi-Fi connection
there are some on-screen controls that
you can use if I tap on the center of
the screen I can change the brightness I
can change the volume and I can get a
menu of the different channels that I
can go to so I can click on to the next
one I kind of get this picture in
picture which is pretty cool I like what
I see I tap on the little thumbnail and
I get the full screen I like this
concept I just wish there were some
channels that I actually wanted to watch
and what's kind of cool is that so you
do find a channel that you like you can
you can view the TV Guide by going to
menu TV Guide and see the programming
list and from here say you want to see
something at 750 p.m. well you tap on
that and it automatically synchronizes
with outlook to set up a reminder so
that you don't forget to view that
station so that's kind of cool all right
let's go back let's go into radio and
radios a little better than TV because
you get a lot more choices so if you
want to add a station you simply do
click to add
station and now what's neat is that you
can go by regions so if you want to find
a radio station located in your hometown
so say you live in Los Angeles and you
know that you know 95.5 is a station you
like to listen to a lot you tap on that
and you get the internet stream it's
obviously not going to use standard FM
radio signals but you get it over the
internet and it's actually pretty good
quality so that's a good feature of spb
online now we're going to go to news
which is just basically a standard RSS
reader and you can add other sites quite
easily you can go to menu and add
channel SBB has included a bunch of
different entries automatically so you
don't have to search for various feeds
so you can select online catalog and go
to next English well that's the language
I speak so it goes to their server and
comes up with some matches and so what
I'm going to do is go to computers an
Internet go to pocket pc and ho hey look
pocket nails there so I'm going to add
that and we can see the pocket now feed
after after it updates and we can do
that nice flick scrolling that's
included on the program it's a very well
done flick scroll I like it a lot and
you can tap on various articles and see
the entire article depending on how the
that particular website does it's RSS
feed we have full feeds at pocket now
okay so the next thing I want to show
you is the weather application which
looks quite similar to touch flo 3d on
the HTC touch diamond and touch pro I
already have it set up for New York City
and it gives you the temperature right
now in Celsius although we can change
that quite easily to Fahrenheit we get a
five day forecast it looks like and you
can you can kind of cycle between
different cities so you can add a city
take away cities and that sort of thing
so that's that's kind of helpful ok so
far we've covered the first four items
and to be honest with you guys that's
where the usefulness stops of this
program everything beyond this is pretty
much requiring you to pay for spb
services so if we go to even themes and
we want to get an abstract theme
everything here you see costs 99 cents
you can't get any themes without paying
which is really silly I already paid
twenty nine dollars for this software
and now i should pay an additional 99
cents for a theme come on that's silly
if we go back to ringtones again all the
ringtones let's get a jazzy ringtone
cost 99 cents not worth it to me ok and
finally i'm going to show you games here
now what you see on the screen here are
actually free games that you can play so
if i go to online checkers and I don't
need to type a name here I'm just
demonstrating its connecting and it's
going to find someone out there who's
playing this game right now and it's
kind of cool because I can play with
them right now I guess it's their turn
anyhow you get the point so we can go
back we can play some other online games
or we can click download games and of
course cough up more money to SB be if
we want to play for example spb free so
which costs four dollars and ninety-five
cents
so that's pretty much it for spb online
it's absolutely not worth $29.95 because
really all you're getting is some TV
stations that you get streamed to get
some radio an RSS reader weather
application and all these things you can
get for free anyway from various sources
and really SBB online is about selling
products and services to people from SB
b's catalog of products which is fine
but i don't want to have to pay for that
this program should be free that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
