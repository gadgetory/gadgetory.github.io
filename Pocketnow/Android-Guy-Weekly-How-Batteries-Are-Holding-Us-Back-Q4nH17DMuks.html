we're going to talk about batteries and
why they're holding us back and what we
can do with our smartphones and our
tablets let's go take a look alright so
batteries are a specification that are
included really on every single cell
phone and tablet that you get and just
don't mean much and why is that because
most of us don't understand battery
technology so for example that is an old
Nexus One see that it's got a 1400
milliamp hour battery in it and it runs
at 1 gigahertz I think it runs at 1
gigahertz it's been so long this is a
Galaxy Nexus it's a dual-core 1.2
gigahertz and it's got a 1750 milliamp
hour battery in it okay so what does
that mean well if you take a look at
your battery you're going to see
something that says how many milliamp
hours it is you're also going to see
something that says how many volts and
how many watt hours hey the volts just
kind of ignore they're pretty much
standard three point seven in this case
that's what our phones use to run on
volts well that's electro-motive force
that anyway let's not get into too much
detail on electronics you can do that if
you want to and if you'd like to know
you know more about battery theory and
electronics leave me a comment down
below I can get into that detail if you
want but let's keep things a little bit
high level so today let's let's just
suffice it to say voltage is going to
remain the same three point seven volts
is that one variable we're going to lock
it in and leave it over there okay now
we've got the other and that's the
milliamp hours that is literally the
capacity of the battery now what do I
mean by capacity if we consider voltage
to be flow which essentially it is and
milliamp hours or amp hours to be
capacity which it is then we can start
to understand
and how batteries work and where some of
our challenges lie so I keep saying
capacity let's picture your battery as a
jug of water one gallon jug let's make
things easier two liter for lead or
whatever for for our metric friends but
you've got this jug of water now there
are a couple of things I mean it's got a
predetermined amount of stuff in it
right water in this case and it's got a
specific flow rate you can't pour the
stuff the water out of that jug any
faster than the hole and the the neck of
the jug will let you do it ok so that's
your voltage essentially so we've got a
gallon of water well how long is that
gallon of water going to last if I have
a lid on it and set it on a shelf it's
going to last almost indefinitely oh
sure you're going to have some
evaporation through the plastic it's
going to go bad and it's going to have a
funny taste after a while but you're
still going to have about a gallon of
water in that even years later well in
batteries it's kind of the same thing if
you just set this on the shelf and leave
it alone it's going to remain charged
for months and months and you can come
back and use it it's great if you leave
it inside your phone and your phone is
turned off not just screen off but
entirely off it's gonna last for months
and months and months hey wouldn't that
be a cool spec battery life three months
just don't turn it on ok maybe not so
turning it on turning your phone or your
tablet on is akin to drinking out of
that jug of water if you are let's say
it's a nice cool spring day like it is
out here in utah and i'm watching the
garden i'm watching the grass grow i'm
watching the birds i'm not doing
anything i'm just sitting down relaxing
and sipping at my water it's gonna last
me all day and i'm probably going to
have some left over see i'm not using it
much i'm not doing much now if I decide
that I want to go out for a run on the
island right next to me in the hot with
no shade and there's a no wind coming
across so I'm just sweating and sweating
and sweating and I'm not cooling down
well I'm going to be drinking water left
and right I'm going to be going through
that and I'm gonna have to stop and get
refills on my water
cuz I'm going to use it all up it's the
same gallon of water but because I'm
exerting more energy I have to drink
more water by the way a gallon of water
a day is kind of a good target number
for you just FYI with batteries it's
kind of the same way obviously you're
not storing water in them you're not
storing a gallon of anything in them
what you're doing is you're storing
energy will get to how it does that just
really high level in a minute but the
more you use it the more you open that
jug and pour it out into a glass and
drink it the faster your water is going
well the more you turn on your phone and
use it use your battery use your screen
use your radios use your speaker all
that stuff the more you use it the
faster it's going to drain just like the
jug of water okay we all got that let's
move on okay a jug of water works by
having a big empty space without holes
in it obviously that you can fill up and
then a lid that you put on right pretty
simple when you want to get water out of
it you reverse the process take off the
lid pour the jug put the lid back on
with a battery it's a little bit
different inside of a battery you've
essentially got three things you've got
an anode you've got a cathode you've got
an electrolyte now I'm not going to go
into tons of detail unless you want me
to go into tons of detail again leave
comments down below suffice it to say on
one side you have positive ions on one
side you have negative ions with a lack
of electrons so essentially you're
storing all of your electrons on one
side they're not on the other side and
you're insulating those two with an
electrolyte solution so you know if you
imagine two wires that you're holding
close together as long as there's a gap
in between their power electricity is
not going to flow between them but as
soon as you get it close enough it's
going to arc across make sense batteries
don't really work exactly that way but
it's kind of what it does so when you
charge up the battery you're essentially
replenishing all of those positive
electron positive on is it positive or
negative I can research that if you want
me to know anyway you're putting the
juice on one side and not on the other
side and then when you need to
use it you're reversing that process
you're allowing the flow to go across
and it's that electrolyte solution that
lets the electrons travel through and
power flow and whatnot now this is
direct current so it's goes from one
side to the other side and out and I
know it's not just one side the other
side there's lots of little cells in
here so trying to keep battery
technology simples really hard okay
stick with me take a deep breath all
right so we've got these batteries and
anodes cathodes electrolytes and they're
all crammed in there really really
really tight you can't cram them much
tighter because again when you put those
two wires close together eventually
they're going to arc when they arc
that's called a short by the way it's
going to let the electrons flow across
and that will discharge the battery
that's why you don't ever want to short
your pins on the top because it'll get
really hot really fast and burn stuff
out and cause damage so don't do that
that's what happens on the inside in
fact the lithium ion batteries are
famous dare I say in famous I know I
pronounced that wrong but go back to the
three amigos see what I mean it's a
funny show but when it happens is inside
inside things happen it's not just a
solid piece in there and some of these
batteries were built without really high
Wow standards I guess they weren't high
quality and there was stuff in there in
between that space that kind of bridged
the gap just a little bit just enough
that when it got hot sure enough the
electrons jumped across and it shorted
it got hot and well fire and explosions
and all kinds of stuff that you don't
want to be happening with the cell phone
in your pocket that should be all fixed
now because quality standards have
improved but it goes to show you that
you can't cram the anodes and cathodes
closer together without running into
that possibility of shorting and
exploding we don't want to happen so
today's technology how can we get more
juice in a battery when we make the
battery bigger it's about it
that's where our problem is we've got
screens that are getting huge
high-definition screens they're using up
lots and lots of power they're very
bright they're very pretty but they use
a lot of power well the bigger the
screens get we talked about this before
the more processing power you have to
have both cpu and GPU well the higher
those run the more power they consume
you also need more ram to be able to
kind of cash all the stuff that's going
to go into the GPU and CPU and be
processed and displayed for you that
takes extra power oh and guess what cram
and all those in there makes it run
hotter which makes your battery kind of
discharge faster not cool so we've got
all of these things are making huge
advancements and the specs are going
through the roof quad-core processors in
cell phones are you kidding me okay
whatever but high-def screens okay they
take up lots and lots and lots of power
so everything is getting faster hotter
and using more power to run but our
battery technology is still lagging
behind significantly in fact in these
electric cars that you're hearing about
and some of you might even owned by the
way if you own an electric car comment
let us know that kind of cool if you ask
me anyway back on topic the batteries
that they use there are essentially the
same batteries that we use in our phones
and they're not all that advanced
compared to all of the advancements that
we're making in technologies in other
places so our batteries holding us back
right now we're kind of teetering on the
edge we can always make bigger batteries
but people want skinnier phones so at
what point are they too skinny at what
point do we need to say no no no guys
let's start making our phones particular
sewing a bit put bigger batteries in
them and at what point are we going to
start getting bigger capacity batteries
with higher tech in them that last
longer come on I want a battery that's
going to last me all week don't you so
that's what our topic is for the day if
you've got some thoughts about batteries
or if you
like to correct some stuff that I made
two simple please feel free to do that
down in the comments down below of
course give the video a big thumbs up
because by doing this stuff we're
learning more about our phones and our
tablets and by doing that we're going to
be able to better understand how they
use in this case electricity get more
life out of them we're going to talk
about sometime in the not-too-distant
future about how we can make our
batteries last longer not longer
capacity but last longer so that we
don't have to replace them and wear them
out which might be really really
important for you if you have a
non-removable battery so you'll want to
make sure that you subscribe to our
video channel so you don't miss out on
that in an upcoming episode of the
android guy weekly with joe levi for
pocket now and the android guy weekly
