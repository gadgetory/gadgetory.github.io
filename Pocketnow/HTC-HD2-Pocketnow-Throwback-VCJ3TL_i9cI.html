purchase thanks to Boost Mobile for the
sponsorship and thanks to you for
watching 2009 it was the year the terms
sexting auto-tune and birther entered
the public lexicon the year of the
Octomom the year a jumbo jet landed in
the Hudson River it doesn't seem like
that long ago until you remember that
the current version of Windows Phone
wasn't even out yet and our intro for
Pocket now videos still looked like this
yet almost five years after its release
a Windows Mobile smartphone from this
period in history has defied all odds to
stay relevant making some history of its
own in the process if you followed its
path to release you might have known it
as the T 85 85
the T 91 93 or the Leo but its proper
name is the HTC hd2 we first reviewed it
way back in 2010 and we just unboxed a
refurb last week so let's review it
again this is the HTC hd2 and this is
PocketNow throwback the HD 2 has never
been a humble device even before it
became the world's most adaptable
platform for mobile programmers it's
stole headlines for its sheer power in
2009 it's 1 gigahertz Qualcomm scorpion
processor was bleeding edge it's 4.3
inch display positively massive by the
standards of the day that large screen
area drove the hardware size up sure but
HTC did a good job of keeping its
chassis pocketable while it was still a
big device for the time its footprint
today seems petite when compared with
modern smartphones like the HTC One it's
11 millimeter thickness sharp physical
hardware keys and the attractive
combination of brushed metal and soft
touch plastic on the back make for a
very handsome device one that holds up
pretty well even today going back to the
display there's more to it than just
sheer size it's also capacitive and
capable of multi-touch input both firsts
for a device running Windows Mobile
which was a platform built for resistive
touchscreens
and styluses the HD 2 shipped with
windows mobile 6.1 but it wasn't the tap
happy pocket PC operating system of
yesteryear instead HTC had developed one
of the most complete shells ever for
this version of Windows a shell which
made its debut on this device under the
now-familiar name
HTC Sense it's amazing how deeply senses
hooks
dug into Windows Mobile
asking almost every aspect of
Microsoft's aging OS and replacing many
of its stock programs with custom-built
HTC apps and while in 2014 we might
complain about such a heavy skin in 2009
this was absolutely critical to making
the HD 2 palatable to a consumer
audience expecting iPhone like fluidity
and iconography of course the real
beauty of the HD 2 is that it was able
to offer the best of both worlds its
software was able to deliver much of the
tap and go simplicity of the iPhone but
the powerful underpinnings of Windows
Mobile were still accessible to those
users with the desire to tweak and
paired with the phone's beefy hardware
and some well-placed marketing by HTC
it made the HD 2 a sell-out success
several times over a big win both for
its manufacturer and t-mobile its
exclusive launch partner in the States
unlike with other phones though the HD
to success story didn't stop there
the device is incredibly modern friendly
thanks to its ability to install
different OSS from the SD card or flash
memory and that tweak ability combined
with an already high affection for the
device in the Windows user community
created a kind of perfect storm the dev
world rallied behind the HD 2 hacking it
to run operating systems ranging from
the different flavors of Android all the
way up to KitKat 2 Windows Phone 7 to
Firefox OS to do bun two distributions
even to proof-of-concept builds of
Windows RT yeah the tablet OS combined
with the official support of its maker
in terms of accessories the phone has
reached almost mythical levels of
worship that don't look like they're
going away anytime soon
today the HTC hd2 stands as a monument
to a steadfast computing platform and a
testament to the power of a well built
machine to capture the imagination and
the affection of a generation of
smartphone enthusiasts
