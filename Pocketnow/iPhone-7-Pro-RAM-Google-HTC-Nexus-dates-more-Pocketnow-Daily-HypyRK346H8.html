provide us with a possible date iphone 7
rumors continue to signal to a more
powerful device and 1 plus seems to need
desperate measures in order to meet
demand I'm hi Mary vera and welcome to
the non galaxy note 7 edition we
actually have a separate video just for
that this is parking out daily
official loose today begin with deals if
you are in the market for an HTC 10 or
you already purchased an HTC 10 the
company is actually offering a hundred
dollars off and accessories and the
interesting part here is that again if
you ordered purchased your phone early
you can still get those hundred dollars
if you follow more information like in
the description let's will the spotlight
over to polar this is not a company that
we usually talk about here but now it's
become relevant to the smartphone and
SmartWatch space mainly because of a new
m600 SmartWatch that's running Android
wear obviously a fork version that's
pretty much designed to allow this
fitness tracker to be more valuable we
cannot wait to give it a try we're
getting a review unit very soon mainly
we can't wait to compare to the Moto 360
sport which wasn't really that good for
sports and if you're in the market for a
one plus three I highly suggest you
follow links mainly because between
august nine and September 12 apparently
there are 25 markets that will not be
selling the one plus three because the
company is trying to meet the man the
backlog is just so huge the company
wants to figure out a way to fix that um
this just proves that the one plus three
is definitely one of the most I don't
know best selling smartphones for one
plus and we have to agree i mean the
product is extremely good it's just sad
that the company continues to struggle
with the basics as will the spotlight
over to the iphone 7 iphone 6s a
whatever it's going to be called we've
got trusted sources KGI securities
claiming that this device is indeed
bringing 3 gigabytes of ram the purpose
for these three gigabytes is still
something we don't know why mainly
because we're rocking the ipad 9.7 inch
pro which has only two gigs of ram and
performs well multitask well we wonder
exactly what Apple is planning here we
can now wait to see the final product
and finally the very hot nurses they
have to do with the HTC nexus smartphone
or smartphones as for some sources are
claiming that we should prepare that
this device is apparently going to be
ready October for yeah I know we're kind
of far towards October for it gives a
lot of companies to launch whatever it
is that they will launch at afar and
separate event
it's mainly making this very difficult
if you ask yourself in the question of
the day think about it with the galaxy
note 7 with so many other smartphones
that are coming in the fall are you
still waiting for Nexus because in my
case I probably won't leave us a comment

opinion friends you know the way goes if
