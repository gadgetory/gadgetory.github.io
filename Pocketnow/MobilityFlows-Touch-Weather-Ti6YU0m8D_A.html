pakka now calm and today we're looking
at touch whether from mobility flow if
you don't use htcs touchflo 3d or sense
then unfortunately you miss out on these
beautiful weather animations and since
there aren't any apps that recreate
these realistic weather effects you're
pretty much left settling for basic
looking alternatives well touch weather
is essentially a standalone weather app
that rivals HTC's weather in terms of
breathtaking animations let's take a
look okay upon opening the app we're
instantly greeted by current conditions
and as you can see it's very early in
the morning and it's partly cloudy so to
reflect that the background is darkened
and the moon is displayed with some
clouds floating around at the top we
have the city and a time of day to the
left we have the temperature and at the
bottom we have extra information swiping
vertically will let us view conditions
throughout the day here we have new
evening and night notice how the
background will lighten or darken
depending on the time of day swiping
horizontally will reveal it's the
extended forecast giving you a glimpse
of the entire week's weather let's see
if we can find a rainy day so I can give
you an idea of what the water droplet
the fact will look like ok here we go
so it's very similar to the weather
found in HTC Sense if you tap on the
screen you'll get some extra information
here we have chance of precipitation
wind factor and more along the bottom we
have the settings here we have a quick
jump to the extended forecast clicking
on it will jump to that day the middle
button is to update the weather the
globe will actually allow you to add
another city or change between other
cities and of course the door icon will
exit the application so let's go back to
settings so here you can actually change
the database that this app uses to look
of whether i'm using accuweather since
i'm living in the united states but
there are some other options for
different parts of the world so let's go
to background and here we can change the
backdrop behind the weather animations
there are six choices and you can
actually insert your own let's change
that to number four if you go down you
can actually add a blur effect and you
can change the shading intensity let's
go to graphics if you wanted to add a
moon phase transparency you can do that
and you can look at some time and date
settings here you can change between
Celsius and Fahrenheit and of course you
can update
so here's the new background looks like
it's earth and as you can see the
background is blurred a bit so this was
a look at touch whether from ability
flow there's a free version with limited
features and the pro version costs five
dollars fortunately they allow you to
trial the app the full version for 15
days i'll post the link on pacquiao com
that's it for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
