big or too expensive no problem you
should check out the GS for mini
I'm man town this is PocketNow and we're
unboxing the samsung galaxy s4 mini so
here's the FedEx packaging and here's
the obligatory scissors to take care of
it and while we open the envelope to
check what's inside let's talk a bit
about the g s4 mini before we got our
hands on it
Samsung announced the GS 4 mini on May
30 and officially introduced it to the
world in plastic and silicon at the June
21 Dhin event we've already published a
quick and dirty comparison between the
Galaxy s4 mini and its original bigger
brother while we were in London so make
sure to follow us on all the usual
social media channels so that you know
exactly when a new video or review goes
live and of course as usual a big shout
out to our friends at club that code at
UK who supplied us with this review unit
and with that here's the box and while
we don't want to jump to comparisons
this is how it compares to the box of
the original Galaxy s4 they are
identical taking a closer look at the
outside of the carton we are greeted
with a color picture of the device
itself underneath which the galaxy s4
mini branding resides yes it's almost
the same as the one on the GS 4 there's
nothing really interesting going on on
the sides except more branding and the
back goes out some specs like the LTE
capabilities Super AMOLED screen a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core processor helped by
1.5 gigabytes of RAM as well as the
usual suspects including a 1900 milliamp
power battery opening the box reveals
the phone itself which we'll put to the
side just for a second the box itself
contains the usual literature as well as
a micro USB cable for syncing and
charging bundled headphones which are
always nice with some spare various
sized buds a UK plug and the battery
itself which is rated at 7.20 2 watt
hours which is exactly 1,900 milliamp
hours and now let's switch to the
special screen protector peeling cam
mode
boom quick harbour toward the front
holds the 4.3 inch qHD display with a
540 by 960 resolution there's the
earpiece on the top branding sensors a
1.9 megapixel webcam and there's the
home buttons plus capacitive buttons on
the bottom as usual 8 megapixel shooter
on the back with an LED flash and since
we're already here with the GS 4 this is
how they look compared side by side a
little bit of hyper glaze fingerprint
action going on there but let's add more
devices to the comparison we have the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 first and then
let's add the HTC One and let's add the
Nokia Lumia 925 and maybe the Apple
iPhone 5 and of course the GS 4 itself
once the battery door is removed we're
seeing the camera construction in micro
SIM slot micro SD card slot for
expanding the 8 gigabyte internal
storage and we'll insert the battery pop
back the cover and go for the first boot
yes this is hyper glaze - and has the
same texture as the one on the white GS
for a quick rundown of specs while it
boots up the GS for mini GT I 91 90
packs a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED display
with qHD resolution that's 960 by 540
and that is powered by 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core processor there's 1.5 gigs of
ram 8 gigs of internal storage of course
expandable 8 megapixel shooter 1.9
megapixel webcam Android 4.2.2 jelly
bean and the 1900 milliamp hour battery
in addition to Bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC and
all the others everyone that's gonna do
it for today for the Galaxy s4 mini
unboxing I have an Anthony nod you can
