expect for the new Nokia PureView and
all on video more case leaks of the
galaxy s 10 plus have emerged that shows
the device size in comparison to the s 9
plus and it looks like Sony is bringing
triple cameras and a very very tall
Xperia XE for I'm high metal Yvette a
happy New Year to everybody 2019 is
gonna be insane and we're looking
forward to it
this is PocketNow daily the official
loose today begin with deals the Samsung
Galaxy Note a continues to be one of
those phones that we highly recommend
and if you're in a market for a note
it's currently three hundred and sixty
dollars on Best Buy I know but there's a
catch you have to get it on Sprint and
you obviously have to get into the
installment plans that they have we're
either paying like $15 a month which is
not necessarily crazy you can learn more
the description now let's talk about
galaxy f we're not exactly sure when
we're getting this I mean we're already
packing up and getting ready to go to
CES but we don't expect to see anything
there the most important part is two
things one that it seems that developers
and Sami and Google are working together
on building apps that work for foldable
products and number two it seems that
we're getting triple cameras but in a
different array it seems that one of
these is gonna be for bouquet mode and
then the other is going to be an ultra
wide-angle which is great stay tuned now
let's talk about the Galaxy S ten as a
ice universe's now on a new YouTube
channel that's great and we see how
they're testing a case on different
devices like the Galaxy S 9 plus and the
Oppo find X where it seems that the
Galaxy S 10 is going to lie in the
middle so it's gonna bring the same
screen size but with a smaller footprint
and you know that's actually great I
love the Oppo find experts design so
that's gonna be great now let's move the
spotlight over to the Sony Xperia XZ 4
we don't have a timeline for this we're
assuming it's gonna be probably MWC but
we've got some leaked case for dead
screen protectors I believe and the most
important part is still no knotch it's a
21 by 9 aspect ratio display it seems
that there is a headphone jack on this
thing my god Sony thank you and most
important triple cameras so would it be
that finally
Sonne is going to bring us a really good
flagship that we'll see and finally the
hottest news today have to do with nokia
nokia welcome back one more time to the
hottest new segment we've got a full
video showing us the features to expect
on that Nokia 9p review and their hot
yes Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 six gigs of
ram we're not exactly sure on screen
resolution but the most important as we
get Android one with two years of
software updates guaranteed that's
fantastic but most important guess what
these five cameras at the back are going
to do it seems that the phone is going
to take pretty much multiple photos at
the same time using all lenses and
allowing you to have all the flexibility
to change bokeh after the fact to do
edits on your photography after the fact
like imagine that the whole concept of
having multiple lenses take the same
photo that would pretty much make any
camera look obsolete if you've got all
that versatility but let us know in the
comments down below I mean what would
you like these cameras to do do you
think that that's a good idea because
for me it would be great I mean if we're
using the new htif file system which no
that I believe you need a snapdragon 855
for that no that won't be the case but
you will have so much information on
each photo that you can do so many
things with it that would be me leave us
a comment down below we look to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us on par
now without comment subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one you can follow
me on Twitter Highlanders quarterly that
are on Instagram and heinously better
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I'm high memory
that I think so much for watching we
will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
