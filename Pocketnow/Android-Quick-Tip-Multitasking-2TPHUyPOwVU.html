an Android quick tip alright today we
actually have two quick tips then
they're both regarding multitasking now
in case you don't know multitasking is
the ability of an operating system to do
more than one thing at once for example
you could be reading your email while
you're on a phone call or surfing the
web while you're streaming Pandora now
Android has had this built in since the
very very early days but to be able to
swap between the apps you could either
go back home and launch it by tapping
from your home screen or the app drawer
but that's kind of cumbersome and it has
extra steps that you don't need to do to
quickly switch between running apps
press and hold the home button doing
that brings you your recently run apps
now most of the time you're going to
have two rows of three icons each so a
total of the last six run apps you can
see here I've got eight the reason for
that is I'm running CyanogenMod six
which has the default at eight but
here's another cool thing first of all
if I want to change between any of these
I just tap and I can easily switch to
that other app to switch back press and
hold home switch to another one really
easy with CyanogenMod I can do something
even cooler than that I can change the
number of these apps so to do that I'm
going to go back home
I'm going to tap the Menu button and go
to settings and from here you'll notice
a new option called CyanogenMod settings
we're going to tap on that go to input
settings because that's an input button
and then long press home settings kind
of cryptically named but when you think
about it I'm long pressing on the home
button so that makes sense we'll tap on
that we can show the title or not if we
want to save a little bit of space and
then over here the number of recent apps
right now it's set to eight that's the
default I can do 12 or I can even do 15
will do 15 just to show you and if I
wanted to I could override the default
havior with another app so if you want
bunk press home to always open your web
browser you could potentially do that
we're gonna leave that as is though and
then we're going to go back home and now
we're going to long press on the home
button and look at that you've got a
much larger grid of apps that I've
recently run now that's advantageous if
you are a heavy user and switch between
an awful lot of apps like I do but you
have to take into consideration that now
there are a lot more icons for you to
visually sort through to be able to
switch between apps so kind of judge
that playing around with it and see if
eight is faster for you to switch
between apps or maybe you want to
compromise between 8 and 15 and go with
12 so go ahead and give that a try for
pocket now and quick tips I am on Joe if
