weekly gutentag and welcome to the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discussed news and opinion from the
world of mobile technology I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at
pocketnow.com and i'm joined by managing
editor and temporary roommate anton d
Naja harami how old headless your colon
stimmt sprechen sie englisch schiessen
yeah ok yeah uh so listeners as you may
have noticed this episode is a little
different we don't have a third party on
the air with us it's just Tony and me
today we're recording actually in the
same room for the first time ever we're
sitting in the same room for the first
time and we started the show with the
German greeting poorly pronounced though
it was and there's a reason for this if
you've been following pocket now at all
during the past week or if you follow us
on Twitter which you should do or if you
follow the mobile industry in general
you probably know what it is Tony and I
are in Berlin yes we are it's awesome
and we're we're covering the annual
Aoife or IFA trade show which tends for
what Tony internationalis fukao still so
it didn't it's the exact thing we see as
a consumer electronic show but i think
the IFA stands for their appropriate
german words the acronym gosh yeah ok
I've you will always pronounce it better
than I will even though it's incomplete
that's it's in it yeah it's an event
that the big manufacturers attend to
make major announcements and unveil new
product and we've had no shortage of
those this time around so the thing is
once we what we have had a shortage of
oddly for a sec show a shortage of
internet connectivity it's been a
ridiculous enormous challenge trying to
stay connected this trip
you remember you and I talked about this
that may be carriers should improve
their coverage but you said maybe they
think this is a tech show and everybody
brings their own internet well guess
what we don't know still rely on you
carriers but do you keep on feeling it
actually was a little ridiculous cuz you
were you were playing the you were
defending the carriers I was like we're
waiting in line we're walking into the
the conference venue and I'm like oh
this is ridiculous I can't even check in
on foursquare because there's too much
you know there's too much traffic on the
network right antennas like well you
know it's hard no I know it's happening
we should be I shouldn't bring in a Cell
on wheels to the texture probably not
invest that much in improving the
coverage or the strengths of the signal
because it's a show which happens every
I don't know once a year and maybe they
think that for those five or six days it
is not worth it to invest even though it
should be because the message the Trade
Center is used for many shows right
exactly they should I feel like they
should have a cell on wheels or several
you know maybe a fleet of the but
whatever I we don't run a network this
is why we don't run a carrier right who
knows what you know we've had a great
adventure finding prepaid data solutions
that it was by the way prepaid data is
not is not cheap and it's not efficient
and it's not fast it's not fast no
there's nothing good about it and the
hotel even the hotel Wi-Fi has been
horrible hotel wifis are never good I
actually had one single exception which
was last year at mwc in Barcelona the
internet upload speeds were like 35 next
they were huge God what great our old
man back in the back in Honduras can
tell you that of course this year
staying at the same hotel internet
sucked so they probably realized that it
was too good to be true last year and
they just drop with frontal yeah and
it's kind of amazing listeners to watch
what happens on the as we deal with
different kinds of traffic here we'll
start uploading a YouTube video as you
have probably seen over the past week
we've had like 20 and the you know for
the first two minutes the uploads going
great and then something happens on the
network that's like you know stops yeah
there's some kind of bot working that's
like oh you're uploading a video you
wait all night
everyone else like on facebook can do
what they want and of course if you have
the time to start it again it's okay if
it stops one or two times when it stops
the 14th imma just starting your hair
yeah just really start parading angrily
through the streets of Berlin so anyway
that's that's why we're not being joined
by a third party in the podcast this why
we don't have Brandon or Joe or hi May
or anyone there's just not enough data
to support a call so on but you know
what it's all right we're it's the
roommate our on the Pocket net weekly
and we're going to talk about IFA and I
or Aoife and there was there was news
from elsewhere in the mobile world this
week like the world doesn't stop when a
trade show happens but there's we were
just talking about before we went on the
air like the prey the pace of trade
shows is so fast as I have found out
about this is my first one that you it's
very hard to realize that there is still
a world out there where stuff is
happening and so we're just going to
cover on this broadcast the special
special episode products that were
announced at Aoife and I'm that we got
our hands I'm so so jealous I have never
had the chance to attend an apple
keynote when when Steve Jobs was there I
wish I would have seen him I'll probably
okay let's not be pessimistic I will see
Tim Cook on stage but yeah we're getting
at is that Apple is not present at any
trade shows they make their own events
right and this is why we will probably
not cover iOS in this episode on the
podcast so if you're a die-hard iOS fans
still bear with us just to see what's
going on but if you just can't can't go
through the Android news then it is fair
for us to say click away but do tune
back in next week when we will have a
normal podcast unless you're just like
listening to our dulcet tones oh yeah
yeah with the with them we can do any
exit now we can even do German accent
mr. chairman and also if stay tuned and
if you hear the view here the
distinctive German police car siren out
our window it's because we have our
window open our hotel room is about the
size of the the sound booth I usually
record in
welcome to Europe no it's great so let's
let's hop in here we have a lot to talk
about there's a lot that has happened
and the first thing that we kind of the
smaller news so we'll hit that real
quick the is the Windows Phone news we
never do windows phone first so this is
kind of exciting yeah we want to just
get rid of it no no I'm kidding of
course I'm kidding unfortunately there
was no windows phone news that I have a
nun at least worth mentioning of but
there will be a special event coming up
actually this week then it's two days
away from now depending on how we can
upload this podcast so we're cool yeah I
the way on the third yeah so if you guys
see this going up on the fourth you'll
probably notice that we had some
problems with the internet so we were
expecting a nokia microsoft joined event
and there's about the speculations about
nokia devices and the Windows Phone
consumer-oriented features windows from
eight to be more specific there was none
such thing in at the IFA at the Eva the
it with the exception of the the atif
that's right yet which we did reach to
see it was a silent press release kind
of launch there was no phone available
at the show there was probably it
probably was available in the hands of
certain people but we are unfortunately
not yet among them right yeah so that
the here's the thing listeners the
device was not we did not see it the
this is the achieve s is what it's
called it's part of the achieve device
family from Samsung it's brand new and
what it looks like if you haven't
checked out we've got we've had a couple
stories on it I think we did we break
this one no somebody else but they think
that it was the verge if doors before a
special Samsung event yes yes yes it was
um so regardless it's it's a windows
phone 8 device it looks like it's
rocking a four point eight inch HD Super
AMOLED display resembles the galaxy yes
looks a lot like the galaxy s3 except
it's running Windows Phone 8 which is
pretty pretty hot for anybody who's
wanted some really intense windows phone
which was the other one which was the
galaxy s2 running windows phone was in
the focus the focus s yeah yeah because
the focus one was like the Galaxy S 4
windows on then the focus asked to the
galaxy s2 yeah so that's that's what
this thing looks like and we're kind of
looking at pictures of it right now and
it looks you know it looks like a
samsung phone exactly this rabbit's it's
another phone but what I really like
about it it's it's it's back yeah it's
just it's just nice it's interesting
we're talking about design we're talking
about looks and we're not talking about
the windows phone operating system
itself which is the big boom but we
don't know much about Windows Phone 8
because Microsoft wouldn't tell us the
world not how specifically so we're
looking forward to that nakia microsoft
event maybe we will see what they are up
to yeah we've had we've heard some some
leaks regarding that yeah the etfs I'm
looking forward to seeing but the really
cool thing is that what you kicked
started the segment off with with this
nokia 920 and na 20 yes there have been
some leaks for at least the nokia 920 is
a pure view branded device or is gone
maybe we I figures rawson yeah branded
device but what I've seen earlier today
I saw another leak indicating that maybe
that might be a an 8 megapixel sensor on
that instead of any kind of PureView
rated thing and that the PureView
branding will be will be attached
because they've they've come up with
some kind of image stabilization or some
something that'll make it better than a
normal camera hi i am not excited and
you know why it's not because i love
nokia i'm a fan of nokia design and
watching but just look at the 800 the
900 and even the predecessor the n9 they
had Carl Zeiss optics and the picture
quality's was just bad yeah I don't know
if it was the software I don't want to
blame windows phone because windows
phone is a neat little platform so and
again the focus took great took great
pics absolutely so if they don't do
PureView they need to come up with
something really huge to be on par with
at least android phones because
currently right now
on Windows Phone there's no phone which
can be on par with with current android
offerings not not to mention the iphone
4s which history it's on par with the
with the galaxy s we shouldn't forget
the just in a spec sheet way that the
HTC Titan to write which there's that
big a 16 matrix megapixels but still but
it's so much about what happened yeah I
know we should just throw it out there
but I by the way I understand listeners
that we are breaking our own rule and
we're only supposed to be talking about
Aoife stuff but this is kind of related
to the burl interest in a way because
the tony has been taking you may recall
that Tony is the one who reviewed the
nokia pureview 808 and I Tony's been
taking it all around Berlin as we've
kind of walked around we've done some
sightseeing and I have had occasion to
use for the first time in my life to
PureView 808 and inverse India and no no
I my Star Trek communicator phone and
run Simeon but it was one of the first
Symbian phones and but I just have
fallen in love with this 808 which I
sort of have expected to by the way
that's the mattress that we keep leaning
on so yeah sorry about the creaking but
the Iowa just I just adore it and I'm
sitting there with Tony yesterday we're
drinking coffee on the banks of the
river play the river spray con obsession
American the river spree and we I'm just
playing with his PureView and looking at
the footage that we got in the stills
and it's such a beautiful phone in a
hardware sense it's it proves his
beautiful images and I said my next
phone is going to be a windows phone 8
with with PureView technology and if
from Nokia and if they but if it
released this thing that it's really not
peer review if it's just pure view and
name i'm gonna be really really
disappointed you and many others meet
among them if i say this it's ok to have
mid-range phones and even enough
flagships necessary but high-end phones
on the market but if nakia really wants
to pull this off after one and a half
years and being close to anonymous I
mean don't get me wrong nokia is great
they wanted to do windows phone because
they didn't want to be an anonymous
android OEM they're kind of just one of
those windows phone OEM so there's
nothing special about okay designa side
he can't say that they are up two or
three or four notches right would it be
apps or not and the special nokia apps
and the design really isn't enough right
now as to the service that experience
but what really could book them ahead of
everybody else is a peer review
technology even if it's not going to be
a 41-megapixel humpbacked its back
because they don't want to do that but
go with a 1650 megapixel sensor do
instead of from eight pixels to one
super pixel just do from four pixels to
one super pixel and just deliver that
imaging quality for for our windows film
users they want nice pictures yet they
do and and we were up at the top of a
200 and something meter tower yesterday
indeed we were and you know Tony's
taking pictures out the window of Berlin
at altitude and you just I mean we
everybody knows this already I know this
isn't new news but like you take this
picture and you just zoom in and you can
you know yes lessly yeah and it's not
like you can look through people's
bedroom windows from 200 meters but it's
effectively like you could see a seagull
on their roof or a mouse on their roof
you know I mean it's incredible so
anyway it's that vs fanboys we are huge
fan but I mean oh you've made me a fan
boys but I don't worry I brought Tony a
an HP veer from the states so I'm
working on him from the dead the dead
OSN you don't have to work that hard I
love it I finally discovered the it's
bomb / HP devices now that they're dead
yeah I know yeah welcome welcome to 2009
yeah ok let's move on here we um we've
got we've got windows 8 to talk about I
love to top it thank you we do because
windows 8 was the big deal at this
year's Aoife especially personally for
me who's just and I'm just kind of
burned out on on Android tablets by and
large I don't want to say I'm burned out
on all them but I'm you know there are a
lot of Android tablets out there until
recently there have not been a lot of
Windows 8 tablets and now hope that's
changed it's a it's a new it's an
exciting platform bloody this yeah and
Microsoft is you know it betting its
future on it so I understand why it's a
big deal so certainly I think
the most visible announcement in this
domain came from Samsung with that at
Eve brand we were talking about before
which took us a while to learn how to
pronounce right and I've still don't
know if I'm doing it right deity of
smart PC and at Eve smart pc pro pro we
did hands on Zhaan all these by the way
guys just to let you know if you haven't
seen the videos you should check them
out so the difference the difference is
between these two tablets they're both
what are they 10.1 inch yes it's a
difference in resolution ok it's a
difference in processor power processing
processing power but design wise they
are pretty much the same except for the
fact that the pro is much much thicker
which you'd expect normally for from a
tablet which is addressing the brow
humor or businesses professional market
yes but overall I like the tablets and I
like the fluidity of Windows 8 I love
that Microsoft brought that battery
smoothness which which was their number
one main selling point on Windows Phone
7 they brought it to the desktop and of
course we should mention that the
desktop is just an app on Windows 8 all
right the Start screen yeah yeah exactly
it is but you know that's a very good
point and normally in the past you know
we would kind of subjectively evaluate a
new product based on how smooth it was
exactly when you picked it up like you
could pick up a low end android device
and be like odds jittery all over the
place and will bring redress right and
we'll talk about that in a second
actually but you can't do that with
windows with Windows Phone and Windows 8
plus devices I feel like they are all
buttery smooth no matter what they're
running on wood and even the Nokia is
610 which you reviewed was that was
smooth indeed and it was the first one
to come up with tango it had a very slow
processor but I did a comparison of that
phone with the LG optimus 7 which was
among the fastest windows phones out
there because it had super fast nand
memory but yeah windows film has what it
takes so it's the neverending reply of
fanboys when they are in a flame war
Windows Phone and yes windows phone
doesn't need quad core or ho
horsepower do deliver that smoothness
right and this is what they got right
and yeah and i agree with you i'm really
glad they ported that 222 windows to
windows 8 so we've messed around with
both of these I think the pro one the
most interesting part about the pro
edition for me was that it as a
full-size USB port which is part of the
reason for the thickness we were
speculating honest I don't understand it
barley it's not only the USB port which
is adding up bulk to the thickness of
the device probably there's something
else inside there but what if they went
with an adapter like from micro USB or
from something smaller and then
something better than something and just
make it tapered I mean holding a 1
centimeter thick brick in my hand it's
not fun it's not fun at all especially
if you have these super slim the devil
is like the Nexus 7 not to mention the
iPad ok a bit on the thick line but by
the way Michael tell me how does it feel
to use a stylus on a Windows operating
system oh yeah to I remember doing that
small buttons there when microsoft word
on tonight wow so yeah when you hop into
the regular desktop if you're not in the
Start screen environment you happen to
the to the regular sorry about the
traffic noise you happen to the regular
windows desktop and it's like you need
that stylist so bad but even with the
stylus with a screen at this resolution
if you're in Microsoft Word and you're
trying to bold some text you're using
some of those toolbar buttons up topics
just to just find a small arrow which
gives you the list of fonts right yeah
it's it's almost well it's not
impossible certainly but it's it's not
very fun and I understand why the Start
screen is gonna be so crucial to Windows
moving forward um and it has a girl
thing right nows and you're right make
them acute yeah and but it's cool
because Windows 8 is adaptable right
like you don't have to use it this way i
think the achieve and an achieve pro
both have the keyboard dock available
right plays all right they do you have
yeah and these you can plug them into a
keyboard dock and then you have you know
you've got both touched control and
physical key controls so pros and cons
of the keyboard of course there are no
doubt
it adds a huge speed and gives you
functionality and yeah it might give you
also extended battery power if it has a
battery pack which is constantly
charging your tablet right but then
again it will be like you will be
carrying a notebook it makes it like
it's carry handle but its bulk to it it
does whatever you may be just want to
hold the screen and that's it it has
nothing else with you but yeah it's good
to have that it gives you an option yeah
I think that's going to be the deciding
factor on whether ultrabooks or whatever
they're calling these hybrid
convertibles nah not conversable
convertibles animals is a term if I know
right that Microsoft uses for those of
their slates which either swing or have
that swivel which bux open the keyboard
I think this is just a just an accessory
and they can't call them transformers
because there's lots of buzz about men
right yeah let's go with an accessory
hybrid yeah yeah but high river went for
the UM yes anyway whatever you know they
were very visible the deity of brand is
anytime a big brand like samsung
launches a new kind of smaller sub brand
it's it's it can be big news i think at
eve is going to be definitely I think
they're gonna try and make it as big as
the galaxy brand has been for for
android so that wish they will succeed
me too or both of their sings
Microsoft's and Samsung's and ours ya
know agreed but it's not the only one
just because the most visible Sony had a
big event that Tony and I both attended
we saw they use the CEO of sony which
was good and speak which was awesome and
he was yep I had never seen speak before
and they pushed the Sony push their vaio
duo 11 and this one is this is the one
that we that we leaked what was your
first thought when you seen the either
leaks or the official presentation and
I'm specifically referring to the way
Sony is dealing with the swiveling out
of the keyboard yeah so listeners what
what the deal is of this vaio duo 11 is
it's another hybrid / you know not
convertible whatever where it's a tablet
and then it like the what was that HTC
smartphone that that did that HTC
yes 18t called it yeah that I come to it
was the Titan first tighten too yeah so
what happens is it slides just like that
phone it's a landscape slider that
slides and then you can pull the screen
up so that it resembles a laptop at a
very you know at an obtuse angle it sits
and and if affordance having the
keyboard attached it would look exactly
like the surface exactly it looks very
much like the surface what I what I
thought about this when I got my hands
on it I didn't think about it much when
we when we leaked it but I got my hands
on it after the Sony announcement and
it's certainly sorry it certainly seemed
to be very impressive it was going to
have it the wind taken out of its sales
in about eight hours for me but we'll
get to that in a second but I was like
okay that's cool that's innovative it
has this little kind of innovative hinge
that props it up back there and it feels
reasonably sturdy let me draw did you a
on you we will have lots of Windows 8
tablets too what do you think will be
the differentiator among OMS I mean they
will probably be many without a keyboard
money with a keyboard so keyboard will
just not consider that as a
differentiator but as nakia
differentiates with the drive and
services what would what would Sony
offer me to buy their windows 8 tablet
in the detriment of sand sand springs is
it only a brand recognition thing or
will the XR more or it better not just
be a brand right handed on thing because
I'll tell you sony you know in the
united states has meant less and less as
the years have gone on and certainly and
you know i think it's going to be hard
where I think we're seeing in Windows
Phone what we started to see in nor what
we've wanted to see for so long and
Android which is this kind of thing
we're like own okay the software is
going to be unique across I'm excuse me
the same across all the platforms and
the hardware is going to be the lone
differentiator of course on Android we
haven't seen that yet because OEMs keep
putting these really what I windows 8
and the tablets we I think we see two
general trends and they're not
specifically talking about RT with ARM
processors and windows full windows
equal in Turkish AMD
but I think Andy is in the game but we
are yet to see an AMD power windows 8
tablet so that's a no so how do you say
that Englishman separate the waters here
the waters and upskirt stir the waters
draw the line between fans of Intel
processors AMD processor yeah but that's
only like of like a one percent of the
market we'd like to see what we're
getting at slowly here is that would
like to see somebody anybody offering
something special besides build quality
besides something which will probably
end up as being standardized
specifications probably the same Windows
8 tablet from different manufacturers
will have closely similar specifications
they will not be able to juggle too much
with that but I want something specific
I want proprietary apps i want free apps
i want free offerings I want services I
want them to offer me something so that
as an incentive for me to buy their
tablets beyond the fact that they are
sony or samsung or whomever else and
whatever comes as a conclusion out of
this in terms of hardware specs and
build quality sure and i think that's a
question that's been asked in other
generations of products too but i was
too young when I was born my family was
buying desktop computers for example I
know the market is quite different in
mobile but it's in some ways it's also
very much the same you know I think my
family certainly shopped on price and as
a result we often suffer dinner in our
computering choices but you know not
always but so I grew up with and I
wonder if this will be the case because
I grew up with the compact brand which
HP purchase and but I was very loyal to
compact simply because I was familiar
with it any wonder how many of these
brands bank on that yeah and you know
what I hope I will never see and those
who purchased windows I was all about to
say windows phones with those who
purchase windows pcs know this when the
species usually come with the platform
and a ton of blood were like yes from
norton systems you guaranteed to mcafee
to every possible and impossible trial
and share your application and OEM can
think of i hope it will not be the case
with windows 8 meter mobile pcs / slate
/ tab and it started to happen and found
platforms as well and then
time it's a damn carriers but anyway
that's that's another matter entirely
but I agree the speaking of though there
are still differentiators here the acer
is another company that brought us some
hardware with the Iconia at the w510 and
the acer iconia w700 these are two once
again Windows Phone 8 tablets these ones
are a little different you know they
have this kind of the tablet build to
them but they are they're made of some
kind of polycarbonate the I don't want
to say they are polycarbonate because
I'm not sure if that's correct but they
definitely felt very different felt like
HTC One X in hand you did a little bit
or the PureView 808 accepted lighter and
they weren't and I meant to say this
about the samsung achieve they didn't
feel like a stretched out galaxy s3
which is not the last time i'll say that
on this podcast too because Samsung has
decided for their kind of like hardware
design that they want to go with this
really light feel in the hand with
really glossy plastic that is not what
this that suits excuse me acer device is
either one of these two five ten or the
seven if you check out the specs you
would get back to what we talked about a
couple of minutes ago there are two main
trends like for instance take screen
rest of the resolution this w 510 is a
slower tablet but it has the same
resolution as the Samsung atif smart PC
not the pro one so we'll see two trends
lower end and higher end probably
consumer and prosumer / business
orientation so I their standardizing the
specifications which I don't know
whether it's a requirement by Microsoft
or they're just going with what they
think the other guys are doing right and
as you'll see the w700 which is the
other one is on par with the smart pc
pro from samsung so it's yeah the higher
end range head-to-head which by the way
has a rather nice dock to it just do two
w700 yeah yeah then figure we didn't
manage to figure out exactly whether it
will be that useful to have that dock so
it's weird like it's it's like an
l-shaped dock ok it's it lays there on
the desk it's it Sarang
and you slide it in right you drop the
tablet into the lower rail and then
slide it to the left and lock it into
the upright rail and which contains what
a USB port USB port the charging port
and probably an audio out even just that
the tablets speakers are on the lower
garage yeah and this how should we call
it was doc yes this dock is cut out so
that the speakers the tablets own
speakers managed to get sound and sound
is directed towards you so sound doesn't
go down to the table but it comes right
like like from this you yeah it's like a
gutter runoff flat tube yeah the sound
like spills out of the speakers comes
down and gets rotated and blasted out
toward your face uh yeah that seemed
cool I was wondering if it was a demo
doc at first because it certainly
doesn't look really polished enough to
be able to literally it will be an
optional accessory yeah people who
manage to decide whether they buy that
or not exactly yeah but in terms of
usability and fluidity we don't even
need to mention this I think we'll see
this a couple of times but then we'll
stop mentioning it yeah they all perform
the same they do and they perform well
so don't get me wrong they're fluid
they're almost instant is what you'd
expect from from software and hardware
to work together nowadays yes and and
it's not like we have any occasion to
run any benchmarks or any of that kind
of stuff by there but in a UI which for
me is one of the most important aspects
of a device yeah all the windows it with
its we great quick grant to of course I
remember back in the day and already
talking like an old guy when we attended
shows device is on display were not
locked into a demo mode you could go to
the Google store or to a marketplace and
by a benchmark application and fungal
and play with the settings and do
side-by-side comparison nowaday you pick
up a tablet you can go into settings you
can probably launch an application or
two but they are locked in demo mode so
it's it's something which yeah I don't
think it's good because of course this
was a consumer show so probably it was
to avoid people messing the tablet not
running up thousands of dollars in app
purchase bill what
we have hands-on with either an Android
tablet or android phone which will be
coming up later and I think this is re
transitioning towards Android no no no I
finish my Ryan please do I want to run a
benchmark I want to see how it goes
aside from just launching the email
application simultaneously on two
devices right which is entrant but this
is sorry windows folks is was this was a
rent which don't have to be more angry
directed then and I would have totally
let you run with it but there's
something very important that I that I
have to use to close up windows windows
8 we toshiba was not toshiba and yeah
what did I say toshiba yeah my old
roommate is to say I don't know why I
pick that up just now spend a week in
Germany folks here but your
pronunciation will get all crazy know
what was their story if the shiba had a
windows 8 oh right convertible it
doesn't have a detachable keyboard and
if you guys ever tell him why we're not
we're not coming on this the sony tablet
s is that no this wasn't that the which
one was that the so many devices
lieutenant it was the sony vaio duo 11
the one which resembles the surface that
doesn't have a necessarily a detachable
keyboard but we covered it because it
resembles too much of the surface with
that angling of the screen but brocade
get to the back to the topic if you guys
remember Brandon minimun are in chief
posted something on pocket now regarding
our policy of running with windows 8 rib
and Windows RT coverage the
differentiating factor whether we the
deciding factor on whether we cover a
tablet or not is that whether it has a
detachable keyboard or not if it has a
vegetable keyboard you can just grab the
screen part the tablet itself then we'll
cover it if it's screwed too with screws
to the clicky border the keyboard itself
or it swivels if it is not detachable
we'll just treat it as a laptop /
netbook / ultrabook / / / which is not
ours
sorry just a heads up for you guys so
that's why we didn't we spent some time
looking at that from Toshiba i think but
we didn't functionality wise yeah i can
tell you that much it's quality is as
what you'd expect from toshiba probably
the price point will be as what you'd
expect from toshiba super high it runs
smooth it has a great screen but we
didn't do a hands-on because what we
just rattled you so we but it's not the
last time if your toshiba fan don't wear
it will mention them again I know what
you can't wait to get you know I can't
wait I'm so jet bringing hills all right
so here's what happened so with Tony and
I had this big day at the press
conference at the trade show and Tony
wasn't feeling well I mean we were both
being blessed you're completely
exhausted and tony was like I don't I
really don't feel good so he had to go
home I was like okay I'm gonna go to
this event there are some of the events
of these trade show listeners and some
of them some of them occur after hours
and some of them are event you want to
go every day too and some of them are
events you want to go every year to
right here right so this one I was like
yeah I'll go I know yeah stay home you
know it'll be fine I'll go and I'll
cover it and I didn't expect there to be
much of anything I expect there to be a
bunch of accessories and because let's
mention that we had not the pleasant
surprise with a previous event right now
he said it's anything like that was okay
when we were all amped cuz we're though
we're gonna see some really really hot
stuff and then it turned out to be a lot
of you know cool accessories but you
don't go to chose necessarily to see
accessories right so maybe that's not
true but we don't anyway so point is I
went didn't have a camera with me just
had myself and I thought I would just
meet some people and hang out and I did
and it was a lot of fun and I saw the HP
table there and HP and I of course have
nothing personal against each other HP
certainly doesn't doesn't think about me
but um you know what you do thinking
once in a while and you know with holy
webos debacle I mean there was some some
bad blood on my end there until I
started working for pocket now and I
kind of had to become unbiased and I've
been working hard at doing that I just
wrote a piece about that today so I
didn't want to stop by the table but I
was like
you know it's HP I should go I should go
stop and see what they've got and I see
a table that's decked out with a bunch
of laptops and you know notebooks I'm
like okay whatever I'm gonna walk away
thank you guys and but I see this one
out of the corner of my eye that looks
too small to be a laptop it something's
different about it and it looks like a
macbook air 11 i will say that that's
what it looked like to me and I was like
well what's that and of blanking on his
name like an idiot the HP Envy x2 yes
the HP Envy it's like at least for me
but yeah it's the X to the envy x2
that's what the what the product name
would the product llegan was it really
said it resembles the macbook air but to
imagine the macbook air with much much
rounded corner still the same chiclet
keyboard that i should mention it was
yest thing i noticed about the tablet I
said hey Michael look at this HP using
Apple's keyboard so exactly yeah that
was the first thing you said when I
start of a joke aside yeah I like it but
you're what happened was um one of the
friendly guys at HP was showing me this
thing and he be pulled the screen off
the off the thing okay he pulled the
screen off of the keyboard dock and I
didn't think that was possible and kind
of blew my mind because the thing looked
so good together it looked like a really
well-built small ultrabook and he pulls
the screen off and it becomes this
tablet that looks great also standing
alone you just looking at the tablet
you'd never know that it plugged into
the dock and that itself is not
necessarily unique but the build quality
overall this thing is made of aluminum
the doc is aluminum the tablet is
aluminum it's got this it's 19
millimeters thick when it's when it's
closed you know as a as an integrated
unit but the the tablet I mean when it's
connected and when it's connected yes
closed yeah when it's connected and the
lid is closed and and it's eight point
five millimeters thick as a tablet so
it's very thin its tapered at the edges
it feels amazing in the hand and all of
a sudden it runs windows 8 I mean we're
still in the windows 8 second so it 11.6
inch display is a 400 nits panel so it's
really really bright there are two
full-size USB connections in the
there's a theirs ports on the tablet
there's microSD expansion on the tablet
and full SD on the on the dock there's a
touchpad with them with gesture
recognition on it it's basically I you
know you can read the specs but I've
written about this enough already it's
only been a couple days but I'm so in
love with this device and I basically
told Tony I could when I came back I was
like there's I kept waiting for the
other shoe to drop I kept waiting for
there to be something I didn't like
about it and the more the HP guys talked
the more I liked it and so this was
announced just couple days ago I had no
camera on me so I had to shoot the
hands-on video with a HTC One X I really
should have brought the PureView like
Tony suggested I do but at any rate we
captured the video HP was so nice to me
to come out in the hallway there and
kind of you know just show me this thing
for five minutes and they were really
wonderful so we don't think we kind of
don't know is released we know this is
coming later in the year and pricing
pricing is gonna make or break this
might be on par with others unless they
sell it as an ultrabook you know yeah
and this in case HP really wants to be
somebody in the windows 8 oh I necklace
yeah it if that was my position today I
was like wow this could really be HP's
play to like contend with surface
because surface is gonna just wreck I
mean you know it's gonna disrupt at
least the this the third party
manufacturer ecosystem of course but it
will also depend on whether the screen
will be as good as the screen on the X 0
en made tablet in it doesn't always
necessarily come down to the price the
Nexus 7 I have a nexus 7 and we're
transitioning that's why I'm yeah now
you're talking about Android I have a
nexus 7 finally Michael brought me one
from the states i confiscated it it's a
great tablet it's a cheap tablet but the
screen on that thing is just terrible it
basically doesn't have a read it has
something which is undefined between
pink and magenta or my eyes are not
good any more than 150 years of age but
its rise or not what you're trying to
say here that Microsoft could be
successful with the surface beyond the
price point if they included and i think
the the hardware department and inside
microsoft always did a good job so i
don't think it will be bad the question
is how much better all the other tablets
and offerings be right and that's the
window it way they were going to be
somewhat it's more expensive how much
better will that be to justify the price
difference and I think that's yeah and
that's that's that's a solid point and
that that's why I was so so impressed by
this by this excellent excellent build
quality but in just a short thought did
you wrap up windows yeah aight i love
what they did I love what Microsoft is
showing and i definitely look forward to
having many of these devices on the
market and this is a small insert brent
here hope not too many because the
diversity is always good I just hope
will not see a flood of windows
8-powered slates tablets just like we
see a truckload of Android phones from a
truckload of OEMs yeah probably quantity
will kill somewhat quality I know the
top dogs will still remain yeah the
cream will rise to the top yes yeah but
but I agree yet I mean and speaking of a
flood of Android devices we saw our
share of it obviously but it is
predictably I mean of course there's
gonna be a huge number of these in any
trade show but the biggest among these
the most anticipated the one I am
already tired of talking about not
really the Galaxy Note 2 what a weird
thing not the note to itself but the
whole galaxy note concept yeah yeah
concept i mean the initial note comes
out we in the tech media a lot of us
certainly kind of like look at it and
it's like okay we highly motivated right
we will see hated yeah
exactly and either love it or hate it
everyone had a degree of kind of like
Rick really this is what you're okay and
then it goes on and sells like way more
than anybody expected boom you know and
it's like okay there's a market for this
people really want this this big thing
that we've come to call a phablet right
which initially was a derogatory term
and then became not one as it became
successful so anyway the Galaxy Note 2
is highly anticipated I don't think it
was a secret from anyone that this thing
was going to be announced everyone
expected this thing to be announced and
then it was announced and we got our
hands on it and you know I I don't know
really what to what to say it's a galaxy
note that's you know bigger yet smaller
in the right it has a bigger display but
the casing size is actually a little bit
more manageable and strangely the bezel
is not that thin as you'd expect so yes
still comfortably hold it well not
touching accidentally on the screen is
silly yes yeah exactly and the s pen has
been redesigned in the with a different
tip so that writing on the glass screen
isn't quite as slippery feels it
supposedly feels a little more like
ballpoint pen on paper I didn't really
find that but I didn't have too much
time with it on our various visits we
were testing out features more than that
the most striking thing to me was that
they've changed their design language
which we should have expected to
coincide with the galaxy s3 and you know
I'm it's that's not it's not my favorite
hardware so I didn't really like the
change all that much I liked it better
than the original note which I found to
be very yes blocky and clunky and i
agree with you yet what I what I want to
ask you is it you handled it more than I
did yeah if you get the same slimy slimy
feeling of its back like it's going to
slip from your hand or from your table
even if you blow on it kind of feels
exactly like the same back it has the
galaxy s3 yeah yeah with that I think
there's hyper glaze on it I don't know
that's not yeah just confirm only some
love it some don't but if you have
either greasy hands or just normal usage
it becomes so slippery and don't forget
guys this thing is bigger much bigger
than the S
so if you had problems holding the s3 or
holding onto the s3 you will have even
more nails with this point it's not the
one for you if that's the case and we
did a little comparison video between
the s3 and the note 2 which was fun I
usually you know comparison videos can
be hit or miss for me but I think we we
found some fun stuff to talk about with
it one thing there's a lot that I
actually do like about that I want to
sound like I'm dogging this unit because
I do like it there's a 3100 milliamp
hour battery in this thing and it should
be yeah with that screen it should be
yeah i mean the original note had a 2500
milliamp hour battery though right so
it's still the life was good and so
better yeah it's got the new TouchWiz
nature UX with a couple improvements to
the camera in there there's this cool
thing called air view or if you hold
your stylus over the screen yeah you
hover the stylus over the screen without
contacting the screen you can see a
little a little dot a little cursor
where the phone knows the stylus is so
just practically speaking in daily use
you can see you know that's convenient
but also they've implemented in an
interesting ways like in the video
player where you can go down to the
scrubber and hold the stylus over the
bar the progress bar yes and without
advancing the video the video continues
that its normal rate but you can see
preview windows of what's coming up so
there's little implementations like that
that are cool you can hover over the
calendar and see your daily appointments
without clicking on it and let's not
forget this is running jelly bean and IL
so let's not forget that together with
the galaxy s3 the Galaxy Note 2 are
currently the fastest android phones
money can buy on this planet yes it has
a super fast quad-core Exynos processor
there's not a ton of RAM I wouldn't say
that it's necessarily faster than the
galaxy s3 even though the s3 is yet to
receive the highly anticipated jelly
bean update we were probably expecting
expecting that you have you here there
were leaks that it will go down on the
twenty-ninth it didn't not to our
knowledge we're still expecting it but
still either one of these two if you
don't like the phablet experience go
with the s3 it's a super fast film if
you want the stylus
the huge screen and you want to be cool
because I think know having a pebble
this is cool it's depending on the
circles you traveling right yeah yeah
it's an depending on how big your hands
are these and that's always the case
with any any fat so you can you can
wholeheartedly by any one of these you
will not be disappointed yeah and I
think we're probably expecting well
we're kind of rampantly speculating
we're pretty much expecting this to drop
an announcement to be made on this in
the in the coming coupled in the next
couple days right for us yes at least
that's what we think it will be yeah
right anyways I just I just hope how
circling back a little bit to the
specifications do you think that they
will cut down the X you know squad core
to a snapdragon just to get LTE like
they did with the s2 or will they
probably include a chip to offer both
walk or an LD that will be the perfect
solution but somehow I think you guys in
the States will still get the dual core
processor with the with LT functionality
even though I hope this is not going to
be the case I think that'll be the case
too unless that what is that the s4 pro
is ready yeah but we by the way we
expected that from LG with the optimus G
that yeah nowhere to be found right so
yeah and I don't think Samsung will ever
ever go with the third party ccp
interpreter in fact they have the racks
another season of the x nose is great
right they just need to figure it out
how to have the best of both worlds
being one the quad core speed that they
won of course you're healthy babies and
I tell you what I will go on record is
still saying right now in late 2012 that
you give me dual-core with LTE anytime
I'd I cannot sacrifice LTE connectivity
and living in the United States having
having had it now that you've seen the
past interesting Germany oh dear God
yeah having dealt with with this
supposedly fast HSPA over here but no I
mean these are special circumstances I'm
not but but really I LTE is so critical
especially the carriers in the stage now
who are so overloaded on their 3g
networks that it's not even funny with
the exception of two you know t-mobile
who has plenty of spectrum i think but
so yeah no I think we'll definitely see
a dual-core CPU with it with LT it'll
probably the quality and
the Snapdragon s4 yeah let me see
everywhere but yeah there know and it'll
run fine it'll do you know the galaxy s
three runs fine on it right all you're
eating is fast jellybean is really fast
it's you know it's tech yeah I've gotta
stay glued to pocket now we'll cover it
as news and we're expecting to receive
reviewing it of the note too soon you
have lots of comparisons with everything
interesting so i'll have it all their
yeah it's just yeah moving past samsung
the entire experience was refreshed by
sony at that same Sony event this was
very confusing okay guys you know this
if you've watched our hands on we
actually shot another hands-on video
that didn't even go up what happened at
the Sony event was this we ran from the
Sony CEOs announcement to the to the
show floor s what usually happens at
announcement exactly and but we were up
front I mean we were like some of the
first guys to get her hands on the dolly
which was great I loved at the same bull
which by the way which was ridiculous
cuz I had a microphone tied to my shirt
and then who Tony is like trailing
behind me with the camera and the cord
like we're a single unit anyway but the
reps the sales reps on the floor had a
bunch of these cards these around their
necks a stat card yeah just like
business cards stuck together with
specifications for every phone allowance
but every I think every every so people
in history so yeah exactly so 268 I know
so I like it I think maybe the sum of
the reps we talked to who were all
wonderfully friendly and really really
awesome and super like would help us out
got a little confused we got some wrong
information from some of them and since
the phones had just been announced we
kind of weren't examining them terribly
closely on the initial hands on and
let's not forget that they look alike
those keynote didn't necessarily include
specification no it doesn't and and the
in the phones look very similar yeah and
especially original through a hand
letters I mean the yeah yeah and this
confusing namings like it's like the
Xperia T the V the J it's like ok it's
like I can't even keep the One X and the
1v and the one you know yeah
has history the notorious oh it's they
should call it not the Xperia but sony
alpha but a sony alpha yeah that's true
yeah so anyway the point is we got some
miss title videos up we had did hands-on
zuv different phones that weren't the
phones we thought they were and then we
got specs messed up so sorry about that
even if you look at the phones they look
the same they just want saying I mean
they're all rectangles but some of them
you know whatever you can you can
actually check out the specs add pocket
now but the one of the cool ones was the
was the the waterproof one yeah because
there's the T was kind of the flagship
model of the TX was and then the tea was
the German specific one or maybe that's
vice versa and one of them was was was
was immersive oh and to see a smartphone
that is a merciful is one thing usually
they're really rugged eyes on the dirt a
goalie bricks up to 10 meters yeah
that's what they told us up to 10 meters
is that of course you will never go if
you're saying yes Cooper I just give
them into 10 meters in here yeah but I
actually don't know I'm so reluctant
after that giant mess of a speck problem
that we have to even talk about these
things no we have to we have a saying
here it would give the Caesar what's the
Caesars so yeah let's say that Sony
phones are good I mean the Xperia line
was good at mwc to where Sony failed was
too quickly act on updates and of course
my net will disagree with me because his
specific review unit cracked one week
after normal usage but so probably I
hope it was just one unit of the
millions but the phones look what you'd
expect the sony phone to look and the
sony specific UI is as you'd expect it
to be with their live wallpapers it's
nothing out of the ordinary and this is
what i'm trying to say it's not it's not
like jaw-dropping is just another
android phone and that's it and I mean
how long has that been the case because
you have to talk about the Sony stuff
right because I don't didn't don't
misinterpret me but I like speaking as
the average American I feel like
I don't care cuz sony has failed so hard
at making a name for itself in the
mobile space in the United States yes
true but still sony phones have great
camera quality something which other
androids not to point now out one or the
other didn't manage to quite achieved so
they have said they're great point let's
not forget so he's a huge company
they're offering massive yeah also
services like music services proprietary
services they have the record label so
they have the power to do something it's
just that they're probably right now
going in a there in the valley just like
HTC was nice but their Valley I feel
like HTC's Valley is a different shape
right we're like Sony's Valley has been
this long intense david hasn't even been
a decline in like this is there one
let's be fair and see it's a steady
climb is it it's a steady climb yeah I
don't know all right we'll see about
that I don't hate sony it's just that
I've never ever been impressed by any of
their smartphones that have been widely
available probably let's not forget that
there and most of them are Asian
companies yes but they're specifically
Japanese Sahni yeah if I recall this
well and if I didn't don't bring me hate
mail but no what I want to say is that
there's a difference in design language
and perception and it's one thing to be
used you guys in the US with a motorola
design language or the specific HTC for
the USA design language and it's another
thing to have a sony japanese phone for
asia and europe it's just normal that
you guys don't like it that much but I
don't have anything negative to say
about Sony and except for the fact that
we want more and we want better yeah and
that's it I think they stand a chance
here's the thing I I just think I the
only thing I'll say is that I think sony
has this really really long and proud
legacy of making amazing products and
they were one of the companies that
inspired Steve Jobs when he was about
building Apple products you know so I
mean I have great respect for the
company's just in the mobile space I've
just never been wowed so they
they look yet ya know that I hope they
do bus will be a favorite yeah the next
the the company that I feel has gotten
it really right in at least one respect
and people already disagree with me
about this on Twitter so I mean yeah no
absolutely not everybody agrees the is
HTC and I love what they're doing with
the one line I love what they're doing
with their new design language on their
new products and that applies to the
desire x we saw the desire x announced
and then choline photo code name to the
proto yes as we knew it as we knew it as
the much cooler sounding proto but now
it's the desire x lols do name prototype
cares I know photo would have been so
much I would have carried probably
carried a phone named proto anyway HTC a
kind of announced this quietly it was on
display we did a hands-on on it it's a
mid-range phones got a 1 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 it's got a 4
inch Super LCD wvga resolution by the
way diesel car outside 5 megapixel back
camera 4 gigs of internal storage right
blah blah blah ice cream sandwich sense
for that oh it's a mid-range phone and
that's all it and that's all it is but
you look at the casing of this thing and
it's like somebody took it's like
somebody named HTC took the One X and
like narrowed it down and slimmed it by
about you know two three one third so
it's about two-thirds the size and kind
of tweaked the design language even
further to make it even a little more
bold the lens you know the camera lens
is big and oversized yeah and there's a
cool yeah there's some cool color
options there's a metal bezel around the
around the screen which is black it's a
and this is going to come down to a
matter taste and I'll just shut up
because I'm just being a fanboy about it
like it's I think it's a beautiful
little device and of course its
mid-range and it runs sense which
probably means it's laggy I think we
noticed a little bit of evidence on that
under a demo unit probably not final
software telling it to true there's no
it's too early we're not this is not a
review or everybody just was playing
with a whole team demo units abused
right but in any case it's a mid-range
phone we're not expecting huge
performance out of it but I would be
proud to carry it for a little bit just
on the hardware
along the casing I really love it so not
to disappoint one hot and one cold
Samsung and HTC are the leading OEMs
when it comes to android and because of
their release cycles they leap from HTC
One X and the one line in general was
announced at mwc in Barcelona in
February that was a good lineup it was
quad-core phone then then came the
galaxy s3 at the end of May and
immediately the samsung phone took the
first pot as in the hottest phone the
fastest phone now I expected it to to be
that but I also expected to see HTC's
next leap frog since they are in
encounter time it was HTC's time to move
maybe with the highly anticipated and
leaked HTC one x+ which never saw a
latter day at least not here I expected
HTC to reply to respond but no they did
not they brought out a desire x and what
did samsung do damn galaxy note is a
note to two steps in endgame yeah so I
really not sure what what HTC is waiting
for their bubbly waiting a little
wishful thinking here waiting a little
bit for for the year to pass and they'll
probably just drop us something drop
something on us before the holiday
season if they don't this year there's
going to be no other events major events
and if they wait until MVC 2012-2013
it's going to be bad before them so I'm
just hoping to see something coming out
of HTC which will at least now reduce
the the gap between Samsung and HTC to
only one leap frog part of me wonders if
that was the plan if the plan was that
HTC had this 2011 this thing where they
did this taiwanese thing which i
understand is a taiwanese kind of a
business lucama commonality to like oh
we had some success now we're going to
flood the market with it with a bunch of
different variations on models and then
they realized that was a mistake pulled
back and then i wonder if the strategy
was we're going to do this
one line I'm going to do an improvement
on it every year like like say Apple
does and with moderate improvements in
the interim and I wonder if that was the
plan so let's not forget HTC had like
four phones last year at IFA they only
had this small tiny booth which was like
I'm gonna try to be a play smart here as
here no feet yeah it was like a 50
square feet I like 20 square meters
something like that small small smells
like a it was like a teenager's bedroom
3 demo units of course they they are
pushing the beats by dr. dre brand every
phone had headphones attached but that's
it one phone and I expected something
more from HTC and I have nothing against
them they do a great job but bring us
more I I'm a little impatient for more
of myself and we'll see what their what
their thing is but however who had more
what did ya is your game you know who
always have you know who did the
opposite thing another company name
starts with an age but is a silent age
is Huawei from China and it's not huawei
because i seen lots of common no this is
not the US company guys it's not huawei
it's Huawei but it's but it's or 18 I
don't think it's I don't know the HS
there guys this is different with shiny
speaking listener if there is a
chinese-speaking listing service
actually love to hear that yeah audio
file please yeah that we that would be
awesome at podcast at pocketnow.com you
should send it please or tweet it to us
and listen to the info at the end of the
podcast that is a really good idea
because I we got to put this to bed once
and for all at least yeah yeah so anyway
the company in question had a huge
display at at Aoife I think it dwarfed
besides Samsung who had a whole like
gymnasium it dwarfed pretty much any way
any other OEM 5 x is bigger than HTC
probably eight times as big yeah so like
you're walking through the the trade
floor and there's this big white like
flower like structure and enlarged Bay's
of demo phones behind it and a bunch of
wonderful PR people walking around would
smartly dressed everyone very friendly
and very helpful and under this giant
sort of fiberglass white flower were
some new devices and I think what there
were three for this tuesday I've let two
phones the mediapad 10 fhd yeah I've got
seven light and the phones the Essen
they were both in the g series which
recently learned that the g series is a
mid-range series and the beat is the
high end right because good good years
gold p is platinum yes hello Janie the g
six hundred and the g 3 30 plus the
update you can talk about this you
reviewed the phone that the p1 the
update for the new emotion UI yeah so
they want to get this right out of the
way the phones are unremarkable yeah
unfortunately yeah yeah yeah they're
mid-range phones the ascend branded as
jess g like you said gee 630 they're not
really worth discussing i don't think
there's there's enough there no they're
just iterative improvements on existing
find it's what ZTE does and they were
not here this year uh-huh it was what
it's the same thing ZTE does it's the
seven is the seventh it's the second
manufacturer and they go like like
head-to-head but they were missing here
it's the same thing they always bring an
army of mediocre towards right low-end
phones flooding the market with yet we
made this so anyway um the interesting
thing the only interesting thing in the
phone department from huawei huawei is
was this skin that they built for the p1
and we had michael from Huawei show us
to getting i'll give us a walkthrough of
this new UI which they're calling i
always mess it up and I messed it up in
the in this video too it's not
imagination you I it's emotion UI
emotion you that's probably my fault
because we had a
lapsus both of us and everything is it
the moat is it the imagination he's a
shirt and the cortex seriously we're
cutting the video together listeners
after the after the fact and I'm writing
the shell post for it and I'm like isn't
it your imagination you I write in terms
like no emotion okay two minutes later
Mike is it a motion or imagination so
anyway that's the story behind that's
the story the emotion UI always seemed
do it seems to have built for users who
are confounded by the Android experience
who who don't like the complicated
nature of it but you know quote unquote
complicated nature of Android so they've
built this skin where they've basically
eliminated the the Apple on yeah so you
can have as many home screens as you
want and these big friendly-looking
bubble icons and little folders and
stuff but you have no app launcher which
is a little weird to me because I kind
of always considered the app launcher to
be the simplest part of Andhra right so
I don't I kind of don't know where
they're going with this but Michael was
really cool about about telling us about
it because he was telling us that the
that were always intent when they built
this was to say all right we're gonna
try this we're gonna try and simplify
Android but we're gonna pay really close
attention to what the users are telling
us yep and if if the users tell us that
this is not something they want whatever
we will just you know cut it out and of
course any company you know big hit
tries to behave that way but he was
really upfront about he's like yeah I
mean this is basically you know and he
basically said this is a test if you
guys haven't seen the video please do so
our youtube channel youtube / e 2.com /
pocketnow video but if you can't right
now i'm sure you've seen em I you I or
me we or we call it however you want
this is thing looks exactly like that
with the round icons and and it is move
and don't get me wrong it is not sure
that it is something that I would
personally want to run on my androids
bumble it's a matter of taste it is so
that's nothing and of course there's
this included application which is a
tutorial that teaches you how to do
stuff like Android users were morons no
we r power users you guys are power
users and you tweak you flash you do
stuff with your phone which a normal Joe
would necessarily not even dream about
doing so I'm not sure what what the
thing is there but yeah that's suave or
here or where is the thumbs and the
tablets are also on the mediocre end o
the chat we yeah there was something
else I wanted to say what is you I but I
really go on I forgot I was it yet don't
fight in the well fight all you want in
the comments about how it's how it is or
is not a ripoff of miui i don't i don't
know it'll be interesting to see where
it goes yeah but the tablets like you
were saying follow following the vein
this is this is the first iteration
right off the emotion UI so I'm just
like yeah that's slow 3d sense one point
oh right yes to see where this goes with
version 2 or version free me too cuz
molly is not going away they're really
really maybe locally according it to our
Samsung devices or HTC's be careful um
yeah the huawei mediapad we won't talk
about android tablets is the last kind
of topic of discussion and as we
mentioned huawei had brought their
mediapad 10 fhd mediapad 10 fhd and
mediapad 7 light there was no mediapad 7
like pro so I don't know why the light
was there but this is this one has no
sugar right yeah this is a diet yeah so
these are what they sound like they're a
10 inch tablet in a 7-inch tablet yeah
and our experience with the with the
first one the 10-inch one was
interesting and it resembles whatever I
went through last year ethos Michael
about the experience when the
non-functioning tablet this year and I
will tell you about my story from all
right so our first day we roll up to the
huawei booth and we'll go to this tablet
uh wow you guys have a 10-inch you know
what's going on here and they brought it
out and we're very friendly and very
apologetic but they said they didn't
have power we'd have to look at the
hardware only and that was the same
and that was so that's when we did the
hands on it was like oh okay well
hopefully they'll get it fixed and it
happened with me too in last year in the
think either IFA or mwc i'm not sure
where but same company tablet
non-functioning one i know lots of
things happen at trade shows but guys
don't bring one tablet with you to the
show floor bring at least five or six
whenever somebody messes the settings up
or the battery dies or the cable just
gets cut our bills ice cream on it yeah
just you have another one yeah and then
they move to their credit when we came
back a day later they had not only that
one fixed but they also had other one
that on display so that you know they
fixed it but yeah that day one that was
a real disappointment but but the tablet
itself like holding that thing up and
you can see me waving it around in the
hands on like it's a piece of like it's
a legal pad it's all that thing when you
your home and yeah it's like a hand fan
yeah but yeah there's a fancy name for I
can't think it's so light um in most
tablets when they're when they're that
light they feel really cheap in that
they're flexible like the deity of you
can kind of knock your knock your
knuckles on and it sounds like a hollow
space behind there it doesn't feel very
very high end but this one was solid it
was just too light it felt solid but it
was too late to feel and like anything
but cheap like it was like a pad of
paper so um but don't get your hopes up
guys this is waiting for something to
launch on the tablet yeah is is
something that it's laggy probably
probably it's not we always say this
Instagram feed on the final software or
sprung enough final hardware or movie
was running 5500 applications in the
background but the way we experienced it
is that yeah it is lagging it is it
sounds like is the seven the seven is
really the seventh does that was was
kind of a disaster but saw it on the
software side but yeah the 10 yeah
that's the tennis yeah
that's the story of the huawei tablets
may be there maybe i don't know maybe we
won't we'll see how they have that goes
the moving on a tablet that wasn't quite
quite so underwhelming sony has revised
their tablet s they're sort of folded
magazine tablet there they're weird form
factor experiment it was was the P no
that was the well the P was yeah that
but the the the original s had the
folding oh yeah yeah the tapered yeah
yeah it's like listeners if you're not
familiar with it it's is if you pulled a
magazine open and then folded the front
cover around back and you know how you
get that hump where the spine is a sony
built this into their tablet i never
thought it looked very good but i was
like good you know I appreciate new form
factors all right cool yeah so what
they've done they've rebranded it as an
xperia tablet and redesigned it slightly
so that that curve is still present it
suggests the initial design intent but
it is much slimmer and it makes it it
makes for a more streamlined device it's
still kind of awkward it's still a
little weird but it's comfortable to
hold and the really cool thing about it
is that it is it's the exposure proof
yeah sony had this really cool display
at their event where they had this yeah
well they had this like 90 degree cut
out of a circular display table where
the sprinkler hit sprinklers were
mounted above the devices that were
sitting there and one of them was this
Xperia Tablet S just getting rained on
and water is just shooting down this
thing and it's not this it's not a big
bulky rubberized construction tablet
like it's really thin and nice it's just
getting soaked but it didn't care that
was really cool and I can't wait to see
more of that from others what I'm more
amped about is that they the inclusion
itself of a tablet in the Xperia line
means for Sony exactly what the
inclusion of the assumes nexus 7 means
for Google and for the Nexus brand I
mean they will probably treat this
tablet along with their other Xperia
phones there sometimes excellent
sometimes a little bit behind with the
with software but it is an xperia tablet
and a fish
Xperia Tablet S yeah that's pretty much
it as a functionality goes the party is
good as you'd expect it functional
device it's not the fastest tablet out
there but it show me against the job
done and it's it's it's innovative to
like it's got this guest mode in the
software that that we wrote I wrote a
piece on this all right well it's like
user accounts why aren't why aren't
tablets given user account settings and
there are third-party apps that do this
but this is built-in it's called guest
mode it lets you restrict certain apps
when you certain users don't sure yes
your exactly and I mean I think that's
really cool and Sony's bringing that
what I think it is excellent about this
tablet is that it will have a 64 gig
version which will still be upgradeable
with a microSD card and yeah those of
you who use your tablet for content
consumption which is the main usage
except what i use it only for work
you'll love this one yeah and the price
point is not that bad either how do you
did just blow by the IR blaster man he's
not you're not after about the IR
blaster now they've they've done
something that when we've written a
piece on the inning Joe Joe wrote a
piece on this parts like you know why
are we building I are windows into these
super modern tablets and to control your
TV yeah and you know that's cool because
apparently apparently people do that so
whatever yeah the pricing is not too bad
this is what it's 600 for the 64 gig
model so that's you know reasonable i
wouldn't pay it personally but but you
know if you need a lot of capacity and
then expandability on top of that and
you want to be you want a tablet that
will withstand something like a
rainstorm and that's running a competent
OS like android i mean that's it's a
solid choice and let's not forget that
it comes with me accessory that the
surface like keyboard dock which comes
with a go yeah we go we'll go for a
hundred bucks if that's important to you
then you can grab something like that
yeah it's adds functionality it also
adds bulk not too much though so it's
something to I think it's something to
look up to it is cheap do you know how
tired I was that day I don't
remember the keyboard dock I was so
exhausted as is no short amount of
commenters have been quick to remind us
well I look like crap on camera thanks
at 342 all-night Drive and you were like
a third 12 12 hour flight yeah and then
navigating the streets of Berlin anyway
did this is we will move on here because
we're coming up on our time limit but
we're gonna go a little over the this is
cool all right this isn't new this was
this was cool this is exactly this was
cool months and months and months ago I
just wasn't paying attention so toshiba
released a tablet now excuse me no
that's not right toshiba announced a
tablet back at mwc yeah in freaking
Barcelona in February and they called it
the 8270 which even the toshiba guy i
talked to admit it was like the most
uninspired name everything this is like
yet stands for android tablet like oh
okay cool and they announced it back in
mwc and they are still showing it here
at you know whatever six months later
seven months later in bars in a berlin
exactly what LG did with the Optimus
view yes exactly saw the view but I NBC
still got a little elves in the clay
acer a cloud mobile same same story I
think so with a lot of companies do this
I'm not dogging toshiba but the problem
is they fooled me and they didn't do it
on purpose I fooled myself because I
didn't know enough I saw this thing on
the table the same night I discovered
the HP the beauty and the XD envy x2 and
but I saw this toshiba tablet laying on
the table and was like what is this
little 7 inch guy and what I say in the
hands-on video no sorry the the quick
tour video we didn't call it a hands-on
because it wasn't you know because it's
announced ages ago it looks like
somebody took a nexus 7 reverse
engineered it and then built it with
expensive materials like it's got it's
you know it's got this metal back on it
oh I don't care about that this Queen
had me from the first one in the screen
this 7 inch AMOLED panel couldn't get
much in the way of details on it and the
specs we did get were wrong it was
calling it as a TFT IPS
ya know it's an AMOLED panel with the
most beautiful color saturation you've
ever seen and they had that this they
were showcasing it with this a green
nebula wallpaper which was so gorgeous
and the device I mean just the way it
felt in the hand from from the display
of the wave Feldon and it was all such a
premium 7 inch android tablet experience
it is but it comes at a cost well that
is the thing I mean they they toshiba
has not announced anything specific but
they kept quoting prices I heard two
separate quotes from two separate people
one of which was yeah it's going to be
in the 400 euro price range and then
another guy said we're going to be that
500 euro price range this was let's take
the cheapest one right even if it's 400
euro what does that translate into
dollars it was do we say 52nd about
anywhere but the 600 Doppler 7 inch
android tablet no no no you may have
been able to get people to buy into in a
pre nexus 7 world even then you wouldn't
but maybe now forget it yeah but one
thing to do Shabazz defense is that that
this specific tablet is like preceding
the nexus 7 with like six months so
whatever didn't build this tablet they
thought of its internals and its core
features hardware-wise the nexus 7 was
nowhere to be seen and of course we knew
that Google and the suits were aiming to
reduce the price point because they want
a cheap affordable Nexus brand what the
shiba could do not too much is that they
could drop the price point a little bit
maybe cut their loss at their their
gains their percentage of fun we'll just
try and break it break even on it go to
the dumping policy and maybe probably
they will sell it will probably not sell
when they are compared one on one with
the Nexus 7 you'll instantly won't feel
those four hundred dollars exiting your
wall
so but it's a neat little tablet and if
it were any cheaper I'll probably buy
one because it's just that screen is
awesome and the screen is awesome and
it's not you know it's not running
jellybean it doesn't have the advantages
of a Nexus device the internet but it
has a rear mounted camera that shoots
okay pictures as a front mounted camera
it different mental cameras two
megapixel which is pretty cool but the
thing is what would you pay for this
this is a 7 inch in free mail knowing or
telling the Nexus 7 is out yeah like
what would it is a premium tablet it's a
premium 7-inch it'll get so give deluxe
edition 7 inch tablet so say it's too
many guy max bye max 2 99's you'd pay
double the cost of the cheapest nexus 7
for this premium experience I would too
having had my hands on if I were just
listening to this podcast I'd say we're
both crazy idiots all right but you have
to get your hands on this thing and I
sound like a toshiba like she'll but
whatever i don't care i really like it i
like it almost i don't like it anywhere
near as much as I like that HP Envy x2
but I for an Android tablet in the 7
inch range if I'm going to carry
something that's not the Nexus 7 from
what I saw with my brief time I would I
would want to carry this so we kind of
got to wrap it up here but we we put
kind of shoe horn this into the Android
tablets let's talk about militantly LG
was here ok yeah I know it's this is oak
leaf regatta finished with finish with
the topics and I just remembered let's
insert this into that's right you guys
listeners and service mentally in the
phone section LG was here we expected
the LG optimus G I just mentioned it a
couple of minutes ago that first super
fun run running the Snapdragon the probe
ship which would bring quad-core and LTE
and LG teased it the Qualcomm teased it
the phone was not hear what was here
though was the optimus l9 i think which
was the natural follow-up to the L
Series which we see Nana Barcelona
back then it was the l3 l5 07 and now we
have the online which is a meek little
phone it's a budget phone but it has
someone towards high tech as aspects so
it's running it's it's fast and the LGU
I version 3.0 it's definitely an
improvement over previous versions so I
want to talk about that yeah please do
i'm gonna die with it because I LG is
another brand that suffers in the United
States and it doesn't get much exposure
and I don't have much experience with it
so the I keep hearing about this LG skin
that like people just always are like
how it's such crap and whatever and it
looks it doesn't it's not pretty ok it's
not a very pretty you I it's it's not
among the obvious either I mean it's no
it's nice not say managed right it true
right right ok you know this is all
subjective but it's not the best you I
but I'm doing the hands-on with this l9
and it's my first experience aside from
my quick time with the view using the UI
and it's responsive and I mean it flies
it's it's it's as responsive as the
latest iteration of touch woods which is
very responsive for it but it has what
TouchWiz doesn't a truckload of
transition effects from home screen
Johannes watch the hands on video if you
want to see these in their entirety but
like when you're swiping between home
screens you can select between various
things including like an accordion
effect which is really weird looking for
like bait bait turning effect yeah
Freddie the effect soon it's all you
know what it's its craft or whatever you
know it's it's the unnecessary
improvements but I love you I touches
and if you don't want to use these you
can turn them off you can make it like
any other android phone right but it
just it that those are nice touches and
as is the ability to turn an icon if you
don't like any of the stock icons for
like the browser you can take a picture
of whatever and with the phone's camera
crop it and make that picture your
launch icon that's cool I'm through but
still still with your sisters with all
of these and the in the buzz which led
up to IFA waiting for the optimus G bln
is just
no I feel let down yeah yeah and how
about the optimist view how about the
eyes well I finally got my hands on this
is if you don't remember your listeners
to the their phablet the LG phablet that
looks like a coaster or a roof shingle
or something free aspect ratios screen
yeah I felt exactly the same as you Tony
when you shoot stony would tell us and
he said this on the podcast before where
he's like guys it's not as bad as it
looks and I was like whatever man that
thing looks ridiculous and then you hold
it and it's yeah it's it's like a graham
cracker but it's still it feels better
in the hand than it looks like it would
I would still never carry one but for
somebody who wants a four point four by
three aspect ratio at that size and you
know there's no reason that the phablet
market has to be dominated by this one
form factor that Samsung is going to
dictate now you know it's cool i'm glad
LG is pushing it i just fighting the
evil in me but it will come out i just
hope we this this thing was announced at
mwc yeah we saw it in barcelona we are
seeing it now with up to spec
specifications in IFA in berlin I just
hope LG won't show it up again in
February in 2015 and Barcelona i would
probably I don't know I jelly bean and 2
gigs of ram and walk already but and I
want to design the markets coming soon
yeah it has to be on the market should
have been a long time ago but this is
really less trying to get there are
rumors that that in the states at least
verizon has partnered with LG to push
this as their family actually there were
even more recent rumors when they might
have cancelled that alongside like just
like t-mobile might have guests of the
original note we don't know unless we
something happens real quick it's it is
too late it was launched to combat the
first generation note and now the note
is at second generation and the first
generation competitor is not yet even on
the market like when the touchpad
launched to to compete with the second
iPad yeah you can't do that well we'll
see how that plays out it would be very
sad if that never launched but there's a
thank you for remembering that I didn't
want to leave Algeria there is an item
that we could not put in any other
category so we kind of put it at the end
of
tablets category here this is the
Samsung Galaxy camera what so we've been
talking a lot about how point and shoots
are kind of dying and you know I don't
have any numbers on that that's not a
factual statement it's just kind of this
thing where it's like yeah camera
digital cameras are probably going to go
extinct outside of professionals yeah
consumer ones it yeah and even the
prosumer ones will stick around i think
but yeah consumer grade point and shoots
are probably going the way of the dodo
and that's okay because phone cameras
are getting really good but then Samsung
is like you know what we're not doing
anything I'm not doing anything except
dominating the smartphone world let's do
this hobby project and put it under the
increasingly watered-down galaxy brand
and call and they took their w-what 850w
850 whatever that cameras the ten ton
hammer is called and slapped android a
big-ass 4.6 4.8 inch yes just without
just any Android jelly bean an internal
jelly beans will only be one and there
are cameras with jelly it's crazy so we
were all up into the trade floor and I'm
like it we're shouldn't hands-on it's
likely tongue is like you want to go do
that galaxy camera and I'm like all
right that means you wanna fine and we
go over there we find him a gentle one
which is quit fast for some reason
becoming our trademark yes and
and I fire this thing up and you know
what I should give a shout out to the
IFA people again Samsung's promo people
who were running the floor were amazing
they were no that's all so friendly
Julian if you ever listen to this euro
you're awesome the guy who showed us a
galaxy camera I don't remember his name
but he was awesome too so he shows us
all the features and you can hop on into
a custom set a custom camera settings
screen I think that's the you're talking
about the things which conduct on the
under lens yeah yes I think that's the
that's as manual setting as it gets so
what it is if you haven't seen it is our
hands on is you can hop into the
settings screen and then it's like an
old it's like a camera's lens let with
all of its setting rings like with the
Rings for um for what if f style for
focus aperture for zooming yes and you
can like manually you know rotate these
on the screen using touch movements and
that you know that's really cool and
it's it would be a gimmick if it didn't
work so well and it does work well I
think of the guys I'm gonna say
something right now I reviewed the
PureView 808 and I said that it's a
camera with film functionality now this
galaxy camera it comes with Wi-Fi only
splash 3g and 4g functionality yeah so
you snap a picture you can of course
always transfer it via Wi-Fi direct to
your tablet or your phone but you can
upload it if you have a 3g radio to
facebook to instagram do hbu twitter you
name it right from the camera why didn't
they put a speaker on that so that has
phone functionality this might be not
probably the preferred phone for people
but no it was just and don't think it
would have been so difficult to achieve
it wouldn't have and you know so you
listeners that this camera is huge if
you watch our hands on it it's big to
hold in the hand I mean it's it's not
meant to be terribly portable it's meant
to be it like a DSLR replacement even
though the optics aren't as good as a
DSLR I think it's like 12 megapixels
16-megapixel we can play something in
there so it's big right and and but
you're right they could have put an
earpiece and a microphone on a
speakerphone with my for a speakerphone
and you know people have talked on
weirder devices
there's that Nokia taco phone right the
5800 or whatever that was I will gladly
toggle 7-inch tablet so oh yeah Antonio
talking on tablet like people will talk
on stuff I would even talk in the galaxy
camera if a minute could carry it around
and take cool shots with it anyway yeah
that's a dang against it it had but I
think my takeaway from my time with the
galaxy camera and I told this to to a
samsung VP who asked me about it and I
meant every word it's an item i came up
to look at didn't expect to like it sort
of expected to maybe my head make fun of
it a little and within the two minutes
at one me over i was like i can actually
see myself carrying this I think you
better prepare because next year that
they will be doing hands-on videos with
android-powered dishwashers it's a good
point right right alongside the webos
toaster yes um cool so I just to that's
that's kind of the end of the products
we wanted to talk about that
unfortunately there was nothing from
nothing really really high end in the
tablet space from HTC do you have that
slight bitter taste in your mouth induce
a thing I mean it was a show it was a
cliche it's one of those shows which are
big and you have to attend if again but
I was expecting more I was too I didn't
you know I think I was surprised but I
was pleasantly surprised when Samsung
carted out some windows 8 stuff because
i was expecting a galaxy note 2 but i
didn't know what else to expect so there
were some pleasant surprises but yeah I
really something Austin is it let the
real attends like a sous um wasn't even
here really they had their the booth a
tiny little if HTC's booth was small a
sous had actually a sous Intel Intel did
what Google does at mwc there was a huge
intel booth and order partners had small
micro islands within the sub sub duluth
yeah yeah so as soon as was all that it
was nine square meters free break free
it's very small they had like to send
books on display and
I think on the other side to others and
books on this place yeah there were no
phones and we guys the rap ok this is
this mold booth within the intel booth
where's where's the hugest Sue's booth
and there's not now there's not this is
that ok ah god it was such a just book I
wanted to lay my hands on a pad phone
even though it's old I wanted to you
know yes that's not get a sous dominated
MVC tablets he had the Infinity bed this
was the talk of the town yeah and then
there just weren't here so you know
whatever that's cool that's a tactical
decision on their part i was just
personally disappointed who do you think
motorola had a blue leak was doing our
company here so yeah so let's let's talk
about that the winner we talked about
this concept of this winning company
like who that's right sorry is it sorry
survive um auto traffic berlin we
wouldn't movie value our automobiles
here that's part of the fun um this
concept of like kind of like who won the
eva for in this is just a personal take
there's no data to back this up for
company and for device I think we should
each give a response I think and in a
company sense the clear clear winner of
Eva was Samsung in that they were the
most visible they had a lot of
anticipation built up for this galaxy
note 2 which they capitalized on
delivered and then over delivered they
were like and here's all this other
stuff too which while it's maybe not the
best I don't like the achieve too much
whatever but it's still really really
important and it's gonna sell really
well probably so I think Samsung really
brought the heat and they are they
continue to be in it to win it I think
they were the winner kind of company
side you if and Barcelona I said that
Microsoft was the big loser because
there were no windows phones and no
windows tablets I think that this year
as a company Microsoft is a winner I
mean I'm seeing this which could be
interpreted in two ways they want all
right because they had so much exposure
on almost every company had a windows
tablet yeah and I'm seeing this
while my heart is shrinking and
shrinking of fear that I just hope they
will not flood the market with cheap B
category products now we love it I don't
think there was a company who matters
and who didn't have a windows 8 on this
play it's true yeah so I think yeah they
had and if they do what we expect them
to do two days from now with Windows
Phone 8 the announcement with Nokia they
could take away this quarter maybe they
really could I mean it's particularly in
the buzz in the buzz sense because you
know I think maybe Samsung gave us
seated a little bit of ground than that
in that sense because they as a galaxy
has three big big blast right but the
note 2 is not going to resonate with
them with regular consumers sure it's
gonna you know and and of course there
are millions of note users but a lot of
a large portion of them are either
really had hardcore users or they're
geeks and then this is not that's not a
you know an attack on note users by the
way absolutely not I this is I I really
like to note a lot but it's not a it's
not a device for everyone and so the
note 2 is not as buzz buzz worthy and
none of their products whereas buzz
worthy as they have been so Microsoft
has an opportunity to jump in and steal
the limelight I agree yeah even more so
that the it is it's just that time
Microsoft is always waiting for the end
of the year and let's not forget we are
waiting for the surface their tablet
yeah which will be cheap I I predict
this I don't know why did I predict this
I hope you're right but I don't know it
could be it should be the same way like
Google's handling things here's my Nexus
it's cheap Nexus 7 if you want something
premium by little Sheba 8270 mmm this is
what my perception this is my surface
it's cheap if you want something pie
around by the samsung smart pc that
would be it would be interesting well
seeing we'll see speaking of devices
let's let's wrap this up with a with a
winner selection I you want to go first
you want me to belong in the device
category you'll be longer I'll be longer
okay I think or shorter in the same vein
as the Microsoft argument I don't think
Samsung was the was the winner of you
know well I think they were the winner
is a company I don't think they were the
winner in the device category neither
the note 2 nor the achieve devices is
really going to capture a lot of
imaginations and they don't really have
the the opportunity they're all sequel
devices except for the achieves but
they're don't not really terribly
remarkable so I think that HP has a
really really big opportunity to help
define a product category with the envy
x2 I think it is well built enough to
serve as a flagship type device that can
really grab a lot of attention in an
environment where they're working with a
new platform in Windows 8 which is going
to be Microsoft going to be so hungry
too you know dominate with Windows 8
they have a huge user base is so
installed already clean windows seven
right and in addition though it's it's
gonna be on the forefront on the leading
edge of this wave crest of a new product
category whether you call it a hybrid or
a convertible or you know whatever this
tablet with keyboard not keyboard
accessory tablet with keyboard component
that you know with with stock keyboard
component it's the first such device
that i think i would i would use
personally and i think it I think if HP
plays it right and I said this in the
piece I wrote today they have the
potential for a really big winner on
their hands and they are desperate to
get into the tablet space after the year
they lost on the whole touchpad debacle
so that is the that is the device winner
for me for Aoife 2012 the HP Envy x2
almost purely based on speculation and
potential Tony my favorite device I
can't remember exactly the model number
but was the intelligent vacuum cleaner
which whatever it did a wall it returns
and
Esther the Rumba yes agreed yes to get
serious guys know I don't have a clear
device winner I mean the note 2 is
buzz-worthy it's a great fast film but
it's not for me and it's definitely not
something wrong breaking as the note 1
was back in its day same goes for all
the rest of the film's I mean HTC
disappointed LG disappointed or maybe we
expect it too much out of them then a
sure with with their phones they
disappointed so in terms of phones I
know none and in terms of tablets and
trying to think of one but I can't
identify one with which I should
resonate or which I'd say I I need to
grab this end day one so as as hardware
as far as hardware goes I'm leaving IFA
without a dream next device MVC I always
said that I'm gonna get the PureView 808
and I gotta get the PadFone I got the
808 I'm yet to get the bathroom but I
will I'm leaving IFA and I'm looking
forward to mwc because it can't see
