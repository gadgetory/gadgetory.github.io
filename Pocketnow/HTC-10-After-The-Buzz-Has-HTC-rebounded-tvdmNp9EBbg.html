phone comes out we all go crazy
reviewing it then a couple of weeks
later we're all moving on to the next
new thing our phone ages is as important
as that initial out of the box
experience so let's do something about
this
HTC had a rough year in 2015 alongside
LG - very promising flagship phones were
burned by the negative press surrounding
welcomes processors 2016 became
something of a rebuilding year and early
reviews were largely positive now nearly
six months later how has our review unit
aged under aggressive use it's time for
our HTC ten after the buzz full
disclosure this phone has not been in my
keep apparently if you really want a
torture test a phone you should send it
to pocket now editor Adam doubt
considering the number of undie twisted
cranky comments we get about fingerprint
smudges I can only imagine what people
will say about the numerous scrapes
scratches and dents here
it helps us check in though if you're
hard on your gadgets what might you
expect it's now pretty easy to slide a
fingernail in between the front glass
and the bottom edge by the USBC port
also the vibration motor on this phone
is toast it's now a wheaty floppy buzz
instead of a tight vibration thankfully
though we can see this is taking a
corner drop the bottom speaker hasn't
been affected and otherwise this phone
is still running strong handling the
black version I personally prefer the
silver HTC especially in how these wide
faucets reflect light and that scratches
and blemishes will be better hidden also
I'm still not the biggest fan of home
button mounted fingerprint sensors and
having hardware navigation buttons means
you can't customize the order of your
back and multitasking keys but it's not
overly egregious getting used to the
standard layout if you're coming from a
Samsung HTC redeemed its reputation here
for performance the 10 remains a snappy
and as responsive as when it was new the
scent skin is leaner than in years past
and that helps though we'd certainly
like to hear more on when we might
expect an update to
Android seven early rumors pointed to an
October launch which seems increasingly
unlikely we definitely like to play with
the improved notification shade and
split screen apps on this phone the main
camera doesn't quite crack into the same
tear performance as a Samsung but it's
easily the best we've ever used on an
HTC and falls just a bit behind for
manual controls HTC is also one of the
only manufacturers to offer high quality
audio recording so this phone still tops
our list with the v20 for people who
like to record live music we hadn't
started our real audio review series
when this phone was released so circling
back here the 10 speakers are a very
different take on mobile audio the top
earpiece responsible for mids and highs
the bottom tackling lower frequency
sound but both sharing duties to spread
out info it's a different experience
than standard stereo speakers but it's a
sound we still very much enjoy detailed
crisp nuanced and plenty of range games
and videos sound great and moving over
to the headphone jack
HTC delivers one of the best performers
of the year the 10 produces the lowest
noise floor and widest dynamic range
we've ever tested on a phone easily
besting our fee okay one USB DAC and
just edging out the LGV 20 with lower
distortion numbers and less stereo
crosstalk where HTC falls behind LG is
on the amp which will arguably be more
noticed by folks comparing these two
when using consumer grade headphones
they're neck-and-neck but on higher
impedance solutions the v20 easily pulls
away with louder output we're looking at
the best of the best for 2016 though and
if you want high quality audio you can't
really go wrong with either the main
weakness we can point to is battery life
six months later performing our media
test streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the 10 drained 8%
of its battery which is higher than we'd
like to see compared to a galaxy s7 with
a similar battery capacity it is still
the fastest phone we've benched for
recharging though and you should be able
to get plenty of runtime if you need to
top off quickly in the middle of the day
so let's wrap this up how do we feel
about the HTC 10 six months later what
we have here folks is the most
underrated flagship of 2016 it's really
a shame that the 10 didn't receive more
fanfare it's
hands as a satisfying alternative to the
Apple Samsung duopoly attractive design
great multimedia features and a solid
camera understandably after a rough year
HTC would need to take some time
building its reputation back up
customers wandered away after the one m9
but if HTC continues improving and
manufacturing phones like this we think
consumers will be game to give them
another shot just if you do buy one
promise me you'll take better care of it
than Adam did I mean damn man as always
