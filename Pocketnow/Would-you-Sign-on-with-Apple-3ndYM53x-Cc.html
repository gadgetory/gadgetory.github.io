and the World Wide Developers Conference
which kind of surprised us with a few
big announcements in both software and
hardware while social media is still
buzzing over the design of that beastly
Mac Pro calling it things like a cheese
grater we found ourselves impressed by
some new functionality added to the iPad
pro but underneath all of these fun
announcements was a declaration of
safety a declaration that users and
developers alike
can take a better stance toward data
privacy the headliner sign-on with app a
single sign-on apparatus that creates
aliases per app so you don't have to
give your actual email address to any of
the apps that might be accessing your
data with the conversation around
privacy coming to the forefront I sit
down with Brandon minimun and TK Bey to
discuss the state of privacy on the
internet and in our own lives support
for the pocket our weekly podcast comes
from Oregon State University earn your
Oregon State MB a 100% online in a

pocket now hello everybody and welcome
to the weekly brought to you by Pacquiao
and xda-developers episode 361 recorded
on June 3rd 2019 YouTube viewers you are
enjoying the highlights of the show
after which we invite you to join in on
the full conversation regarding Apple's
announcements and their stance on
privacy in between those two main
segments we also ask the panel what is
in your pocket now so let's get into the
show we begin with some thoughts on
Apple's keynote WWDC I saw people on
Twitter going like yeah it's my first
time a dub-dub and I was like who calls
it that why are you calling it that it's
WWDC and I think it was really funny how
on stage none of the people actually use
the words iTunes is dead but let's be
real iTunes is practically dead by now
right to a certain extent yeah we've
seen the purification basically the the
different versions of software now that
will manage different parts of the the
OS or well not
with the libraries right so you have the
video library your podcast library and
content so what's super interesting
about iTunes is that it was built for a
world of the past where your computer
was the server it contained all the data
you didn't have a superfast internet
connection there what there really was
no cloud because storage was still very
expensive and had to be local on your
computer but now your movies your music
all of your data exists on another
computer somewhere it's streamed it's
downloaded we're moving past that to a
decentralized cloud-based manin it's
been happening for a while and I'm glad
that it's finally that Apple has finally
gotten on board because iTunes has been
a mess for a very long time but it's the
backup and restore that always worried
me because that's where a lot of people
at let's say you lose your I've tuned
your iPhone or your iPod Touch to bring
a new one but if you have a backup your
data is at least there you can restore
it to a new phone yeah indeed you're
talking about data redundancy because
like if you take your phone and you do
an iCloud backup and then you throw it
in the toilet and flush it down the
toilet and then you go out and buy
another iPhone while you log into iCloud
and it says today you you know backed up
here if your back if your iCloud storage
limit hasn't been read exactly yes
you're gonna get like I think earlier
pictures back I was actually really
excited about all the iPad stuff I don't
know what you guys have thoughts were on
on the tablet side of things I think
what people wanted was a a closer
experience to like almost like a touch
friendly Mac OS and I think that's kind
of what people thought that iPad the
iPad operating system was going to be if
you go back to 2010 and so I think iPad
OS is such like a it's it's it's better
it's improved but it's really it it's
really a half-measure it's still a
blown-up phone operating system with a
little bit more it would it would have
been Jaime's class of like oh my god are
you kidding yeah this was the best part
of the show and like he's like so happy
cuz he's he's such a big advocate why
are people so obsessed with dark mode
can somebody explain that to me that is
coercion it's a good segue to me because
that's exactly what I was excited about
exactly so
dark mood for the most part if nothing
else especially on AMOLED displays saves
you battery if nothing else but for
aesthetics and for reading at night it
still also looks a little bit cooler
it's also if the first time we've ever
seen a theme hype ups the situation
comes straight from a poll speaking of
the audience kind of going crazy over an
announcement there is one there is one
that kind of floored everybody and I
like the way that Tim Cook actually
announced it and you said there's one
category that we have yet to fill in our
computing segment and that is of course
the Mac Pro so a device like this will
allow people to film at 16k and crop in
at 8k and you need a lot of how you need
four GPUs and 28 processing cores and a
terabyte of RAM to be able to handle so
many pixels moving down the screen it's
gonna be awesome oh and the monitors 10
is $1,000 and imagine if you order the
monitor and then the stand is in black
order oh my gosh
and you get it you get it you get a
$5,000 monitor and you're looking at
like it looks great on the floor our
conversation today around privacy
actually has a special sponsor hackable
an original podcast from McAfee from the
news two episodes of black mirror
stories about cybercrime are all over
the place if you're concerned about your
personal devices like your webcam or
your voice assistant spilling your
secrets hackable looks to answer those
questions and more each episode found on
all major podcast platforms has hackable
host jeff Siskin inviting a white hat
hacker to try and hack a device he's
using and in season 4 you can see if
these show friendly hackers can crack
smart phones printers even smart kettles
learn if the Internet connected
essentials that power your life also
leave your personal data vulnerable and
then learn how to protect yourself from
letting your love of devices put you at
risk listen and subscribe to hackable
today on all major podcast platforms
including Apple and stitcher so I wanted
to throw to you guys about privacy and
in particular this new feature called
sign-on with Apple I I realized that
it's something that we can all do if you
have if you decide to run your own mail
server but it not everybody will run
their own mail or if they're not running
a website or so on
there's just the ability of not having
your own personal email getting
bombarded with emails getting
information you could just basically put
it in I'm hoping they implement it and
it works as simply
as they're saying because the reality is
again it all relies on the end-users
experience once it comes out do we I
mean is in how do you change the proxy
once you're basically you know done with
it and how do you know where it's coming
from in a sense of what account if it's
sold and you're starting to get spam on
it
does it just all come into one inbox
that whole process I always worry about
the details but in theory I think it's a
good idea and for every story of a
breach there's also stories of companies
trying to make it so that you have
control over your data if somebody got a
hold of which podcasts I listened to
like fine it's boring I don't care but
like when it comes to other more private
things like the photos I take or the
emails I send or the text messages I
send privacy is obviously very important
private from what whoo you guys yeah I
don't I don't want you guys to see my
emails and pictures private from a
stranger who's trying to get my identity
yeah definitely don't want that so with
with privacy it's like the question is
privacy from whom do you actually dive
into the Android US privacy settings and
all the permissions and whatnot so I've
been so yeah so as far as just the
ability of controlling the information
access for application we've been doing
it ever since exposed with you know back
in the day where we one of the reasons
we needed to route our device was to be
able to install expose and install X
privacy in there is this there was a
module in there that allowed us and you
know it's it's one of those things that
you you should you should see what
applications are asking for and you
should really address the fact that why
does it need access to your camera when
it's just a text messaging application
and it doesn't actually do anything some
apps use location data in the background
and it's creepy and it kills your
battery like I think like the weirdest
apps like a library app or something
that you have or Starbucks act like it's
constantly pulling the background so
that maybe you can present you with oh
there's a Starbucks nearby you should I
don't know patronize it and it's it's
it's killing your battery and it's it's
fantastic to have as much granular
control as possible to see what apps are
doing and to question why does my
library app need my location I'm
deleting it yeah but I don't think I
used two factor authentication a whole
lot do you guys use that yeah no I I
have to factor on all of my doll my
gmail accounts and anything that I can't
even my fortnight account you know my
epic game account I have to it's not
required though does an epic require
that use it's an option okay you know
for the regular person that you have
buys a phone and uses it for two years
since we're very abnormal it's a
no-brainer it adds an additional layer
of security that makes it physically
impossible in a lot of cases but not all
for someone to take over your account
because they don't have that second part
they have their username and password
but it's like a second password on top
of that so yeah you can really save your
but in a lot of situations I think you
guys have convinced me because I think
the only place that I have ever used to
FA has been with my Blizzard account
when I used to play overwatch a lot
