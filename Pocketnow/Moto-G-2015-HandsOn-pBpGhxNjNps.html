summer and wouldn't you know it the
leaks were spot on I'm Michael Fisher
with pocket now and this is a hands-on
look at the 2015 Moto G so compared to
our moto x coverage there's not a lot to
say about the new moto g mostly because
again it's been leaked to high heaven
but the moto g is Motorola's
best-selling smartphone of all time and
the company seems committed to keeping
it that way first it's kept the price
the same the Moto G starts at 179 99
unlocked which is still pretty
compelling considering what you get a 5
inch 720p display a 13 megapixel camera
that's been repurposed from the Nexus 6
24 70 milliamp hour battery micro SD
storage expansion and 4G LTE radio this
generation also brings adjustable
storage and ram 8 gigs plus one gig or
16 gigs plus two gigs respectively and
Motorola will also now build you a
custom Moto G if you wanted you can
customize the shell and accent color and
even engrave it to truly make it your
own finally the new Moto G is rated ipx7
for immersion in water up to a meter
deep making it a better poolside
companion than the last one in the hand
the new Moto G feels somewhat like the
older one but smoother and somehow more
plasticky it's substantial at 155 grams
but the smooth side planes make it
slippery like a dry bar of soap and the
side keys are mushy fortunately the
ribbed plastic backing helps with the
handling and that back holds on like
crazy you really need to try hard to pry
it from its mounting and you really need
to squeeze it all over to latch it shut
when you want to waterproof the thing I
anticipate a few warranty claims for
damage once people start getting these
in hand and take a dip in the pool
without fully sealing the back cover
this is running Android 511 by the way
with some of motorola's custom
enhancements namely moto display is here
to wake the screen on motion or
notifications emoto assist can keep the
phone quiet while you're sleeping and
moto actions
lets you do things like launch the
camera with a wrist twist or fire up the
flashlight with a chop chop there's no
moto voice here though on account of the
Snapdragon 410 processor that lower end
processor combined with the phones other
less than stellar specs as us wondering
if it'll continue selling as well as it
has unlike when the first moto G
launched two years ago this end of the
smartphone spectrum isn't empty there
are competitive players out there with
very compelling products at this price
point can a handful of moto features and
some waterproofing keep the
third-generation Moto G in the game
we'll have the answer in our full review
coming soon stay tuned to pocketnow.com
for that and make sure you check out all
our coverage from today's Motorola
events in New York City here on YouTube
until next time this has been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
thanks for watching we'll see you next
