now calm and today we're going to be
taking a look at the can to both the
chem 1 &amp;amp; II can't you will be available
on may six on verizon wireless online
and on May thirteenth throughout verizon
wireless's national retail stores the
kin one and two will join Microsoft's
Windows Phone family so let's go ahead
and in this video we're going to go
ahead and do an unboxing at the device
and see what it comes with and then
we're going to go ahead and briefly take
a look at the device so here my hands I
have the Kin box the packaging comes in
a round cylindrical box that has a matte
black finish the can one has a white
finish and also a black embossed label
on the bottom that says to the Kin box
has also green letterings you'll find
this shade of green throughout the
device and on the user interface as well
so let's go ahead and remove the top
which is a nice rubbery field and inside
you'll see more of the green accents as
well as a tab for you to pull out the
tubular packaging on the inside the box
um is a recyclable material with a green
elastic band wrapped around it and
inside the box on one side you'll have
the Kin to which runs on a version of
Windows Phone and has a sliding qwerty
keyboard we're going to go ahead and set
this aside for just a moment and here in
this package you'll see that there are
menus or different manuals on how to use
the device and quickly get acquainted
with your kin
you also have a micro USB to USB charge
and sync cable as well as stereo
headphones on that connect to the device
via a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack as well as a wall adapter
for quickly charging your kin let's go
ahead and set that aside and take a look
at the hardware the device has a half
vga resolution capacitive touchscreen
with an earpiece speaker on one end and
on the bottom you have a microphone port
as well as a back button on the upper
right-hand side you have the power
button which toggles the screen on and
off volumes up and down as well as a
dual press shutter for the camera press
and lightly to focus and press it hard
to snap your picture a micro USB port
and three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack flanked both ends of the
device the left side is relatively clean
except for a little notch here where you
can push in to release the back battery
cover speaking at the camera the Kin has
a 8 megapixel camera the Kin one has a
5-megapixel camera the two has an eight
with HD 720p video resolution for
recording as well as a bright lumi LED
flash the 8 megapixel camera will
compete with the HTC droid incredible
also on verizon wireless this device has
an 8-megapixel camera that records in
vga resolution and instead of the bright
lumi LED flash it just has dual LED
flashes the the back has a nice texture
matte finish to it it's not a rubberized
finish but it does have a nice texture
to it and then the keyboard there's a
circular with a nice modern font to the
layout and a very long space bar the
keys do offer a nice tactile
feel to them and it is very cliquey and
then you'll see also elements of green
throughout the keyboard as well the keys
are nicely spaced and aren't contiguous
as far as the user interface on the can
the can has three home screens the first
screen here in the middle is what we
call the loop the Kin Loup allows you to
stay in the loop with your social media
and social networking by aggregating all
your status updates from various social
media sites such as Twitter Facebook
Windows Live and myspace and it also
integrates RSS feeds if you have any
there's also a kin spot here at the
bottom which is indicated by this green
circle if you want to share something
Microsoft introduced a new paradigm for
cut copy and paste by just tapping and
holding which brings up a thumbnail of
what you see here and then you can drag
it into the spot the next home screen is
the favorites and this is where your
favorite contacts not all your contents
but your favorite ones that you interact
with the most or stored and then you can
go ahead and tap until you see a
thumbnail and then dragged into the spot
so if i were to share that caption with
with a person i would just drag the
person into here and then if i hit stand
at the top can gives me an option to
send via text or mms message and email
so even users who don't have a kin would
be able to access the links that i am
that i would share with them and it they
can access the URL or view it as a
screenshot here if you want to adjust
any of your contacts if you want to
rearrange them or remove them tap with
two fingers and then you can go ahead
and remove contacts or even rearrange
different ones in two different spots
and then the other homescreen the third
home screen is the apps home screen kin
unfortunately doesn't allow you to
download additional applications
although it runs on the windows mobile
platform or the Windows Phone platform
and then you'll find various different
apps regularly needed including a
messaging app email app and a phone app
there's also an integrated zoom music
experience so you can use your zune pass
and stream music that way or listen to
Zune streaming radio music can be
downloaded and integrated with the
device via the zune desktop software for
Windows PC users and for Mac users slide
loading drm will be available via an app
for the mac platform when the device
gets released let's go ahead and check
out the camera
and you'll see elements of Windows Phone
7 here when you go into the camera menu
where the panoramic screens are
indicated where the the ends are so it
shows you that there there is more
content if you go forward the zune
browser is an HTML based browser and if
we go to pocket now calm it does take a
while to load
so now that the page has mostly loaded
if i want to share the page i can go
ahead and tap and hold and at thumbnail
would appear and i can drag it down to
the spot so this has been a quick tour
of the zune or of the kintu with zune
software and Windows Phone underlying
and this phone will be available on
verizon wireless Vodafone
internationally and it will be basically
Microsoft's next generation of the
sidekick device this the kin is
manufactured by sharp and Chung win for
