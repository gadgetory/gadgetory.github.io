I mean ah your eyes literally have a
warranty it is standard warranty up
until you're 40 so I'm not 40 yet I'm
still a little far off but here we go
now I definitely feel that and
especially like from some some of the
recent like side projects and stuff
talking to doctors about your health and
eye health and and technology
contributing to some of that too it's
amazing that we can spend our lives
staring at the tiny little
glowing rectangles that we do and not be
wiped out even faster so you know I
think you're well joined in this company
good sir
that girls to be resilience of the human

without further ado man we've got a lot
of news to tackle man there are some
good stories this week so on all stories
it's indeed for the week of April 9 2018
this is all the news that has fit to
podcast some independent repair shops
are refused refusing to do work on
iPhone 8 units this as the iOS 11.3
update has apparently killed touch
sensing on third-party display
components used to replace the iPhone 8
a previous iOS update did the same for
iPhone 7 replacement screens there was a
fixed last time I'll have to see if one
comes along this time the Korean Fair
Trading Commission also against Apple
this week apparently there's word that
the nation's major carriers have
complained about carrying the costs of
marketing the iPhone for them Eric
enjoyment this in exchange for
standardized materials with limited
customization for
carrier Apple has been issued to please
explain no action has officially been
taken just yet the home pod is not
really doing that well by the way after
ten weeks on the market Apple's smart
speaker offering only achieved a 10%
share compared to Google's 14% and 73%
for Amazon 7 million units are expected
to sell this year of the home pod by the
way to Google homes 18 million and
Amazon echoes 29 million
redditors have seen test emails for the
Spotify car player a 4G connected alexa
password playback device of some sorts
that mount to a dashboard of a car it's
said to be packaged with spotify premium
service and cost between 13 and 15
dollars per month with a 12 month
commitment apparently this may be what
we'll see in New York at the event they
have announced for April 24 the LG V 35
thinkyou is said to be the next V Series
device coming this year from the Korean
table with a lot of the same the same
components excuse me
like the 16 megapixel main camera sister
sensor and there's also a wide-angle
camera with a narrow field of view than
previous LG smartphones this one being
107 degrees as opposed to 120 or even
135 degrees also artificial intelligence
- heck The Wall Street Journal reports
that Sprint and t-mobile or again
talking about merging it be the third
time in four years though details of
very scarce at this point Android
manufacturers have been found not to be
patching vulnerabilities even though
they say they have been security
research labs reports that on average
ZTE and TCL failed to pass along more
than four patches per device over the
course of last year HTC and LG 3 or 4
piece samsung sony in google closer to
zero on the list we'll get into a
discussion a deep dive on this in in
just a few minutes
Chinese tech brand schemey is reported
to be considering an acquisition of
GoPro the company once known for its
action cameras have been has been on the
sales block since earlier this year
after a heavy decline in business thanks
to drone players and even xiaomi itself
with its Yi action cameras used to be
worth more than ten billion dollars now
it might only fetch 1 billion dollars
meanwhile Xiaomi is growing its business
with a rumored IPO soon and worthwhile
this in the tens of billions of dollars
soul singer John Legend has is a had his
latest music video for a good night
featuring blood blood pop shot entirely
with a Google pixel - and snapchat or
snap Inc has submitted documents for
certification what for a potential
sequel to spectacles its first Hardware
project version 0-0 - as they say and
the first project seemed moderately
successful for snapchat of course
software wise they have been lacking and
have failed to keep hold of people
especially after that big marketing faux
pas with the ad about Rihanna and
domestic-abuse head into that so just a
quick thought we're not going to spend
too much time on this but a snapchat
status for you guys I just love the
ambition that these are the 0:02
spectacles that some day will see those
like 900 I was thinking like oh oh what
happens when we get to the nine hundred
and ninety-ninth
version of spectacles and we have to
tick over to the thousandth I need
[Laughter]
everything - in your prescription like
the little blends attached that the
camera has to be in your prescription so
that everyone else can see it in their
relative prescription view so that'd be
a good idea I just don't see where
anything that's spectacle related unless
they are somehow jumping into an AR VR
world
really gonna capture the public's
imagination spectacles were a novelty
they were fresh they were something
interesting for the snapchat platform
and right now it's everything that
snapchat does is being milked by
competitors and I don't think just
another fan targeted launch of a
specific piece of hardware which is
stuck to one platform is really gonna do
it for him I don't know I I guess I II I
really wanted a pair of spectacles and
then I was like okay can we come up with
another design please I mean I don't
like really you didn't it's a very
enthusiastic plug I I actually
considered I was like okay this would be
a reason for me to actually consider
using snapchat but then you know I tried
them on and I'm like ya know hey I don't
look good with these so never mind I
feel that you know snapchat should
consider more than one design like I
don't know I I don't think there was
anything wrong with them I actually
considered that to be the you know a
genius witty to share your stuff but not
with those looks yeah I agree
yep indeed let's go up to the top of the
rundown here and talk about the iPhone
displays and this has been an ongoing
conversation between multiple owners of
these repair shop in some cases these
repair shop chains not necessarily
related to Apple nor they authorized
service providers as Apple likes to uh
you know go into contract with them
maximize the profit and whatnot and this
has been reported by motherboard one
shop owner says that they had to go
through 2000 reship mitts because of the
latest display malfunctioning apparently
this is going down to a microchip
controlling the display and you know
just not refusing just refusing to
accept the touch so it's just an ongoing
piece in the latest saga against
third-party shops and Apple I wonder
exactly what took Apple so long because
we've we've known that so here's the
thing about Apple parts for those of you
that don't know every single Apple part
that you purchase on the on any shop
that's not an Apple store or a certified
retailer or a certified repair shop is
it's it's a knockoff it's not a real
display made by Apple it's not a genuine
part as much as they tell you it is and
I'm saying this mostly for you know my
my friends from latin america who you
know the biggest problem is what happens
when you are in a country that does not
have a repair store certified by Apple
which is like I mean from from on DotA's
and it'll do it as there is none so a
lot of people have been forced to use
this display it's not necessarily that
they want to use a third-party display
they're not even cheaper I mean if you
want to replace the display in the Apple
Store it's like 80 bucks if you want to
do it on the street it'll cost you like
around 60 to 70 so you know with apples
extensive control of the hardware I'm
shocked that it took so long for the
company to push an update like this and
this is just to prove that you know it's
just one thing that the company will do
the next thing will be batteries I guess
I don't know I mean we will go after
third-party hardware though I'm trying
to look up and I'm sorry I should have
done this before we jumped in live but
there were also issues with third-party
home buttons right yeah the error 53
issue but this is one of the things
because I agree with you I'm actually
kind of surprised that we've seen Apple
sort of slow play into this generation
of hardware there's always something so
I'm part of a repair or some part of a
software update which will which will
make this a painful experience for
third-party shops and third-party
resellers and stuff like that but um and
then I'm writing a service that Apple
can't or maybe is not willing to do it's
also let's say that you are in a first
world country with a ton of Apple stores
around you I mean if we're if we're sort
of acknowledging like a libertarian or a
conservative argument shouldn't me have
the ability
to engage in some kind of competition
and this also kind of goes hand in hand
with a lot of the efforts at the state
level that we see for right for repair
you know for consumers to have the
ability to maybe even fix a product on
their own and not just take it to a shop
or something like I remember back in the
Pocket PC days I would whip out a
soldering iron I would crack open a case
and grind down a PCB and replace
capacitors and stuff like that like
these things were expensive and I wanted
to keep them running for as long as I
possibly could so so the thing that I
think bothers me about Apple's approach
here is that it seems especially
punitive to their customers so you know
in your example I mean I think is a
perfect one you can't get the right
actual Apple service repair affordable
and in a time efficient manner for your
phone to not be out of commission for
weeks so then you go and you replace the
screen and then Apple pushes a software
update with no warning to you which then
bricks your phone and that I think
overly harms the consumer experience as
opposed to I mean they're already
putting a ton of pressure on third-party
repair shops but that's kind of for me
that's where you draw the line in the
sand and you say like there should be
some opt-out and I know Apple doesn't
like doing this but if I replace a home
button and it's going to brick my phone
there should be some consumer
notification before I run that up that
is a good point that is a good point I
guess my and I I know that my point is a
little polarizing because of two things
the first one is I it's not that I agree
that Apple is doing this it's just that
I'm it's horrible I don't have you ever
seen a third-party fake iPhone display
no I have it I mean like no III largely
agree with your point I I think Apple
has one a vested interest in protecting
their brand and their reputation that an
iPhone should look like an iPhone and
then to that consumers need to know that
there are some significant security
risks with some of this hardware you
don't know what might actually be going
into a device that could leach off data
or make your device less secure but what
I don't like about Apple's response here
is not not advising right it's yeah it's
it's it's lack of notification a lack of
awareness and then it's overly punitive
to the people who are already the most
vulnerable in their sphere of
people who are already at the most risk
of being taken advantage of and now
their devices are getting crippled yeah
that that is a good point
I don't know I we'll see I don't know
how thing about it is so the phone is
yours
you bought the phone you have a right to
do with that phone whatever you want and
there there is a legal right to repair
that is true I just I wish that these
third-party display manufacturers would
be oh my god like either the displays
have zero sensitivity or they're lacking
in sensitivity or they're yellowish yeah
or they they look really gross really
bad and they charge you 70 bucks for
those displays so I don't know I to a
certain degree I feel that what Apple is
doing is not necessarily bad I just I
have to agree with you 1 &amp;amp; 2 in addition
to notifying the consumer how about
working on establishing places where
this repair is not so painful because it
like for example right now in the Apple
Store if you want to get an appointment
the the app doesn't give you
appointments for more than a week and
they're always jam-packed it's insane
how much they're jam-packed and sure
you've got the option of best buy now
and certain other companies but you know
there are countries where there are no
repair shops so III have to agree with
you that definitely Apple needs to find
a better balance to do it well I don't
think they're paying much attention to
that issue as they are to the battery
replacement issue and that of course
goes back to see the whole iPhone
startling thing but I'll just throw in
this 10th attention to the lis related
story here is that 95 Mac is reporting
that Apple stores have had to hire
contract work to have on-site people
just be able to do it just to be able to
replace those batteries because of the
high demand that they're experiencing
after all you only get a year to get
these replacements done for that
subsidized $29 price point and people
understandably are frustrated and
they're looking for other sources and
otherwise they'd be going to like the
low buying iFixit kid for $29
but they have to provide their own labor
which is kind of risky in this sort of
sense and there are also there like more
places but they're untested or less
tested and you really don't know what
you're getting into
like Office Max and Office Depot
supposedly just started offering the
replacements at that $29 rate so and
here's something here's the thing about
that iOS 11.3 update that supposedly
helps you with your battery I mean my
you know my iPhone 10 got the update and
because the battery is still new
obviously it just tells you it said
maximum performance and that's it but my
iPad pro which is not the latest version
has iOS 11.3 it's more than a year old
and I have no options to control or not
control throttling and I have noticed
that this iPad is slower than it used to
be I don't know and and by the way that
hold the battery module is still in beta
for those of you that don't know it is
still something Apple's testing well and
it's something that we've already seen
sort of cool off in the general
discussion in the general public
discussion or something yes but it's
it's something that I think again just
contributes to what is it that you're
really getting for your money how much
control do you have over it and as
grown-ups what decisions can you make
well I mean well Peter Hayden makes a
good point with the hashed IP and weekly
on Twitter I guess it is delete parts
Apple has to watch out for when these
parts are easy to come by I guess they
don't want to create issues with the
brand and he links to the how I made my
own iPhone in China videos and the the
guy I don't remember his name but he's
been making a series of videos about how
he's wanted his iPhone and in Chen Chen
or whatever or first of all is the guy
who did like how to replace the
headphone jack Phone 7 yeah yeah that
too but also you know he's been doing a
whole bunch of mods and one good luck if
you it the the cost of a plane ticket to
Shenzhen is this much so good luck to
that if you don't live in China good
luck to you if you want to go and deal
with Taobao and want to find you know
figure out that thing without getting
ripped off I laid my weeks for the name
of my good and I would recommend
checking out some of his videos that I
think they're crazy entertaining
they're cool so by the way I was in
Shenzhen a week ago no two weeks and I
went to the Sakura your iPod there I
can't I can't pronounce the name
correctly launched on pay or it's it's
literally the you know the computer and
phone electronics market oh my god there
is a full building like it's funny
because I knew that the that the p20 Pro
is not gonna ship with a case nobody you
know you can't buy this phone you
couldn't buy this phone by then and I
brought like five cases like oh god that
that plays is insane and yes it is full
of places for you to replace your screen
you just have to be willing to run a
marathon just to find what you want in
there oh my god run a marathon climb a
marathon like it's it's in it's an
insane amount of floors there there's
there's a building that's probably you
know the typical size of any building
here in New York and it's just for
servers and computer parts and stuff
like that
it's insane um we should probably move
on I do want to tackle these last few
tweets here on the p-n weekly hash tag
from Daniel Aladdin off not being able
to repair your thousand-dollar phone in
some countries does not sound like a
premium experience I agree oh and then
ah so in those countries where you can't
repair that phone the phone's probably
gonna cost you a fair bit more than a
thousand dollars oh yeah and then also
from Renato Laporte car manufacturers
supply certified parts to any shop that
requires them well I can't electronics
manufacturers do the same a good repair
job and I get their hands on original
parts Apple or other om om it's almost
impossible that's a good point
so plenty of comments there make sure to
keep on chiming in for that I want to
get to our next story here the second
Apple story about Korean carriers just
having to deal with the marketing I'm
going to pay up and
pay up for a good airtime for in-store
materials for it's it's the whole King
but all here and they're all
standardized and there there's very few
you know logos that you can you the
carrier it can put on there there's this
a fair shake I guess obviously the key
FTC is looking into this what do you
think you confused me there yeah well I
mean so the carriers are paying no so so
it's it's a little like a car dealership
you know Apple sends over an
advertisement and then it's up to the
carrier to pay the airtime and all they
are apparently allowed to do is slap on
like a little carrier logo at the very
end of the commercial so like say you've
got two carriers and eating in one
market they're showing the exact same ad
for the iPhone because they're wanting
to advertise to their customers that
they have the iPhone and then at the end
there's just a tiny little you know plug
for their carrier and and it seems to be
ruffling some feathers in like again and
mostly in how much this stuff costs and
and who has to foot the bill and all it
does is seem to serve Apple as opposed
to really helping the marketing
situation for the telecoms but I've seen
that in I don't know who pays for these
advertisements in the United States but
I've seen a ton of ads here where it's
the whole full-blown iPhone ad that we
already saw from Apple and then at the
end it's like get it buy it on AT&amp;amp;T yeah
which I'm sure that's not something that
I will pushed I'm sure that it's the
carriers that that you know they're like
okay fine I'll I'll use your ad cuz you
already paid for giant day or
whatever crap you have and you already
did all your homework and everything
responds yes so we have Apple doing
their own advertisement and then at the
end I don't know man it's it's each
country has their own ways man cuz I see
that I actually see more of those ads
then I see Apple direct ads without a
carrier information at the end Oh
totally and and I wonder what would be
the local political or legal situation
involving creating your own ads I mean
look at like t-mobile commercial
I think t-mobile more aggressively
brands product launches lose a win a new
phone shows up on t-mobile
it's a t-mobile commercial that features
whatever new phone might be available to
their customers and I'm curious why that
doesn't seem to be as as prominent a
solution in in Korea why you know we've
got this sort of an Westerner
sensibility commercial which being which
is being produced for European and
American audiences and so we're just
going to take that material and run it
for Korean distribution doesn't seem to
make a lot of sense to me now
unless there's something which prevents
that I don't know if there's something
which precludes them cutting their own
advertisements which I can't imagine
what that would be and I'm just not I'm
not versed at all in Korean law so the
broadcast standards are but it's it
seems like to me like the instead of
complaining about this is the ad we get
from Apple and were allowed to run from
Apple we're just going to talk about our
products and our services on our own and
maybe we feature a product like an
iPhone maybe the brand guidelines from
Apple or just that strict in the
carriers ya know pound pudding if Apple
is putting ridiculous restrictions on
their ability to feature their products
and advertisements for their carrier
then I do think the carriers have a good
faith argument to be made in their local
legal arena but that's also - the same
token is like if there's any wiggle room
or any wrangled room or any legal
loophole in in doing business in a way
that's still in good faith
featuring products in advertising for
their carrier then I would say just take
that opportunity and run with it
otherwise completely devalue the iPhone
in your market and see what you can do -
I know bolster up like a local player
like you know LG could use a little help
[Laughter]
you know remains to be Tinley since the
you know apples growing its presence in
Korea and you know their iPhones are
growing a little bit in popularity at
the very least you know the Apple seems
to be wanting to gain more control of
its narrative in the market there so
doing before before we leave Apple real
quick
hi me I was wondering did you get to
spend any time with a home pod no I I
declined so I I actually I I've spent
time with it
I actually ordered one and I returned it
two days later and the main reason why I
did it is because it as much of a user I
am of apple products I use a lot of
Apple or hardware I'm not really much of
a pan a fan of Apple services and so you
know the biggest limitation with the
home pod is Siri on the home pod is
trash it's it's even more limited than
than pretty much anything like I have a
Google home mini Thank You Jules and
it's just I don't know that is probably
I feel more complete even though it's
significantly less expensive and then oh
my god like it only you it only allows
me to use things like Apple music I
don't like Apple music I'm a Spotify
customer and so if you're whereas in the
Google home mini I could just be like
play my Spotify it'll and I actually can
tell the app this is the music app that
I want to use um and so you know it's
fine for you to give me a speaker that's
$100 that's force that forces me to use
Apple services because I mean hey it's
just $100 but you know like I said in
the daily two days ago I'm like it's a
speaker it's three hundred and fifty
bucks and I can't choose what I do in it
like seriously no thank you
I mean most amazed and your apartment
it's supposed to like bring the walls
away make it a day but I'm not gonna
sing I am NOT gonna use Apple music and
that's just the thing I don't like their
app I you know and so if you have a
speaker that forces me to use your
services than fine could you please at
least charge me a lot less for the
speaker regardless of how much
technology you punch into it because
you're gonna make more money through the
services I mean the the the the speaker
becomes the hardware that opens the door
to the services and so you subsidize the
speaker
with the amount of money you'll make
through that through that so I that's
the reason I'm like I can't even use
this I'm not even gonna review this oh
my god like get it out of here
well I though but that really segues
nicely into Spotify plan and trying to
move into the automotive space do you
think an LTE connected puck for your
Spotify habit would would deliver for
your car for your so here's here's an
interesting you know what I when I saw
though when I saw the news about that I
was like okay I don't understand so have
you guys noticed from your vehicles how
terrible the you know whatever systems
and your cars are I'm rocking like a
mid-level Bose system in my little I'm
sure the audio quality is amazing I'm
asking a the experience ever came in
your car oh yeah no no the the Nissan
touch panel center console thing the
entertainment head is is garbage its
loot cars so I try I Drive a Mazda cx-9
it's a gorgeous car but like the head
unit is like the whole experience of
carrying a phone with it is a nightmare
um not even pairing it so like I I have
like a little USB flash storage drive
just to keep like my daughter's favorite
music
easily yeah well no matter what I don't
have to have fire it up from my phone I
can just punch it in my wife used it for
the first we've had this car for over a
year and my wife used the in - unit to
try and find her music for the very
first time last week the the the drive
that we were in it was gonna take us 15
minutes to get to a restaurant to meet
up with some family and friends and it
took her the entire 15 minute drive to
navigate to play one song from wanna my
daughter crying in the backseat the
whole time and I'm just sitting there
like you've got to learn that I can try
and talk you through it
it was awful it was the worst multimedia
experience I think I've ever seen
watching someone try and do that and
this is what you're supposed to use
while you're operating a motor
motor vehicle so here's a thing I feel
that there is so much opportunity in
this market I just I am really upset at
the fact that if you want to get a car
with carplay or Android auto you can't
get it at that I've noticed you can't
really get it at like mid level or lower
tier you have to buy like an expensive
car if you want to get as features or
you have to feature this in and then or
you know and some of these cars don't
allow both services some of these cars
don't give you the option to use both
Android auto and and you know car play
and so here's the thing I'm like I don't
know exactly what Spotify wants to do
but again the experience right now is so
bad I'm like show me the money I mean
just show me what you're gonna do
I I can't wait to see what you're gonna
do if it's good enough then fine and if
it's not then we'll move on we'll see we
see dory
alright let's hit up on the LGV 35 thing
thank you again thank you I'm now
interestingly enough I believe the V 30
plus which is out right now is being
called the V 35 in Japan for some good
reason I would hope because they're
weird like that
well LG's always had always had an odd
separate strategy for Japan yeah yeah
they had that small V 20 that was
waterproof they then they called the V
34 yeah so you know but let's dig into
this we're getting the stuff from the
Android headlines which apparently is
relying on a very reliable source here
thank you
ai camera and with the camera
brightnesses and all that kind of stuff
obviously
artificial intelligence and
computational photography has been most
obvious I would say in terms of the
integrations going in most complex of
course because i'm dinah philosophy
I'm tired of the time I'm tired of going
to presentations and hearing ai ai yeah
AI battery AI photos AI whatever and all
you know I'm glad that it can tell it's
a plant
why okay so I'll just say this I love I
love it so I feel that smartphones have
this amazing opportunity that typical
cameras can't bring and it's the fact
that they have smarter brains and so I
like this whole approach of pointing my
Huawei phone at something and have it
detect and adapt that's for me that's
true intelligent Auto as opposed to just
whatever color it's metering for it'll
expose or underexpose or this or that
the problem is particularly with LG
products lately I mean I was a big fan
of the V 20 I like the g6 to a certain
degree but then they'll be 30 the V 30
is a beautiful phone
it's a beautiful phone it's great to
handle but you you know one of the
reasons why I didn't even review the V
30s thank you
the 30s would be 30 s plus thank you
you're welcome is because oh my god
there are horrible issues with the
display just the the it's not screen
burn how do you call that like
persistent or image retention image
retention and so if you set up the
always-on display
it'll persist on the UI when you unlock
the phone which was a problem that
didn't happen with the V 30 um and so
I'm like really LG I mean you had all
this time to launch this phone and you
literally didn't fix anything but add
more RAM and more storage
no snapdragon 845 which actually is the
only processor that's capable of act of
being able to push the 10 bit sensor on
that camera so that camera has
capabilities that the processor can't
push and so I'm like what is the point
what's the purpose of this phone it's a
stopgap measure
and it's an it's a fairly apparent and
obvious one which is disappointing from
a company that we've been I mean I think
you and I have been fans of for us
especially the V 20 era yeah yeah when
it came to multimedia really trying to
drive my spare microphone for the
longest time ever since you taught me
that it was that good man totally you
know uh this is this is one of the
things that again this
a cranky conversation like we used to
have about Microsoft back in the day
where we're watching a company with more
than enough potential more than enough
expertise and they're dropping the ball
at the one-yard line down after down
after down after down again I want to be
excited about a v35 because I think LG
could do really well with a tick-tock
strategy don't reinvent the wheel every
year focus on a couple key aspects that
you can improve but keep the overall
platform from what works before but then
you put out this half measure the the V
30s where we're seeing consistency
issues we're seeing QA problems and
quality problems consistency problems is
something that has been linked with the
LG brand since the g4 so if we're not
seeing them improve their it makes us
extremely gun-shy as to what kind of a
recommendation we can give a product
with generation after generation after
generation of problems and terrible
something cameras
I'm a terrible suffocated is like going
back and I was playing with my v10 and
like the dual camera strategy is a good
idea it is so even they say that's a
good idea
they pretty much came up with the whole
idea I mean how so much innovation
coming from LG and it's just this whole
fumbling of leadership and all these
changes it's like you know the company
is so successful in their TVs and
they're so successful selling parts to
Apple but it seems that the company
doesn't it's not putting enough effort
in being successful in everything that
they do they're at their advertisement
needs work they're you know I I wish
that their displays but you know LG is
probably the new Sony I guess where LG
is the HTC of this time well but and we
can add Sony they're where you know and
the reason why I say Stoney is because
how is it that every other smartphone
has a better camera experience than Sony
phones and all the sensors are Sony I'm
like what isn't it supposed to be the or
the other way around and you know Jackie
Chan there you did the wet state right
again
what I don't know I am I'm looking
forward to see what LG does next from
their new leadership and I hope it's not
that this new leadership change is not
an excuse to rush something that is not
well baked well we are six months out in
this so that's I really think LG taken a
knee holding out and refining a product
line until it is like certain ready to
compete and especially in the second
half of the year
I really don't think LG does well trying
to rush to compete at the you know in
quarters one and two if they can get
some good deals on resources chipsets
Ram components things like that and I
think they have a much stronger play in
the second half of the year they can
usually be Apple to a product
announcement and if they've had that
entire lead-up for manufacturing in
place through the first half of the year
then we won't play this will they won't
they game this is the thing that I think
has been killing LG since since the G
since the v20 has been let's announce a
product and then let's not tell you when
it'll ship or how much it's going to
cost for at least six weeks and then
we're after the point where you've heard
about pixels and iPhones so you've
probably already bought that phone but
then we'll finally get the V or the next
G Series phone out and now they can't
even tell us like what the replacement
phone will be the the off-again on-again
rumors that we see for the g7 or the g7
thank you or the g7 S or whatever this
thing is gonna be called or wherever
it's gonna show up I say scrap all of
that have a two-tier premium strategy
that launches you know quarter three
2019 call it you know the the V the V 40
and the V 40 plus yeah we all know that
we all understand what that means you've
got a little phone you've got a big
phone they all have the same features
they have the same chipsets similar
screens same camera stuff and one has a
bigger screen and a bigger battery and
it Bree v8 so much of the conversation
because you're not going to train
consumers to understand what think you
is as a brand label that doesn't mean
any
and you're not gonna you're not gonna
win any hearts and minds with that you
know like no one's gonna see that and
think oh well that's an artificially
intelligent camera system on a
smartphone like it's not gonna happen no
it's not gonna happen and I you know I
just I find this level of oddity where
companies are just so like I I hate to
reference Apple but I think this is the
best example when Steve Jobs took over
the company Apple was horribly
outclassed by Microsoft products and you
know the first thing that Steve Jobs
came to do is like you know forget about
the competition let's focus on being
Apple let's try to do something that's
unique and then we've got every
smartphone OEM oh the iPhone tends got a
notch it's a stupid idea but let's all
get a notch let's all do the notch I
mean are you serious that's the best you
can come up with and see this is the
reason why I like what Samsung is doing
Samsung is not trying to follow ship
they are being Samsung and they are
being Samsung in a couple of interesting
ways you know not just from a design
perspective like the company has really
invested in the whole concept of smart
things I mean we do TVs we do
refrigerators some of these even tweet
I'm sure they're working on the Android
powered toaster behind the scenes that
we just don't know about this and so you
know one of the biggest pushes with the
galaxy s 9 was the whole idea of smart
things we now have a smartphone that
connects to everything and I like
walking into my apartment now it detects
the TV and it detects this and you know
this is the I'm like you know this is LG
makes some of the best televisions I've
seen and their phones don't talk to
their TVs like I'm like really like come
on and it's and it's just fun because
it's just weird because they were the
first company to come up with the whole
concept with the g5 of the friends you
know different things that would
interact with the phone and then this
phone would do this and they come up
they came up with the most awesome
concept for VR with that you know those
goggles and what happened to these
products like what happened to these
ideas I I don't know yeah we've got a
couple tweens here we did get the the
Jackie Chan
an edge from Samantha's from at Danny
Kelly 84 a hashtag P and weekly love the
cameras on my g6 hate the display hate
the lack of updates adding the lame AI
branding isn't going to persuade me to
buy a g7 and again I completely agree I
mean I think there are a lot of
consumers that feel left out in the cold
when their products aren't being
properly supported or properly
maintenanced and then to your point
I'm tired of sort of following the
footsteps of other companies I want to
see companies that are actually trying
to create their own I think your Samsung
example is hilarious because think about
where we were Galaxy S days and Samsung
being like the the most cited brand for
copying Apple yeah you know Apple taking
Samsung to court over UI design and
they've now actually managed to find a
design language and a conversation with
their computers which is unique to
Samsung whether you love them whether
you hate them a Samsung product stands
for something which is wholly different
then I just want to have an iPhone like
device that runs Android it's it's a
unique completely unique and separate
experience from that conversation no and
I understand that that strategy works in
China where people are just so they're
so focused on the iPhone that but they
you know sometimes they just can't
afford it that whatever product looks
like it you know
Oppo changed your strategy in the past
they have like the fine series and
everything and then they realize that
these products didn't really sell then
they started making devices that look
like the iPhone and that's when they
started gaining momentum so I totally
bones yeah well I totally understand the
concept I totally understand the purpose
for it it's just that doesn't really
work in every market you know I think
they should have their iPhone clones for
China and for whatever markets are
focused on that and then focus on
bringing some value and some
differentiation to the market I mean LG
has got probably the most interesting
innovation portfolio that I've seen in
smart phones from the audio quality to
you know the whole concept of dual
cameras in the back cameras I'm not
gonna mention their terrible selfie
camera but just you know they provide a
lot of value value that other OEMs don't
provide any
they don't bank on that they focus on
things that are not relevant completely
so we know you're gonna have to get
going here pretty soon so Jules we
should probably talk about the security
patch situation before before hi my
Hestia bowl oh yeah if you can so like
before we jump in yeah so again the
security research labs a couple of
researchers there have tracked over 1200
founds over the past year and some of
them have been engaging in very at the
very least misleading at the very worst
deceptive practices when it comes to
these patches of course we're talking
about these security patches from Google
2015 after the stage-fright incident
they've been making a big priority about
releasing them monthly and ever since
then some carriers Bart like some
manufacturers barring carrier status you
know having to maintain the update have
been releasing them at a very frequent
pace now what actually gets patched well
that could be related to holes that are
having well created for whatever reason
but they're not all getting patched and
that's the key point here like oh
they're getting patched they're just not
getting any real patch it's just the
software update that's not really a
software update as that sometimes a very
few yeah they just like type in instead
of oh for for the month oh five for May
then that's that's how they are if I'm
reading this correctly it could be say
there was a comprehensive security patch
suite so a number of security issues
were addressed in one major update from
month month that that update might not
fully encompass by the time it filters
through the manufacturer it might not
fully encompass everything that the
consumer gets yeah I mean one particular
example of the galaxy j5 last year or
the 2016 model was actually honest about
this record it had this month's patch
but not last month's or something like
that and then the galaxy j-3 same model
year 2016
claimed to have patches for every update
it received but it actually lacked 12
patches total and two of them were
critical so a big difference there so
we've had this conversation a lot it
feels you know again one of for better
for worse one of the major advantages of
the the closed-off ecosystem of the
iPhone is I find it highly dubious that
we would ever ever be talking about
something like this on an iPhone but
it's happened I mean nothing like where
Apple says hey we fixed to that critical
vulnerability and then they actually
hadn't I mean there have been situations
where Apple products haven't gotten so I
mean I always look at like the Mac
Defender bugs where it took months
months for Apple to address something
that a similar exploit in the windows
ecosystem was fixed in days so so there
definitely are issues there but I
seriously doubt I can't think of a
single time where Apple has published we
have fixed the this exploit and we have
published the the fix out to our
consumers and then that turned out to be
completely spurious or completely false
and and I get it
for EODs it's incredibly disappointing
because OMS are still there is the word
adamant like when something is forceful
yeah yeah yeah they are so adamant about
their user interfaces they want to push
it in your face and then they can't keep
up with the demand or the requirements
of the own poison they've already chosen
I'll give you an example of a company
that does the complete opposite and it's
being incredibly successful Nokia
they're not dealing with that stuff
anymore they went through they went for
Android one where that is no longer
their problem all they focus on is
making incredible hardware and that's it
and you know as opposed to the theory
that every OEM had where yeah we need re
our own user interface for reasons I
don't understand you know no kiss
proving that you don't and they're being
like oh my god Nokia we were covering
the news and at MWC Nokia has sold an
insane amount of phones yeah
you know there were waiting for them to
like fully push the United States but
they're doing a lot of things right
right now and and one of them is just
not dealing with something that they
can't control they don't have the
infrastructure right now to control that
and they just don't want that problem I
mean what's the point of lying about a
saw a security patch why do you want to
deal with that sort of that publicity
why not just get rid of the problem you
know good news yeah a good night to have
here is that a lot he is a component
level and that gets passed along to the
manufacturers and why not media tech
being the biggest offender here with
they produce a lot of low-cost chips now
it's it's noted that Nokia does have
media tech powered phones but even then
they're on the relatively low side of
the missing patch levels averaging one
two three missing patches per device so
and they're in the ranks with Xiaomi and
oneplus which in themselves are pretty
good that just keeping things updated so
you know and good on them but when
you're surprised to see you know HTC
Huawei LG Motorola TCL ZT e ZT being a
particular one in the u.s. because
they've been trying to get things
throwing you know just so that that's a
bad look especially after that recent
law enforcement advisory again CTE and
Huawei to be seeing any kinds of
shenanigans with critical exploits the
company I'd be really interested to see
how the breakdown on individual devices
happens would be TCL because if there's
an issue between blackberry software and
TCL hardware manufacturing then that
could be a very big deal and again for
me having been such a big advocate of
the key one if you want to make me super
cranky really fast a BlackBerry device
that would be the way to do it but that
you start screwing with people's
security patches but and here's the
thing about blackberry I mean has your
q1 received the Oreo update no mine
hasn't so here's the thing I mean what
was the promise that Blackberry made
when we were in their briefing well
actually I thought that they were pretty
upfront about saying we're not going to
be we're never gonna be first to getting
new operating systems out but I have
been a little disappointed recent
with the the turnaround time on
month-to-month updates like that to me
has always been a bigger play for
blackberry was to say we're gonna be on
on the pulse and we're gonna be yeah as
aggressive as we can with these bug
fixes though we might be behind the
curve on the full OS and lately that
hasn't felt like that's been as correct
a lot appraised Misha leaf or the first
maybe six seven eight months and really
good yeah yeah yeah and it feels like it
there's been kind of a dearth and that
kind of news lately so which is odd
considering they haven't been making a
ton of noise we haven't been seeing
rumors about a key to like that seems to
be when a company starts to you know
back off the aggressiveness lack yeah
well didn't we covered the leaks of the
possible key to yeah it's starting to
come out but again it was like you know
what was the codename for the first keen
one that they said this is not our
codename but we'll talk about should
mercury mercury and they're like but if
you guys all that mercury fire that's
called mercury no this one's being
called Athena or something so yeah I
just mean I I don't I don't mean that
there haven't been rumors or leaks I
just mean we haven't seen that same sort
of burning what what are they gonna do
what are they gonna do this is gonna be
like the first hot thing and I I would
expect some correlation with the quality
of software support for a well over a
year old phone as we're seeing a lot of
noise or a lot of information being
generated about its successor and that
hasn't seem to be the case you know
again it kind of goes hand in hand with
the frustrations I have with LG and
Samsung you know you like Samsung it's
almost a parody or a joke for the
company like oh yeah you want Oreo we'll
just wait until the new phone comes out
and that's the best the easiest way to
get the new operating system on your
phone
oh yeah and we'll eventually get around
to updating an older phone too LG just
you might never see any kind of update
there either it's it's critical time on
these bug fixes I've been most
disappointed though and the only the
only shirt
in town seems to be Google what's odd
because LG has started to commit itself
to software obviously just they opened a
freaking software upgrade Center and one
of the new campuses in Seoul and we and
we haven't worked in weeks yeah so now
it's gonna be apparently a priority
they're gonna dedicate the hundreds of
people and needs when already you have
these outfits like show me and like all
the Chinese carriers Chinese
manufacturers too and have the people to
just you know acts away at all the the
crafts and stuff with the the software
updates so yeah oh no this this is
something I don't know I mean do you
think that this is the kind of long-term
conversation that will eventually
resonate with consumers we've got
hearings about data privacy and data
security for Facebook happening at the
federal government level we've got
people who are leaving or especially the
medical conversation saying like hey if
you turn off social media your stress
levels drop do you think that that the
hardware side of this the manufacturer
side of this a story like that could
resonate because I have family and
friends where I don't want them having
to worry about their security setup and
an iPhone now makes a lot more sense for
them who are concerned enough about
their their data and their privacy to a
certain product
I'm glad you bring up the Facebook topic
because news today are that regardless
of all the mess and everything that's
happening people continue using Facebook
like there have not been there has not
been a significant drop in consumers
using Facebook
I guess the have you seen that's the the
hearings the congressional here at I see
the congressional hearings and laughable
yeah but ok so let's ask ourselves the
question why why is it that why is it
the people know that there is a security
threat and they continue using Facebook
I guess so there's this interesting
video from box that I real
like over how you know how that lock-in
works so well how people it's funny
because you know the newer generations
are not using Facebook my son doesn't
use Facebook all of his friends don't
use Facebook for them their social media
is snapchat that's what they use if
anything they'll use Instagram they're
starting to use more Instagram now but
they care less about Facebook the
problem is what them a graphics are
currently using Facebook my dad loves it
my you know my my stepmother loves it
and you know I've noticed that older
generations continue using Facebook and
it's it's one of those things where you
know it's just that that would the way
these companies lock you into the
service where it comes to the point
where people don't care about their
privacy more than they care about being
part of something and so in the case of
smartphones you know the problem is
you've already bought you know somehow
marketing was able to convince you to
buy X phone and in you know in certain
countries buying another phone is just
so expensive and that the cycles where
you can replace that phone will take so
long so what happens if you know that
you've bought a phone from a brand that
doesn't guarantee your security can you
just go out if you're already past the
14 day window and just return that phone
can you go past the you know no you
can't you you're stuck with that phone
you can try to sell it on eBay or
whatever but the problem is you're stuck
with that phone and so you know that's
that's the reason why for many people
I'm like listen if you don't want to
deal with a ton of things just get an
iPhone or get a pixel it's why I tell
people but then the one that's most
accessible to them is the iPhone because
the pixel you can only find on Verizon
you know financing is not always
available and so the converse said the
thing about the conversation want it's
just the problem is so broad like them
fixing the problem is just requires such
a broad solution the question is what do
you do people are extremely locked to
Facebook just as much as they're
extremely locked to that phone that dis
costing them so much money in they that
they can't just get rid of so I feel
that the conversation just like what's
happening with the convert'
congressional hearings and forcing
Facebook cuz you know I was thinking
about the whole thing of
what's been happening to Facebook for
example and I'm like okay Facebook
created a tool that can harvest data and
people freely provide that data and
Facebook has figured out a way to get
people to feel compelled to share that
data so I do agree that Facebook is
liable because they've created the tool
and the business is to share the data
but then you come to the point where
you're like okay yes but Facebook is not
Canberra analytic ah it's not Facebook
that use the data to you know to harm
you know democracy or stuff like that so
you know there's more than just one
person liable what I feel like is you
know oh sorry
um I feel that Congress and governments
should make Oleum liable for what
they're providing and especially in
cases of disclosure especially when
we're seeing a manufacturer operate I
feel they're not operating in good faith
when you say we've we have patched this
vulnerability and then you haven't know
that to me like I I'm actually shocked
that this story didn't come with hey
there's a class-action lawsuit brewing
yeah and so that's the thing I feel that
just this example is being set what's
fit with Facebook should be set with
OEMs where I am have to understand that
they can play as much as they want with
their hardware but software is the
experience and consumers to serve
security and it's their responsibility
to provide the security it's not
something negotiable it's not something
that they could just you know brush off
under the rug if they're if they you
know either you know there's there's a
funny saying in aviation where you can't
play with this in aviation whenever you
go certify an airline for the first time
the phrase they'll tell you is this is
not a business for poor people you
either have the infrastructure to do
this right or you can withdraw your
application right which which also it
doesn't seem to be I mean again I don't
want to say it's a direct causal
relationship but there does seem to be a
significant correlation that a lot of
the devices that are not receiving the
support that has been announced are
mid-range and lower-cost devices again
you're paying for something when you
start buying a premium phone
and the people who are already the most
vulnerable in our society or the people
who stand to benefit the most from
purchasing the less expensive device are
the ones who are being left out in the
cold for future support for future
updates for progress and also making
sure that their data can be protected -
and that's entirely lopsided you know we
look at economies around the world now
it's it's like that's even more
insidious I want to hold those companies
to an even higher standard on the lesser
expensive devices that they put out now
let me ask you a question I mean we go
the reason why I put the Facebook
example and how can bridge analytical
was the one that pulled the data think
about this who is responsible for
Android Google Google okay they've
created this open source platform where
every OEM can do whatever they want with
it or they can abide to whatever Google
is doing and just not deal with it
shouldn't Google be liable to a certain
degree into forcing OMS like listen you
want to use Android it's fine you can do
whatever you want with it but you are
forced to comply with these timetables
and if not you will be banned from using
Android or something like that I don't
know I think it i think we're long past
that time I go GLE in trying to prevent
Exodus and trying to prevent competition
because I mean think about it that now
becomes a corporation's biggest asset
isn't can we build the best product it's
how can we best prevent competition in
our space that's become sort of the
capitalist you know fighting metric I
think that's most used and Apple has a
perfect solution they have a monopoly on
iOS Oh like they have zero there is no
competition for an iPhone but there's a
they've taken responsibility for their
own responsibility for it because they
do have competition for smart phones and
this is also where Google ran into
problems in the way that they originally
entered into this relationship with
manufacturers saying hey you know like
you had Microsoft you had palm you have
apple there are all these different
outlets and a lot of companies were
making software will let you do what you
want but there are some guidelines we
need you to follow for Google
cops but they're only already headed
towards Google they on it's the only
benefits to Google it's not for the
consumer no no and but that's how that's
how they tried to rein in bad actors
yeah because you know Google is a
service what well they still are mainly
a services company not a hardware
company but that's how they would try
and rein in bad actors if you want
access to the best services on the
Internet and people were all about Gmail
and Google Maps and and everything that
they had to offer there you at least had
to abide by some of these requirements
before you put your phone out but then
after that you could do whatever you
want every successive generation of
Android has tried little baby steps to
rein that in I think it's time that they
just pulled the plug yeah you know you
can you can weather the storm of people
running off to use a Tizen powered
galaxy phone you you can you can play
that game and and Samsung would be silly
to just completely abandon Android and
try and convince everyone that their
next phone should not run Google
services on it but what what what I
think is going to be increasingly
difficult is to try and have this
legitimate face-to-face conversation
with consumers and say it's okay that a
ton of players in this space and
especially lower and mid-range devices
are completely not getting the support
that they're claiming - just real quick
on Facebook though for you hi mate in
many markets Facebook adoption has
completely flatlined and we are actually
starting to see a very very small
contingent of users walking away from
Facebook as a platform so we've we've
already demonstrated that they can't
have permanent growth like they're just
a finite number of people on the planet
with computers but we are actually
starting to see the beginning so when
Zuckerberg x'
in front of this committee and you know
they asked him point-blank has you have
you seen a significant reduction in user
activity that's not actually the
important metric it's it's no you can't
show growth you can't you aren't getting
new users on the platform young people
aren't really flocking to Facebook to
use it in any significant or meaningful
fashion and we are starting to see the
very
beginnings of people walking away from
the platform so that that's a bad place
for a social network to be if they can't
turn that around and they'll have to
leverage what's happened Instagram a lot
heavier to keep up with trafficking and
user data yeah they haven't done to a
good extent because Instagram still
relatively insulated from all the other
than ads but they and even if they can't
grow in terms of user they still
had need eyeballs to see the ads that
these providers are dishing out and if
that's the case if the you know growth
is not happening then or if there is a
decline which would be even more would
be the worrisome case because good you
know steady growth it's because you can
still have targeted sub audiences and on
all the I think the the ad providers
would be generally happy if they can get
a good amount of those but if there's a
market decline then there would be
something to be worried about here now
if we were to just toss everything out
and make this a universal standard and
just make sure that all the cbs-tv e's
are covered like involve the freakin
commerce department of commerce
that's get the NS n ist on this and
let's just make that happen let's make
Google Apple everyone else follow the
same damn rules no no I'm not gonna lie
I'm I guess I am happy I'm I'm not happy
with what happened I'm happy that there
is a level of you know that people are
in right now opening their eyes to just
oh my god like social media social media
is great for many things for finding old
friends and for things like that but I
know people that literally only live on
social media that's never but don't have
a life beyond it and it's all about what
you show at the moment and then that's
not you know a lot of people you know
particularly where I'm from it's very
common for people to live a life that
they don't live like but you know a
photo can't really capture your life it
just captures a moment and you know I I
I feel that there should be better ways
I mean I I hate getting on the subway
and seeing everybody on their phone
and it's instead of having a
conversation with the person that's
right there in front of them all they're
doing is chatting with somebody that's
halfway across the world or in another
portion of the city you know and it like
the person across from you is gonna
stick a shiv in you like that's right
but why what caused all this like you
know what caused all this I mean there's
a blessing in their curse I mean I
person who says like III you know I
missed the days when you would just
interact with people on the subway there
are those amazing photos from like
post-world War 2 era
oh you saw that you saw it people just
all have newspapers up in front of their
faces and stuff like that too and you
know you get on you get on like the
metro or you go to DC and you'll see
everyone sort of quietly like keeping to
themselves and it becomes sort of taboo
to be loud or try and you know shake up
someone else's day they might be there's
a certain social team you know sociology
in quote like close quarters mass people
in close quarters as opposed to like a
more open space with transient people
and just like you do a one-on-one with
another person so oh no but that's just
me and my you know not degree happening
there you can you can move on now mm-hmm
but I mean your your point larger taken
is finding a balance I feel between the
communities that we can build for each
other online
you know the echo chamber of the
like-minded is a really safe place to be
but then also being able to engage at
the local level or the community level
or just the face-to-face level again is
something that I hope we don't lose and
and that I feel actually in what's funny
is that I actually feel more emboldened
from people younger than the current
millennial like the generation coming
after Millennials I feel actually has a
better understanding and a better
balance of what to expect from digital
online media in broadcast and how to be
active proactive in their communities
what we've seen from recent political
debates I feel they actually have a
better handle on this then many people
my age and older do so you know again
it's taken us the the the period of time
from the iPod
to the 10th anniversary of the iPhone is
such a brief window to analyze trends
over time in the impact on society but
the generations of people coming after
this coming after this point are already
evolving to better meet the the
conflicts and the problems associated
with this technology and I feel it will
get better from that point to a society
finally figures out what to do with all
this stuff and we've seen some of some
terrific examples of how poorly it can
be used of how of how badly it can be
used in public sphere um but we just
have to weather that storm along the way
you know it's not to say that oh well we
just won't do anything and we'll wait
for you know my grandkids to figure it
out it's how do we meaningfully join the
conversation so the people who are most
impacted by this are better armed to
deal with it when it does rear its ugly
head yeah well I mean a lot of kids get
this stuff thrust into their laps and
just have to find a way to handle it and
ride the bull as it is and well last for
like a lifetime I mean these effects you
know the recession or maybe as or
something like that
that's always something to you know it's
a big deal to be able to just grapple on
to it so yeah this is the station lost
more than a podcast there you go but I
love III agree with your point one I
mean I love that my son is he is against
using Facebook yeah he is against it
like yeah my my daughter has I believe
we're still at four photos that are
publicly visible of her on Facebook and
that's just a family and friends that's
not like public public she has zero
presence on social media I grew up with
zero presence on social media and I feel
like she should be allowed to make the
same dumb baby little kid mistakes that
I was allowed to make without my parents
broadcasting it to the whole world her
imaginary internet points imaginary
internet points I love that is so true
and and as she gets older then we'll
have those conversations that like how
are your peers communicating
each other and how can you join that
conversation and what's the safest way
to do that and I'm not afraid of her
picking this stuff up you know like I'm
not afraid of her figuring out how
technology works kids are pretty smart
um I'm more afraid of having an entire
backlog of years of embarrassing
material that will be easily searched
Crawford cross-referenced and logged
with her not being able to have any say
and how in how it's used exactly
especially from organizations that
profit it from her behavior so so that
to me became again a little of that as
tinfoil hat but not a lot of it as we've
seen in how different companies have
been able to leverage this information
despite Facebook's security protocols
you know what be more tinfoil half of
that the the the theory that having
privacy will be shameful in like the
next 30 years ah I I kind of feel like
that I know I totally appreciate that as
one component of the debate I think
another component of that though is
gonna be privacy through obscurity like
as privacy your roads uncertain at
certain points and in certain levels I
just how much are you going to care to
investigate someone or dig into
someone's personal life or try and find
information on someone I feel like there
is gonna be a multiple pronged approach
to how we discuss what is publicly
available and what isn't and judging
moral compasses on the dedication to the
what levels you're trying to access
information you know I was having this
conversation the other day with a couple
of friends and you know the topic was
why you know why don't I personally use
my Instagram to you know to market
things I it's a trend it's what a lot of
people are doing and I get it it's just
I find that so I find I remember when I
was in college and you know just my my
the teachers were like you know we have
to we have to fly this trend of of
marketing on social media it's the new
boom and everything and I'm like oh man
like can I please go somewhere where
something is not being sold to me you
know can I just be can I okay my
Instagram just be a normal way for me to
I don't know show what I'm doing but not
necessarily with the purpose of selling
you something but that's the thing you
know it's just these companies are just
so focused on selling and selling and
selling and I get it I mean I get it
it's just I for me it's irritating no
doesn't this I mean because I'm I'm
right there with you like I I've never
done a sponsored post on my Instagram
yeah I actually know what my ad metrics
should be if someone were to reproach me
for that you know and I know how much I
should charge it's a I feel the next
phase of social interactions on the
Internet
will have to come from a company who
doesn't crowbar in monetization after
the fact mm-hmm
so many of these things that we're using
today starting from the friend stirs and
the classmates.com has been let's build
a cheap free service let's see how we
can make it cool and then once we reach
some sort of tipping point then we're
gonna cram in a bunch of monetization
schemes the the worst of which usually
is how can we traffic user data yeah but
on top of that just like how do we force
more ads into your timeline how do we
rearrange your timeline so that you're
not seeing information that's topical or
relevant to the time that it was
published in instead what I what I think
we'll see for the next phase Internet
4.0 will be how do we engage in a
profitable endeavor a service that can
generate income and be clear about that
intention from the very beginning so
that consumers know what they're getting
into and ok I'll give you an example
Amazon I mean I know Amazon is a
shopping mall and I will visit Amazon
whenever I want to visit Amazon because
I need to buy something but I'm not for
to deal with it unless I follow them for
some people then and I know that Amazon
can be smart let's come up with the deal
of day or the deal of everything and and
you know now you follow Amazon by choice
but you're not being spoon-fed more
Amazon and I'm not saying they don't do
this because they do but we're not being
spoon-fed this by the people that I
follow because they're getting money for
it yeah yeah couple of our people on the
YouTube chat say yeah they agree I hate
how we've turned ourselves into brands
and how we feel we lacked of value you
don't have for that so there's that
major major part of the conversation in
these Facebook hearings is Zuckerberg
literally saying like it's a free
service and they signed the licensing
agreement when they agreed to have you
ever met if ever read I mean see here's
a motion for the next law dear companies
can we please get a quick and simple
basic this is what you're signing
nobody's gonna read that User Agreement
that's the first thing that needs to
change in the in in in the countries
it's like shoot I have a duty be are
like are you kidding me nobody reads
that I love it give me a second and I
love it how Windows does it I love it
how Windows does it like whenever you're
activating your Windows computer you get
the you love and user License Agreement
and they're like you can choose to opt
out but then no windows oh yeah you can
totally make that choice the choice is
up to you and them just cited as a
knowledgeable consumer what was right
for you I'm actually gonna I'm gonna
screen share this here real quick and
I'm trying to keep the the YouTube page
public see that you can see it this is a
yeah yeah this is actually broadcasting
correctly so oh my god what is this I
don't know it's looks to be
I'm not sure if Juan's a audios cut out
on the YouTube feed could be
can you hear an increment no I can't one
you there I mean it could be but uh yeah
I'll just hear hopefully he keeps on
talking so that I can cut in tune or
there yeah why we lost you for a bit and
yeah no he's talking yeah just doesn't
know we can't hear so I think I think
yeah I think you should I know it's not
that it's any time I screen share and
I'm not also clicked on hangouts then
hangouts locks op so that's not a
YouTube issue that's a hangout so okay
so what is this you're showing us so so
in 2016 the Norwegian consumer council
did a live word-by-word non-stop reading
of all of apples and third party and
user licensing agreements on the average
iPhone and it took them 32 hours to
complete the live reading of what an end
user licensing agreement resembles when
you buy a new iPhone but they have to
switch in people for this of course they
did or I don't I don't know like again
the the what they were showing here is
sort of like you know a compressed
cutting cuddy version of that but
they're they're actually trying to read
it and that that stack of paper next to
her is the printout of what you're
agreeing to when you're when you're
signing up for and this is this is for
the iPhone this is actually a company
that we hold up as as being pretty good
about privacy only about their consumer
protections see that needs to change I
understand the whole purpose of of being
like you know I used to write user
manuals for a company and at some point
you need it to make sure that everything
that you wrote covered absolutely all
the possibilities I get that but really
like I don't think any of my any of the
manuals that I ever built I wrote shoot
I wrote seven manuals I don't think any
of the manuals that I ever wrote for to
be used on an airplane
are as thick as what you need to read to
use an iPhone mm-hmm mm-hmm so and I so
it's it to what benefit if you wrote a
manual and you had important information
that yes or a contractor needed to know
would you expect them to chew through 32
hours of reading to get the information
that they would need to complete and so
obvious reduces ability but having a day
and a half's worth of reading material
in any breaks without any breaks knowing
that no one can get through it all no no
that isn't correct it is to me that is
incorrect
yeah but anyways just prevent all the
class-action lawsuits from happening in
the first it's funny I was only here for
an hour but I am loving this
conversation we can end it on that one
if you want I mean I was a pretty good
stopping point because okay or actually
no here let me let me throw this one out
here real quick - did you guys actually
watch the the John Legend oh can I can I
be omitted from my opinion on this no oh
man I love contradictory beings uh guys
have you watched that video well that's
that's why I asked is it's the story are
you getting the story of the stuff I'm
sorry I've been filming so many I mean
one your camera expert I've been
reviewing pretty much every phone and I
love the pixel to death don't get me
wrong it's just I don't know how a video
like that is possible without manual
controls I okay so here's the thing
we're not impressed by the pixel the
pixel is irrelevant to what made this
music video look cool you know it's the
same problem I had when that and I
forget who did it but a tech outlet
compared the LGV 30 and it's log capture
high-quality 4k video files against a
red camera and Wow look amazing
great this phone does in competing
against the cinematic camera and then we
saw a whole bunch of gimbal tracking and
drone shots you're not impressed by the
V 30 know if V 30 is irrelevant to the
conversation you're impressed by the
fact that you got this amazing aerial
drone photography the camera is is
completely secondary to the conversation
of the thousands of dollars of platform
that went into supporting that camera so
I totally believe that you could using
the stock camera both although I doubt
they did they probably used something
like cinema 4k that's not it's just I
don't think it's possible I mean first
of all for those of you that have used
because here's the thing if that video
was good was shot in daylight I would
have been like yes all right fine fine I
could believe that but when you shoot on
a smartphone camera sensor I like one
phone that does an amazing job and I say
it is the iPhone the iPhone 8 iPhone 8
plus or the iPhone 10 I feel like people
don't know that there are clips in my
samsung galaxy as 9 plus review that
were filmed on an iPhone 10 4k at 60 I
am incredibly impressed that what that
camera can do but here's the thing all
those clips whatever I used like 6 or 7
Clips within that video
they were filmed during the day you
can't get that level of quality at night
the sensor is just too small the lens is
just too small
to be able to provide good quality video
without the the constant jitter that it
does trying to autofocus because there
are no manual controls look at this this
is this is why I mean let me try and
screen share again and see if my
computer locks out don't you know when
you go into this it's not showing the
video joules it's as soon as I click off
of the window and hangouts it locks up I
mean don't show the video because we're
gonna get copyright I've paused it and
I've got all the audio cut off and
everything into but the reason why I
pause it on this frame here is because
you can see the overall blue light tone
then when we scroll down and we actually
see the conditions that they were
shooting in they had that entire set
washed in the same kind of light but
look at the actual phone screen that
they've got that
look that's not that's not no that's not
the the pixel camera app right so again
look at the rig that they put the pixel
on I mean you're talking about the
stutter that you get in low-light
environments which is true with a lot of
software processing and the the software
image stabilization which works with the
hardware image stabilization you would
get that little low-light shift yeah as
they're trying to blend frames together
but you're not gonna see that when
you're on rigs like this and then with
races with a tribe of huge 50-pound
tripod weight brakes on top of a brace
on top of the brakes fine I'll give him
that
I've you know there are vlogs that I've
done with it with a with a gimbal that's
I'll give them that it's just like the
the the cradle that that foam is in is
probably twice the cost of any gimbal
that you sure I'm sure I'm sure but what
I'm tracking panning and slider
mechanisms that they were on right and I
get that what I'm saying is fine it's a
music video there's there's high
production they I mean there they won't
use an expensive red camera manually I
mean they are they're also mounted in a
very expensive tripod and things like
that so I'll give them that
the problem is I is the camera really
capable of capturing low-light like this
because you know what the camera will
start doing the camera in met in Auto
controls will stop dropping shutter
speed with that with that you know and
so if you look I don't see any light
flashing of the lights I don't see any
of the typical things that a smartphone
will do once it starts going into grain
okay that's that's just it is is like I
I you know again I I wholly believe that
they used the pixel hardware for for
shooting this music video because
they're not really in low light they're
they're they're I mean look at when you
look at that photo of what they were
using on that set that set is washed
there is a get on of blue light for the
for the camera sensor to utilize it to
your point and then we also have to
wholly believe that there is a
stur amount of back-end post-processing
video editing color correction and
everything else to try and get that to
try and get this looking consistent in
uniform even with them shooting under
manual controls so so literally what we
have here is the pixel camera sensor was
used to shoot a music video the pixel
camera sensor in hundreds of thousands
of dollars of stabilization and movement
hardware and then hundreds of thousands
of dollars of lighting and grip and
electrical and then hundreds of
thousands of dollars in post-production
was able to shoot a pretty decent
looking music video and I'm sure and I'm
sure they had to adapt some sort of a
lens I mean and again I don't I don't
know maybe maybe not I mean when I look
at that rig it looks like they might
have just been using for a lot of these
shots it looks like they could have just
been using the pixels standard glass one
picture from Google's the keyword blog
and they have a whole bunch of uh you
know just puffy text to promote the
pixel with like with freaking John
Legend saying I love using pixel like
they're pulling an iPhone there I love
using pixel to talk to Chrissy and Luna
while I'm on the road like that's this
is all what it's about like this is this
is the part this is not billboard this
is not for Bill this is for Google
they're like this is there's there had
to be some sort of cross section between
John Legend's agents and whoever else or
the label and Google saying let's let's
come together and make sure that people
know about Google and not about iPhone
and that's my opinion
oh well thanks you got a tweet from
renato Laporte which again it's kind of
the same thing you know the world's
first full smartphone movie is talking
about someone shooting the movie on a
smartphone and then he's got a photo
which again we're talking about multiple
thousands of dollars on a cinema quality
lens in an enclosure which probably cost
a couple thousand dollars for the rails
and connectors and the the box that goes
in front of the lens to act as a as a
light filter and and all of this kit
which goes into it and you're like we've
gotten to a point the camera is kind of
irrelevant
you know you didn't shoot a movie on a
smartphone you shot a movie on cinema
great gear it's not the rent it's like
the red smartphone that's coming it's
modular and once you snap everything you
can snap on that thing it'll be great
yeah you know but you weren't walking
around like oh man this shots so amazing
oh look I'm shooting a movie this is
gonna be in theaters Wow look at this
like that's that's not what's happening
there and and and it's such an obvious
play to me like why I get cranky about
it is because like you you're you're
making people feel emotionally good
about buying a pixel look they shot this
amazing music video on the phone that I
have in my pocket isn't that amazing and
you're walking now what no a good pun
well then um but but that's that's
irrelevant to the conversation of
shooting a cinema piece of material when
you make a movie you're using movie
grade components to get that movie done
and you're using the tremendous amount
of Education and experience from the
people who are designing the lighting
from the people who are doing the sound
from the people who are doing the
choreography the cinematographer
everyone every piece of that chain has
decades of experience yeah so work
around the compromises of using a phone
as in the final capture medium or the
final capture story you know what a good
example of this my Castelluccio wff WFAA
in dallas he had a whole bunch of just
like he's produced a series of reports
feature reports or maybe even breaking
news were just on from his iPhone and
that this was back in 2013 when iPhone
was starting to get into that great
category that that hot category so yeah
and this and this is a guy who's adapted
to many changes in the industry he's a
veteran in this so being able to adapt
to that is just one of the ways that
like the whole media industry has to you
know just follow on and make sure that
they are able to take the money that's
coming in and also take the technology
true true true so anyway I just like
that's the last little buyer beware I
wanted to throw in there your smartphone
cameras really good and you can do some
amazing things don't get me wrong
we love our pixels we love our pixels
there's nothing wrong with the phone
it's just not a red camera right and
it's not a cinema camera and that's all
oh my god I can't even give you examples
of using in a 6300 and or the the
Panasonic g85 which I've been using
lately and you just you know unless you
invest on some amazing thousand dollar
lens don't expect much from it if you
use the camera as it came from kit and
don't expend much for me like even then
it's like well do you have soft boxes do
you have lighting do you have flashes
what kind of what kind of tripod head
are you kind of specific result are you
looking for it that makes it look
perfect
100% perfect to your eye at the moment
that you need it like sure like you can
get all that I can I can I can dump a
Hasselblad in and novices hands and
their photos will probably still look
about the same as the photos from their
phone that that has always been a truism
it's just we're now starting to see the
flip of that you know where the consumer
grade technology's gotten really good
when it comes to when it comes them when
it comes to photography I have to agree
when it comes to video there is still
more to do well yeah I I mean I see what
you're saying there yeah that that's
that's when when it comes to photography
I you know I I went to the Vatican I had
a g6 in my hand which was a prototype
and I had an a 6300 with a with a good
35 military meter 11.8 and there came up
where I was like you know it I'll just
keep using the g6 I you know I
there were even photos where I found
that HDR which was only available on the
g6 would capture better dynamic range
insert shot
then I could with the a 6300 so I ended
up choosing the phone just because not
because the phone could do a better job
than the camera when it came to hardware
but because the software enabled things
that even the camera can do like ADR you
know and we're definitely seeing the
software processing argument being made
pretty heavily by a lot of companies out
there right now yeah yeah well um I
think that's as good a place to stop as
any man I'm glad you know let's keep
going yeah for the conversation let's
just keep going so so folks again I want
to thank all the people that were
