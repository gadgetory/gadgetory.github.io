Galaxy s7 along with some dates AT&amp;amp;T and
Microsoft seem to have finally figured
out some software updates in Android 6.0
marshmallow continues to reach more
phones I'm Jaime Rivera and it's not my
fault that my son just made me watch 21
Jump Street for the first time this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with Microsoft and AT&amp;amp;T believe it
or not finally another oleum that's not
Apple is going to be able to update your
phone without the need of carrier
intervention the whole windows as a
service updates are going to be pushed
to your phone from Microsoft and AT&amp;amp;T
will have nothing to do with it and I
just hate the fact that AT&amp;amp;T makes it
explicit but these are non certified by
AT&amp;amp;T updates which is just horrible
since that means your iPhones have
non-certified by AT&amp;amp;T updates as well
but yeah anyways apparently that's
apparently going to start with a TMT and
more carriers should follow as soon as
they pick up more Lumias by the way
we're talking about the Lumia 950 for
now other official news that have to do
with software updates come from Huawei
as the company is also pushing Android
6.0 marshmallow to the honor 7 but hear
me out here apparently it's only
available in certain countries like
India to start and you have to sign up
wait two days to get approved and then
you're getting your software updates so
apparently this is some sort of a beta
test they're just not claiming to be so
just beware and for those of you avid
whatsapp users me included it seems that
the company is already testing a new
video calling service right now you can
make phone calls through it you can also
send voice messages in addition to text
messages obviously but yeah it seems
that video calling is coming very soon
but we're not sure how they're planning
to deploy it and believe it or not even
though most of the news have drifted to
the Galaxy a7 we hear that there is a
galaxy s6 mini in the works which we
assume will eventually just be dubbed
the galaxy s7 mini and they're just
diverting the leaks but anyways
apparently we're getting a snapdragon
808 processor here and edition two gigs
of ram 16 gigs of non-expandable storage
and apparently a 720p display as for
every galaxy as many in the past
it's not really a bad phone the only
problem is its timing let's see if it
ever happens and finally the very hot is
today half again to do with the galaxy
s7 because things continue to shift here
this apparently the galaxy s7 even
though will look identical to the galaxy
s6 will be a tad larger it seems that
it'll be 5.2 inch display instead of a
5.1 inch display and then we will also
have the plus variant launching
alongside of it apparently this phone
will have curves but it seems that it
won't be an edge variant meaning that
the curves will be at the back like the
galaxy note5 which is rather interesting
this will be a 5.5 inch display on this
larger unit makes some sense it seems
but we don't really hear much about the
edge counterpart making us wonder if the
edge variant is going to wait until
later this year you know to launch
alongside the refresh the galaxy s7 edge
Plus and this is just a mouthful let's
just lead to the question of the day if
you had to pick which one would you want
the smaller or the larger galaxy s6 if
you only had these two variants to
choose from in my case I would wait for
the edge variant later this year but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends as always
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on
parking out comment subscribe triking
