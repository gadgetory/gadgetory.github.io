weekly hello and welcome to episode 13
of the pocket now weekly once a week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss what's hot and what's cool in
the world of mobile technology
smartphones tablets and especially today
phablets I'm your host Michael Fisher
senior editor at pocket now I'm joined
as usual by our editor-in-chief Brandon
minimun good morning to you sir good
morning and our managing editor is back
anton d Naja good afternoon to you from
America and greetings from Romania thank
you it's great to it's great to share
the airwaves with you again Tony it's
been a little while it's good to be back
I'm still recovering from my vacation
but it's good to be back bet you are
yeah how did you enjoy your week away I
didn't even ask you that it was
jam-packed was it yeah indeed it was i
thought i'd had some time to defragment
my brains and to plug in myself to
recharge a bit but unfortunately no
plans deferred from the reality oh that
that does happen in a good way or a bad
way unfortunately in a bad way oh crap
I'm sorry that's things just follow up
and lots of things to do lots of things
to take care of and everybody wants a
piece of you so yeah but now I'm back
and now I'm recovering from navigation
remember the ad the days of defragment
in your computer yes how horrible that
process was and watching like it cuz I
had to run my Defragmenter in das i
think was 6.2 i was running on my first
pc and like those you know that that
cursor like the hard drive was
represented by those little rectangular
blocks in the girls were the cluster
Buster's yeah yeah I and like they would
change color as the defragment was
awesome and of course today with
solid-state wraps we don't have to but
but did did max need to be defragged
when a mechanical hard drives I feel
that every every mechanical hard drive
has to be too fragmented in order to
optimize the placement of the
information I mean it's moving heads on
spinning disks the less the movement the
faster the hard drive right yeah I I
remember there being some Defragmenter
apps offered I just figured that it was
a good question though brenner because I
thought that I may be iOS excuse me OS
10 or the mac OS handled you know
writing two drives differently than PC
but um let's hope we've got it we've got
a ton of stuff going on here today
including some really really boss
listener mail at the end of this thing I
mean the listeners brought some awesome
awesome stuff so I want to get to that
but there's a ton of stuff between here
and then they also at that's some rotten
eggs and potatoes no they all know they
love us this week it's grid so it's all
boss all the time to haul boss that is
boss i love i love that word that's
gonna be like a new people word like it
used to be fat yeah bad he and a fresh
as well oh that's that's you think fresh
is coming back I'd say it is if I have
something to say about it yeah that's a
good one not a good one it's very clean
and you know fresh what it is and then
um what I have no idea what you're
talking Oh slang um let's uh both
Brandon minim an end Anton today have
have some pre news and editorial bits
that they want to bring up so that's
exciting to me I Brandon why don't we
start with you in the editor-in-chief's
corner ah it's finally got a name is it
sort of got this he a week name sorry go
ahead nice thank you um yeah so so real
quick or maybe it won't be real quick
who knows how it turns out um I was kind
of thinking about the galaxy note 2
because there's been so much fanfare
about it there have been so many events
there have been so many there's been a
lot of news about the galaxy note 2 and
Samsung is is pushing this i think maybe
harder than the galaxy s3 if that's even
possible if not as as as you know firmly
as they did you know it's gonna be on
all carriers it's gonna be unadulterated
with with no carrier branding except for
on the back and it's a really big device
for samsung and rightly so i mean it's
it's it's beautiful Hardware it's its
innovative it's really really smoking
fast Michael's been testing it and we're
gonna have a review up probably by the
time you you listen to this and I had a
thought um I've used the note we all
here have used the note to Michael use
it the most
and there's something unsatisfying about
it so I still really like to write stuff
down and just yesterday I was writing a
list and you know 10 years ago I would
write stuff down all the time because we
didn't have you know smartphones to type
into and so forth but it was kind of
different for me yesterday cuz i was
writing down a list of topics and i was
thinking to myself you know what i would
love if i could search this list but its
its analog i can't do that i would
furthermore I would like to rearrange
this list and short of using an eraser
that I didn't have on my pen it's
impossible to do so so the note 2 is
this awesome opportunity to bridge the
world of analog and digital and it does
it in some ways but and I haven't used
it as it as my daily driver so i can't
really I can't really say whether this
is the case but I think there are some
ways that the note 2 could be better and
and of course there are some software
features and I want to ask both of you
what you think would be killer features
that would really bridge the analog in
the digital but the first thing I want
to say is the thing that comes to my
mind is the reason I like to write
things down is because of the tactile I
like the friction on a piece of paper
when i get when i get the galaxy note 2
stylist in my hand and I write on the
screen and it glides along the screen
and it's almost like on a skating rink
even though they've increased the
coefficient of friction or whatever it's
still not like writing on paper and I
wish that there was some screen
technology some hybrid mode where like
when you pull out the stylist the screen
like becomes textured like a piece of
paper and I think that would be
incredible and that would that would not
only make it feel better for the user
but it would help the software because
it would slow down the stylus pen and
perhaps let you write more accurately um
so so I want to ask you guys what do you
think what kind of feature do you think
Samsung would have to bring forth or any
OEM to make it make the bridge from
analog to digital really complete um
well I don't have a specific answer it
right at the moment I will in a second I
just want to say you that was a entirely
awesome thing that you just said all of
that I agree completely with everything
you said regarding phablet
in general and the note to specifically
what the same person right yeah we are
ABI apparently um thank you yeah no I I
would never have thought of the of
changing the texture of the display even
though I wrote a piece on that recently
when the stylus comes out and that's
entirely possible because you can do
that with with the with forthcoming you
know touchscreen technology they just
apply a voltage you know some kind of
current across the display that changes
its perceived texture now it does that
too for fingertips not necessarily for
first I lie but you know that these
things are going to be possible if
they're not possible right now they're
going to be possible in short order so I
think that's one of the greatest ideas
I've ever heard with regard to a
note-taking device or a a stylus
equipped mobile device well I'm Tony
Tony what do you think I'm not sure
about this texture thing I mean it would
be a good thing in terms of feeling what
you're writing down but I'm not sure
it's doable right now because all of our
screens are protected by an extra layer
of glass maybe how about to include a
small vibration rotor rotor and motor
and the stylus itself and whenever you
are acting with the stylus on the screen
it will emulate some vibrations like you
you feel on paper but that's not what i
wanted to say initially what I think
here's what I did a couple of years back
when I was running a beach see there was
a software which allowed me to create my
own font and I've created my own font
out of my own handwriting not because I
love my handwriting but because i love
handwriting fonts by the time i think it
would be possible with such devices to
create your own font and not only use it
device while but creating your own fund
from your own handwriting would allow
you to search your input in a note
brandon said that once you write
something down you cannot search it and
you cannot rearrange it well you can
rearrange it by copying and pasting the
bitmap itself how about writing it down
the system recognizes it as your
handwriting font and it's instantly
searchable as a font hmm right right I'm
trying to think about how that would
work because
it will probably be an initial setup
process where the system would ask you
to enter with your own handwriting a
couple of letters may be the entire
alphabet and use that just like Siri and
s voice are you are learning your voice
it would continuously improve and learn
your handwriting style your inclination
the shapes of your letters that and that
way it could transform your input into
text and it would be searchable so what
you're doing effectively is drastically
improving the effectiveness of the
conversion to text yes because it
already knows what a you know what a
Tony a looks like you know good oh that
is cool that that seems possible today
with software yeah it does it's awesome
it definitely does and yeah I like I'll
notice when I'm inputting text with the
S Pen on the UH note to like I'll make
kind of repeatable errors where mistakes
were like I draw my e really stupid
right and the software always thinks
that it's you know about an a with an
accent mark over it or something like
that yeah but most of the times your
input is recognized because as far as
I've seen your S Pen lessons video which
was a great video and if you guys
haven't watched it you go online to our
YouTube channel and watch it thank you
you can input with your handwriting say
you write an email say hi Tony your
voice sucks this morning and you write
that down with your with your S Pen on
the screen it will transform it into ya
text above how about it would leave it
like that but still recognize it as text
and be searchable oh IC which me yeah
but just a quick side note there that's
when you see me actually writing
successfully in that S Pen video it's
because I'm trying really hard it's not
easy to do especially in a situation
where especially in a real world
situation in a video those are
controlled situated circumstances you
know I'm like I want this to work now I
don't want it to work now so that I can
demo how it doesn't work if I'm out on
the street and somebody's trying to give
me their phone number whatever and I
want to write it down because that'll be
faster than typing it in for some reason
it's it's really really hard to do I
think that's great if it learned your
handwriting over time let's not forget
one thing guys I'm not sure about you
but I can speak for myself in this
technology era I almost forgot how
to consistently right with my hands
because I'm non stop using my keyboard
and my devices if somebody gave me a
piece of paper to write the statement
one page long I'd probably I don't know
oh yeah had a sore hand have you try was
just gonna say my hand actually cramps
up earlier now remember in school when
you would have to write all day in hell
yeah now it happens after like a half a
page I'm like are my mind like writing
muscles atrophying and my phone yes
ridiculous so that's amazing and then
and then once in a while you hear
someone like the New York Times there's
someone on their radio talk radio
mention like the lost art of writing
stuff and I'm like who the cares who
cares I can type so much faster than
I've ever been able to write mitch's who
can actually understand what it is that
I'm tough and I mean just on and on and
on like yeah I understand that there's
like an art of calligraphy and you know
the handwritten note there you know back
in the 50s when they did that 60 said
whatever like I maybe just cuz I'm yeah
i was born in 1986 i I just I don't care
about the death of Henry and I think
it's a good thing this is the same an
argument I was making with regard to two
books and I know that's a whole
different argument or whatever and but
ultimately what we're talking about is
communication right and if you are
receiving my communication in a manner
that I can compose it faster and I am
more comfortable doing I mean then what
how what difference does it make how it
is delivered listen I guess you know
communication might be there might be
two facets there's a communication
should be effective communication should
pass through an emotion or some sort of
sentiment and you could argue that
writing with your hand you can somehow
convey sadness or Alicia more personal
yeah sure yeah I mean definitely and
I've written note i've received notes
that have like certain words it's not
very obvious that they were pressed hard
into the with the perfumes and the
lipstick kisses and stuff i need to
start getting the notes that Tony's
getting that's a yeah yes I love in me
and that sounds exciting uh why don't we
why don't we hop on over to speaking of
not that had Tony what I understand you
want to talk about waiting this morning
yeah I've recently became a waiter but
not in the
serving dishes Garcon kind of waiter but
in the type of waiter that the person
who waits a lot lately and just to keep
it short I'm waiting for ice cream
sandwich on my galaxy s3 wait I am image
giving therefore for jellybean I'm sorry
i'm also waiting for jellybean on my HTC
one x i'm waiting for the android update
on my nexus 7 i'm waiting for my iphone
5 to be delivered and i'm still waiting
for nokia bell featured back to on my
808 PureView so yeah this makes me a
waiter but guys just think about this
are we why are we so eager to get these
updates I know Michael touched upon this
to podcasts or free podcast before this
but why is this I'm checking for updates
every two hours am i paranoid that
that's so interesting that's an
interesting thought it's like everybody
has it and I don't so so either is your
question like why do we keep hitting
refresh as it let me guess sure okay
right right right i think there's two
different answers to that I think it's
just like when you just a second just
like when you copy paste something and
you command C or ctrl C like five times
yeah it's like enough to do it once but
we're like five times yeah well I think
that a big part of it is what you said
like I mean every you know not everyone
else but that we perceive everyone else
as receiving these updates like you know
it gets talked about the internet take
it slow leak there's news stories
whatever or dot one dot two is out some
people have it it's like there's that
instant if you don't have it there's an
instant feeling of I'm missing out on
something I need to be able to
experience this for myself I don't want
to see somebody else's video and their
hands on and whatever so I think that's
that's the that's the geek answer like
from a broader cultural perspective that
that might be actually that might be the
same answer in turn in both cases cie
unless there's a feature I'm really
waiting for I don't I don't care i still
haven't received jelly bean on my galaxy
s3 cuz it's a verizon version and I
don't you know yeah mines global and I
still don't have it really yep Wow but
I'm waiting right you're waiting yeah
well you're a waiter
uh no I don't know you know I think it
goes back and forth for me if there's a
feature I'm really waiting on then I'm
then I'm really excited about it if
there's not if it's just like bug fixes
and incremental stuff than I don't care
I don't I don't even look at that
refresh screen you know Brendon how many
times you hit refresh in your devices
well I go step beyond that I care so
much about updates that the day after
the announcement of a new version of
Android for example and as someone rips
around from like the new Nexus or
whatever and then they poured it to like
a device totally not intended and
there's warnings like phone doesn't work
Wi-Fi doesn't work nothing works I'll
still install it because I I want to
experience this new operating system
enters crazy and and and Michael you
mentioned sort of this this aspect
there's there's the geek reason for it
and then there's a cultural reason for
it and I think we've been retrained in a
way I mean people generally generally
like newness and change well I shouldn't
say people like Jay people don't you
people like newness when it's two years
is up on your contractor 18 months it's
time to get a new phone you take at home
you you stare at it from across the room
you love it and software has an
interesting can can do that in a way and
we used to be in this two or three-year
release cycle like back in the 90s
there's windows 95 windows 98 when we
started to get used to this idea of new
software bringing new features and
bringing newness and then something
changed in the 2000s we started to get
yearly updates and then in some cases
updates that were occurring between
nearly updates just that the point zero
point zero point X updates at added
landscapes support or something like
that like on the Nexus 7 and so people
have that emotional attachment to
software updates like they do with new
products that they take home because
their two-year contract is up so and
then they and they become kind of
addicted to hitting the refresh button
cuz they want to get that it's kind of
like a high of seeing the new features
yeah it's almost like it's in the same
family of feelings as receiving at
notifications all the time where there
have been you know stories written after
like like story upon story is written
where it's like are you experiencing
smartphone addiction like because every
time you look at your phone and it's
blinking you you experience this little
my new wave of like oh oh somebody wants
wants to what what you know so yeah
that's that's it i think it's not a
different
scale I think I think that's like a
micro feeling of getting a major
software update it's like that that
emotion of you know having some sort of
experience that is you know it takes low
it's low effort and it's free you know
right yeah it did I miss something you
did the did the nexus 7 get landscape
support did I is that what's rolling out
mm-hmm wow I really got up I've been up
and I had my head in the galaxy note 2
for a week I haven't even picked up my
Nexus 7 um that's uh that's cool that's
really a profound thoughts there Tony I
hope you get some updates soon man
that's a lot of updating on me too yeah
and before we go into a note to land I
just want to ask you something adjacent
to updates did you get that update which
enables the multi window feature haha
uh-huh uh-huh yeah I sure had yeah how
do you like that I really curious about
it so if your listeners don't know what
what this is that the galaxy note 2 was
announced but before it was released
samsung was like check out this awesome
dual screen multitasking that you can do
on the galaxy note 2 and then it was
released in south korea and it was
released and you know in an unlocked
form and you know it didn't have that
feature so Samsung was quick to release
a software update that turned it on a
couple days later and I was so busy that
I almost didn't notice it and then it
was like oh software update it was like
oh good well maybe this will stop
TouchWiz from crashing and it did fix
that problem TouchWiz now no longer
crashes but it also it brought this new
feature so that's it's awesome and it is
awesome I talked about this interview
and listeners this we mentioned this
already but the galaxy note 2 review if
it's not up it's going to be up very
shortly after you hear this so you're
getting a little bit of a little spoiler
a little preview but the what what you
do with this is quote samsung calls it
multi screen samsung love's calling
stuff stuff like it can't it can't
launch a new feature without a name and
sometimes they're imaginative and
sometimes they're really not but so
multi-screen you are called it s window
and i figured that's what they were
going
you know it's like s window s pen s
voice what you do is when you're you're
running the device like say you're in at
the home screen you just press and hold
the back button and it opens up this
little dock on the side of the screen
which is scrollable and it contains
about I don't know maybe 10 or 12 apps
these are the only apps that are
available for multitasking it's kind of
like the kyocera I don't want to say
this at all but this is a little this is
true it's ads them true in the best way
possible it's like what the kids have
tried to do with the echo except it
actually works well there are more apps
available for it like for example
Twitter and Facebook are supported and
what you do you if you just pick one of
these apps from the dock you just tap on
it it opens the app full screen but if
you click if you press and hold and then
drag one of the apps onto the screen
while another app is running it will
open it up in half the screen so all of
a sudden like right now I just did it
and I've got my gmail running on the top
half of the screen Google Maps running
on the bottom so if somebody has sent me
an email with an address I can look it
up in maps I could essentially it's
using the the bigger display size of the
note to very intelligently because this
5.5 inch display is more than big enough
to to display two apps at once so is it
like be like having two displays two
separate displays in landscape like I
don't know hvga or 2w vgs one above the
other in landscape mode well well what
about the other or one next to the other
like its portrait Nikki type you have
either one and you know what it's like
it's like the snap feature in Windows 7
that they brought in in vista or 7 or
whatever it was so you've got you know
one app on one side of the screen
another app in the other side of the
screen and they both the best part about
it is they both run like butter I mean
there's no lag there's no delay there's
no indication that the phone is
struggling at all even though both of
these apps are not only running at the
same time they're both in focus at the
same time like jumping between them you
don't have to like you don't have to
specify which one you want to work with
they're both active all the time I
wonder why they weren't able to do that
on the note 10.1 which like literally
pauses the app and then restarts it
after 35 seconds uh oh yeah that's right
i forgot about that in the review i
don't know i will have to to act like
maybe leave this for deficiencies
yeah maybe they will Mabel brings the
note to 1001 the only thing that I have
found is that when you're jumping into
this for the first time like after a
fresh food I think maybe like I'm pretty
sure and I haven't verified this so this
might not be true at all but it seems to
me that this would be the kind of
activity where the phone would clock
that XO knows you know quad up to the
full 1.6 gig hurt you know it seems like
a pretty intensive application right and
i'm sure it's using almost all that 2
gigs of ram but i feel like maybe
there's an initial delay when you first
enable multitasking after a boot because
there's i was trying to take notes in s
note while I had the like Facebook up in
the other pain and for like the first
five seconds I tried to do that the pen
inputs were lagging by like five seconds
mmm I was like what are you doing what
would to know you're you're so good
what's the matter and then it was like
oh yeah no I'm awake now so it was just
to that but that's that's the closest
I've gotten to erroring this out on our
multitasking no question yeah uh these
kind of features excite me because
anything to increase productivity while
on the go is awesome can you give me a
couple of use case scenarios where this
has improved your experience on a mobile
device yeah this particular feature like
like in what cases is the split-screen
helped you um the the first time I ever
used it right after i installed the
update i had just i had facebook open
and my buddy just moved to chicago and
he was he took a picture of this like
logan square sine I don't know where
Logan squares in Chicago so I kept
facebook open I dropped maps into the
other pain and i just typed logan square
chicago and while maps was figuring that
out i was back in facebook like re
looking at the picture and then it
popped up and so on one pain i'm looking
at where he is on a map in the other one
I'm looking at the photo he just took
from that location you know what i mean
so it's not that's not necessarily a
good productivity example I mean it's
more like social it's entertainment I
know but it's you know that was that was
really cool to me for the first time
being able to do that um but you can
have your your email application in one
window and your by donal browser and
another one so you can just he send an
email while you're
browsing we're checking out the URL and
vice versa where you can have YouTube
you've only got 10 or 12 apps that can
use this is this gonna be open the third
parties or well new ones be added you
know I think that yes Samsung there's
been some some noise made about that and
I hate it when manufacturers kind of do
that because I don't hate it but it's
like oh yeah we're gonna open this up
and devs are gonna be able to write
stuff forwarding them whatever and then
kind of wouldn't nobody wraps it says
nobody writes yeah exactly but I think
that as a solid chance of happening with
the note 2 if it is in fact opening devs
but the apps that are that are enabled
for to chat on Chrome email Facebook
gallery gmail internet Maps messaging s
note google talk twitter video player
and youtube so honestly that's a really
really neat exactly and another thing i
was doing was I was watching YouTube I
started a YouTube clip and I'm just
watching YouTube in one pain while in
the other one I'm like you know reading
email from Tony you know it's like it's
it it brings the experience of using
this device so much closer to a desktop
computing experience I think we lost
more things I lost you for the last five
seconds oh you did Brenda news you lose
me as well uh yeah I lost you but it's
it's recording on your end so it should
be fine right okay um well so I'll just
say it again and maybe I'll get it back
it's it brings the experience of using
the galaxy note 2 so much closer to the
desktop computing experience in in a
good way which so so I asked you in what
cases would you um would you benefit in
terms of productivity just to answer
that question just look at what you do
on a laptop or desktop so you have your
chat running while you're on the web or
you have your email client open while
you're on the web or um you've got your
twitter client open while you're you're
I aming but yeah you know it sounds like
you know because of that limitation of
the 10 or 12 apps and I wonder if like
if the system checks for some sort of um
parameter before allowing it to show up
in that menu because like google voice
and that would imply that Google worked
with Samsung and I doubt that's the case
it's got to be something about google
voice that allows it to work in the
multi window mode that's uh it's talk
not google voice sorry oh yeah so even
the applications are being tricked into
believing that there
is a smaller resolution available and
they max out to that smaller resolution
which is depending on portrait or
landscape the width and half of the
height or vice versa that is as close as
I get can get to a normal explanation
you know you might be right on that I
mean that seems like a simple solution
and it seems like maybe that's what
they're doing here I'm not sure what the
nuts and bolts are I just the
implementation is really really good and
another thing that's kind of in the same
family as this and some people probably
think this is less impressive I think
it's really cool you guys remember
pop-up player from the galaxy s3 how you
you know start a video and then pop it
up into like a little screen on screen
window and you could watch your video
while you were doing other stuff yeah on
the galaxy note 2 they have samsung has
has taken that concept and applied it to
the browser so i have my default browser
set to the pop-up browser meaning that
if i'm into twitter feed which i'm
always in i'm always looking at Twitter
on the phone and there's always links in
tweets cuz you know it's like us we post
stuff in it's like hey I just wrote the
story here's the link you can click on
the link and that pop-up browser will
open but it won't take over the window
it just pops up in a little window by
itself you move the pop-up browser
window over wherever it's out of the way
while it's loading the page and while
it's loading the page you just continue
in the twitter feed and when the page is
ready you go back to the pop-up browser
you read the article and you can make it
full screen or you can exit it when
you're done is this bubble browser a the
special browser or is it grow more to
stop browsers I think it's the stock
browser it is the stock browser in in a
smaller form the only kind of downside
to this is that when you maximize it if
you want to go fullscreen it always has
to reload the page uh-huh I don't know
what that means though I don't know why
it would have to do that like it loads
the full page it's not like it's loading
a you know a mobile version or anything
like that it loads whatever you click on
in that smaller window so I don't know
why it has to reload every time you you
take it into full-screen mode but that's
a minor inconvenience it's just another
one of those things where it's like hey
we have this huge display let's not just
scale up Android elements and make it
into a huge phone let's actually use it
for something useful and that they're
both really really handy features and I
love it it's just just just just a
endlessly surprising to me how much more
utility this device has then I kind of
expected it to how much you were against
bloods I'm most against you I was only
against him if you were a commenter
looking to pick a fight with me and then
I became against phablets magically I
think for some some guys are so enthused
about the phablet concept that even
using the term like they they seem to
think that it is a a pejorative term
like it's an insult and it's like no
it's just a phone tablet hybrid it's a
cute name for a for actually what was it
what I thought was a lame concept when I
first heard of it but which actually
makes a lot of sense and let me tell you
guys you cannot take this device out in
public this without being asked about it
Brandon you remember this we i met
Brandon in New York City last week from
AT&amp;amp;T event we were not out of the subway
station 25 seconds I'm walking down the
road with the galaxy note 2 because
Brandon wanted to see it we're kind of
playing with it and this like woody was
heated red traffic cop yeah its traffic
I was like oh is that the galaxy is that
the new galaxy which has become the
default thing for any Samsung Android
products like yeah and then we like he
wouldn't let us go like we talked for
like six minutes about this he's like
taking out his s3 is like ha man yeah i
mean i got the s3 but man look at this
see i was out at a bar last night
because it was a horrible night and i
needed to go to a bar late at night and
I'm and fortunately there was no iphone
4 incident but I'm playing with the
galaxy another burner that's like three
people talk to me inside the space of
three minutes I'm at dunkin donuts the
coffee shop this morning waiting for my
sandwich to show up I'm somebody's like
hey wow that's that's big what is that I
was at a brewery recently a girls
there's absolutely nowhere you can go
where people are not going to ask you
about this device because it is huge and
you get to a point where you're so
comfortable holding it that you're like
wow I forgot how huge this devices and
the public has to come along and remind
you so funny it's amazing it's uh but
yeah you definitely can't have a moment
to yourself when it's out in public
because it'll be funny for you to get
back to a 4 inch rise up 4 inch screen I
don't know if I want to I think it well
yeah yeah you're right it and finally
because I know we have to move on it
makes the experience of holding my
galaxy s3 it makes the galaxy s3 feel
like a miniature
phone now and I'm not even being like
I'm being a little jokey but that is
entirely correct it when I hold my
galaxy s3 now it feels small and it
really only took me about a day for that
transformation to happen and that's
strange I think that says something
frightening about us that was so so
instantly adaptable but yeah anyway look
for the look for the full review
listeners it's going to be on the site
very soon if it's not up already and
it's uh it's quite an impressive device
I like it quite a lot what does I'm just
checking again again for my update on my
Nexus 7 and it's still not here so I
took that opportunity to check all of my
updates nothing yet but I'll keep you
posted and and Anton and tony is still
waiting nice to the waning can you just
tweet that periodically like every hour
you just tag every om so while we're
talking about galaxy products and high
SPECT ones at that I just read the story
this morning the galaxy s3 alpha has
been unveiled or galaxy s3 a which
apparently is a galaxy s3 variant that
is physically identical on the outside
but has the same specs internally as the
galaxy note 2 which is to say it's
running that X knows what is it 4412
quad running at 1.6 gigahertz instead of
the 1.4 of the original yeah and then 2
gigs of ram instead of the one that
shipped with a lot of versions of the
Visigoth history wow I guess I shouldn't
be surprised but look at you go Samsung
you're like uh what you I mean III don't
I don't I don't get it I maybe is it
they're just doing this because they can
or what well I it's is it coming to
Europe or us I this is this is in Japan
on carrier NTT DoCoMo but as Tyler
settings and commented cheers man and in
the comments it's also available in
Australia that's right so what I think
of this is that whenever Samsung came up
with the galaxy s3 the Exynos processor
in that format
didn't support LTE and this is why US
carrier Ryan's went with a Snapdragon
processor dual core and LTE but as the
as they continue to improve and they
launched the knell to that quad core
4412 processor which is the same
processor by name but I think they made
some tweaks that supports LTE and the
faster speed and now they're just using
that for samsung galaxy s3 which is okay
for them but as I said myself and I will
repeat it I will be so pissed if I had a
u.s. Bryant with a contract on a US
carrier but that's whatever yeah
whatever we do in this world will you
buy something now and the two weeks from
now it will be old ya know it's true and
I don't know how I feel like Tony ends
this post don't you wish us for a
variance packed the 4412 quad and LTE
instead the dual core Snapdragon you
know I don't know if I do I it seems
like every instance I have and I talked
about this little in the galaxy note 2
review because there is a little bit of
lag on the note 2 at points very minor
don't get don't get all crazy but it
seems like every single time I test an
ex anos quad-core chip and then I test
the the Qualcomm variant with the s for
the dual core one outperforms the other
one and I'm not talking benchmarks I'm
talking you I it seems like i don't know
if it's this crate versus cortex thing
you know or or what but you know it's
just i'm always more impressed by the
qualcomm running version so i don't know
i i'm not i don't have a massive desire
to get more quad-core hardware in the
states because it's android even do we
even know if android is fully optimized
for quad-core yet and in jelly bean that
is a good question yeah knows knows i
don't know i mean that's actually
there's actually even more to talk about
with that because in a second with this
with another nexus device announced with
it with it with a Qualcomm processor but
before we get there can we just touch on
the the galaxy s3 mini oh my god I'm so
disappointed apparently everyone is so
I'm yesterday I've got my head
I'm banging away in this review and I
just noticed Twitter explode for a
second I'm like what why is everyone mad
on Twitter what's going on apparently
samsung is guys correct me if I'm wrong
Samsung has created a device that looks
like a small galaxy s3 but packs and
none of its specs is that right yeah
that's true what's the deal here we're
looking at you love the big
disappointment is all about I don't
think it's about the specifications it's
it's about the samsung executive going
on record one day prior to that or I
think it was the same day the specs got
leaked and he said on record that the s3
mini will pack the same specifications
as the S free so normally everybody gets
excited and in-your-face Apple 4 inch
higher specs here's the iphone 5 killer
and then a couple of hours later we see
the leaked specifications and it's just
mini so it's s3 mini half of everything
yes free hats yeah it's got a dual core
associate from erickson from st-ericsson
at 1 gigahertz 1 gig of ram a 5
megapixel primary camera vga webcam 16
gigs of storage with microSD battery is
1500 milliamp hours and it's jelly bean
and it's expensive oh yeah it's 515
bones Wow and then there's a picture of
it in the wild yeah um yeah it's such an
opportunity to do a killer device here
yeah I mean ninjas another like industry
to our category defining device like a
of a pocketable really fast really well
done hi res screen phone but yeah woge
wvg come on WCAG a come on I could build
a better phone in my garage yes I did
you wanna yeah we should have a video
segment on that can we do that a 10-week
video series Brandon minimun builds a
mobile phone in his garage you know what
really pisses me off not the fact that
the s3 mini has lower specs because it's
a smaller phone probably the the target
audience is different what this is me
off is the fact that they are using
heavy dog
who's barking here is not my dog the s3
they're using the s3 moniker they're
trying to capitalize on the success of
the galaxy s3 by naming this little
fella the s3 mini and to get back to
your post Michael with the dilution of
the galaxy brand this is the perfect
example on that you're absolutely right
I mean they're not satisfied simply with
with diluting the galaxy brand name now
they want to dilute every iteration of
the galaxy brand name and actually they
started doing that with a note to at the
note 10 dot one which I I get that's a
different thing I actually kind of don't
mind that because I understand what
they're doing with that but look at this
yeah that this is absurd nice what
happened with that I'm sorry you guys
what happened with that naming
convention we heard from Samsung last
year with the s being the high range
high-end the M and the why why couldn't
they just name this the galaxy I don't
know why to or or M something they're
naming it as an S phone which is
high-end but this is far from high-end
it really is I use a surprise us it's
getting announced today and you know
maybe yeah maybe the maybe they put
misinformation out there to lower
expectations that would be crafty of
them I that's it's you know what though
it's not the only tiny phone samsung is
bringing to market I was originally
gonna talk about this in a second but
let's just let's just get out of the way
now the the galaxy music looks to be a
phone that's kind of in the same size
range so this is it's called the galaxy
music once again it's another galaxy
product and I love Steven shanks
headline samsung announces galaxy music
one weird little android because it
really is it's this um I thought it was
a music player I thought it is i think i
think it's an mp3 player which makes
phones right but which one calls right
yeah it's but i thought it was that um
the 5-inch the galaxy player with the
top and bottom speakers because it kind
of looks like that in the photo until
you realize that it's totally small its
listeners if you haven't seen the story
it's a little tiny little device that
has cool colors and it has speakers top
and bottom of the display which is cool
and
also a rumored or so far unconfirmed
projector I've heard some reports that
there was something on the press release
but not in the renders the world did
that get the bunt it hasn't been updated
but it yeah they from the story it says
it gets weirder the official specs
samsung released also mention a galaxy
beam style wvga PyCon projector but yeah
I think that's probably a slip up on
somebody's you know somebody didn't take
that out of their galaxy beam document
when they converted it to the galaxy
music but it's a very unusual phone I
think the most interesting thing to me
besides the fact that it seems to have a
hardware music button which is
interesting is that it is a phone like
it looks like a little personal media
player and they tacked a phone onto it
which of course begs the question as we
asked first at Berlin Tony and then in
New York City last week Brandon why
can't why couldn't they just put a phone
on the galaxy camera yes then then
things would have made sense the world
over mm-hmm then then they would have
called it the 808 PureView they're true
yeah 808 PureView s now that galaxy
camera that that's how i'll refer to it
that galaxy galaxy camera we stop there
God yeah yeah yeah keep on wondering
about this music but I mean you you get
a phone in your hand and you press the
dedicated shutter button then you take a
picture and you somebody of your friends
has this small little music phone and
you get it from him or from her you snap
the button and it starts playing music
yeah it starts plate like the other
trying to take a picture of you and it
starts playing the most embarrassing
track it starts playing like did the
spice world album from from the Spice
Girls oh that was I mmm that was a
pretty good album i have to say anyway
okay did you get see the movie i was
horrible horrible horrible a favor
that's that's that is true uh let's talk
let's stop talking about samsung galaxy
products because it's getting confusing
the next Nexus device one of the next
Nexus devices
probably going to be an LG made device
and you know what what I feel a lot
better about this than i did I I was yes
need you yeah yeah I think I think Tony
has an i-told-you-so moment when I first
heard about this I i let out that long
grunts of displeasure and I use a
filling a lot of negative emotions here
but you know what it looks pretty
awesome I love what they did with the
backing I love the fact that the front
and back panel look to be completely
flat it looks like a Galaxy Nexus and
and it it's it's got a design that I
don't think we've ever seen before and
plus it's going to be running stock
android lg cannot screw this up the
designs good the software is going to be
I think it's gonna be an awesome phone
wow wow bold bold words I i think it's i
think it does look like a Galaxy Nexus I
think you're right to a degree it's like
a galaxy nexus with a shinier bezel and
a back that that is actually really
sci-fi and really really cool yeah um
but it's not like when the Galaxy Nexus
was announced I was like oh bullet
that's a cool design it's not but you
know it's not really doing a lot it's it
it's not quite minimalism either it's
just like there's not a lot here to look
at so okay whatever who tell me what
were you gonna say I'm sorry when I
usually protect or defend Apple
everybody calls me a fanboy but I've
been known to protect and defend LG and
I'm a fan of the brand and I keep on
giving them one more chance one more
chance and my last one more chance was
the optimus G I'm yet to see how that
phone performs but from what i see this
nexus 4 or whatever name will be is a
modified version of the nexus of the
Optimus G and it looks good LG has
improved a lot in terms of their build
quality and materials used and as
Brandon said it's it's it has no
applications or user interfaces
proprietary to LG to run on top of
Android to screw it up so it's google
software on a nice
I wouldn't say very nice design because
it looks exactly the same as the Galaxy
Nexus and the nexus s so I think this
might have a chance of succeeding but
then here's the but I think and this is
my personal opinion this will be the
only Nexus phone will see you do you
think yeah there won't be any other
Nexus devices long snout this at least
not officially wearing the Nexus brand
good i think google might or might not
adopt other phones in the AOSP project
like they did with the sony but
officially Nexus phone I think this will
be the only Nexus phone we'll see i'll
leave my words but this is what I think
right now that seems reasonable it seems
confusing for the consumer that watches
the Nexus brand if there were like two
or three of these things yeah um and and
I I would Oh God well there are there
are several Nexus devices on the market
already though right I mean you've got
the tablet you know that the end and
there's usually like the nexus s and the
Galaxy Nexus did coexist for a while on
the market there so but I get it I I
know you didn't want to pull a galaxy
right is what you're saying yes but
never the same release in multiple OEM
made fights yes if they are that
different generations but from the same
generation there's always one very true
yep I have a theory on why Google went
with LG on this nexus I would love to
hear it cuz I'm confused me too yeah
yeah it would seem like an unlikely
combination to given that it given that
LG's sort of a fourth-place player here
but it's in google's very much best
interest to have a strong LG because
right now samsung is owning and then
behind them we've got HTC we've got
motorola who you know is now owned by
google of course and we'll probably see
a nexus phone for motorola soon but it
hasn't been that long since they bought
the company and then we've got LG and
and right now I don't think LG has a has
a good a good brand image generally
speaking and if they can improve LG's
brand image they create a stronger
fourth player or maybe third or second
player and competitions really good an
Android and in
and it's in sync Google's best interest
to have as many strong partners as
possible so you think they're well and
look at what they did with with a sous
yeah you know outside of tech circles
and and people who buy you know note
windows notebooks not a lot of people
knew the ax Seuss brand name before the
nexus 7 came out you could probably make
the argument that they still don't that
as sous branding is very minimal and
very tiny on the on the nexus 7 but you
know there they have a stronger market
position mindshare position than they
did before so that's completely valid I
think you might be right they might be
going a little out of its way to be like
hey LG build our next awesome thing so
you can be a little more awesome so that
this ecosystem can continue to thrive
because with that good that and not only
that i think google is them is making
the smart move here they're showing some
love to every OEM for what thirsteth was
HTC then it was samsung twice and not
sure what happened there now it's LG i'm
not sure if Motorola will ever have a
nexus phone again this is my personal
opinion I'm not sure why but I don't see
any motorola Nexus devices and it got
too they've got I told you this will not
be the motorola Nexus and I'm right
again maybe next one but I think they're
showing some love my money is on Sony
for the next Nexus yeah well it wasn't
sony for the next thing now no way let's
actually make it can we make a bet at
some point because i get we will i will
just say it we will see a motorola Nexus
device before we will ever see a sony
Nexus device that's what I that is what
I believe what would it okay do you want
to bet some palinka did you say I'll bet
you some American West Virginia
moonshine against some Romanian polenka
okay you're on it's a long story long
story Berlin tales oh not the topic of
the topic of the podcast now haiyan
mother'll on a related note or so lose
weight on a related note i'm drunk know
what guys
evidence to the the I have to remember
these things LG Nexus 4 has a 1280 by
768 screen apparently resident of 720 so
it's it's higher res than the most
android phones out there the vast
majority of them which i think is it's
not that early pixels it the the
difference will be taken up by the
on-screen buttons right but if you
compare it to the Galaxy Nexus which
already has like you know the bottom 40
pixels taken up interview you know you
can you get maybe you get back maybe you
have a true 1080 x 720 and then the
buttons that's probably what it is oh I
just and I missed a little bit of a
speck here I thought that the LG Nexus 4
here was shipping with a Snapdragon s4
just regular but it looks to be possibly
shipping with the s4 pro bro ya encore
oh man that's that's another gonna get
excited yeah yeah well in we we haven't
seen one of those or handled one of
those in the wild yet right I devices i
only own the device powered by this bro
chip at the moment is the LG optimus G
which was announced like one and a half
weeks ago yes it would be it'll be
really cool to see how that performs cuz
um yeah anyway well we'll have to see
what that what happens there to to wrap
up the the android news of the of the
week google has done this really
interesting thing and i'm sure the
timing wasn't explicitly intended but it
certainly is a happy accident if not
google has implemented their biggest
street view update ever this is tony
this was your story you've got it like a
ton a list of countries here that are
now supported in Street View I think
they were working on this and they were
planning on gradually releasing it but
seeing that Apple is right now writing
little bit drowning a little bit I think
they just stick their hand place it on
Apple's head and push them below the
water again yeah I completely agree I
mean that normally this wouldn't even be
a story I'd want to talk about but the
fact that Google is doing it now well
and while Apple is like embarrassed it's
like little
look this is what you all missed exactly
it's kicking them right in the face and
like go ahead go ahead run oh how I was
gonna say something you do you did that
you do that sharp intake of breath
youryour it is very easy to tell when
Brandon the man has says Reeve when we
livin I was just gonna ask if you guys
have ever seen a sighting of a google
street view car several you have yep
several no I never have oh that's cool
it's got to be creepy tena that thing
looks like a robot doesn't it didn't
have that big ball on top yeah without
making any any commercials or ads here
I've seen a couple in my hometown they
were some opel corsa small cars they had
those 360 camera that on top and the
glutes of cables and strings and on the
sides they had some cameras too and then
I saw them and Hungary and Poland so
I've traveled a lot in Europe and I've
seen like four or five times the google
street view the google maps cars wow wow
wow imagine that job just try to drive
around oh yeah 1,000 miles this month i
would love being even either awesome or
terrible horrible it would be like being
a trucker I imagine except without as
much stress probably well yeah but
imagine this if you are making the maps
with your car how do you get how do you
find your wave in a city that's uh
that's a solid point there until then I
take this opportunity to tell you that I
still have no updates thank you for
being the thank you for the persistent
updates on your lack of updates um let
me just scroll through here this did the
thing this is this actually kind of
nicely segues into into iOS because I'm
tired of I don't know about you guys I'm
tired of talking about mapple gate I I
hate that term but when they'll be
invented it Stephen did what Stephen did
oh I didn't know that oh that's awesome
you have to love it well now I like the
term now I I just I'm just sick of it I
don't hate the term based on it its
merit I'm just you know so tired of it
continues to be newsworthy and I got my
first real taste of it this past weekend
when I ran into my whole family and many
of whom you know a couple of whom have
apple products and my sister as asking
Blake is like carrying her iPad around
the house and is bothering me while I'm
trying to talk to somebody else just
like how do I down how do i downgrade
and I'm like what are you talking about
Lexi know and and and she's like yeah
I'm like what do you mean and she's like
I hate the the maps they got all messed
up I'm like oh wow really hold on let me
let me see what you're talking about
because I now she's got your attention
exactly and she just would not stop
hating on it and then I go to the
brewery that same day we're having and
we're in the tasting room of this beer
brewery people are asking about my
galaxy note 2 conversation turns to
smartphones and these total strangers
are just talking my ear off for 15
minutes about how much they hate the
maps on their new iPhones and until this
past weekend until these experiences it
didn't really register for me just how
much regular people were annoyed by this
I just thought I didn't necessarily
think it was just geeks but I know geeks
tend to be a lot more vocal we tend to
really you know hate on stuff very
loudly but no regular people really
really hate this stuff so it's really
interesting to see it's really
interesting to see that this story that
we're developers apparently tried to
warn Apple about these problems with
maps before iOS 6 officially dropped
which this was a this came to us from
cnet via BGR it looks like we're
developers actually were just emailing
Apple employees directly saying you know
finding all these bug reports and they
either didn't get acknowledged or they
got acknowledged very rarely and it
seemed that Apple was just really well
aware of these maps issues and was just
dead set on going ahead with iOS 6
anyway what what do you think happened
here I mean you think this was a
planning failure do you think this was a
stubbornness did something specific go
sour with Google really quickly like
what no i think is i think that apple
back back back tout from the google
relationship in terms of maps and that
particular discussion probably happens
somewhere way before iOS 6 got gold or
public and once they started seeding
beta as to the
Uber's and testers their relationship in
terms of maps was second to none so I
mean no this was non-existent mmm still
late for them to say okay our maps suck
let's get back google maps because they
already burned that bridge down all
right yeah that I don't know it's it
it's a shame to see that happening I
keep thinking that I keep telling people
in between telling them like yeah listen
here's this leaked app that gives you
google maps functionality but only about
a fifth of it or you know download bing
maps or you know whatever i keep kind of
trying to give people hope with their
new shiny iphone 5s i'm like no it's a
great device just you know Apple has no
choice but to make maps better as fast
as it can so that's what they're going
to do so it's gonna take some time but I
feel like you know I feel like they're
gonna do that I feel like they're gonna
really bring it because they have to
what are you going to do you you can't
have a smartphone a top to your
smartphone without without a good
mapping program no they will definitely
improve the question is how will user
survive until then and I yeah I I here
in my home city in in Romania I'm using
navigation only when I want to compare
phones or applications and there is no
problem with iOS maps here in my city I
mean navigation is okay the streets and
their names are accurate I can navigate
without a problem from point A to point
B the problem is you cannot find point
point A or point B by searching so the
p.o eyes are the problem because if you
long tap and hold on the on a certain
point and you navigate to that point it
will just get you there without a
problem the problem is when you search
for something like museum like the
shopping center there's no POS so if you
know you're going from this point to
this point it will route you but if you
don't know where you're going you're
just tapping in I want to go to the
museum it doesn't know where the museum
is this is that's interesting because I
think Brandon and I ran into that issue
a couple times in New York City last
week then
we had talked about wanting to do this
maps off right where he I'm running at
an android phone he's running an iphone
and we're like let's try and navigate to
the same thing but I couldn't do it
because i was on 18 tease 3g network in
the city on whatever that was a Thursday
afternoon near rush hour and there's
just no network capacity no room for me
yeah but but but a good indication i was
on 18 t2 but over LTE and it was working
so that's a good indication of course ya
know AT&amp;amp;T LTE LTE network is rather boss
if you don't mind my saying so I I love
that word using it I am so surprised by
how quickly ATT at that's kind of silly
because verizon is absolutely everywhere
but um it was around here where I live
it went from like in the course of two
days it went from being nowhere to
everywhere it was like two weeks before
the iphone 5 came out and now i can't i
can't go somewhere in my day-to-day
commute that doesn't have LTE which is
just great they're not great yes it will
be nice to get back on LTE the the
speaking of the iphone just got to wrap
up this the iOS segment here which is
very short this week not content
apparently with beating up Apple over
its Maps issues some people started
reporting this Purple Haze nonsense
which is I don't know brand drugs yeah
it's it's actually a really good beer
too but essentially what this is is lens
flare and I don't know why people just
decided to start hating on the iphone 5
4 4 experiencing lens flare problems
when as consumer reports did demonstrate
it via some testing every single
smartphone camera is susceptible to it
even regular cameras are susceptible to
it all you need to do is watch the 2009
JJ Abrams take on Star Trek to
understand what lens flare is because
it's in every single shot as a stylistic
choice I think the problem is not above
the lens flare itself but the purple
haze but in what the hay is surrounding
the flare like yeah whenever you get a
bright source of light just a little bit
outside of the frame it will of course
turn into a haze now whether it will be
purple or pink or another color depends
very much on the sensor depends very
much on the glass or material used to
protect the camera lenses itself right I
i've been i've been taking out my phones
like a moron and shooting into the light
like against every photography
principled out there just to prove my
point that i'm not defending Apple every
smartphone does that and I have no no
doubts to say every the word every
because cameras and these smartphones
are still not high end okay dado a curve
you aside the problem with the apple
purple haze is that somebody somewhere
somehow shot a picture into the light if
that happened with another phone we
wouldn't be talking about it but it's
rattle yeah and we need and we need the
community needs to bash Apple at all
costs and this is what drives me crazy
what idiot took a picture of the Sun
like imagine that how the desert like
why don't you just go into a dark closet
take a picture Billy I can't see a thing
it's so dark in here this is this is
amazing like I mean it is stories this
is a maybe 150 word piece from you Tony
about the purple a support document says
it's normal and common there are like
there's just endless endless threads of
comments after this like people yeah you
hit it on the head time people love love
to just destroy apple and each is a
reading our sort o tons a flagman in my
direction you know that's true too yeah
you're as you what did you say in the
email this morning you are the the
sacrificial goat yeah the sacrifice goes
right man I tell and there's it probably
ask you before I forget I'm sorry let me
ask you on those other cameras that you
tried it on Tony is the haze the same
color is it that's exactly what I was
going to say the problem is I have
proven to them that the haze is there on
the galaxy s3 the haze is there on the
One X there is a slight haze also on the
808 PureView the haze will be there and
in this case it's the same purple haze
on every smartphone I've tested what
what the first is the amount of color
and discoloration which this induces
into your final image
is and the iphone 5s don't have that
right you don't afraid because you are
waiting I'm still waiting yes well I
think the moral of the story is besides
you know stop looking for excuses to
beat up on Apple is everyone don't take
pictures of the Sun right or a menu that
you just live with the consequences
right because if if i recall well every
camera manual which i have read says
that it's not healthy to point your
lenses and your sensors towards the Sun
because your pixels might die eventually
exactly exactly just like your retinas
so leave it be let's jump into Windows
Phone before we get to reader mail we
have seen what we've now seen what Nokia
is doing and what Nokia is doing with
the US carriers I think it can safely be
said we have two stories of carriers
announcing windows phone 8 devices
t-mobile usa's and is releasing the
Nokia Lumia 810 which is correct me if
I'm wrong the Nokia Lumia 820 just yet
with a different number and probably as
support for those AWS bands that
t-mobile uses and then verizon is also
announcing their nokia lumia 822 or not
announcing i think that one's just
leaked but in any case that is 820 right
with a different number and this jives
with what someone told me at at in a
discussion recently somebody who I don't
have mentioned but who had some
knowledge of Windows Phone plans who is
kind of very very careful in saying
nokia has only announced the 824 you
know for blah we have no comment on any
other model numbers or names for other
carriers it's like oh this is what you
guys are doing you guys aren't this
exclusivity flap with the you know the
920 on AT&amp;amp;T maybe we'll see how that
plays out but really if they wanted to
and if things worked out they could very
easily just release a 925 on verizon if
they wanted to
ah that feels good I know it's true
isn't it I hope it's true too it seems I
hope that pans out that way but it looks
like initial indication so that that's
they're going to be playing the model
number change game depending on what
carrier they nokia has not only that if
i was a verizon customer waiting for the
Lumia 810 or a 20 or a 22 I'd be pissed
because this thing is ugly like sin oh
that is just good pointing look at the 8
and windows okay the 810 is is nice
sharp corners rounded edges but but the
822 I'm sorry I'm sorry and that's not
my money um at the exactly this is what
the this is the other thing Twitter blew
up about the other day where I was like
why is the boys the feed moving so fast
o people are complaining what are they
complaining about oh this ugly phone oh
wow yeah this is not pretty it looks
like a hobby man hey it's not that it's
got a chin I mean Chin's are like not
cool anymore makes it look tall and CLD
i like i like chins but not a chin like
this where it's got those two nested
curved lines in the corner if listeners
if you haven't seen this device like the
back of it actually makes it look like
okay what it's another rounded pebble
with Myrtle yeah we haven't really seen
the rounded pebble design aesthetic in
Windows Phone so I'm like okay whatever
that's that's okay and then you look at
the front and it's like oh well that
those rounded edges don't really work
too well with the tiles do they and yeah
but imagine this they will at one point
complain or ask themselves why on earth
aren't they selling phones why isn't
Windows Phone catching up because of
this well it was just verizon just
surprised mid-range right yeah yeah but
again when your Microsoft and your
platform is Windows Phone and you're the
third one with four percent market share
you cannot just say that's just one
carrier man you need all carriers you
need sure all forces in yeah well I mean
that they also released the HTC surround
remember like I mean they can't all be
winners yeah I don't be like 19 bucks
yeah I believe Michael Owen this is a
great free phone too would be yeah yeah
I agree yeah that could be a good theory
um yeah I don't know
any case we'll be able to order them
soon because the we have this rumored
announcement of Windows Phone 8 presale
like the presale pre-order dates going
to be what is this opening over a week
prior to the launch event in October
21st is the rumor at least that's when
AT&amp;amp;T is planning to open pre-orders
according to that looks like this came
to us from the verge this would this
would be cool I don't do preorders
usually but I might do a pre order if if
this just opens up yes it's called Lumia
I think my freak on the number is 928
because Lumia 920 yeah yeah well you
know I finally got a chance to hold one
Tony in New York City really oh this is
a funny story yeah I wanted to bring
this up that you did wait which which
which part is it to talk about and what
you thought about the 9 20 points sure
yeah we were at the eighteen t of n in
New York City that a whole lot of
devices from a whole lot of
manufacturers was really really cool and
the Nokia guys first of all everyone was
so nice to us because as Tony pointed
out in a couple emails is a lot of
commenters pointed out that you can see
in the reflection we were we were not we
got there in a real hurry and we didn't
have the proper equipment so we're
shooting a lot of this on mobile devices
i think i was shooting a lot of these
hands-on videos with iphone 5 we're
shooting someone at least make the 808
PureView man for that i wish i had a
PureView me yours but we were we were
challenged because it was such a loud
event they were playing some great music
so we had to go up on the rooftop to the
roof deck every time we wanted to get
some hands-on time of the device and
narrate about the device and be heard on
the video and everyone was so great to
us HTC nokia samsung AT&amp;amp;T seriously
everyone was like yeah we'll just step
away for a second will go up to the roof
and and you know we'll give you ten
minutes of our time so you can do this
so that was really awesome just a public
thank you to all them but i finally got
my hands on the on the nokia lumia 920
and I got to play lossy or Matt uh
that's what I was so jazzed about so
that's it is at this event but that I
found out even though we had posted a
new story i just missed it that there is
going to be
sian variant of the 920 and furthermore
first of all that just made my whole
week and then furthermore that the
science is a matte version the glossy
ones like the red one in the yellow one
or glossy yes but there are Matt
editions including the Scion one and
it's just the same as the 900 in that
material and I'm just I'm just so
excited right now I just wanted to want
to go pre-order at the moment so they it
was really great to get our hands on
that I think Brandon and I had a slight
disagreement about the heft I think we
had maybe like a 20-minute in-depth
conversation about heaviness of a device
versus its perceived quality and
somebody that wasn't a disagreement it
was just a discussion it was the deepest
discussion remember anything right
sperry it was profound I was changed
changing I remember Michael when when we
were in Berlin and you held the 808
PureView for the first time oh yes Tony
said it's heavy and when you held it for
like the fifth time you said that this
feels so good it does that yes and
that's to be honest the 920 has shades
of that yeah I don't think it feels as
good in the hand is the PureView 808 but
God it feels great so um yeah it was it
was very nice to have an have now a more
informed perspective on it having
actually held the thing it's a shame we
still couldn't play with the software
because it's there still hiding
something from us thanks um yeah like
deity vests because if you guys check
the landscape there are two nakia
devices to HTC devices we were hearing
of an alcatel device and the samsung
atif s was announced at IFA and there's
nowhere to be seen no reports no hands
on there was one which was yanked of
course but there's no buzz around it
they didn't have one at the New York
City event um yeah I don't know what's
going on with that what are they up to
hmm I don't know um anyway it's yeah we
just don't care about Windows Phone I
guess but but you know they obviously
care about Windows 8 cuz they've got all
those at Eve tablets that we saw yeah
but that's different it is yeah I don't
know um so the 920 um so so Michael you
found it to you liked its heft right you
you like that theft that high quality
it still is the weight in your hand I do
yes yes ah well well as we were talking
about I should say that the hardware on
the 920 is pretty boss it's uh it's
extremely high quality it's unique it's
gorgeous and kills good in suppose it's
I'll use as much as I can and it feels
good in the hand the screen is just
stunning yeah um but uh it's thick and
heavy oh oh yeah I I I don't like that
right that doesn't mean I wouldn't use
it and what it liked it but it reminds
me i was telling Michael gives me this
anxiety of the of the back in the day
when every phone was thick and heavy he
had devices like the HTC touch pro2
which was just like a deck of cards but
longer and taller and thicker and and
the Lumia 920 is like a deck of cards
but a little bit thinner and a little
bit taller a little bit wider and it's
just to me it just gives me this weird
sense and and I I long for the lightness
and the thinness of a galaxy s3 or
iPhone 5 and so it's just a difference
of opinion but it was interesting to see
how our responses were so different to
holding the 920 finally yeah yeah no
you're right and I forgot about that it
you know and I think part of dealing
with that thickness part of the reason I
can deal with that thickness okay is
because I saw a tear down which we
talked about a little bit or maybe a
leaked internal component shot whatever
it was maybe just a first-hand account
of the PureView the new PureView and I'm
making air quotes the new PureView
cameras for the new Lumias apparently
regardless of how how not 808 quality
they are there's still rather hefty
units and the hardware that is required
for that is a lot more akin to a sugar
cube like it's a it's a big it's a big
component so I think that is probably
this is just speculation on my part that
is probably why the Lumia 920 needs to
be that thick that's not a problem with
me I like heavy phones I don't have that
feeling that I'm gonna drop it just
because it's too light right and well I
mean I think though that like it's
easier for me to take if you can justify
like I'm willing to make that sacrifice
I'm willing to carry a thicker phone in
order to have better
camera quality right like I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be willing to carry a thicker
phone if a manufacturer was like yeah we
could have made this as thin as X or
whatever but we just wanted to throw in
an extra half pound of rubber for no
reason it's like okay well then no you
know I don't know I think if there's a
good reason for it then I can live with
it so fine well you know we'll have to
see we'll have to we'll have to get some
hands-on time with the with the devices
and maybe a cyan one and we'll see I
just watch like with that oh i was gonna
ask michael so what'd you think of the
ad the headaches okay so yeah that we
also got our hands on the HTC windows
phone 8x and the that was i I was
pleasantly surprised now that was quite
a bit lighter than the 920 and also
bigger in the hand somehow but with a
bigger bezel so the 8x guy I think I do
like it and i was very tempted by it the
design from a design perspective i
really really like the way that device
looks and feels to an extent but without
the added without the the kind of
special nokia touches like the the
wireless charging and the nokia software
suite and the really nice well
engineered feel of those buttons on the
Lumia 920 we're like this clicking
response was as good as an iphone 4
volume keys which are kind of the best
we're good really get into those finite
d to those fine details i think the HTC
windows phone 8x just becomes less and
less impressive to me personally by
comparison yeah i don't know that's the
best but if you like thin and light you
know and if you like that soft touch
feel instead of polycarbonate org or
gloss then that's gonna be a better
device for you especially if you don't
care about wireless charging we know i'm
a giant fan boy for wireless charging so
there's that let's just to wrap it up
speaking of HTC is sad story again if CC
is third quarter net profit down
seventy-nine percent from last year this
is in the windows phone category because
I think those with that Windows Phone 8x
and 8s are now they now make a bit more
sense why HTC em
so much noise when they announced them
and why Microsoft is you know obviously
standing firmly behind them because the
company is not doing well and that's
really scary because I like HTC so much
that's part of the reason I made a
special effort to call out one of their
commercials the you campaign in that
post from a couple weeks ago about the
best mobile commercials because I like
HTC like what they do I like the
direction that they drive the industry
and in this kind of innovative hardware
direction you know doing things
differently and I don't want to see them
go away I don't want to see them do
poorly so I really hope that they're
able to pull out of this death spiral do
you guys think the windows phones are
going to do that I'm sorry Tony go ahead
no I was about to say that I think right
now HTC is experiencing the consequences
of whatever they did 11 and a half two
years ago when we wrote like three or
four dear HTC editorials and HTC was
just releasing phone after phone after
phone with the same outer aspect and
when you are in this business you cannot
allow yourself a period of one year one
and a half years when you do not
innovate and the the the perception of
the brand has shifted a little bit and
of course Samsung was great to
capitalize on that and they just shifted
and Samsung became the number one
Android the OEM of course we can debate
if it's the world's number one OEM but
yeah and I think HTC is now struggling
to get back there where they were the
one family which was launched in
Barcelona the excess and V are part of
HTC's new direction which which we like
I just hope they need I think they need
more innovation and to keep going on
this road which they started to to
switch back that perception to whatever
it was before they lacked innovation
yeah and and don't forget that every
company rises and falls and literally
every company throughout history has
gone through periods of expansion and
contraction and Samsung's killing it
right now and it's very possible in 2014
or something they they'd make a lot of
errors you know apples been on top for a
long time and there's a lot of
indications that they're they're having
some problems and an HTC will probably
find there's again and they have a good
brand and they've got a heritage and
they've got relationships and they've
got a place in a lot of our hearts
you know as a company that was there in
the beginning and you know they I guess
they just need to say they know what
they need to do everyone yeah but here's
here's a free tip from me fire your
marketing department and hire new people
because back in the day I remember
seeing HTC thats everywhere when was the
last HTC had you guys saw well that's
yeah um we're actually going to touch on
that a little bit in in in reader mail
too but ok ok let's leave it to death
yeah actually why don't we just want to
use that as a little segue here to jump
into that so cuz we're running short on
time this is a really good point this is
it comes to us from Jon luttrell or I
hope I got close to your pronunciation
there from not so sunny Scotland who
loves the show thank you for listening
John um I was just wondering what your
thoughts are on how HTC can improve
sales I think the one x+ will be great
especially with jellybean to me the main
issue at least in the UK is that most
people have no clue about the 1-series
because the advertising just showed some
guy jumping out of a plane take pics and
videos I think they need to look at
marketing and get their products known
again that it is exactly what we're
talking about I completely agree I loved
the you campaign when HTC was focusing
on its brand awareness and we've talked
about that I've kind of talk that into
the ground but I think if they could get
something like that back this
aspirational quality of like reminding
you how important your phone actually is
to you and oh look by the way look at
our one series it does this stuff well
for you and then you can we can talk to
wear blue in the face about how the
camera's not as good and blah blah blah
but man yeah they're just needs to be I
think more of it is the consensus right
more of the advertising never better
advertising more advertising and more
innovation on the products of course
yeah yeah which-which I think they're
doing though I think that's the thing i
think the 1-series really could have
been a bigger hit if only and i
completely agree with John here that
does that guy jumping out of a plane is
eye-catching but when you're doing these
commercials I don't know what they're
called in the marketing world whether
you're just calling out one feature and
each commercial is calling out a
separate feature for some reason it's
working out for samsung with their
what they hold the phones back to back
and they do the tap would have written
about it what do they call that tap tap
to share something like something's do
but like you use it once two years
exactly right with this is one of these
features that's I catching but no one
ever uses and probably is never gonna
use but it works out for them because
they're just saturating the market with
it and and and they have five or six
different other commercials an HTC you
just got this one kind of gimmicky
commercial you're like I don't cool i
can take photos while i'm taking video
well now everybody can do that yeah
that's not a thing anymore put out more
ads and i put them in the right places I
when I when I Drive into philly um I see
at every major place where I might be
looking at a billboard it says in huge
letters that next big thing is already
here in the picture of galaxy s3 and
like I constantly am reminded about this
next big thing concept and somebody
samsung marketing figured out that they
should place a billboards very
strategically if they want to remind
people I mean it's just smart marketing
and Samsung's in a great job yes
marketing that this oversaturation can
backfire but until it backfires it will
just drive sales like nuts so I just
think HTC didn't find any empty spots to
place their banners on because of
Samsung because Samsung would like be
able to punch on all of them wrong yeah
well it's I you know we'll see I that's
um it would be so wonderful i think the
battle between the i was expecting at
the beginning of this year a great giant
apocalyptic fight between the 1x and the
galaxy s3 it's just you know and we
didn't get it because Samsung just
rolled up like hit HTC right in the face
at the beginning and he hasn't really
gotten back up maybe the one x+ I don't
think that's it I don't know so I think
maybe whatever this the five insurer is
gonna move yeah that could that I could
not all think the galaxy from its star
exactly because what I think is gonna
happen i think the note 2 is going to
increase public public awareness of
phablets to a pretty large degree and i
think HTC if they play it right they can
come in and kind of try and milk some of
that well just don't forget guys 5
inches is not phablet territory these
days it was one year
for this but the galaxy s3's 4.8 inch
and the 1x is 4.75 inch could be the
same outer aspect and dimension as the
1x or the s3 well that's true yeah um
well we'll have to see how that goes i
let's uh let's jump into another another
piece of mail here this is from mike
bates who wants to send us some
well-deserved praise and thank you and a
question thank you first of all this i
love hearing this you're podcast is
awesome and makes an early morning bus
ride much better that is awesome yeah i
love hearing about where people listen
to us like in their commuter at home
whatever the second mike is wondering
what your favorite phone is not based
off what is the best but the one that
you like the most just in terms of
unique looks or features just curious
keep up the great editorial videos
articles in the podcast thank you Mike
um guys do you to something leap right
to mind it's Danielle sides 808 PureView
time yeah I'm looking at it right now
damn that you're such an 80 a peer of
your fanboy that's awesome i love it
yeah and anybody can say anything about
symbian or nokia bell right now it's a
good little platform too bad they killed
it it can do anything i need and with
this camera I always think it with me so
it's my main driver right now cool what
about you Brandon I'm kind of in this
weird spot right now I've been using the
iphone 5 as a daily driver but gosh I am
so tired of iOS it's just making me
depressed and and and we're in this
weird fate of time period where we've
got these awesome windows phones coming
out we've got some new android phones
coming out so I really don't know I mean
it's either right now I'd be using
galaxy s3 or an iPhone 5 i'm skinnies an
iphone 5 right now because a little bit
newer and i'm enjoying the camera and
some other features but you know I this
isn't a good time to ask me that
question what about you Michael this is
not a good time to ask me either I'm
kind of between stuff obviously the
Lumia 920 I talk about it every podcast
I'm kind of like backed into a corner
unlike in that though because I i I'll
of the features and I love you know from
the camera to the wire
charging to the polycarbonate build to
the whatever but I as far as unique
looks goes um you know aside from the
nokia smile design it's not bringing a
lot that we haven't kind of already seen
in the in the n9 / lumia 800 / lumia 900
so I think the HTC 8s is kind of my
current favorite as far as a visual
standpoint goes fisting yeah I mean you
know yes its mid-range but I say it over
and over again i really respect and
admire it when companies decide to take
a bold design step and making a phone
with a fluorescent color band around the
bottom is bold especially when one of
them makes it look like a traffic cop
you know with the gray and in neon green
so that's in his bowl yeah tennis ball
right yeah so that's that's mine that's
that would be mine for looks obviously
the 920 still wins on features for me
thanks for the question Mike that was
that was an awesome one and to sum it up
the last piece of reader mail from
Philip who lives in Cardiff UK the UK
will be getting LTE at the end of the
month and the major roll out of LTE over
the next two years I was wondering if
LTE is a major leap in technology and is
it worth me selling my six-month-old 1x
to get an LTE device thank you oh my god
yes there's it is a major leap in
technology we've written a couple pieces
on LTE I wrote one pretty recently about
how it's how it differs from 3g if you
want to look it up Phillip it it has
absolutely changed the way I use
smartphones here in the states when I am
not on an LTE network I actually have a
measurably less pleasurable experience I
don't like it whenever I come back to
Boston after having traveled I'm very
very pleased to be back in LTE coverage
it is the most major leap in technology
I have ever experienced personally and
if I had a six-month-old 1x that didn't
support LTE I would absolutely get rid
of it in favor of an LTE device once it
came to my neighborhood I my answer
would say it depends I agree that LTE is
amazing and awesome and faster as always
better but you know your phone still
relatively new only six months old and
it's possible that you spend you know of
24 hours in the day you spend 10 0 10 at
work and and the other 14 at home and
may or may be 13 at home and maybe one
hour commuting and so LTE for you isn't
that big of a deal because you're always
on a Wi-Fi hotspot at work or school and
at home um so I guess it if your phone
is a year older a year and a half one
it's a yet definitely but since you just
got your necks you gotta have you got
kinda have to look at what your internet
needs are and where you're using your
device well that's of you know that's
definitely a smarter answer I agree if
you want to be more fiscally responsible
the 1x is still a great device and if
you're on Wi-Fi all the time then maybe
it doesn't matter but man you know what
having LTE everywhere like not having to
jump onto a Wi-Fi hotspot because you
don't need to because you're actually
getting better speeds over LTE
especially on a new fresh network that
nobody's on that's a feeling that's
tough to replicate I mean that's that as
far as geeky pleasure goes I think I
think it's tough to to beat that so I
don't know and and and Tony if I'm right
you you are you've not used an LTE
network I have not unfortunately in my
region LT is not present I've been
reading some reports that one of the
major carriers here in Romania will skip
LTE and start implementing the next
thing after LTE okay banga no it's
called differently i'm gonna get some
info and i'm gonna get back to you guys
on this okay i still have an answer for
for Phillip Phillip you said LTE will be
implemented over the next two years so
at the beginning will be probably
problems with coverage and speed and
stuff like that so by the time LTE will
be stable you're now six months old 18 1
X will be probably 11 and a half years
old so we're gonna change it anyway yeah
that's that's the probably the best
answer out of it yeah it doesn't depends
on how big the itch is to to get a new
phone is this the Everything Everywhere
probably the the new carrier oh really
that joint venture there yeah a new so
yeah but by the time they start with
coverage and the
fix all the problems at the beginning
you'll be fine cell because by the time
you'll sell you one x you'll not sell it
because of LTE you'll sell it because
there's something better on the market
you'll want that wasn't all the all the
listener mail that we received this week
