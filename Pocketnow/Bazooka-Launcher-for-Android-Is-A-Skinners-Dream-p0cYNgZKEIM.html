of the things that we love about android
is its ability to run custom launchers
which give us new features
functionalities and add a new look and
feel to the whole device today we've got
bazooka launcher it's a Skinner's dream
let's go take a look so just looking at
this you'll notice it looks pretty much
like any other launcher out there yes it
does have some iOS or some me you'ii set
how you pronounce it i still don't know
but it's got a look and feel with the
nice rounded rectangles there there are
some new animations do that a couple of
times just in case you didn't see it a
very limited number of settings and
that's primarily because this is
trebuchet so you get all the trebuchet
up in options in addition to those
trebuchet options you've got the ability
to turn on or off the custom lock screen
you can reset the theme back to default
and then of course a shameless plug for
in this case a custom rom the avatar um
but what I really want to show you two
things first and foremost let's take a
look at how easy it is to add another
home screen just like that and that and
that and that and you can keep going I
think nine is the most you can do and
then you can change which one is the
home home screen just by tapping on that
icon if you want to get rid of some home
screens that's easy to can just tap them
away or if you want to quickly jump to
one of your home screens just tap on it
and go from there it's really quick has
the same kind of animations on the side
that you'd expect but what we really are
interested in here is the theme ability
now themes themes are there for
cyanogenmod no problem but to get this
level of theming you usually have to
flash your own custom rom to get it so
looking around here here are some of the
most popular ones here are the latest
additions and if you want to download it
just simply tap it starts to download
there you go at side loads and apk and
you're good let's come back over here to
the ones that I've already downloaded
and let's select this iphone the
apply it takes just a moment to apply
restarts the launcher which takes just a
moment and then you'll notice that
things look a little bit different this
is that bumblebee theme that we were
installing before so we're going to
doing two things at once here now you
can see I've got a very iphone like look
and feel more I phony than it was before
let's go in and change to another one so
you can see what it is and this is one
of my more favorite so a lot more
industrial looks like your apps are
tucked away in pockets switching between
these has a red tab which of course is a
kind of a trademark of the levi strauss
company you've got this nice red tab
over there nice wallpapers it changes
the overall look and feel of icons of
the launch of the app drawer omit the
whole thing and it just looks beautiful
so bazooka launcher quick easy fast
based on trebuchet I love it if you want
themes I think you're going to love it
too take a look if you like what you saw
make sure you give the video a thumbs up
