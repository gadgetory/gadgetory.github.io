for AT&amp;amp;T iphone rumors seem to point out
to an iphone 6 coming and amazon is
rumored to bring a 3d screen on a phone
I'm hi meri behna and can you imagine
the pain of having to watch me on 3d
this is out daily let's start
today off talking about nokia the
company has been marketing their
unannounced Nokia Lumia 928 with video
comparisons with the iphone 5 and galaxy
s3 yeah the three and also audio
comparisons as well links down below and
if you want to see everything that
happens with their May fourteenth events
we will be covering it live so make sure
you subscribe to our YouTube channel
will give you the full details of
everything that happens up next we've
got samsung we know about their galaxy
s4 active that rugged waterproof version
of the galaxy s4 that plans to retain
the same design pretty much like the
Sony Xperia Z apparently the company is
planning to bring this phone first to
AT&amp;amp;T but then again we've also got
rumors that the phone will be launched
in Europe on July fifteenth oh it best
to wonder which will be first stay tuned
up next we've got a sous the company is
the king of Android tablets for a reason
if they just teased out they'll be
having an event on june six at computex
and apparently we will be getting the
new Transformer Prime at this events but
wait a second it says that they're
transforming everything but then they're
showing Windows 8 tablets all over so
the question is what are we getting now
for some apple news we've got some
leaked listing showing that the
next-generation iphone will be called
the iphone 6 and not the iphone 5s but
wait a second i mean the leak is kind of
weak it's only shows a couple of
listings showing that the iphone 6 is
being mentioned anybody could type this
up but then again if you think about it
iphone 5s sounds kind of weak it most
probably is the fact that Apple is
considering bringing the iphone 6 as a
name as apparently they will be bringing
a cheaper iPhone which could probably be
the iphone 5s you never know and finally
for the health come on news of the day
we've heard the rumors of Amazon
building a kindle phone for the longest
time and we're bored about it but the
wall street journal is now reporting
that the company is actually working on
two phones and get this one of these
phones as a 3d screen and i thought
those were dead but a pair
really this is some new technology that
will track your retina in order to be
able to give you the 3d renders that
you'll see on the display but regardless
of that what's the point about having
that technology on a phone it kind of
makes more sense on a tablet where
you'll be watching a movie but that
leads you to the question of the day
would 3d on a display specially on a
phone be something that you're looking
for is a feature 3d is dead I mean in my
particular case I hate to go watch
movies on 3d because I instead of
enjoying the movie better i end up with
a bigger headache so leave us a comment
down below do you enjoy 3d I mean people
are not even buying 3d TVs anymore
they're just gimmicky and of course is
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in South the world mushy
follow us on talking outcome subscribe
to our YouTube channel you can also
follow me on twitter at high me
underscore to be better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi meri behna thank you very
much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
