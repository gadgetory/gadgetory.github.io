One mini is to the one mini too it may
not be the spec blockbuster that the one
m8 is but the one mini two might just be
the prettiest mini sized smartphone
we've recently laid eyes on and we're
going hands-on right now I'm Michael
Fisher this is pocket now and this is
your first look at the HTC one mini 2
even more so than last year the family
resemblance here is striking despite
what HTC calls a forty percent drop in
the amount of metal used in its makeup
the one mini two bears the same brushed
aluminum chassis as its bigger brother
with the same polycarbonate inlays
similar boomsound speakers the same palm
kissing curve even the same available
color options just like last year's many
the one mini 2 sports a plastic ridge
around the perimeter but it's been cut
down quite a bit here it doesn't look
out of place at all on our gunmetal grey
review unit will have an in-depth
comparison with the One m8 later in the
month to go along with our full one mini
to review so for now let's just quickly
run down the specs for processing we're
looking at a quad-core Snapdragon 400 at
one point two gigahertz leaning on a gig
of ram and 16 gigs of storage and yes
microsd expansion has made the cut and
supporting cards all the way up to 128
gigs the display is a 4.5 inch LCD at
720p the battery at 2100 milliamp hour
embedded pack and you'll notice the
camera lacks the distinctive duo sensor
of its up range sibling the one mini 2
packs the single lens of a more
conventional 13 megapixel shooter and
the software reflects that wrapping up
the optics package up front the selfie
cam is a wide-angle 5 megapixel shooter
while the mini component may not be
obvious from all angles in the hand this
phone does indeed feel substantially
smaller than the one I made taken on its
own it feels more substantial than its
dimensions would suggest and it looks
much more expensive than other devices
in its class button feedback in our unit
here is a little mushy and android for
dot for tattoo with sent six looks a
little more washed out on this phone
compared to the flagship but we should
note that this is pre-release hardware
as evidenced by the slight color
mismatch on the volume rocker here but
at first glance and first feel it's very
nice we'll be taking a much closer look
in the weeks ahead stay tuned to pocket
now for that coverage and if you want
availability information right now visit

news post detailing pricing and other
launch info on the HTC one mini to

you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
