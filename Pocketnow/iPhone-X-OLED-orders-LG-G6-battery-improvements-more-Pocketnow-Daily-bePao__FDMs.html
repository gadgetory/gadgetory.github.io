displays for the iPhone X reports
claimed that the battery on the LG g6 is
larger than ever and actually C begins
giving consumers a shot at what we're
getting with the HTC you line up I'm
Jaime Rivera and the clearly the Mac
cell that I had no clue what he had
behind him in this ad in the 80s this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with the launch of the HTC u
ultra and you play obviously we are
still waiting for our review and it's s
the phones are gonna take a while to
come to the United States but as it
stands it already launched in Taiwan now
it's launched in the UK 650 pounds for
the u ultra 470 for the U play we can
not wait to tell you more about these
phones when we get them other
interesting news have to do with
Google's instant applications this is
something that the company made a big
deal of at Google i/o the fact that you
no longer need to install apps on your
phone to be able to use services
specifically obviously the Chrome
browser plays a big role on this and as
of today certain other devices in the
United States are being able to use
these services obviously it's going to
take a while for these to roll out for
those of you that we're doubting if we
are getting wireless charging or not on
the next generation iPhone well Apple
has just joined the wireless charging
consortium the one that brings us she
and PMA wireless charging and everything
and all the standards and everything you
want to know about this now this is
rather interesting as Apple has been
using wireless charging on the Apple
watch for two generations already pretty
much two years we should say so we
wonder exactly why the company has taken
so long it could be that it's now going
to take it seriously on other devices
that's at least what we get from these
news spotlight over to the LG G 6
we heard the bad news that the G 6 is
apparently not bringing a removable
battery apparently according to some
very trusted sources from Korea the
reason why is because we are getting the
largest battery that LG has ever put on
a phone and this is major news the
largest I remember was the g3 with a
3200 milliamp hour battery and it's
actually gotten smaller over time the g4
in turn SK use actually had that same
battery or at least the same battery
size so I can't wait to see what battery
size we are getting on the g6
remember LG has been really good about
this ever since the g2 they cannot wait
to see what we get and finally the very
hot news is they have to do with the
iPhone X yes we hear that Apple has just
made a crazy order for a hundred and
sixty million displays OLED displays for
this next generation iPhone this tells
you as much as how much Apple plants to
sell we know that usually Apple sells
around 75 million units just on the
first quarter alone so this is pretty
much what Apple is planning the rest of
the year and apparently Samsung is going
to be the supplier for these all s
displays this is great we've been
complaining about Apple taking forever
and getting into the OLED game but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you believe that Apple has taken too
long do you feel that it's right about
now an apple should because in my case
with everything that's going on with the
galaxy note 7 and everything I think
that this is the best time for Apple to
make this shift leave us a comment down
below we looked into your opinion
