expect for the new Google pixel - we
finally get a date for when to expect
the essential phone shipping and Huawei
has already begun to tease the evolution
of the may 10th and its event
I'm Hina iveta and don't judge me
because of the t-shirt I liked it and
that's the reason why I got it but I did
not go watch this Transformers movie
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today I have to do with evolution
as of today you're actually able to make
phone calls from your Google home
speaker but there are a couple of
caveats you have the functionality but
the problem is you don't really have a
phone number initially so people are
actually going to get an unknown caller
ID initially unless you're a project 5
customer or you have a Google Voice
number and Google Voice number is
actually not difficult so you can learn
more about the features and everything
in the link in the description now let's
talk about Huawei the company has just
sent out press invitations for an event
to happen on October 16 in Munich and
they have a big tent over the event
cards so yes we are expecting the Huawei
may tend to make its way we don't really
know much about this phone except for
the new display technology that might
come here so there is a lot to look
forward to whoa wait has really been
doing an amazing job of their phones
lately we can't wait to see what we get
now sorry about the Apple watch Series 3
the news lately have been that this
phone has LTE capabilities and we'll
have an LTE variant and another that
doesn't many people thought that it had
to do with phone calls but apparently
that is not really the plan the whole
idea is for this one just be fully
connected all the time and it also seems
as if Apple actually wants for this to
be a standalone watch a watch doesn't
depend on the iPhone is a good idea the
only problem that that's going to be a
very clunky watch it doesn't depend on
the iPhone unless it's a lot better than
series 2 or series 1 so you can learn
more about the possibilities in the
description as well now let's find out
the essential phone we have been waiting
essentially as to when we're getting
this device and the company has finally
come clear expects shipments in 7 days
we don't really know exactly when the
Sprint models are going to be shipping
we don't have information there but
there are sources the claim that
apparently these phones were also ship
pretty much at the same time so
I can't wait to tell you more about that
phone whenever we actually get one stay
tuned and finally the very interesting
rumor sedan to do it the next generation
Google pixel or dubbing pixel to and
pixel excel to reason why is because
we've got some leaked images of the
settings it seems that the whole edge
sense feature that we have from the U 11
from HTC is going to be called active
edge and it seems that it's not making
its way to the pixel XL 2 because pixel
X 2 is apparently made by LG you're
getting the taller aspect ratio and you
know we wonder if that's actually a good
idea for both folks actually not share
features across the board it leads me to
the question today do you think that
it's a good idea for you to have to be
able to choose between what features
you're getting depending on which vary
you're getting in my case I don't think
it's a smart idea I feel that I would
rather two phones and just choose sizes
but then you get all the features across
the board but anyways leave us a comment
down below and let us know what you
think friends you know the way it goes
