360 and it's all new design options sony
unveils a bevy of new xperia z5 models
one with the 4k display the novo thinks
that it can give Microsoft Surface a run
for its money I'm hi meri behna trying
to keep up with so many official news
today but trying to add some rumors this
is parking out daily there are official
news everywhere today but let's begin
with LG the company has just unveiled
three products they started with the g
pad to 10.1 in addition to the rolly
which is a very interesting keyboard
that's portable but to top it off the
company has also shown as the LG watch
urbane lux for those of you that are
interested in a gold-plated LG G watch
because you just have that much amount
of money licks in the description for
the full hands-on videos from the team
at Aoife and if I tried to list all the
Lenovo products that were announced
today I would run out of space in this
video so let's try to cram everything
lenovo has announced a bevy of tablets
and laptops a lot of ThinkPads idea pets
we've got Chromebooks but probably the
coolest product was an idea pad makes
700 particularly because well it looks
like the surface pro 3 in every way and
it pretty much is in its design and it's
got the the cover and everything it's
very interesting product another
opportunity for a ton of hands-on videos
that you can see in the links in the
description and fine if you want some
rumors today let's talk about the Oppo
find 7 update as yet this flagship from
the company is a little dated already
and apparently this oppo find 9 will be
announced in Beijing on September 19 so
set your calendars this was probably one
of the hottest phones last year so you
bet we are looking forward to the update
and one of the hottest tickets happening
today at Aoife is sony sony has stolen
the show with its three xperia z5 models
particularly because well the z5 compact
is just as hot as the z5 only with a
smaller display and everything we've got
the same specs but the coolest product
was the z5 premium because we are
talking about a 4k display pretty much
the first 4k the school
in the market for a smartphone that's
going to be sold very soon according to
our team idiva the display is gorgeous
and the specifications are greatly to
the scripture for full details this is
probably one of the phones that a lot of
us are going to want this year and
finally for the hot news of the day my
moto 360 is on ebay because the new moto
360 was just announced and up it is
gorgeous we've got two models of 46
millimeter and 42 millimeter variant and
then there are a bevy of ways you can
customize it from a gold-plated designed
to the regular stainless steel there's
even a sport bearing that you could
choose from and the specifications are
much better Snapdragon 400 but for those
of you that wanted an AMOLED panel here
we cannot understand why we still have
an LCD here but yeah the new Moto 360
has just been announced then we would
love to know as for the question up
today what do you think of the new Moto
360 would this be your next SmartWatch
because in my case you bet it will be
stainless steel that's my favorite leave
us a comment down below tell us what
option would you pick and yeah i will
definitely be checking my ebay friends
