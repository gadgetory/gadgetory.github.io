pocket now calm and this is a look at
the on-screen keyboard experience of
Windows Phone 7 let's get to it okay
before getting started we want to
mention that this is not final windows
phone 7 hardware or software now the
on-screen keyboard in Windows Phone 7 is
especially important because software
developers cannot customize the
on-screen keyboard what you see is what
you get you can't change it right now
like you could in Windows Mobile legacy
and like you can today in Android that
may change in the future it'd be nice to
see a swype keyboard on Windows Phone 7
but right now this sort of rectangular
keyboard is what you get and you know
it's not that bad it's actually really
good now before talking about that of
course you may have another keyboard
option if you buy a windows phone 7
device with a slide-out keyboard like
the LG Panther here which may or may not
be going up for sale on AT&amp;amp;T and past
the FCC so rumor has it that it's coming
to AT&amp;amp;T but that's unconfirmed by AT&amp;amp;T
at the moment so let's talk about the
keyboard unlike Android and iPhone the
keys are very very squarish on Windows
Phone 7 the first and second row are
offset which is nice for ergonomics and
then the second of the third row and
fourth row are laid out in a grid now on
some keyboards you can get to the
numbers by tapping and holding along the
top row of keys which really helps with
usability like on the HTC hd2 and a lot
of other HTC keyboards but in Windows
Phone 7 you have to go the extra step of
pressing the 123 button here in the
corner to access all of the characters
and the symbols now fortunately they
placed the period and the comma
obviously very frequently used
punctuation marks within easy reach so
you don't have to dig into another menu
to get to a period or a comma which is
the case with some smart phones out
there now we have a dedicated button for
a mode of guns so we can tap on that and
get a wide variety of emoticons by the
way I should mention that this keyboard
will change color based on the system
color scheme so if you are on the dark
color scheme it will be a black keyboard
but if you're in the white color scheme
like we are now it will be a white
keyboard which just looks
better when filming on camera that's why
I have that chosen so let's talk about
the actual typing experience when you
type in Windows Phone 7 you get a clicky
sound a clicking sound that I find quite
satisfying but some may find annoying it
will want to turn off okay so as you can
see there is autocomplete so you don't
have to be super precise when typing and
as you type suggestions come up and you
can either tap on a suggestion to make
it go through or you can just keep
typing and when you press the space car
windows phone 7 will use the word that
it thinks you're trying to say I found
this to be very very accurate so
accurate that it's almost as fast in my
test then then the iphone keyboard is
and in some cases Android depending on
which keyboard you are using now if you
flipped over into landscape we get a
larger keyboard which is actually a
little bit awkward to use compared to
the portrait keyboard so I'm going to
try typing the quick brown fox and there
we go very accurate now there are some
settings associated with the windows
phone 7 keyboard and I'm going to get to
those so let's go into the settings here
and down here are the settings for the
keyboard so we can choose to capitalize
the sentence capitalize the first letter
of a sentence we can have it suggests
text and highlight misspelled words
which is good for auto correct correct
misspelled words insert a period after
double tapping the spacebar turned on
insert a space after selecting a
suggestion so really just a bunch of
autocomplete options you can also change
the keyboard if you want to go to
another one so right now we're in
English and here we go we have a variety
of different keyboard choices now let's
go back something else wanted to talk
about of course like other smartphone
keyboards if you tap and hold on certain
certain characters you will get the
other varieties for different languages
so here we can get this letter or if we
do an eye we can choose a variety of
letters or if we do the end get the
Spanish letter there okay so I brought
in the iphone 4 here and the google
nexus one so you can get a sense for how
the keyboard sizes compared these
screens are all very similar
as we have 3.5 inch here 3.5 inch here
3.7 inch on the nexus one you can get a
sense if we line them up of the keyboard
heights they all go to about the same
level as possible that the windows phone
7 keyboard is a little taller because we
have this bar along the bottom and you
can see the difference in keyboard
letters so here on the iPhone their
rounded a little bit very rectangular on
Windows Phone 7 and also a little bit
rounded on google nexus one let's
compare the landscape keyboards on all
of these devices and here they are in
landscape you can see that the most
surface area probably can be found on
the google nexus one but it also takes
up a tremendous amount of the screen
whereas a surface area on the Windows
Phone 7 device and on the iphone is
pretty much the same now one final thing
to note since we're talking about text
entry in Windows Phone 7 you cannot copy
and paste so if we want to tap and hold
nothing happens what you can do is move
the cursor and select a particular word
so just tapping on a word will select it
really cool and we can actually change
the autosuggest item here and you can
also obviously use that tool where
you're tapping on a word to delete it
seems practically impossible to select
multiple words although perhaps that's
just a feature coming in future builds
of windows mobile so if i wanted to just
highlight world and after i really i
really can't i can tap on the word
individually or the other word
individually but there's really no way
to multi-select so overall the keyboard
experience in Windows Phone 7 is really
great save for the lack of copy and
paste and multi select if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
