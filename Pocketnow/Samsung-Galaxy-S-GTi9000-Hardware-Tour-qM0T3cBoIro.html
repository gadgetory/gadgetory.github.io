Danny Webster here from Park comm and
this is the hardware tour of the Samsung
Galaxy S a 9000 so the dimensions of
device are 2.5 inches across with the
height of four point eight inches and a
depth of 0.4 inches still a very thin
phone right here that equates to sixty
four point two millimeters across one
hundred twenty two point four
millimeters in height and nine point
nine millimeters thick so under a
centimeter in thickness so but one of
the very first phones to be under
centimeter and thickness on the front of
the device we have the light sensor and
proximity sensor we also have the
speaker for in calls and the
front-facing video camera so in the
event that the United States actually
supports video calling this phone will
be ready the entire screen is made out
of glass and around the edge of the
device is this chrome bezel on the
bottom we had these capacitive buttons
one is a menu button and the other is a
back button as well as the home button
but that one is not a capacitive I was a
I was pretty sure that this was going to
be an optical trackball from the
pictures of the internet but after
looking at some of the specs I guess it
is not and of course playing with the
device it also is not on the top of the
device we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which supports stereo
headphones this also has an FM radio
built into it so you need to plug in
your headphones to use the FM radio as
the antenna we also have a micro USB
slot here with a cover to prevent pocket
length so all you have to do is slide
this cover over shove in your park and
not have to worry about populating
inside that port on this side of the
device we have a lanyard area so if you
want to have a string attached to your
phone or whatnot you can have that there
it just pop off the battery cover slide
that inside and there you go
well saw a volume rocker on this side so
up and down course on the bottom of the
device we have the microphone on this
side of the phone the only thing that's
on this side of the phone is the power
on and standby
on the back of the device we have a 5
megapixel camera without a flash so I
was a little disappointed to see that
this device does not have a flash we
also have the speaker for speakerphone
and I don't know if you can tell but
it's it's sort of a touch of color this
is what Samson does with some of their
devices and televisions if you ever seen
that it's a blue tint but you probably
can't see it on the camera I don't know
if you can see it if I flash the lights
in there but it's little blue it's kind
of cool actually if we take off the
battery cover we have the micro SD card
which supports up to 32 gigabytes of
memory we have the SIM card slot a
lithium-ion 1500 milliamp battery with
also we have an external port for an
antenna you can see that right there
sometimes if you live in areas where the
service is not that great you can just
plug in an external antenna and there
you go so in terms of hardware this
device has one gigahertz processor in it
and it uses the Samsung hummingbird
processor which has 32 megabytes of l1
cache so it's a very fast device it
actually has its own graphics drivers
the screen is a four inch Super AMOLED
with 24-bit abilities and I can turn the
screen on right here let's see and you
can see the screen quality is superb
I've never seen a screen this great
before I mean the camera does not do it
justice even outside in direct sunlight
the screen is just amazing and it's 480
by 800 pixels this is a quad-band GSM
phone with UMTS in 1909 hundred and
twenty one hundred so it does work on a
tMT's 3G network and you can see that
right up there I have the HSDPA
connected and HSDPA is 7.2 and the HSUPA
is 5.76 this is the 8 gigabyte version
there is also a 16 gigabyte version
available if you're able to find it
it does have 512 megabytes of RAM so
that's a great thing to have on a phone
with this much power
is to have a large amount of RAM so that
you can access that really quickly so
some other features of this phone is it
has a capacitive multi-touch screen it
also has bluetooth 3.0 and yes you did
hear me correctly that's 3.0 not 2.0
this is one of the first if not the
first Android device to have bluetooth
3.0 it also has Wireless B G and n
unfortunately because this phone runs on
the 2.1 android 2.1 operating system it
doesn't have the drivers to support the
n band on the network so we'll have to
see if Froyo or if any other updates
come up that will support that Wireless
and band so tell us what you think about
this phone leave some comments down at
the bottom
leave some pros and cons if you want
that's a great thing to have in some
comments leaves a little bit of argument
for other people also if you liked the
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and this is the hardware tour of the
Samsung Galaxy S I nine thousand thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
