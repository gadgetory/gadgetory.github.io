posting some big performance numbers but
how does the mate 9 handle your audio
we've taken a look at this beast or a
listen rather and it's time to share our
results the huawei mate nine includes a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and new
for this year stereo speakers which are
orientation aware when holding the phone
in portrait we get an HTC 10 style
distribution where the earpiece tackles
higher frequency sound and the bottom
firing speaker performs more like a
subwoofer filling in mids and lows
rotating the phone to landscape switches
this to a more traditional stereo left
and right channel distribution
in practice this works well enough
except for the slight dropouts when the
phone flips orientation and this is tied
to the phone settings if you disable
rotation in your settings the speakers
stay pegged in portrait mode listening
to the speaker quality regardless of
orientation the bottom speaker is
responsible for most of the heavy
lifting
overdriving the earpiece eyes tend to be
a bit shrill at max volume at more
comfortable levels especially arm's
length from your face the two work
together well enough to create a sense
of depth in your music games and videos
personally I was pleasantly surprised
not because the mate has any hopes of
unseating an HTC or the axon 7 but
because this was a noticeable
improvement over previous wall ways
we've reviewed the Nexus 6p excepted of
course
and we're always happy to see progress
now the headphone report isn't quite so
glowing in fact we have a new winner
here for last place including a
dedicated 3.5 millimeter jack is still
appreciated until we can all decide on a
proper standard moving forward but the
mate 9 posts some of the lowest
performance numbers we've seen in any of
our audio reviews falling behind even
the LG g5 with a higher noise floor and
lower dynamic range we're disappointed
to also see truncated quality the phone
will play 24-bit audio files but output
seems to be limited to 16 bit worst of
all the big mate 9 packs a small
headphone amp on consumer headphones or
the ear pod style buds which come with
the phone it's a fine experience but the
mate struggles to drive higher impedance
cans even my lowly hd25 s only at 70
ohms cranking the phone to the max the
output was at the upper limits of my
tolerance but still comfortable to
listen to and to my ears music was still
somewhat on the dull side the huawei
lost handily to our fee okay one dak a
small USB audio device but happily the
mate nine properly recognized the Pheo
so for those who want to improve their
headphone quality we have high hopes
that future USB solutions will play nice
with this phone the mate 9 gets a lot
right in delivering one of the few truly
large screen experiences of 2016 and
we're happy to see some progress on
speaker playback but this phone
certainly won't be on the audiophile
list at least not without a little help
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full mate 9 coverage
be on the lookout for our real camera
review so we can see some of the things
this phone definitely gets right and
help us out with some sharing on your
favorite social networks for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget guy
on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
