the camera and this is the brand new
huawei mediapad x1 here in barcelona and
taking a look at this dress over so
you'll notice from the very beginning
that this is a 7-inch tablet a small
tablet or a large bone and it's very
very marketable and it's very very light
will have comparisons with the competing
nexus 7 either first or second
generation and the ipad mini and you
will see that both of these devices are
larger in their footprint and this is
something which has been called out by
Ravi CEO several times the very very
slim footprint if you look at it from
the side the aluminum back backed up by
plastic at the top and the bottom
because then I said because of the
necessity for LTE connectivity and
antennas and while we're at the back we
can take a look at the camera which is
one of 13 megapixels and it has a flash
unlike the one on the ipad mini and the
one on the nexus 7 but taking it to the
front you see the 7-inch display with a
1920 x 1200 resolution for a ppi rating
of more than 300 i'm guessing it's about
323 behind the screen there's a who
obeys own high silicon processor which
is a quad-core processor clocked in at
one point sixty Hertz aided by two
gigabytes of ram and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage of course expandable of
course you have the ear piece which is
my main functionality personally I love
crossovers like this where you can just
take the tablet put it to your ear and
maybe try to have a phone call because
it doesn't look huge like for instance
we have CBS News backbone which is a
little bit larger in footprint while
still at seven inches there's a
5-megapixel front-facing camera and as
you've seen muah me has moved the
buttons to the screen so the bezel is
much much smaller of course when you
will flip this the landscape mode you
will not need to hold it by the small
bezel you can put your finger on the
screen and if you're in the browser you
can just browse with the other fingers
so it will neglect your first finger
being on the screen
in terms of the UI we are seeing who
obeys own emotion UI and that we're used
it by now this doublet is in its current
stage running Android I believe for the
two de two and once again the rundown of
the specs and here you see Android
version Fortuna to this will be
available shortly in Europe for 399
heroes and once you will be able to buy
it with the this gadget which we will be
taking a look at in just a couple of
minutes you'll probably be able to get
the bundle for somewhat cheaper we'll be
back with more on this mediapad
excellent at the with comparisons
against the nexus 7 and yet we need to
have an aunt on I'm is trying to get a
great clip of me but the room is crowded
thank you very much for watching this
let's lock it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
