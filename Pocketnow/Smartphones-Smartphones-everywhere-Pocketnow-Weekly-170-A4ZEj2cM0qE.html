shape oh those of you listeners who are
new here's what we like to do well it's
basically hearing from you guys during
the course of the show beer Michael and
I given the opportunity we'll talk went
back and forth just ridiculous banter
mostly about endless pockets and things
for the better part of three hours here
but if you could help steer us on track
by asking us questions about gadgets
we're talking about something that we
haven't talked about yet but you want to
hear us address once you they jump over
to the Q&amp;amp;A feature there in your Google
Hangouts toolbar type your questions the
other viewers will vote up their
favorites will do our best to address
them on the air if you don't think of
something during the show you're
listening to us later on maybe the high
quality edition of the pocket
can only shoot us an email we're going
to answer a few listener males on this
show will answer more on future podcast
but send us an email podcast at
pocketnow.com to get your question in
our inbox will be reading through those
we look at some Q&amp;amp;A is a little later on
but one way or the other we want to hear
from you bank tells the truth he always
speaks the truth and that is why we have
him on the show so weird and often all
that stuff being said there's a lot of
truth bombs that need dropping there's a
link Jules just sent me I've got to go
look at and there's a Q&amp;amp;A panel that's
blank right now which is an unusual
thing this far into the no it's
fine do you promote the film people know
we're doing live hundred questions in
there by this point so is mine we need a
little break oh yeah i'm wearing my LD
west holster again by the way um which
has two empty pockets i'm wearing
captain no phones it's right because i
can't show you anything that i have a
look at the secret phones yeah I have
things guys that we're gonna talk about
a lot but I can't turn around this way
so let's get into the damn news and tell
people if and going on Jules take us
into the news block
now I think that it's important that we
kick off this news block with the
biggest smartphone news of the week and
I don't know if this is the biggest more
fun more because I i I've just become
Steven tell me if you're with me I've
just become sort of mm accustomed to one
plus being like oh if there's one plus
story it's a big story because one plus
has been the sort of despite its
missteps has been this darling of the
tech nerd the superandroid nerd space
for so long but tell is this is this
stuff worth good is this particular
story worth getting excited about our
way well I gotta disagree with you a
little bit there mum plus having all
these big stories companies really great
about keeping its name in the press but
it's sort of like it likes to leave a
lot of little breadcrumbs we rarely get
one big thing from one plus this time
though it really hasn't been teasing its
new phone nearly as much as the 1+2 got
teased and obliques leading up to its
launch but we're talking about here if
you haven't guessed already is the 1
plus x AKA 1 plus mini we've seen both
names pop up 1 plus x is looking like
the official one it features prominently
in this invite going out for october 29
launch event it's it's going to be a
much more mid-range device than the one
plus two we've seen I mean there's been
plenty of spec leaks early retailer
listings they're not all of them
agreeing on the same thing here from the
hardware so we're not super clear on
adjustments disagreement over the SOC
and especially with these two names they
still even with confirmation for the
oneplus X so we've seen the oneplus mini
name in some retail things as well
there's the outside possibility that
this different brand it could represent
different hardware configurations or
different markets so not super clear
about what's going on there but yeah
coming up Cooper 29 two weeks now
pricing we've seen two twenty to fifty
mentioned so a bit more affordable than
the the 1+2 up in the 300 range but
still not nearly as cheap as some of the
Affordable Android options from like
Motorola and other manufacturers though
especially with the availability issues
we always think of one plus phones I'm
not quite sure how this guy's gonna fare
yeah the perhaps the an early indication
although this should never I should
never rely on this for any sort of
insight is the comments section we're
currently this is relatively new store
easily 14
comments on it as of this second but
these comments go yet another phone that
I can't buy unless i watch the net like
a hawk on meth harrell powerfully
unviable and powerfully beautiful you
mean predictable right some large fellow
commented man no claws are out I mean
hey well I'm gonna wait till we can find
out some more on this and we will be
finding out some more on this do not
worry you're going to put our hands on
this device did you talk about pricing
can we move on yeah yeah to 20 to 50 ish
somewhere in there cool sorry I was
trying to deal with the problem with
media card its jewels all pics later to
you as well oh you don't know you don't
even have it yeah it's not great flow
read some it's funny cuz some days it's
fine and some days is not maybe jewels
maybe somebody in jewels offices plan is
sweet oh and I was home forever that's
no good well I didn't ask Jules weed we
didn't mean to me please well I guess
it's gonna be our faces for a second hey
let's talk about that other big ass
phone we talked about OE spec good yeah
that's better that's slightly better
let's talk about that other big ass
phone release that we teased in our
intro verizon wireless is surprise
surprise launching some more droids who
are complete shock no one's know this
one counts stunned at this uh how many
funds are we talking about Stephen
though it's not like last year we only
have the droid turbo this looks like a
twofer yeah i mean we're talking about
invite coming up here for a verizon
motorola launch event and again we're
talking about two week time frame here
the 27th yeah and they say droids uh so
more than one definitely and unless
we've been completely missing something
out there looks like running at two
phones the droid turbo 2 and the droid
maxx coming back from been about two
years since i think we saw the original
droid maxx two could join the droid
turbo to the droid maxx too has been
named is popped up in numerous official
sources google mentioned did a couple
weeks ago whether it's it out right in
this support doc the droid maxx too is
the US edition
the Moto X play so finally coming to the
US all right so ya better than that yeah
just on verizon and the return 0 2 is
the phone that we've been hearing about
also as the moto x force is probably how
it's going to come out internationally
we don't know what Motorola is thinking
about it international launch event
maybe that'll be a little more low key
thing in the days following the the
turbo to announcement but that's going
to be you know the higher-end option
here quad HD oh wait they're not gonna
drop these on the same day these two
yeah these two become one of the same
day the Moto X Forks we don't know what
we might hear about that oh yeah right
who knows uh ya know this is interesting
um there was uh there's a bee I don't
know I I want to take a look at this I
noticed that you said we will be on the
ground for the new LT launch event which
is you know that was good of you Steven
that is normally where we would be we
were there for the droid turbo like I
personally can't think of any reason why
we wouldn't be there this year but you
know who note the world is a confusing
place and you know I don't know
sometimes you send emails ago you know I
just don't remember they're in New York
necessarily at this event right ya know
will sparrows now just go to my I got it
well I gotta go back to moe's southwest
grill at some point yeah you gotta get
some more punch cards or something
absolutely make sure that I get my
sodium let's talk about a carrier
development here this was in Jersey
Lakes I don't like this I guess I am and
so i guess i'll talk about even though
it's quite confusing to me it is in it
but it can't it sort of can't help but
be a but be a confusing top yeah AT&amp;amp;T
this week announced something called
numbersync and if you're with it if your
hip with this with mobile technology you
will probably you will probably
recognize what i mean when i say this is
basically a teen teen of google voice
which is a capability to among other
things forward all of your calls and
text messages to all of your devices but
it takes it a step further by then by
allowing sort of full back and forth
interoperability so if you have say a
smart phone a smart watch and a tablet
and you give somebody your phone number
and say text me later
and they text you that text will be
distributed to all of your devices or
whichever one you're actively using at
the moment which I think it will be
smart enough to know and then when you
reply that reply will no matter what
device you reply from that replied will
also be logged across all devices it's
this sort of this is kind of link
functionality we've learned to expect
from cross-platform messaging clients
accepts using the existing broad
compatibility of SMS so people reaching
you don't have to have some special app
there just send you a regular text
message but you get it everywhere it's
all synced up best of both worlds in
theory right and there's also that this
extends to voice calls as well where the
hardware allows you as access exit to
voicemail to basically any means through
which people can get ahold of you will
be synced across your devices and the
limitations that we should be aware
there are and I want you to hit those
but there's something else that I'm
trying to I just want to cover it like
the basic it won't require a tone app
well sort of it'll be bit but it will
require specific devices right because
they have to bake this in to the carrier
bag and he said it's going to work with
likely your default SMS client but with
the stipulation that ATT has to convince
the company's making the SMS clients to
build the functionality in yeah and it
has I mean there isn't a list yet of
what devices are going to support this
and when 18t said the first one is
coming soonish more by the end of the
year but I don't think it's named any
just yet I'm feeling it's gonna be like
iphone and then maybe some high-end a
high-profile Android but right then
confirmed and it won't work with
importantly I think it did they say it
won't work with dumb phones or it has
some some limitations in terms of I'm
gonna need at least one smart phone that
supports voice over LTE well not at
least one you need a 1 vo LTE smartphone
this will not work with non view LTE
devices it won't work with multiple
smart phones you can mock those
smartphones you're not be able to share
the and sync up these messages between
them right so it has different yeah you
have to have different form factors
essentially is right it's basically
allows you to use companion devices with
one primary
with your smart phone line so yeah the
messages that would be sent to your
phone also show up on your smart walks
you have a cell enabled one or on your
cell and they will tablet right so in
the midst of all this so AT&amp;amp;T drops this
bomb and I'm like it's not a bomb 18t
drops this firecracker and I'm like this
is actually pretty sweet pretty
interesting it is because if you don't
have a google voice or if you you can't
have google voice for whatever reason or
if you don't care about go you don't
want to give Google your stuff but yeah
I think that's the important thing with
this is it makes easy to use with an
existing number I know you can take a
number import it to google voice but
yeah people are a little apprehensive of
taking their number to have for so long
and you know signing it over to Google I
know you still have control over it but
it sure but in there but there are
people who also don't want like wait so
Google's gonna like have all my text
messages ever and like it's going to be
an actual like no I don't want it so if
you trust AT&amp;amp;T more than Google I don't
know if that's a great idea or not but
hey great times anyway you have another
option that's great so I think it's
great so what does tmobile do like what
does non seconds after this it doesn't
cost have compatible devices you're
you're good to go yeah so it t mobile
jumps in like you know about a half
minute after AT&amp;amp;T speaks happens like no
that's stupid that's nobody wants that's
stupid we're focus on building things
people want your dumb you guys are all
dumb that's based it was verbatim the
release right soon yeah he doesn't
release is we're gonna do something
awesome it's gonna blow this out of the
water and then tells us nothing about it
it's okay for it probably t-mobile does
a pretty good job of being like no this
is stupid let me tell you why like you
are but yeah but this is basically like
what currently AT&amp;amp;T is strategy is to
build or buy things and then try to
convince customers they asked for it
that's what chief operating officer Mike
sievert said of of AT&amp;amp;T from his chair
another a company I think of them like
labs yeah meanwhile say they see verdict
lens to mobile asks customers what they
want a need and then builds it so I ok
but would is the take over here is
t-mobile gonna build a competitor yeah
and accuse are selling a sprint also has
something so this might not be super
unique out there but AT&amp;amp;T is at least
getting some press for its it's a new
effort yeah meanwhile verizon's just
just happy to be happy
change in its logo and happy to be
number one and just sitting on top no
one's gonna do what y'all want to do
frazzin don't need you uh let's talk
software LG scored a little bit of a
LG's had a good week in the press first
we don't have the rundown but first
Google came out and kind of in the
middle of a cop's yeah so well jeez a
great partner they're just terrific and
now LG is the first officially I believe
the first Android OEM to release android
marshmallow on an existing device yeah
in at least one market did I put enough
qualifiers in there oh wait is it
already out well it'll be out soon and
only a yeah first in Poland right so we
they said we're gonna put my g4 is gonna
be first to get marshmallow Europe
already got it before when we're talking
about what lollipop uh yeah yes it's
easier when you're not dealing with all
the US carrier is and yeah coming up
first then other markets will follow
good on ya LG was it motorola i think
had the first lollipops out last year
didn't they yeah back before it started
essing the bed when it came to two
updates and let's make a big deal about
that I wonder you know I didn't put that
in the rundown but Motorola's having
this issue where they have done this
blog post words like hey here's other
vices getting marshmallow get excited
and not on that last last year
smartphones last year's the last year's
not last year's Moto X 2014 pure edition
but the 2014 carrier editions are not
we're not in the post and I think droid
life ran I ran an editorial basically
had a scathing what dog was happening
looking for Allah and I think would burn
them the most was that Motorola wouldn't
even respond to a request for comment
which I agree is kind of follow
infuriating oh this is a tangent but
reminds me guess what I did last weekend
what I took my mother shopping for her
first-ever smartphone no way yes we
ended up walking away with a galaxy s6
but we were looking at all the devices
in the motorola me of the rise in store
there and there were i was surprised at
it by the number of older models still
out on display
I have to warn her you can get this if
you want mom it's because you really
liked smaller phones and so a lot of the
smaller ones are older but thinking
about motorola and with last year's Moto
X and your mom you get one of these
devices that's pushing 18 months old now
you don't know what you're in for in
terms of ongoing software support here
so yeah a little more the newer one true
enough although i still i continue to
think that only only people in our
segment really care much about the yeah
when I tossed you people you're becoming
a lot more important a security updates
are crucial know that you're absolutely
right but as far as usability goes I
every time anyone in my parents
demographic including my parents is
talking about an update it goes like
this my phone keeps bothering me when I
try to do something what's it saying
it's summer update I hate I don't want
to update it works fine I don't want to
update any hmm so I don't think this
this is as big a deal as it is a big
deal because motorola built its current
reputation on awesome updates and now
it's sort of it hasn't taken long for it
to sort of fall off that horse but if
you care that much about updates why
would you get a carrier version of a
phone anyway when a pure version is
available yeah I know come on Jules is
like Jules makes a good point he wrote
an editorial on this and will do I don't
know maybe he'll put the link in the
rundown Jules always gets really bent
out of shape if we talk about a topic
that he wrote an editorial on we don't
have the link in the rundown feels
nobody reads a rundown but put it in
there put it in there because we want
you to read it we want people to read
that's not the route flash yet listen
Google Joel wrote another wrote another
piece that I'll talk about Dean he this
is a piece called equal time well was a
segment called equal time where we talk
about Jules's pieces um no this was
pieces of jewels are we talking about
this was this was terrific because this
was a headline that went like this every
ok Google request you've made can be
listened to and deleted and the deleted
part is important because you want to be
able to delete to your funky request but
it was just a listen to two-bit remember
go steam when i talked about google
voice now what archives all your text
messages you could search him and be
like I put your tin hat on sure yeah
brother you want to do that first but I
didn't know this and Jules reported this
uh I did not know that every google
voice google voice request you've made
is archived so I went in and listened to
mine Oh Lord literally everyone it's
real it's like it is it is this place
where there's a lot of clips of my voice
do it saying things like you know it's
like how many space shuttle flights were
there and like wake me up at 8am and
like you know I just like what's the
problem with those pokemons and just all
the affected crazy yeah right how can i
tell if my toe will fall off and it's
you know it's fun because you do it
every time of day so is every bit of
background noise whether it's are you
still happy to wake a supercut of them
or something oh god that would be the
best oh I love that the whole even the
just the alarm clock segment would be
like 18 minutes wake me up at 745 a.m.
wake me and the failed ones don't seem
to be in there unless I'm wrong um and
the failed ones are the ones where I'm
just like just completely lazy fair or
like a little drunk I'm like semi damn
alarm for 830 p.m. but it doesn't damn
just brings it up so it doesn't know
where it was first ones anyway you can
delete them if you want to if you can
stop them from being archived as well I
went I think I'd set that a while ago
because I didn't see any money did you
oh that sucks you can go into the Google
settings app on your android phone and
personal info and privacy activity
controls voice and out audio activity
manage activity and this is also just a
general reminder pay attention to these
privacy controls here I mean it's not
just google facebook at all have a lot
of little settings you can delve into
and have some degree of say over what
they're collecting on you so maybe take
a minute and look at those and make sure
it's only keeping what you would like it
to be keeping indeed indeed a Rooney I'm
with you mm-hmm Samsung and LG by the
way is to Steven people are really
interested in knowing what your next
phone is going to be and I'm going to
ask you later
don't worry we're gonna get to the left
of the nice folks I'm gonna place for
this news cuz I have stuff to do I've
secret stuff to do so we have insurance
Samsung and LG reportedly ramp up
foldable smartphone display development
finally whoa tell me about this Steven
if you will look there's a graphic here
with like a lot of phones folded up like
wallets and they look Eddie gross a
conceptual that you don't like that like
a money clip it's nasty put your money
in there I mean this is a foldable
screens look like they're gonna be the
next curve streams we saw these teased
in trade shows for years they were
always sort of hanging out there under
glass you've seen like how many times
you can fold this without breaking it
and how far and then all of a sudden
they're going to appear in the market
like we saw with the curb phones when
this happens it could it be next year or
we've heard rumors about ramping up
production let's say there's talk here
about maybe 2018 for the iphone here it
makes sense to start something like this
on a larger device basically because
with the fabrication you can only fold
these so far something pocket-sized
might be putting a little too much
stress on these flexible oled panels
here tablet size even though it's all
kind of intuitive larger my make this
easier to work with cuz you're not
dealing with such tight tolerances and
small angles things are bending around
so maybe an 11 inch bubble tab that
could help introduce this something like
that old I think Michael you had
something about this recently that Sony
dual screen oh the tablet t yeah if
there was like that but without one
hangs in the middle if it was a screen
that stretched across cross both sides
that might be how we first see this tech
emerge commercially at least yeah yeah
yeah if there's any demand for that I
mean I thought the same thing about curb
screens on phones that it looks really
neat I don't know how many people are
going to ask for this but we're not
going to know until they finally release
it so bring it on I say I agree and I
think that we should prepare ourselves
for uh maybe somewhat unimpressive
display performance on these foldable
things because even with the first gen G
flex which only had I forgot what the
exact radius curve was on that but even
with its very minor curve that the P
OLED panel that they built for that
thing had some serious compromises in
terms of quality how was the screen
quality your get to handle the the
samsung one now the round the galaxy
round yeah I've never even seen one or
her so like I got at a trade show not
like in the hands of a colleague I've
never laid eyes on a galaxy round that's
an Amador phone or old head of Internet
oh yeah also the Commodore phone has yet
to arrive apparently people are getting
out they're not getting it so yeah so I
bitch they're out there somewhere
they're really great job at responding
to requests not just for comment but
like a customer request and like hey I
spent three hundred seven dollars with
you guys do you want to tell me where my
phone is you don't even want to this is
where we hit the button for the cricket
sound effects cook yeah right where was
that mmm wish Commodore head out your
startup sound that we could if we just
got home of the CRT monitor
Oh riots riots is what we mean yeah I
that's how I feel mad as hell let's get
our minds off of that and learn
something from Joe Levi this normally
would be a segment called learn
something and we'd normally have a sound
drop for that and Joe Levi would
normally be here but we can none of that
is happening so I just want to tell you
that he wrote a sweet piece called nexus
quick charging explained because I've
been curious when we get our Nexus
phones I'm like how fast are they gonna
charge what is this USB type-c thing is
it what's the deal with reason and i are
playing peanuts yeah so in and how fast
will the charge and what are the
differences and and by the way what does
everyone else using for their quick
charging stuff so Joe rut wrote a really
nice piece talking about the differences
between Qualcomm quick charge the USB
type-c stuff opposed vo sync charging
oppo and talking about the different the
different currents and voltages and
power and it's just terrific you should
listen to it yeah I didn't realize how
many different standards were in play
here this is like the wired equivalent
of early days of wireless charging here
where yeah if you have this up became
with your phone you're in good shape but
got it if you have multiple devices
you're juggling here multiple adapters
it's enough to drive you crazy btdubs
I've been trying to determine a new way
of a new unboxing strategy because i
have um let me count them one two three
four five six seven eight and I I have
an access of 13 uh wireless chargers and
it is not just just like aggregation
over time I have these all for a very
specific purpose i'm going to be doing
this massive wireless charging video
yeah but is it gonna be like a sign pic
mean angle yeah i'm just kind of a stack
of them they're all gonna be charging
each other and they're gonna burst into
flames yes but i'm having a difficult
time getting an angle for this i don't
want to be like you know the best and
the worst of wireless charging in 2015
because that's so longer so um I also
want to just like showcase I'll just
want a nerd out with them so i might
periscope it when i get some time which
will not be soon but i'm letting
everyone know if you have wireless
charging pitches send
to me if there are things you want to
know I even have a table like everyone
else is already reviewed of a key a
thing well no it's that it's from phone
salesman phone with an F uh they have
they have a tape they sent me a table
it's like an end table it's with a
circular top and it's got it's like two
feet high and it's got wireless charging
bills and I just dropped my phone on top
of just charge its I like it very much
we find one of those people who think
that like they're being poisoned by
electromagnetic radiation and walk them
through your room full of wireless
chargers and see what happens I'm gonna
be fine just see what happens get it
yeah we can do that right there Jules is
reminding me of the alchy thing which is
was the most beautiful wireless charger
I had used up to that point the alkyl
una but it broke like two days after our
last video featuring out so sad face but
it what's looks like a an onyx plate
propped up on up stand it was beautiful
sister circular thing crowdfunding opens
four blocks this is a modular smart the
modular SmartWatch is here modular
something had to finally happen we were
holding our breath for our I never
popped up yeah the RI proud project ara
from google a which has been delayed 08
modular smartphone but this modular
watch this is your chance he's a curious
and interesting thing they are on
Kickstarter right now they are beyond
their goal by quite a bit of thing that
goes 250,000 or like almost 800,000 yeah
I talked about this like an hour after
the the funding opened and they've
already passed the goal by then yeah
fast yeah it'd be people are you know
people find this to be a compelling idea
and I get it if you watch their video
you understand why they do a very good
job pitching the use cases of this of
this kind of thing where it's like
you're going through your life and
you're climbing a rock face and your
smart watches like boom low batteries
like no problem let me reach into my
Scottevest it's just kidding it's not a
video let me reach into my backpack and
pull out what looks like a just little
ol watch link but it's actually a spare
battery or like I'm at home and I don't
want to carry my big ass iphone six-plus
around let me drop that on the table and
pop this other special link into my
watch and it's a cellular radio so now
my watch is a
phone watch voice control stuff extra
battery stuff Bluetooth Wi-Fi radios
body management stuff like you know
heart rate sensors and stuff there's
developer modules you build anything out
of this thing it looks like yeah there's
a bunch that it's originally launching
with so you back this you can just get
the regular watch with a plain old dumb
strap but what's the point of that for a
little more you get your choice of up to
four links i think from the available
ones more of them becoming in a future
they have some ideas of ones that are
going to be out maybe around the time
thing actually ships and it's all open
source standards so third-party
developers are welcome to design their
own hardware modules here in theory
there's a lot of potential here I'm
curious to see how well it works I think
it's limited a little by the physicality
of it like it show you can go with three
links if you want but then the watch is
smaller so your wrist size sort of
controls the amount of functionality you
get and then I don't have to be swapping
out ones for other ones like it might
have to trade your fingerprint scanner
for the extra battery when you need more
more charge they're so curious to see
how well it works in practice but it's a
really interesting concept it is I think
a big challenge here is the is the look
because when you're building these links
when you're making components out of
these links you need a minimum of space
for pretty much anything you want to do
so the links are really big and the way
they come together is you know it's
logical they come together in a band
there's only so many ways you can make a
circle with rectangular links but it
does look pretty chunky to me and I
think that's going to be a challenge for
for adoption but it's apparently yeah
apparently this is what i love about
Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general
you can see the consumer interest the
direct consumer interest in a product
right away before it's even built like
there are three times as many people as
they need to be interested in this thing
interested in this thing so I think
that's fantastic like we always talked
about how like everyone's always talking
about how like so mobile technologies
dead looks plateau the smart phones
tablets are going away and all those
it's like no they don't really enjoy
enough yeah happening
it is it is pretty badass you asked me
on the flip side of the coin teenagers
don't care about the Apple watch and
this is concerning but they do care
about the iphone which and I'm we heard
a report probably three years ago by now
that thought that the youths were
getting disenfranchised with Apple it
wasn't cool anymore well I did not hear
that lately I did not read that report I
did not see it I remember we talked to
it yeah while they they seem to like the
iphone just fine this was interesting it
showed that over the past year or so
interest in smartwatches in general has
been going up but in the Apple watch
particular has been going down right but
but I don't know though I only watch has
sort of gone up there's necessary
there's necessarily at at odds aren't
those at odds though because I feel like
interest in the Apple watch is interest
in smart watches and generally the Apple
watch is easily the most visible
SmartWatch so maybe I this intersection
is as they as more people more teens
actually pick up a SmartWatch maybe the
sort of realizing this for one reason or
another isn't giving me the
functionality I was looking for or the
you know the trade-offs aren't worth the
compound's out of the benefits well so
they're getting exposure and then that's
in turn causing their interest to drop
off now let's see what it is maybe now
yeah let's talk this time with the
numbers here this is um mainly the
discouraging figure is in the intent to
buy figure where the Apple watch has
fifty five percent market share among
early SmartWatch adopters according to
this report alas intent to buy has
plummeted from sixteen percent last fall
to eleven percent in the spring and only
eight percent now now that's interesting
to me I do wonder it what about the
timing of this report i wonder if intent
by is falling because people are because
we're going into the holidays when
people do not have intent the teenagers
tend to buy themselves anything because
yeah
that's dumb i wonder if there's like
there should be a metric that's like you
know desire to receive as gift mmm but i
don't know maybe it is possible that i'm
not interpreting that data correctly and
i'm just an ugly up alive there's no
would buy a SmartWatch period and then
we see this break i mean says he has 55
percentage but i'm curious if it general
trend from smart walk interest has been
in line with apples interest yeah i'm
now i'm not entirely sure and i mean i
think even if you don't care about the
apple watch as like does the most
insufferable of our of our commenters
and incessantly remind us that the apple
watch along with all apple products are
garbage in that we're we're paid to make
them sound good um good care about the
apple watch if you care about smart
watches because the apple watch the
success or failure of the apple watch
will will definitely affect the rest of
the SmartWatch market to put it lightly
yeah and if you don't care about smart
watches well that's fine hopefully you
skipped ahead in your podcast streaming
app if you're watching us live you just
stuck here man the same this ain't life
is strange you can bet it relate time by
the way my room it's been playing life
is strange and on the steam and it's
like one of the best games I've ever
seen in this in the most interesting way
possible like it's not it's not like a
follower of money as anything katamari
to have me it's better it's better than
we golf I will tell you that oh now
follow us on Twitter ask me is like
right after I tweeted about life is
strange if I have any love for something
like Call of Duty or something like that
I'm like this is as far away from
anything like that as possible and it's
really great that gaming is such a broad
category that I do you have time for
gaming Michael I don't have time to
watch other people game while I edit
video oh yeah hey let's talk about my
favorite smartphone the blackberry prev
I do not understand how BlackBerry's
releasing this thing i would do I don't
you understand it they make something
beautiful and they were they put it out
to the masses and people throw money are
we never gonna get a launch event is
what I'm curious yeah I get this ether
yeah we were making this and now it's
kind of here and I guess you guys could
order it but if you want to I mean no
big deal but there's been no promotional
campaign
no launch event nothing they are low key
on this and I know because I keep I keep
bugging them repeatedly this is a
hands-on video Jules LOL at the name
yeah if you don't live in the UK the
name the brand name carphone warehouse
is just sounds like an artifact from
1989 radioshack ad yeah but it is a
massive brand in in Europe I don't know
if it's confined to the UK I don't think
of this but they it's a big retailer
that carries smartphones and gets them
so in some cases before anybody big deal
it's not making stuff up it has these
numbers data here that says the brib
bubble november six it's going to be
delivered like deliveries can be
expected november six which is crazy nan
upon a super fast we had the opportunity
to get some specs confirmed we've kind
of talked with this before but five
point four inch display it is quad HD my
40 ppi the selfie cam is 2 megapixel
mm-hmm and they've got that 18 megapixel
schneider kreuznach cruz knock
gesundheit i gotta learn this that's
like that so I don't sound like I
Klingon but yeah that like there's
there's some great stuff here really
slick video it's like only 50 seconds
long on carphone warehouse's site where
they've basically unbox the thing and
and shown you what's what uh interesting
we had got some dimensions here nine
point four millimeters thick I was under
the impression it was going to be a
little thinner than that I mean yeah
it's got the slider McIntyre and we have
a lot of forgiveness there for a thicker
device but it seems like everyone who
had handled this thing was really
impressed by how thin it was and I guess
for what it is that still might be true
well let's think about it I mean the
that is considerably thinner than
admittedly thick phones like the Moto X
pure or the One m9 which are sitting
around the 10 or 11 millimeter market
their thickest point in the center so
just a nine point whatever 9.4 9.4 I
mean that's that is considering it's a
slider phone that's why yeah yeah yeah
don't get me wrong I'm not throwing any
shade at the other fruit here you give
you a good number getting my heckles up
hell are you talking about Steven now
i'm gonna review this thing fairly i'm
gonna try to review this thing fairly i
have way too many phones in my queue
to actually reviews we should by all
rights be giving this to someone else on
the team but no one I'm touching this
phone first I want this so badly you're
gonna lick it so no one else can have it
yes it gonna be like the guy in the
Volkswagen commercial going right
somebody was asking about the river in
the Q&amp;amp;A but it is not one of the
questions I'm marked so we will move on
the last story in the rundown um i
really i like my headline better than
news so i'm online last time on the
internet last night i'm on the world
wide web and I see somebody else run a
story based on like an XDA thread or a
reddit thread or something about showing
this it's really cool thing showing this
clear galaxy note5 back it is I mean
what more do I need to say it is a
perfectly transparent glass back on the
note 5 it isn't fatty all them this
stock back it's not even like a custom
active device blew my mind a little
crazy um so I'm like whoa that's oh my
god do 19-9 done like 1999 2002 clear
nextel i-95 day looks like an old a
gameboy play it now clear edition yeah
they're bright it which is what you said
so I passed this onto jewels and like
jewels you gotta run this this is gonna
be so hot I'm so amped on this and Jules
responds only two minutes like yeah I
saw that and I really didn't want to run
us it's so lame lame like wow wow so
then he ran the story and then you ran
the headline why is this pass a galaxy
note5 marketing erratically what you are
the worst kind of person no I find it
awesome here's what you need to do if
you want to do this apparently need to
heat the thing up with a heat gun get
use a powerful suction cup to pull the
backup one say goodbye to your warranty
oh yeah give mediately but you pulled a
back plate off an apparently on the back
side of the glass back plate is where
all the color is Jules is highlighting
something but because the resolution is
so terrible on the stream I can't see
what he's highlighting yeah there are
better things you can do with the cover
off than just voiding your warranty
discover the device hack the thing even
further make some bigger news than this
I don't you you are you are a killjoy
food
attend of the kilchers it now this is
awesome um but you use a razor blade to
remove the color film from the inside of
the glass and then you just put the
glass back and you haven't changed
anything about already there in your
phone yeah right you could do this so
there's a video um there's a video
showing you how to do it I think it's
awesome I can't wait till next week we
see the videos everyone melting their
note follow I know fantastic yeah this
is going to be the new the new gate um
but I would personally do this on a
galaxy s6 edge plus I think because I
think that lends itself more to but you
either way you can see the metal frame
on the inside the battery and the
everyone's making the jokes I comments
no no you can see the better you can't
remove her LOL hatin trying to catch me
mod and dirty I think it's beautiful
july three gorgeous to you cray i'll
give you a pass a um it's about time for
listening now before we get into that I
want to get into them cues is have we
had some more interest since earlier yes
it's team and everyone's bothering you
groans like Stephen shank do some work
instead of sitting on your duck Eric
Eric Eric hoots as whilst even review or
share impressions of his next phone we
would all like to see more reviews from
him that's a good question um I can
almost guarantee my next phone will not
be a phone that's just launching I need
to wait and see what the response is
like not just from my peers but from the
users in general um I would not expect
to be at the bleeding edge of the curve
so maybe like an impressions thing might
be appropriate but I you know while I
was shopping for with my mom's phone I
had to play with a lot of them than
thingy print scanners and all the phones
there yeah and got to admit I've been a
doubting Thomas of sorts for the
fingerprint scanners in general I'm sort
of coming around to them so I'm thinking
a little about the nexus 5x again I'm
not going to get this until we start
seeing some reviews ah but it's possible
I might be persuaded so we should have
more storage and expandability and all
sorts of
other things that are important to me
but I think I could live with it I still
love my Nexus 5 it's not it's not doing
me wrong just yet but it's getting a
little long in the tooth so I'm looking
around there i'm playing the feel do you
think that i'll use this to jump to
another Q&amp;amp;A question do you think this
phone might be something that's up your
alley as HTC is struggling to make a
profit for a couple years now says
nikita van Styron do you feel the
rumored a 9 is a desperate measure to
attract some media attention for copying
the iphone 6s or six how lucky wants
people to call it out for copying it
just so we can get a little press so
it's a good some visibility I don't know
about that well first I want to ask you
would you consider that would you
consider the a9 basically based on what
I've seen it's not high-end enough I
mean considering the frequency at which
I upgrade I want something that's going
to be good to three years from now so
probably not Jules brings up the design
share agreement HTC and Apple enjoy
which I do not know enough about at this
point this might be a good opportunity
for a PSA and no we've reported on
before but Jules maybe we want to
refresh everybody's memory about what
that agreement is maybe you can wait we
promise not to sue each other agreement
yeah exactly right between HTC and Apple
particularly with elements concerning
design i believe which is why HTC is it
may be the reason that HTC is doing it
this way by all accounts unless we're
being fooled and all these are fakes and
the arrow looks nothing like this but I
don't think that's going to be the case
so Jules read it up I'd like to know
more it would be great I think my mom
made some comment that the s6 look like
the iPhone oh it does I mean I there six
looks a lot like the iPhone se but we'll
see so Nikki I don't know i don't think
that HTC if if this a9 design is final i
don't think the HTC is doing it to
attract media attention for copying the
iphone but if i'm at HTC and I've just
built the m9 and watched it basically
fall on its face and watched Samsung not
hit its targets but sell a whole lot of
copies of the galaxy s6 which looks
a lot like an iPhone maybe I build an
iphone yeah we read the writing on the
wall yeah so hey good commentary from
glad i bought at the verge this week
about that very thing which Julius was
referencing to always good columns from
Vlad why is Pablo Maldonado why is the
blu studio energy to a budget device and
it can fit five thousand million power
battery and still have a somewhat slim
profile but we can't see it on a
flagship Steven vs. don't we could
manufacturers clearly don't seem to
think that there is enough demand for
this device if they could make a phone
like that and it would sell like a
galaxy s6 they would these companies
aren't stupid but I guess they've done
market analysis it says that yep there
are people out there by yourself Pablo
who we really like a phone like this I
guess the priority even if it only adds
like half a millimeter I'm sure they've
had focus groups handle these phones
this feels better I'd rather buy this
and the numbers play out how they do
someone just blew my face off in the
chat Kenneth Escalona asks if microsoft
released continuum for lumia 950 or XL
will we ever see xbox phone an Xbox
phone with continuum but made for gaming
and would you buy one that's a great
question I don't think we will because I
think gaming is so intensely demanding
on hardware that it would be really
tough to build a phone that could handle
that considering it you know with the
idea that it's gonna be on a big ol
screen oh you disagree you don't think
that it would be impossible I think that
the phone hardware it tends to be closer
to the the edge of development than
console hardware could you have to plan
console hardware so far out right the
time you get it it's already tending to
be a little bit below the curve and
whereas they get a turnaround time on
phones is so fast but like a console is
like half a microwave oven like in size
that's what it takes to run a game to
run a really really well it is your take
apart nintendo 64 the circuit boards
like that big it's nothing it's a
Nintendo 60
no okay if one make an appointment they
make these things bigger so they look
more impressive than the circuits inside
they're not so big say Jules makes the
point that Tegra needs to get on it with
their hundred ninety-six say that
reminds me a lot of what Nvidia is doing
with its shield stuff you play you can
like stream the pc game to the well it's
like the opposite then i guess to the
shield whatever the new account consoles
called now she'll handheld something
like that I don't know yeah I I would
love to see it i think it's a i think
it's a very cool idea i think that would
be a really interesting you know but
what I think the problem though is that
mobile operating systems I mean Android
especially are not super Optima is tour
for gaming but it's not a mobile OS it's
Windows 10 this windows 10 mobile but
it's Windows 10 you know I'm saying but
Stephen just see but suddenly stephen
has gone Wow now I'm in a room by myself
it's okay while Stephen figures out his
technical issues assuming he does we're
gonna answer a couple more Q&amp;amp;A and i
moved to listener mail Jonas come out
when are you getting a Lumia for review
Jonas I don't know selecting question
please wait okay there we go uh I don't
know and I'm not lying to you um Stevens
back Google did not like what I was
saying it aside I need to be
authenticate isn't that the most
hilarious thing Google does this too by
the way you it's just we're gonna hate
on google for 25 seconds it's so funny
it's it like the you'll be in the middle
of a hangout or in the middle of
anything often though happened in the
middle of a google doc I'll be typing
and everything collapses every Google's
have my browser like reloads is like you
need to be authentic you right this
second and it happens in android too
i'll be in the middle of using like
Evernote and then the apple crash I
think it crashes on like what are you
doing and then I see in the notification
bar it's like oh I'm updating Evernote
right now you you decided to update when
I was a bar doing any work it's the
funniest thing but anyway uh love you
goog just Jake hey anyway um what the
hell are we talking about oh yeah Jonas
oh you're getting a Lumia for review we
don't know yet but we really want one
and we also want those fancy
leatherbacks to check out as well oh
yeah those guys I was gonna write about
those they just went up for pre-order
but the site craft and I couldn't verify
the link but apparently they're out
there yeah I'm definitely going to need
one of those two to get to make my 950
look nice so the butchery brings me into
Eric recruits other question Michael
with William with Williams windows
mobile been shaping up nicely do you
plan to use the new leu me as one of
your daily phones and position camera
should make its spiritual successor
every 10-20 you like so much yeah well
the world has changed i wouldn't i don't
i would probably buy it with the camera
in mind but now that it's not impossible
to get a good camera experience on
android that's less of a thing for me um
whew what a thing yeah but I but
actually despite that yes i think i will
carry at windows 10 mobile phone is my
second hand held because I've been doing
welding Android for a bit just of
necessity and I don't like it the reason
part of the reason I carry two phones is
to have two different platforms to enjoy
the differences between them and keep a
pace captain same phones exactly it's
not a captain dupe phone so yeah it will
I will get one of them I don't know
which it will be but I'm gonna get
either the 950 or the XL to carry in my
other pouch and I've been using the 930
with the newest version of Windows 10
that Windows 10 insider preview and it's
starting to look really pretty that new
one where you had to back up to 8.1
first to install it I didn't know um
yeah but I I'm not on a new new one I'm
on a new ish one you know it's fine I
actually don't want to be used in the
insider previews anymore I want to come
at it fresh when they actually hit the
market but uh yeah I'm excited for it I
actually am now excited for it I was
worried because it was so ugly in the
first insider builds and even though I
said it so many times back then I was
like listen I know it's a preview build
but man it was ugly and a mess and and
gross Jules has a project Phi invite he
might or might not use as well I do too
Jules had just got mine are you gonna
use yours I don't think so
I want to very badly would save me some
money but it the way it ruins google
voice will make it so make it
impractical for me right as i need you
google voice for stuff like this for
what we're just talking right now with
windows phone like I need to be able to
just like forward my number joint text
to a different number that's not an
android phone and I really don't wanna
be stuck in hangouts for all of my
messaging which completa find makes you
do hangouts is just not very good do you
guys think that will see the Moto X play
unlocked in the US or did the droid maxx
to prevent that from happening nada my
gut says no but I don't miss a turtle
yeah i think verizon wrangled that
exclusive yeah but who knows i mean i
think you'd you'd probably have to be
there to find out and who knows if we'll
be there or not listener mail I am faith
it's time for listener yeah being that
ticket Steven I've been talking for too
long what do you want to read the first
email from Ronnie if you will ani yeah
we want to hear from Ronnie these were
numbered first usually means mm-hmm
didn't I put him in the I put oh well
whatever what do you want for it Ronan
not fun he writes it oh hey guys my name
is Ronan I have the HTC One m8 but I
want to upgrade my phone before
Christmas I've been watching the windows
event and I really like the Lumia 950
you're not alone I've had a windows
phone before so I'm not a noob here but
do you guys think app developers are
gonna start actually making apps for
Windows Phone now it's time to go back
and give a platform another chance love
the show keep up the good work ah this
kind of reminds me what you were talking
about on the last podcast Michael you're
referring to the new direction for
windows mobile seems to be a lot more
business oriented and auras the
enterprise scale yeah that's going to
affect the attractiveness of the
platform to developers I mean we've seen
sort of like a slow peeling off of
people who maybe once released like
upwards no bank of america or was it
chase or whomever well they have their
Windows Phone apps and then they gave
them a shot and
then those went away there's sort of
business idea that these companies who
are dropping app support we're doing
sonor to devote resources to Windows 10
Universal apps that will work across
form factors here that may play a role
in bringing more back to the table here
but if it's going to really encourage a
lot of new developer interest that
haven't already been working on the
platform I don't know what do you think
I think that air each every time Windows
Phone sees a generational like
reinvention we sort of always say the
same thing like this is going to be at
this is going to be the time that
Windows Phone apps are going to catch on
but this time is significantly different
because you're not writing a Windows
Phone app you're writing a Windows 10 mm
goes yeah and that means it will it will
work on a surface it'll work on a dell
laptop it'll work on your phone it'll
just scale differently I think that's a
much more compelling proposition to devs
I'm not a developer I'm not an expert in
developer relations so maybe i'm just
drinking the Microsoft kool-aid and
vomiting it back up I don't know but
someone should tell me if I am but it
seems to me that it's a more compelling
pitch if I were a dev I would think that
I would make more money that way so and
we've already seen commitments from at
the microsoft event they called out
facebook is building special Windows 10
apps for facebook instagram and facebook
Messenger that's great finally yeah and
so yeah you know I think that I think
there's promise but I also there's also
this thing of this thing that's
constantly being teased of being able to
run iOS and Android apps on windows 10
only hinge means you can run it on
windows 10 mobile as well really
lightweight wrappers right right but
that splintered experience a is not very
good as we learn from blackberry and be
dis incentivizes developers to build
special windows 10 versions if people
are just going to be using their iOS and
Android versions hmm and then it
introduces another level of weirdness
because i know i quoted this before and
I know people don't give a crap about
ingress except for me but it's a really
good example his ingress was a made by
google by a division of google and if
you tried to run ingress in the special
blackberry version of android and
they're like sandbox whatever it was
alright ingress would detect that
as an invalid install and it would not
let you run it and it would disable your
ingress like player account you'd have
to write them for support because
they're you and a hanger about that yeah
so that's the kind of thing this is the
problem when you like hack around
problems hack around issues like that so
we have to wait to learn more as the
short answer yeah I'm excited I'm I'm
still guys I'm still I'm not know like
I'm there's no bread box mmm bigger than
a bread box I'm I'm more bullish on
windows from than I was last week may be
bullish bearish days i right I'm not
sure but I don't want to I I'm not
trying to come across like a poser here
I really still think the 950 950 XL or
are stopgaps and I'm much more excited
for the surface phone but it's what
we're getting it's what we're getting
right now they have some pretty cool
specs and those backs will make them
much more attractive than the stock
backs which look like crap so bitter did
it don't do what's the next piece of
listener Malcolm boom boom well I guess
we're going Bell next either way here we
got a message here from Linus asking us
about the gear fit Oh blast from the
past minus right is my first time
writing in with a burning curiosity for
our thoughts was browsing pocket now and
it ran across an old article about that
very year fit it was a breath of fresh
air and wearable design pen was it with
a beautiful curve display in a small
footprint but we haven't seen samsung or
anyone else follow up with something
similar Microsoft notwithstanding their
but that's more Fitness band and
SmartWatch maybe I still love the fits
design and do you think the markets
ready for is replacing its stagnating
circular displays with some more premium
motif like this is there hope for a fit
two point oh when did the fit come out
that launched around the time of the
galaxy gear too yeah I don't know Jules
makes a good point i don't think the
round design is stagnating I don't think
it's like I think the band played out
Michael everyone's doing it yeah success
is old yeah no I think triangular to be
around for long time I've wanted a
triangular when I was talking about that
reason
on a friggin weird one maybe I'll get a
blocks and maybe blocks will offer a
track okay for me mom you hold your
breath for that sure well don't worry i
want to say by the way can I pimp my son
watch to review real quick because
nobody seems to care I spent a lot of
time on that hey guys I made a zen watch
to review and I got excited because it's
Android wear priced the way Android wear
should be priced which is like 150 bucks
instead of 3 i've heard the tag however
you pronounce that Apple watch room in
charge eighteen thousand dollars for
watches yeah I i do believe we're in a
bubble when it comes to smart watches
and I really think that it soon maybe
not so shun but soon ish and they're
gonna realize that you know I'm not
gonna sell a lot of these things at
three hundred dollars or four hundred
dollars or whatevers maybe I'm wrong I
know but what's the question we're
answering oh the gear fit yeah that wing
which is cool is anything the gear fit
was like was a little ampule of
technology that was like curved and
description wrapped around your wrist
and it was it was small and cool and
because it didn't have as many sensors
as the band it could do it in a much
they could do the fitness band thing in
a much like smaller form factor but the
screen was so striking and beautiful and
curved and and bright and because it's
samsung and they know panels and yeah
great but nobody bought it I don't I
wouldn't count it as a smart walk
necessarily know and this is where you
have to like this is where we have to
reach your consensus as to what's a
smart fitness bandit what's a SmartWatch
know that if it was not a smart watch
but I used it as a SmartWatch because
even though I took it out on that kayak
for that video which was fun it wasn't
like I suited for the type of fitness
that I liked but I just wanted a
wearable that was a smart watch but
wasn't a big ol honkin thing like the
gear the gears it was at the time I
think what we need to see is some
standardized like Android wear level
support for more exotic strings like
this I mean yeah we have square they got
circular nailed if there were some
extinction that could allow existing
software to work on these more wider
aspect ratio displays that would open up
the room for developers to release lots
of models similar to the gear fit
offering more modern functionality but I
don't know there's any effort to do that
that would be super exciting and we know
that Android wear is going to be making
some big changes
we're seeing these speakers pop up in
every nuance that is currently unused
but the manufacturers definitely know
what what the time is what the score was
what's happening but yeah i miss the
gear fit too and i would like to see
that form factor again I don't miss
having to pair it to a galaxy device I
don't miss that I think Samsung's
learned it's lesson there if there ever
is a new gear fit I feel like it'll go
in direction of the s2 oh and speaking
of which Jules is doing our review of
the s2 and I'm really excited to see
that BTW dozen he's been reviewing that
for the past couple days um and finally
we have a listener mail from ya pairing
the s2 to another phone was nightmarish
he says so teaser for the review my my
name is Brian I've just recently
discovered your awesome podcast thanks
Brian and I was wondering how I can
watch it live oh right alright so here's
the thing i'm currently on windows phone
now have a computer don't obviously
can't get hangouts this is a chin like
this also i was wondering if you have a
Windows Store app I searched and you
found all kinds of results but weren't
sure if any of them were actually yours
thanks French you guys are the best
Brian thank you we don't have an
official app in the Windows Store or any
store by the way and there's no official
pocketnow app but there are some really
good third party ones that we can't
advocate because they might be full of
stuff that steals your data I don't know
but we don't have the time or the
resources to build an app of our own set
lovely mobile website actually we do
have the resources to build an app of
our own and our mobile website is um
yeah uh it's not so lovely it's gonna
get better pretty soon by the way pretty
soon but we recommend using your browser
to to get to our mobile site and enjoy
that and with regard to the podcast I'm
afraid that that is the only option for
you as well if you want to watch it live
we are a youtube hosted show of nurses
like it on YouTube and you can you can
watch it on YouTube when when it goes
live from Windows Phone absolutely rely
on you to you Ken you there's a plug-in
and like it shows up as the embed if you
if you go to the ok you of the podcast
you can watch alive I don't imagine that
performance is very good I think you can
even
watch it in a youtube app on Windows
Phone like Metro tube maybe though i
don't know maybe they don't support live
streaming I'm not sure kintel has been a
while since I've since I've used my
windows phone for such purposes so my
recommendation would be to do the
browser for now and we also have some
changes coming up to the site that'll
maybe change some of this stuff so
forgive me for being non-committal I
just wanted to thank you for watching
the show and listening but doing so on
Windows Phone that's pretty cool if you
ask me guys you look like you said year
of your fill their Michael I pretty much
have ya it's tough to do I mean we gotta
go hmm a lot of how we have to go oh
yeah can't wait a sec on the fence but
now's now yeah geez or just your jewels
are ready to get out of here I'm just um
from one final final qmm from from
Kenneth escalona I follow up question
with regard to the Xbox phone is that
there's a special tie in with Intel for
the next windows phone which means it is
possible to run games my idea
specifically is for mmos like League of
Legends hearthstone CSG Oh go I don't
know MTG right etc counter-strike don't
matter strike dawn civ golf golf
offensive yeah yeah and then again heard
hey come on the n-gage and engage QD
from nokia was an addiction even with a
boring symbian OS and windows is a
million times better than symbian yeah
do you never know xbox mobile phone
right but those were tacos were like
we're talking all right it is a very
different engineering challenge to build
a gaming handset that runs titles on the
handset only or to build a phone that is
it a smartphone a fully functional art
phone oh and also if you want to play
games on a massive screen through hdmi
with controller peripherals and stuff
like that like yeah that's different
sony make a new xperia play i will buy
that from you yeah yeah i don't know if
i would or not but you know we will see
if the quantum
yeah and outrun i just i love these Q&amp;amp;A
so i never want to stop but we will stop
in a second ronan japan iphone 6 plus
user here yeah well just went away uh
that question is it before i think we
was saying uh is there a way to show
answered questions yes there is oh sweet
that's great getting more and more on
android from all android wear around
what do you guys recommend okay wait a
minute what was the question aight
iphone 6 feet certainly iphone 6 plus
user here getting more and more on
android from all android wear around
what do you guys recommend Ronan I do
not understand the question but I'm
going to take a guess that you're asking
if we recommend an Android wear watch to
pair with the iphone ah between me yet
my answer is no I don't terrible
experience that you can't do like half
of what you can do with it when it's
perdu an android phone it the only thing
it does better in my opinion is that
when the when an Android wear watches
pair to the iphone and it disconnects
spontaneously which all Android wear
watches do it because why not there is
an automatic card that pops up that you
can tap to wreak to force a reconnect on
the iphone and for some reason that
doesn't exist on the android on android
so so you know if you want to experience
android wear the way it should be
experienced get an android phone if you
want to stand the iphone i think the
pebbles a better choice oh and the apple
watch also oh yeah oh that bless us
might watch yeah I'd love to keep
answering these but we do have to go
