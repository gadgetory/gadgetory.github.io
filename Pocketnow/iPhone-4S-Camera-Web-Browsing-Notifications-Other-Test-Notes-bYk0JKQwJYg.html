pocketnow.com I've been using the iPhone
4s for about eight days now and I have
some tests notes to share let's get to
it so in this video we're gonna cover
five different areas some of which are
specific to the iPhone 4s some of which
are specific to iOS 5 in general let's
actually start off by talking about the
bumper the bumper has been redesigned
sometime in the last few months it's
been redesigned with lower quality
materials unfortunately the bumper is a
great case for people that want a
minimalist cover protection something
that looks good and maintains the curves
and the thinness of the iPhone for what
that provides a good level of protection
if you drop it on a corner or if you
rest it on a table and there's something
there that that could scratch the screen
however this downgrade of materials is
very unfortunate the first generation of
bumper had rubbery edges along the side
now it's kind of like a low density
rubber almost plastic and you can see
what's happening after just eight days
there's a little nick in in the corner
here down near the charging port there's
a nick the gray stuff is getting dirty
and I'm pretty careful with the phone so
it's very unfortunate that the iPhone
bumper has gone down in quality they
really need to reduce the price 29.99
for a case like this is insane
of course Apple likes to charge more for
everything the Apple tax but come on
guys lower it to 15 bucks make it at
least competitive with all of the other
case offerings out there you can get a
much higher quality iPhone 4s case that
isn't going to great degrade on you
after eight days so thumbs down for the
bumper there let's talk a little bit
about Siri we did a whole video on Siri
and I'll put a link up here so you can
jump back and see that is Siri useful
well let's ask it are you useful
no comment fantastic no comment so again
we did a whole video about Syria about
what it can do today and what it can do
and hopefully we'll be able to do
tomorrow meaning in the future where
Syria is evolving you want to check out
that video I will put the link back up
at the end of the video in case you want
to watch this video
through and through now another big
change with the iPhone 4 is the camera
we got a bump from 5 megapixels to 8
megapixels from 720p video capture to
1080p video capture there's a lot of
fancy stuff that's going on in terms of
how they actually achieved improved
optics including lens and aperture and
all of that fancy stuff but most people
just want to take a really good picture
with their smartphone and the iPhone 4s
takes incredible pictures in fact this
is the best camera phone available right
now previously the galaxy s2 was really
really good in terms of taking macro
shots and 1080p video but the iPhone 4s
just takes it up a notch in every
respect let me give you a couple of
examples in terms of the photo quality
so I was recently at a golf course I was
taking some pictures of the golf course
of some trees of some things on the
ground and take a look at this
I found the small mushroom on the ground
very small and I wanted to see how the
iPhone 4s did with macro shots those
really close-up shots that would cause a
most most smartphones or point-and-shoot
cameras for that matter to go out of
focus look at the picture I captured if
we zoom in we can see tremendous detail
from this mushroom it's actually kind of
gross how wrinkly this mushroom is very
tiny artifact on the ground about that
high and yet look how clear and crisp
this photo came out it's really
fantastic let's go back to a couple of
other photos here we've got a golf
course photo
everything is just exposed very very
well the color looks fantastic the
Retina display makes everything really
pop and you can really see the detail so
the sky is blue the contrast with the
trees looks great the grass is a
reasonable color green you can see some
of the yellow and the changing leaves
very accurate color and I tried the same
thing with the flower here so here's
another example of a macro a flower
probably about that size and
massive but it just focuses very very
well on the flower to the point where
you can see detail in each and every
petal so the iPhone 4s gets very high
marks for video capture and for photo
quality if you want the camera with or
the if you want the smartphone with the
best camera the iPhone for us is
definitely vote the one to get and also
the combination of the photo stream
makes it awesome
I've got photo streams set up on my PC
I've got photo streams set up on my home
computer so that when I take a picture
all of my photos are uploaded to the
cloud and then down to all of my devices
which saves a step that has plagued
humanity which is plugging in your phone
and transferring the pictures or
emailing pictures to yourself or
whatever you do this really softs the
problem of course there are other
technologies out there that you can get
on Android for example that will do the
same thing but it's all integrated out
of the box here on the iPhone 4s which
is very much appreciated the next thing
we want to talk about is the
notification system which in my opinion
is kind of bad let's go into the
notification system I was actually
impressed with how many options you get
so we can sort applications here in this
list this is the new notification list
by time or you can do it manually now
because you're going to get a lot of
notifications building up almost every
app these days has a notification system
Game Center New York Times I mean just
every app has some way it wants to
notify you when things happen and you
have so much control now in iOS 5 over
which notifications happen where they
happen and how they happen and it's
actually a little bit of a learning
curve so if we go into any of these
let's say this chess application there
are three different things you can
choose for the notifications to do one
you can have it turn on and go into the
Notification Center
I've actually got that turned off and
I'll tell you why in a sec number two
you can set the notification alert type
you can have the pop-up alert which is
what we've been used to for a while now
in iOS 5 the one that pops up in the
center it interrupts you from what
you're doing there very annoying you can
have this a new kind of banner
notification which is actually pretty
horrible and I'll demonstrate it in a
sec or you can turn off alerts all
together and number three the third
thing that you
can control here as you can turn on the
notifications for this particular
program in your lock screen and of
course in the lock screen you'll get the
new slider so you can jump right into
the program that's trying to notify you
of something that is happening so I've
got the Notification Center turned off
because I just don't find it as useful
as say Android especially Android 4.0
where you can selectively remove certain
notifications in iOS 5 you've got to
either have a big stack of mail
notifications for example or you can
clear out all your mail notifications
and have 0 it's either it's an
all-or-nothing kind of thing and I
really don't like that
let me demonstrate why I hate the banner
notifications so for email right now
I've got banner set up so when I get a
new email you'll see something roll in
from the top there's a big problem with
it so I'm going to send myself an email
then jump into another app give me a sec
and we'll show it off so watch what's
gonna happen here I am in iMessage or
the message notification see how the
notification rolls down and covers up
these UI buttons and it really sucks
because you can't swipe off the
notification you have to wait a full 30
seconds which is a very long time if
you're trying to send an email and iOS
buttons are always up here to be able to
go back and forth for example imagine
being in this group message and a banner
occurs and it covers up this back button
well you have to wait the full 1 2 3
seconds before it goes away or you can't
press the message button unless you try
very very hard to get the bottom half of
the button that is exposed and sometimes
you miss you hit the notification and
you go into the email or whatever was
notifying you Apple could fix this so
easily if you could swipe notifications
off the screen Windows Phone 7 does it
awesomely and hopefully iOS 5 in the
next update will fix this because it
it's a big problem next up let's talk
about the web because with a faster CPU
we're hoping that checkerboards are a
thing in the past
if you had an iPhone 4 over time it got
slower not only that but it didn't have
that much processing power to start with
so you get checkerboards
see if that has been fixed in iOS 5 and
on the iPhone 4s thanks to the dual-core
a5 so here on Engadget we get blank
space for a second but then everything
fills in very quickly let me show you
that again let's go to a different part
of head and gadget in case we're being
cached here so we get a blank screen and
then everything gets filled in very
quickly
no checker boards to be found checker
boards are a thing in the past with iOS
5 and in the iPhone 4s which is very
very fortunate because it can really
slow you down when you're browsing and
pinch-to-zoom is as you would expect it
extremely smooth buttery smooth bouncing
around on the web is a great experience
as you would expect on an iOS device
coupled with the dual core processor and
things are extra smooth now hopefully
sometime soon they're going to update
this silly tabbed interface for iOS in
the phone application because we want to
have tabs like a computer not this
button and then you've got a flick and
there's no way to close all the tabs so
I mean you have 8 resource intensive
websites open you have to go through and
tab it and tap it the tab system really
needs an overhaul in iOS 5 add that to
the pop down notifications for the 5.1
update which is hopefully coming in the
near future but in all seriousness the
web browser is extremely fast on the
iPhone 4s and finally let's talk about
iMessage those of you that have been
using a blackberry for a while I've been
using vbm blackberry messenger which is
basically the same thing you can do
group SMS you can send pictures and you
can also send a video over a data
connection it's all free so you're not
charge five cents or whatever AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon Sprint and t-mobile want to
charge you and it is awesome for example
for making plans so I've got some
friends I'm having a conversation it's
me and three friends at the same time
we're having a conversation
so no more texting one person than
texting the other it's like a chatroom
in your pocket and it's super awesome
and you can add photos you can add video
not only that there's a typing indicator
so you can
see when someone else is typing so you
don't interrupt them and again it's free
and iMessages keenly turn up blue
whereas typical SMS turn up green which
is nice because you can instantly see
whether the person receiving the message
has I Oh s5 if the message will be free
or if they're just on a standard text
messaging plan really cool with the
color coding there so I message big
thumbs up for that it works on the iPad
it works on all iOS 5 devices it's
really super cool now they just need a
PC client so you can follow along the
conversation when you're on your PC so
most of the grapes that I've had about
the iPhone 4s in the last eight days our
software related things that can be
fixed in a software update of course
we'll see iOS continue to above what is
still unfortunate is that the iPhone 4s
is still an iPhone 4 there's nothing
different about the hardware the screens
not bigger it's not anything
significantly different it's not
tremendously faster it's a very
incremental upgrade which is a good
thing the iPhone 4 was a great phone but
you look at a phone like the Droid Razr
and the Galaxy Nexus and you think wow
bigger screens thinner form factors
higher resolution screens Super AMOLED
displays multiple cores and you got to
think how long will the iPhone 4s stay
relevant in 2012 when we're going to see
Tegra 3 quad core phones 720p screens
it's going to be pretty epic and
hopefully notification hopefully the
iPhone 5 isn't too far off it's
obviously going to be a pretty dramatic
departure from the iPhone 4 because
Apple is not going to stick with the
same design for two generations we've
got the four of you coming up on
pocketnow.com soon check back for that
we'll put a link down in the description
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now
