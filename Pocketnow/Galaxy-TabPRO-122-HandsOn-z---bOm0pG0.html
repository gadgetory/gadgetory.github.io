at CES 2014 checking out the new Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro let's check it out so
we've done the best we can on this
screen guys a lot of hands have been on
this so you know it's typical matter
what's displayed but this is the largest
Samsung Android tablet that we've ever
handled it is 12.2 inches on the
diagonal the screen technology is AMOLED
Super AMOLED there correctly and it's
running at a resolution of 2560 2560 by
1600
I wasn't fed that at all I promise
except that's not true power on the
screen here this is the Tab pro so we've
talked about the note pro and another
video but this model is identical unlike
what they've done previously the tab pro
bears the same exact specs as the note
pro except it doesn't have the s-pen
you'll notice this is also the first
Samsung product that is the first non
note Samsung product to feature the
stitch leather so it's interesting that
Samsung is broadened a little bit in
that regard moving that physical thing
this is an 8 megapixel camera by the way
battery underneath is 9,500 milliamp
hours a real monster and flipping around
to the front sorry about the horrible
lighting once again but you will notice
a very new user interface
this is the first major revision of
Samsung's TouchWiz user interface the
section are called TouchWiz anymore all
that often but the first major revision
of Samsung's interface is sliding panels
it's a little Metro like it's a little
like the news magazine app that we saw
on the existing notes and it's actually
fairly responsive on this 12 point 2
inch screen to talk a little bit about
that I want to talk a little bit about
the wood the heft though this is a 732
gram device or give or take a couple
grams the mass varies by a few grams
depending on whether you're getting the
Wi-Fi version
or the 3G version healthy version so
does the processor if you get the Wi-Fi
and 3G it's the Exynos model you get the
LTE version it is the Snapdragon 800 3
gigs of RAM in each case I believe but
that's not quite as interesting as this
new interface which you know when I
first saw this I think it was set to
this mode and you can do legacy Android
if you want to you know you can you can
come back here and you can add home
screens in the traditional way it's
happened hold and you've got all your
kind of usual stuff here and you can
change the wallpaper all that all the
stuff that we're used to seeing but this
new interface is just a swipe away and
now here's all of the the panes that are
available to you such a spill you can
just tap and it will fill in any
available space or you can you can tap
and drag it specifically to where you
want it to be and the tiles around it
will automatically resize we have an
empty tile here very very simple matter
just to tap and hold let's say we want
to put in the gallery that sounds like a
good idea
drop it right in that empty frame and
there it is another thing Samsung is
done you'll notice the HOME key is
flanked by the back key and the
multitasking select there oh wow I
actually didn't see this before that's
pretty cool it's now been moved to the
bottom and you can swipe up to dismiss
which is very cool but there's no
multitasking if you press and hold like
that it doesn't mean multitasking is not
here just swipe out from the edge from
the bezel and there is your multi screen
select drag the internet browser over
here and ah the whole browser fills the
whole screen pool but I also want to do
some text messaging while I do that I'll
pop that right there the familiar resize
option is exists
and also if you want to just say let's
see we're doing both those things but we
want to quickly view a YouTube video you
tap instead of drag you're given the app
in a poll window which can go on top of
anything you want and you know we've
done this a couple times on this device
it's running pretty snappy especially
for a demo unit not willing to say at
this point that that Samsung has has
fixed all of the all of the lag issues
that we often complain about on these
large tablets but man it's it's running
pretty well right now I'll tell you that
there's our drop-down notification shade
with the new bubble-like thing but this
is just a quick UI tour we're gonna get
to know it a little bit better hopefully
we've given you a small sense of how the
galaxy tabpro in the 12 inch size
operates we're taking a look at a lot
more from samsung here at CES 2014 and
Tony behind the camera is doing a great
job keeping up with my nonsense stay
tuned for a lot more from pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
