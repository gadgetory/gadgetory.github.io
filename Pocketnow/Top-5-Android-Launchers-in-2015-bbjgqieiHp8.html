with pocket now we last covered
third-party Android launchers more than
a year and a half ago I think it's well
past time that we took a second look at
five of them and see how they stack up
in 2015 okay so let me just be real here
and start off with the Google now
launcher this is what's become the go-to
replacement for OEM skins it's bright
that's fresh and follows the latest
Android design guidelines and yeah it
just runs no frills stuff here they are
standard app screens for your standard
apps in standard folders along with
standard widgets with a standard app
drawer all drawn up and standard
animations instead of looks yeah of
course Google being Google it's put a
constant search bar at the top and
Google now integration to the farthest
left screen now you don't send money to
Google for use of this launcher but just
keep in mind a point of view that if
something is free to you then you're
probably being sold as a product you are
how Google makes money after all it's
kind of the same deal for competitor
yahoo i mean there AP launcher just
recently got a revamp the overall
aesthetic is a little different from
google's but it's just as clean and
pleasing what is it pleasing many users
is the introduction of SmartStream yahoo
seems to be ramping up its Google
nowness on the leftmost screen unlike
now though it's not terribly
customizable it just so happens to pop
in and out what it wants whenever you
seem to be somewhere convenient and it
also constantly tries to get you to
download more Yahoo apps for the full
experience it used to be that you could
specifically Taylor what information or
apps a v8 provided to what you were
doing during different parts of the day
you could override a v8 suggestions to
not too much the case anymore fighting
review started popping up on the play
store once the update came and we can't
be sure whether or not those had to do
with this but it seemed that the AV
launcher suddenly dropped from the Play
Store for a few hours on July first this
SmartStream implementation is in young
days though so it'd be better if we had
more
I'm with it just to the right is a
screen that piles your favorite apps on
the bottom and a top portion dedicated
to widgets it's the most customization
you'll get in a v8 and it's only one
screen right of that we see categorized
app drawers where automatically selected
apps are piled into music or
productivity or transit categories and
so on and yes there will be duplicates
between categories but redundancy is a
good parachute to have with this type of
app sorting and there's also manual
override as well farthest right contains
the comprehensive Apple list
alphabetically sorted a v8 is more
curated controlled and compartmentalized
experience than Google now so if you
want even less fuss on your home screen
well this options for you the Yahoo a v8
launcher is free for download same grain
of salt applies from the now launcher
here the rest of these launchers go to
the extremes of customizability yet
remained with the material design
aesthetic apex launcher is one of them
now if you're wondering why the heck the
android army decided to take over my
home screen well it's because it didn't
do a good job of importing my desktop
from another launcher the app setup is
correct it's just that none of the icons
are loaded in so I'd have to manually
remove the apps from where they were and
replace them from the app drawer to have
the icons properly show the other two
launches don't seem to have this problem
and speaking of apex is compatriots you
can edit colors of texts the backgrounds
how animations work the sizes of icons
and whatnot on all of them though to
different extents depending on if you
have the free version or the paid one
and for the money or lack of money it
seems like apex offers the most
usefulness there are more customizations
available of the box extending from
extensive widget resizing why would you
ever have a 2 by one gmail minute I mean
what end widgets that don't natively
support resizing can also be managed
there are five gestures that can trigger
different behaviors if gestures aren't
your thing there are some softer buttons
to get to those same behaviors if you
pay 399 for the pro version of Apex
Launcher you can get more assignable
gestures
tabs and folders within the app drawer
duck swiping and you can also add
multiple apps at once to a folder that's
serious bang for buck heck the free
version has some serious Bank to Apex
Launcher doesn't constantly prod you to
upgrade to the pro version and the
feature adds do make the payoff worth it
just make sure you take a little time to
set your pages up over to nova launcher
which actually provides more polished to
the package than apex has the main
bonuses are that you can position items
into checkerboard arrays and that items
can overlap each other important
takeaway here though is that on the free
version of nova there are no just your
actions available that only comes on the
prime version for 499 along with after
our tabs and folders dock swiping and
more scrolling effects if you want
something that you can look at and be
happy with take nova launcher with you
finally there's action 3 the third
iteration of the legendary Chris Lacey's
custom Android launcher aesthetically
there's nothing much that meets the eye
until you pull out and always on a to z
quick drawer from left folders can be
made into covers the first app in a
folder is the cover which you can tap to
access that app you can swipe up or down
to reveal the rest of the folder there
are six assignable gestures available to
you for free out of a possible 15 some
of the appearance toggles are locked to
the plus version toggles free from the
start for the apex and nova launchers
there's a constant banner in the
settings menu urging you to pay the 499
to upgrade and get the quick page a
right-hand side quick apps and widgets
page shutters which basically make
widgets more like apps quick theming
capabilities akin to the HTC One m9 or
samsung galaxy s6 infinite folders
changeable icon packs and more there's a
set back to action launcher from
previous versions and that's the one
swipe feature it's gone you can't access
your quick drawer or quick page from any
app anymore and that's a disappointment
but still great what Chris Lacey is
doing with this constant attention to
detail and tweaking for action launcher
however in striking the balance between
giving free users a good taste of his
product
and pulling them and there are five
bucks a pop over to the Plus version I
think he went a bit too far trust me all
the big pluses deserve to be paid for
but some of the trivial things like
being able to scale icons it can seem a
little ludicrous so I can only recommend
action launcher to those who are willing
to pay upfront for these features what
other launchers have you been using or
looking at leave your records down below
