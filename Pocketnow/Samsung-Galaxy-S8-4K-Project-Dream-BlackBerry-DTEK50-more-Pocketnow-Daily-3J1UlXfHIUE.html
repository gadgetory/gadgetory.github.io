have begun to emerge on samsung's radar
like very finely unwraps its first
premium mid-ranger and boy does it look
familiar and apples quarter results were
yet again a lame celebration for some
I'm hi meri behna and given the fact
that there was no quorum over my full
name in the comments we're gonna go back
to lame Monday jokes this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals with the Moto X Pierre edition
continues to be one of our favorite
phones of last year and for those of you
that are in the market for one you might
want to hit the NH the phone is
currently for two hundred fifty dollars
and you're actually getting thirty
dollars and goodies included on the list
you can actually learn more on the link
in the description other official news
have to do with Apple it is just awesome
how Tim Cook could just downplay the way
that the company's numbers are currently
down and have been down for the last two
quarters right now iphone sales were
forty point four million units which
means fifty percent down there to the
same quarter last year in the case of
iPads 9.95 million units another nine
percent down we can talk about the Maxis
well company is actually having probably
one of its worst quarters ever and the
could only say that people are really
happy with the ipad pro really happy
with the iphone s ii and he's desperate
for the next iphone obviously i dtec 50d
tech 50 yeah i actually have to repeat
it believe it or not blackberry has
announced its first premium mid-ranger
in a long time now based on android and
the name is detect and i have no clue
what that means but this is pretty much
an idol for in every single way from its
design pretty much the only thing that
changes is the back the phone is made by
TCL which is the parent company of
alcatel and we love the idol for it's an
amazing design this film costs 299
brings the same specifications it's just
the rebrand and a very good one indeed
can't wait to get that phone for review
and speaking of premium mid Rangers a
company that surprised everyone with its
flagship of ziti with the exon 7 and we
have rumors that the company is working
on an exon mini we're not sure if that's
going to be an exon 7 mini but it looks
a lot like the ex
design and it brings lesser
specifications 5.2 inch 1080p display in
addition to a snapdragon 616 processor
not 617 I'm actually skeptical with that
number it could be a typo but yeah it
seems that we're getting a premium
mid-ranger here and the that's actually
going to be a good mix let's see what
the price taxes and finally the very
hotness they have do with Samsung as we
hear two things that the company is
working on which makes a lot of sense
number one is obviously the galaxy s
eight but if you're wondering exactly
what the company is going to do here
that has to do with the second rumor
obviously the company has to work on its
daydream compatible project to match
with Google's launch of Android n and we
hear that this is going to be called
Project dream number one number two that
this galaxy s eight will actually bring
a 4k display that's compatible with that
new dream project dream or whatever that
be our headsets going to be which is
rather interesting we wonder exactly how
this is going to blend with project
Odyssey which is the company's
standalone VR thing which also leads me
to the question of the day how often do
you actually use VR do you think that
it's worth it for samsung to obliterate
battery life by giving us a 4k display
on its next smartphone just for the
purpose of BR because in my case I use
VR a lot but not from the gear ER i
prefer truly are which comes from the
vibe but leave us a comment down below
