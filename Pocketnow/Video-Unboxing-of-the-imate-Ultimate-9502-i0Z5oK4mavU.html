pocketnow.com and today we're unboxing
the much-anticipated i made ultimate
9502 let's get to it the box let's zoom
in a little bit right see the back so
this is sort of like the windows mobile
sidekick it's got a sliding screen
that's vga resolution the intelligence
is here check that out in a minute so in
the box we have a video output cable
international charger with a mini USB
connector excellent european-style plug
another different plug here's the u.s.
plug we also have headphones a large
battery let's see how big this is it is
1660 milliamp hours that is pretty darn
big I think we're going to need that
much power to run the vga screen here's
a case
or the 9502 and the smell test reveals
that it is leather very very good
quality leather too pretty nice case in
here we have some software a stylus
collapsible unfortunately it's an extra
stylus i'm assuming some guides a big
thick manual though it may be no it's
all in English actually wow it's a huge
manual it's a lot of reading to do
alright let's take a look at the device
it's a little smaller than I thought
let's slide up the screen spring
assisted feels nice wow this keyboard is
very very small very small Wow let's
compare this to the Titan to or the
tilts Wow look how small the keyboard is
on the 9502 that's going to be hard to
get used to let's take a look at the
device some more front-facing video
camera 3 megapixel camera looks like
there's a flash okay it's pretty thick
it's pretty thick in comparison to the
kaiser it is thinner which is good it's
taller also same size screen 2.8 inches
although the screen on the 9502 is vga
resolution which I'm excited about
compared to the iphone definitely much
thicker of course actually almost the
same height and compare it to a device
like the blackjack it is the same height
and of course thicker so that's very
interesting indeed this very small
keyboard and the very smooth opening
screen here lots more to come on the
9502</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
