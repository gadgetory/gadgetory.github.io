year new pens have the next generation
iphone with a different stainless steel
band and our thoughts on Apple's
built-in SIM card project and why
they're not so good all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi Nabila and welcome to the pocket nail
I review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
after practicing for a while how to say
punish tool instead of PAS notch tool
let's start off with the cool rumors
have apple working on a new pen that
will allow nitride coating to go through
the stainless steel band of the iphones
antenna why well because the antenna is
not so good we already know that so will
it come on the iPhone 5 or probably the
white iphone which ever a year comes out
we'll never know we'll see what happens
more rumors have apple holding a secret
summit for iOS developers as of next
week on tuesday and while the rumors are
that it has a lot to do with apple
trying to talk developers and to bring
more quality into their apps as android
gets better at this now we're actually
not going to speculate this we actually
think enhances a lot to do with apple
working on developers bringing more apps
to the mac with mac OS 10 lion but we'll
see what happens in the end again this
was supposed to be a secret but we
already know about well XDA developers
com which is a really cool site that
brings a lot of tweaks and hacks to the
Android and Windows Mobile community
just confirm that they launched the
sister site called iphone developers com
to bring to exam hacks to the iphone
community really cool we really expect
them to have a lot of success there are
a lot of cool things that you could do
with the iphone once you hack it once
you jailbreak it let's hope they bring
new thing to the table you know I have
nothing wrong against the dev team blog
but it gets to be a little techy
sometime so here's a new approach to
tweaks and hacks from here on continuing
on with the cool paypal just launched
version 3.0 their iOS application which
offers a couple of enhancements one of
this has to do with the fact that you're
now going to receive push notifications
whenever you get any sort of activity in
your account meaning if you send money
receive money or anything that happens
with your account which is really cool
now since we're getting close to the
not-so-cool section what
things are not really sure what to make
of is the fact that also sellers are now
going to be offered the opportunity to
give you deals and information to your
device whenever your location is showing
them that you're close to them really
not know what to make out of this let's
see what happens on the end
alright so that's it for the cool let's
continue with the not-so-cool one of the
things that's really got a skeptical is
the fact that people have just found a
new iOS 4.1 bug that is actually also
being pointed to iOS 4.2 beta as of yet
that will allow you to actually be able
to dial phone calls whenever your phone
is locked if you're quick enough to be
able to actually go into the emergency
dialer of the emergency call section of
it when your phone's password lock and
you dial a phone number you're actually
quick enough to press the send key and
at the same time press the power button
you'll actually be taken to the dialer
and this will allow you to make any sort
of calls even though whenever you finish
the call you'll be able to be taken back
to the portion of your phone being
locked well let me they're really not so
cool parts about this is obviously your
phone is locked because you want people
to be away from it but you know what are
the worst parts about this is that
they've already also found that is
supported to iOS 4.2 beta and we really
don't know of Apple is going to be able
to make something out of this before
november whenever you know iOS 4.2 is
supposed to be released so we'll see
what happens in the end let's hope Apple
takes care of this because it's really
not cool at all next up the white iphone
4 first it was sometime next month
whenever the black iphone 4 was released
then it was some time with in july then
afterwards it was sometime within 2010
and now it's going to be sometime in
spring 2011 that's right the white
iphone four sets could bind to 2010
we're not even sure if this is actually
going to be the iphone 5 it's really
lame really pathetic the fact that Apple
can't really figure out how to get this
production working and you know to be
honest with you why don't you just
cancel the production man I mean people
are really losing a lot of credibility
in you anyways alright so continuing on
with the not so cool app which is
partnered with a company called go
maddow to create a chipset that will
include the sim card of the next
generation iphone 4 within the device
and not being able to be swappable just
like we know gsm technology to be why is
this not so cool well first of all Apple
saying that they want to control the
whole user experience and they don't
want you to go to carriers to be able to
activate your eye
well you can just do it in an apple
store but we're not really sure that's
really what they're up to we're really
thinking that they don't want people to
be able to unlock their phones I mean
one of the cool things about gsm
technology is the fact that you can
actually solve your sim cards you can
unlock your phones use them with other
carriers you can travel abroad and
probably not get roaming where you're
going but you can probably pay for a go
to card or paper or use card and
actually just use your iPhone there as
long as you're able to unlock it but you
know what will happen whenever your card
is built into the phone a lot of Verizon
and Sprint users have a lot of
complaints with the cdma service because
they can't travel abroad their phone is
in Rome and it seems that this could
probably be the future for the next
generation iphone thats it for todays i
