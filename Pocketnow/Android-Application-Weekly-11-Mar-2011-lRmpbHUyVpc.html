the android market the object of the
game is to position your little chalk
guy here by drawing lines and you want
to bounce them off these other balls and
the various chalk balls will give you
either more chalk up here or less chalk
and you want to try to get all the way
across the screen without using all your
chalk and if you get a full bar and it
fills up all the way you get this other
