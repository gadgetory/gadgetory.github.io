the biggest winners in the recent
holiday deals
Google pixeled two issues now seem to be
another source for reboots and the one
plus 5t continues to expand in both
markets and color options I'm Jaime
Rivera and again for awesome t-shirts
like these ripped apparel there is a
link of the comments in addition to a
10% coupon code this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with deals
that continue the Galaxy Note 8 was
highly discounted but continues to be
discounted unlocked in black color on
eBay we're talking about seven hundred
and forty dollars which is definitely a
good deal compared to the full range
price tag even though there are some
BOGO deals for carriers up there so you
can learn more in the description now
sorry about the 1 + 5 t good news for
those of you in India there are no
supply constraints you can get the phone
outright right now but even more
interesting there is the black and red
options that are reaching China very
soon and that particular red option is
one that I would like to get one plus if
you're watching the channel thank you
appreciate it
another interesting launches the new
honor v10 which just got announced most
interesting part of this phone is that
it looks pretty much like the honor 9
and honor 8 but it has all the
specifications of the huawei mate 10
meaning we've got the carrier 970 in
addition to 6 gigs of ram 64 gigs of
storage and we also have this amazing
camera with ai etcetera etcetera you can
learn more about it in the description
now let's talk about the Google pixel to
pixel to excel it seems that issues
continue this time we have reboots and
the reboots are being caused by the fact
that the phones are having issues
connecting to the network now this is
very interesting we have to review units
that are not dealing with this our
review for the pixel 2 XL is going to be
live soon but apparently it's not just
an isolated issues it seems that there
are a significant amount of units that
are dealing with this obviously we can't
confirm that just yet we will keep you
posted as soon as we learn more and
finally the very interesting news that
they have to do with the results of
Cyber Monday and Black Friday believe it
or not I thought I was going to tell you
that Samsung devices or LG devices were
the biggest winners but that doesn't
turn out to be true believe it or not
the company that provides the least
amount of deals is the one that's sold
most
I'm talking about iPads air pods and
even the iPhone 10 iPads air pods and
some Samsung tablets were the biggest
sellers for cyber monday but then when
it comes to Black Friday the iPhone tent
alone sold six million units according
to sources and this is one of those
things that I don't understand there
were a ton of amazing deals and yet
these products from Apple that don't
offer significant deals were the ones
that sold the most it leads me to the
question today what did you buy for
Black Friday or Cyber Monday because in
my case I ended up buying Nintendo
switch games and my son ended up getting
PS fours but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
