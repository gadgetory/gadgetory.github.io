announcements of pretty much every tech
year is about to happen
and we still don't know too much about
what to expect from Apple's September 12
event other than the date so with that
in mind we thought we would go through
some of the leaks and the rumors and
then ask you what you want to see out of
the brand-new iPhone of 2018 this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is what
we've heard so far of the iPhone 10's so
I figured you know what I'm gonna go
ahead and do a segment where in the days
leading up to the actual announcement
I'm just gonna go through the leaks and
rumors and let's see if they're actually
going to end up being true and then I'm
gonna ask you what you want to see out
of the new phone right before the
announcement one of the biggest pieces
of news is that the iPhone is going to
come in three different flavors but none
of them are going to have the word plus
in them anymore a very different trend
from previous generations
instead the iPhone 10 might just become
the iPhone 10s and you'll have three
different versions two of which are
going to be priced at the higher tier
point but then there's going to be a
more affordable version of it with those
two higher versions potentially having
an oled screen what I find funny here is
that it's going to be called 10s but
it's going to be spelled X and then s
and that makes the iPhone feel like it's
a piece of clothing like the new iPhone
please no no I mean the iPhone extra
small other speculation from Bloomberg
is that there will be more significant
changes in the iPhones for next year so
this year's phones are going to be like
the iPhone 10 just in a few different
sizes
people are still speculating what gather
round means including that circle that
is on the invites that was sent out
about a week ago the circle could pretty
much just mean that it's going to be at
these Steve Jobs theater which indeed it
is and that is the Apple Campus that has
that fully circular design that is up in
Cupertino but otherwise people are
thinking that the circle could mean the
return of a home button on these devices
and if that is the case then maybe we'll
get touch ID back as well but leaks and
pictures still point to the contrary as
9 to 5 Mac have found a couple of photos
of a copper gold edition of the iPhone
10 S which looks quite fetching still
sporting the same edge-to-edge almost
screen with a notch of the iPhone 10
with no home button in sight and to make
matters worse for anyone that wants
touch ID it doesn't look like it's going
to be returning any
I'm soon as prediction state that it's
probably not going to come back even in
the 2019 versions of the iPhone because
they're going to double down on face ID
this is in response to a trend that
Android manufacturers are very quickly
adopting the in display fingerprint
sensor and it doesn't seem that Apple is
anywhere near adding that to their own
phones though of course we could always
wish another rendering shows off what
the three different sizes of the iPhone
might look like if they are all not
based and have full screen displays with
no home button insights but in this
particular article some people are
betting that the iPhone 10s line of this
year is going to surpass the sales of
the iPhone 6 one of the most beloved
versions of the iPhone to date because
the three new models will offer a
selection of sizes and improved internal
specifications there are a lot of
different choices for users aside from
the singular iPhone 10 of last year now
granted all of these phones might have
the least amount of bezels of any iPhone
ever and a lot of Apple users have been
clamoring for that so you're probably
going to get at least that particular
aspect this year speaking of the
internals a new processor in the iPhone
10s can put Apple right in line with
competitors like Huawei and Samsung with
Huawei recently announcing their own 7
nanometer chipset the iPhone 10 S models
could come with their own 7 nanometre
812 sets however in the running for 7
nanometer our Huawei and Samsung who
don't really have a release date for
their own development of the 7 nanometer
Exynos chip and finally in terms of the
other announcements that may be
happening on September 12
we're of course expecting a new Apple
watch to be unveiled and this one might
actually have an always-on screen mode
which might make it even more practical
for the users of the Apple watch now
other products that are potentially
going to be announced there might be a
new iPad also a wireless charging dock
that could charge simultaneously the
iPhone 10 s and also the new Apple watch
and then finally perhaps hopefully a new
pair of air pods and that will pretty
much do it on this edition of what we've
heard in terms of the iPhone 10s now
it's at this point that I want to ask
you what you want to see out of the
iPhones and based upon the fact that we
don't have too many leaks that actually
reveal what the device looks like
compared to other phones like the pixel
3 speculation can still run pretty
rampant so let us know what you want to
see out of the brand new iPhones give us
your wish list
I'm going to go through those comments a
number of days from now probably at the
beginning of next week right before the
actual event so get into the comment
sections down below and let's have a
discussion over what we want to see in
the brand new iPhone 10's even if it's
not something you think will happen this
year let us know what you want to see in
these phones and what Apple should be
doing with their smart phones moving
forward but all will be revealed on
September 12 so stay tuned to PocketNow
for all of that coverage and for all of
the leaks and rumors to either become
confirmed or otherwise be debunked and
you can join us for all of that coverage
on September 12 and beyond as we get our
hands on iPhone 10s as ourselves and go
through reviews coverage vs. all of the
comparisons everything that you would
want to know about Apple's latest device
and until then keep it tuned to pocket
now and we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
