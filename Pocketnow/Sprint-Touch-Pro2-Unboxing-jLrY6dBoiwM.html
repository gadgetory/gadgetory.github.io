park.com and this is the unboxing video
of the sprint touch pro2 so let's get
started he's going to cut it open here
okay so nice little small box that's
good it's nice not to waste in these
days okay so I'm just going to open up
the box here we have the device and set
that aside first few minutes we have a
battery charger open up that it's kind
of a neat little charger isn't it
apparently just a USB charger on the
bottom so set that aside the US this
stylus extra style is probably so leave
that overdone side also and a USB cable
and it's just the proprietary Jack for
the HTC devices and this is a mini USB
can also use them any of us be to
connect to the computer or to charge
your device so that's great underneath
the cardboard here let's see what else
we got so documentation to its
engineering
sim card in case because this is a
worldwide phone you can use it in other
places where there's GSM signal so we
got a sim card aspire gaming device
let's see recycle your wireless phone I
don't think so screen protector it's
great some CDs for connected to your
computer activesync probably and some
more papers and documentation let's see
just some documentation on programs in
here throw that away let's see set up
your email and your manual course that's
great it's nice that it's actually in
color I think see some things aren't
something's earned and you're getting
started and we probably all know how to
use that right now so let's look at the
device okay so here we have the device
let's open this up real quick throw some
trash away and it's a sleek looking
device actually you know someone's
plastic on the back it's actually kind
of nice on the back it looks like this
is a speaker we can take up the battery
cover and look at it in the hardware
tour coming up next I'll show you that
open it up and it slides and it tilts
perfect and all all it feels like a
pretty good device actually like this
one better than the worldwide edition
because it's not as slick on the back so
it doesn't leave fingerprints as much so
stay tuned for the hardware and software
tours and you can always follow us on
