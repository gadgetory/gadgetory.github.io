confirmed by Apple's own software new
leaks points a three exhume on the
samsung galaxy note a dual camera and
repair your calendars and wallets for
the LGB 30 i'm Heine Rivera and yes for
those of you asking for these awesome
t-shirts they come from riffed apparel
in my Twitter you can find the link with
an addition of a 10% coupon for a
discount
this is pocket out daily we are going to
call this rumor Monday we actually don't
have any official news or deals today
but we do have some very interesting
leaks of the nokia eight we see it fully
in the flesh dual cameras probably the
worst bezels of 2017 and the largest
navigation buttons we've seen yet you
can see more in the link in the
description now let's talk about the LG
v 30 this is one of the phones that I am
most anticipating in 2017 for those of
you wondering when we should expect it
apparently it will be launched exactly a
month after it gets announced September
28th it will be its global launch
apparently it will launch earlier in
Korea what are the specifications what
to expect we still don't know but it
looks a lot like a g6 which is great now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy s8
active this is actually another phone
that I've been waiting for and it's been
crazy delayed we're hoping we don't have
to wait until Samsung's unpacked event
of the Galaxy Note 8 we see more leaked
renders this time from famous tipster
evan blasts and it's very rare for Evan
to get anything wrong so we can pretty
much set this one in stone that's just
way to see when we're going to get this
phone now as with the spotlight over to
the iPhone 8 to developers recently
tinkered with the firmware of the home
pod and guess what they found
you know that Apple designates its
devices with a small little frame icon
for you to know which one is iPhone iPad
iPod touch this time we've got the frame
for the next generation iPhone and
pretty much looks like everything that's
on the leaks apparently the home park
firmware also teases to some sort of
very awesome facial recognition so yeah
pretty much everything that we've seen
in rumors is getting confirmed with
software and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for those
of you that have been asking yourselves
what is this dual camera going to do it
turns out that it might
not necessarily make everybody happy
because it seems to be 3x optical zoom
and not the wide-angle lens that we wish
we'd see or the monochrome sensor that
we see from Huawei apparently Samsung
just wants to give us more soon when
compared to the iPhone 7 plus the reason
why I'm mixed is because I pretty much
never use these telephoto lenses on the
devices that I've reviewed but paint it
leads me to the question today do you
care about 3x optical zoom or not in my
case again I don't I know that most
pointed shoots that the func point
shoots come with 5x optical zoom so that
couldn't make a lot of sense but anyways
