new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a look at Nokia's
most metallic update to the Lumia 900
line I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow
this is the Nokia Lumia 925 and this is
episode 25 of after the buzz while it
just became available on AT&amp;amp;T in
September the Lumia 925 first launched
in the United States on t-mobile back in
July and it was available in parts of
Europe the month before that our own
Anton Dean odd reviewed the phone at
that time calling it a joy to use and
promising that for the right kind of
customer it wouldn't disappoint five
months later both observations continued
to be true the Lumia 925 is indeed
something special but now more than ever
it also takes the right kind of buyer to
appreciate it some of us were a little
hard on the 925 at first which took the
industrial design of the earlier 920 and
modernized it with aluminum trim and a
busier backplate while we're still not
pleased about the removal of wireless
charging and wish the speaker had been
kept on the bottom edge it's tough to
overstate the beauty of the 925
especially in the black finish of our
AT&amp;amp;T unit this is quite a beautiful
device and Nokia seems to know it having
included the kind of carrying pouch
normally included with luxury sunglasses
it's lightweight keeps it in the same
pocket ability League as something like
the iPhone 5s while its aluminum trim
puts it a step above something like the
galaxy s4 more in line with an HTC One
in terms of feel in hand
back in June we weren't sure if the
change in design language from the
earlier
was a good idea but given the industries
continued march toward thinner and
lighter designs the 925 has held up much
better than the 920 then even to a
degree the newer 1020 in terms of
aesthetics the ClearBlack display may
not be 1080p but it's excellently sized
at 4.5 inches and it's AMOLED fuelled
blacks are dark as can be it's color
palette as dazzling as ever with regard
to nuts and bolts hardware capability
there's nothing special here but then
there doesn't really need to be given
Windows Phones ability to operate
smoothly on even middling hardware that
positive distinction though can only
carry Windows Phones so far we love the
fluidity of Microsoft's platform and the
fact that the Windows Store has finally
landed long-sought titles like Instagram
and Vine it's a definite feather in its
cap but with the competition on both
sides recently rolling out big updates
iOS 7 from Apple and Android 4.4 from
Google Windows Phone is due for some
feature enhancements and an interface
refresh it's not necessarily stale but
some elements aren't aging well the
people and me hubs for example have
failed to keep pace with the
functionality of the social networks
they plug into some live tiles don't
always update as often or as seamlessly
as they should the clipboard forgets
copied content fairly quickly
it sounds like quibbling but little
shortcomings like that can add up to a
subpar experience over time we can only
hope that Microsoft addresses them in
the next Windows Phone release and that
that upgrade will run on the 925 s older
hardware on the other hand nokia has
thankfully done a great job of keeping
these phones up to date with the latest
software toys when we unboxed our ATT
unit we had almost 20 updates waiting
with feature enhancements ranging from
app upgrades to bug fixes and those
updates just keep coming
Nokia's software suite and it's after
purchase support is truly outstanding
and we hope to see this commitment to
meaningful updates continue after the
Microsoft acquisition closes
one of the biggest enhancements has been
the Nokia camera app which made its
debut on the Lumia 1020 and allows fancy
tricks like manual focus and adjustable
shutter speeds exposure and so forth if
that's too much for you you've also got
the option of sticking with something
fun like Nokia smart camera with its
various enhancements or even the stock
Windows Phone camera app which is pretty
bare-bones no matter which app you use
they're all driving the same 0.7
megapixel PureView shooter which is
excellent though 13 megapixels has
become the new high-end benchmark
resolution the six element lens and
optical stabilization of the 925 means
it's likely to be the superior camera in
almost any situation especially in
low-light scenarios it's not perfect the
purple haze color fringing is a little
more pronounced than usual on our unit
and sometimes you need to tweak the
settings to get color balance just right
but the fact that those options are
available to you in and of itself puts
the 925 on another level yes the Lumia
1020 delivers more impressive results
but the 925 is also slimmer lighter and
$50 cheaper on contract with AT&amp;amp;T
speaking of 80 the 925 performed very
well on the nation's second largest
carrier in the Greater Boston area the
LTE throughput excellent as we've come
to expect voice quality was excellent on
our end as well with a warm sound a nice
side tone callers said we sounded a bit
crackly but otherwise fine
speakerphone quality wasn't quite as
good again we wish Nokia hadn't moved it
from the bottom edge to the back but at
least it's loud and as we've come to
expect from 900 series Lumias battery
life continues to be good but not great
especially after prolonged uptime after
many apps have been opened and closed
the Snapdragon s4 tends to get pretty
hot under a load and that combined with
the fairly low battery capacity means
the 925 will continue to be a better
phone for the tight jeans crowd than the
road warriors among us if you're in the
latter group you will definitely want to
invest in an external battery pack
so are you the right kind of buyer who
should consider picking up a 925 now
five months into its lifecycle well
whether it will continue to age well
depends largely on what we see in the
next version of Windows Phone and
there's no guarantee that all of the new
versions features will come to the 925
so honestly it's a gamble but if you are
buying right now and you're looking for
a fluid straightforward user experience
and an outstanding an adaptable camera
and you don't want to spring for the
added bulk or cost of a Lumia 1020 or
1520 the 925 is a real beauty despite
its shortcomings just treat it with kid
gloves or keep it in its protective
pouch to preserve the resale value would
you get the 925 did you just buy the 925
what is your relationship with the 925
