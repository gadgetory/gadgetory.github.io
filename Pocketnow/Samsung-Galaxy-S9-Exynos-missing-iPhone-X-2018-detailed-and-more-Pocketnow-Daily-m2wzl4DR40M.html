what Apple is doing when it comes to
iPhones in 2018 Samsung is apparently
not using the Exynos chip for the s9 yes
you heard that right and a lot of
complaints are coming Apple's way when
it comes to the home pod I'm Jaime
Rivera and follow vehicle it Lavetta on
twitter and on instagram you've got to
keep my son off the script but yeah
please follow him this is rocket out
daily the official news today begin with
deals I continue to recommend the Apple
watch Series 3 as one of my favorite
smartwatches
and as it turns out it's currently
available refurbished for up to $50 off
obviously it depends on the variant
depends on the color and it depends on
the size you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
home pod and those kinds of answers that
just make you cringe when it comes to
Apple as we currently hear that there
are some bugs in the way that the home
pod operates but those are not the worst
ones apparently consumers are
complaining that if you leave the home
pod on a table you get this mark on it
and I'm talking about wooden tables in
response Apple has confirmed that you
will need to place your home pod on a
different surface if you don't want that
problem meaning this is like back in the
day of the iPhone 4 when they were
asking you to hold the phone in a
different way like really all my
surfaces in my apartment are made out of
wood what do you want me to do Apple I'm
actually glad I haven't done this first
batch but apparently Cupertino is
looking into it
and speaking of bugs it seems that
Samsung has halted its rollout of
Android Oreo for the Galaxy s8 over
freezing issues on units and you know
this is something that I don't
understand Samsung is one of those
companies that takes the longest in
doing betas pretty much a whole year now
I'm exaggerating not a whole year but
we're talking at least six months before
they while they get the new version of
Android then when we get the betas and
everything and now really Samsung you're
dealing with freezing issues over that
whole beta you learn more about it in
the description
we should apparently get a software
update soon but right now it's halted
and speaking of Samsung there are some
interesting benchmarks that have emerged
over the galaxy as 9 and s9 plus they
confirm specification x' over the
differences in 6 or 4 gigs of ram in
addition to the snapdragon 845 as the
processor from Qualcomm probably the
most interesting part is that there are
no benchmarks 0 that mentioned the
Exynos 89 10 or 98 10 sorry so we are
already speculating is it possible that
we don't have variants for the X and O's
or what will the case might be I
actually even I've been getting confused
all day but yet it's getting kind of
weird we'll let you know whatever we
learn more about this because Samsung
doesn't even mention the processor they
just say the new 10 nanometer chip and
finally the very interesting dishes they
have to do with iPhone 10 2018 and kg
Eisenmann cheek whoa he's already making
predictions over sales for example we
hear 100 million units for 2018 that's
fine most interesting we hear that we
are getting three iPhones but there will
be variances into the rumors that we had
heard in the past it seems that one
phone will be the regular iPhone 10 2018
with smaller knotch same size there will
be a larger iPhone 10 plus that will
have pretty much the same design and
everything and we even talking l-shaped
batteries and all of this place for
these two phones by the way these are
the premium tiers and then there will be
one in the middle that is not of the
same size of these both and will getting
aluminum design in addition to yes it's
gonna be all display with a notch
smaller not just well but this time it's
an LCD and we're not getting an L shaped
battery which is kind of interesting
anyways it's kind of confusing we're
still early but it leads me to the
question of today we're rolling out so
many early predictions over what the
iPhone 10 2018 will be that we wonder if
that is in any way to turn your opinion
over what we're expecting from the B see
we've got a ton of products coming over
are you still caring about these
products or are you waiting for the
iPhone 10 2018 given the major success
of the 10 in my case I can't wait to see
what we get from MWC leave us a comment

opinion friends again if you want to get
