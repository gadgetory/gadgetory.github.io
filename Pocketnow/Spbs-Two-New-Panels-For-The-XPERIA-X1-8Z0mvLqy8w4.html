hey everyone Daniel Webster here at
paquim√© calm and today I'm going to
show you two new panels that are
available for the sony ericsson xperia
x1 and these are by spb mobile the
makers of spb mobile shell spb weather
and many other different titles so let's
go into settings and we'll get those
right now okay here here it actually
says download buy it now these are the
first two panels have actually seen that
Sony Ericsson has put on their website
that they actually charge people so and
we're going to that and see exactly how
much they cost
okay so here we have the prices and SPD
traveler is actually 2995 and excess PB
weather is 1995 but because you have the
xperia you get a five dollar discount so
for both products there are fourteen
ninety 4490 and we'll just close out of
this okay so the first panel I'm going
to go into is spp weather so we're just
going to go to that okay so like many
other spb programs this has the same
flick scroll so you can switch between
cities and get forecasts on each one of
those cities you can also add cities
here which this allows you to select
cities so you can remove cities edit
cities and do all that great stuff so
like many other spb programs it actually
allows you to use the flick scrolling
and SVP weather and you can see
different cities it will actually give
you who the weather is provided by so in
the United States this is the national
weather forecast or service and you can
also select the city to get more of a
detailed view and you know back and if
you see the review on SP weather 2.0 it
actually gave you a pretty cool feature
it was this globe and which allows you
to change different views so if I wanted
to pick saddle I can do that it'll show
me the satellite view and cool thing
about this program on the xperia is that
it actually allows you to zoom in a lot
further than the SB weather 2.0 the SP
whether two points are only give you two
different and zooming levels
and of course you can also change your
cities here so you can set them as a
default city and remove the city and get
weather sources
okay so the next panel is the spp
traveler and we'll just go into that
first thing we actually do is go over
here and this is the way that this is
actually the main page of the spb
traveler program so if we go on here
this allows us to change the time the
date and right now this is december
twenty first two thousand eight so i
have to change the settings in a little
bit but it's pretty good for just
demonstrational purposes now go back and
if you click on this it'll actually give
you a panorama view of the city that
you're looking at which is kind of neat
so if you want to notice New York looks
like from the skyline that's great it
can also give you city info so it tells
you a lot about the city the area code
the longitudinal add a new latitude and
the general tipping in that city so
we'll go back and the next thing will
actually go to is our itinerary so this
is where you can actually plan a trip so
if you want to add something like let's
say you're going to take a flight so if
you want to add a flight number so we'll
just make one up and if you if you want
to locate that file you just click find
and you can change your date so change
this
to the 25th of March okay and I'll just
a cancel because it's not real in the
next cool little tab over here is
actually our our conversions and tipping
and all that great stuff so if we go to
our tipping calculator we can select
number so let's say our bill is 25 12
equal and if we select to tip so fifteen
percent so it gives you a total amount
and if you want to split it up between
four people you can do that as well so 7
22 times for and that's pretty neat it
also gives you a units calculator so you
can check different mutants so if one of
the length it'll give us that so if we
select like 10 it'll give us the exact
amount so 10 meters equals 393 inches so
just close that if you want to check
flight statuses you can do that here new
search so here's one that I selected
before and it'll give you different
airlines and flights that are available
and you can select on a fight for more
details on departure dates arrivals the
aircraft itself and the duration of the
flight so go back
you can also check clothing sizes so if
you are in the like let's say you are in
Germany and you want to check what size
besides church you or you can do that
here so it will give you the european
size as well as the u.s. sizes and
currencies currencies is always useful
if you're in another country so if we
have a hundred dollars us we can just
see that it's 70 40 0 and all the rest
of the currencies of the world and you
can update that as well GU game is kind
of cool it's a pretty interactive it's
kind of a time waster so it'll give you
a total time how how much you want to
start so we can start this and which
country is this flag from well let's see
grace no bulgaria know Jamaica no and it
will also show you where Jerusalem is so
we can go back
phrasebook is actually a very useful
program because this gives you many
different phrases in many different
languages so if we wanted to see am i
disturbing you it will show you the
exact language this is this is Spanish
right here but you can choose many
different languages and as you can see
we have Chinese czech danish dutch
finnish french german greek italian
japanese polish Portuguese Russian
Spanish and tie so that's pretty neat
we'll just close this
and also give you the time of the world
so you can select many different cities
that you choose and our options and
another cool feature about this program
kind of like the spb weather 2.0 is that
you can view the globe so you can also
change your settings so if I wanted to
go if you wanted to delete the night
view which will show you that show you
the Sun rise and set on the globe can do
that you can also view your trip that
you've planned in the first window just
click OK and you can also zoom in which
is pretty neat and you can scroll the
globe course and I'll show you New York
so those are the two new panels from spb
for the sony ericsson xperia x1 and
they're available through your device or
through sony ericsson's website and if
you need any more information I'll post
a link in park geun-hye calm thanks for
