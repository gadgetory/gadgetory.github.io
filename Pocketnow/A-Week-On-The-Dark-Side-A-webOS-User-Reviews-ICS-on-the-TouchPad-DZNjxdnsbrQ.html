pocketnow.com last video we showed you
how to install the cm9 build of Android
Ice Cream Sandwich on the HP TouchPad
tablet since it's been seven days it's
time to review it but since there's
already plenty of reviews out there of
cm9 on the touch pad this time we're
going to take it from the perspective of
someone who used and loved webos me I'll
show you what Android does better what
it does worse we'll go on a bug hunt
it's pocket now let's start right off by
talking about one of the more
interesting elements of the touchpad the
touchstone charging dock now with cm9
loaded on the touchpad you do just still
drop it on there and it still works
which is really really nice and you get
a nice little blown up time view in
android that's all right in webos by
contrast you drop it on the touchstone
and sure you can get a time view if you
want but you can also use any number of
touchstone enabled exhibition
applications so for example you can use
this application called glimpse to show
you time whether twitter news despite
the fact that i have a dual monitor
setup on my desktop this is how I get
most of my up-to-date information
throughout the day when the touchpad is
running webos there are other
applications of course like a weather
dashboard of Facebook plug-in and other
exhibition apps that leverage this
feature gonna have to call webOS a
winner on this one now let's talk about
user interface a little bit in webos
apps or houston cards which you can
flick away slide back and forth between
it's made the task manager the core
method of interacting with the OS
instead of just a tacked-on afterthought
swipes up from the bottom allow you to
get back to card view where you can
manage dismiss arrange and basically do
anything you want with your open
applications by contrast with ice cream
sandwich your main function keys are
located in the lower left where you can
call up a multitasking view return to
the home screen or press the back button
in some applications sometimes that key
turns into a keyboard dismissal button
which is handy swiping up from the bezel
gets you know where it doesn't bring up
your applications drawer for that you
have to go all the
to the upper right-hand corner of the
screen and tap the applications button
swiping up from the lower right gets you
to the Notification Center which is
handy and another swipe up will dismiss
it and finally going back up to the
upper right we switch over to the upper
left if you want to do a Google search
or if you want to interact with the
tablet with your voice got that yes the
Android approach is a lot less intuitive
and if you're coming from a webos device
it takes a while to get used to Android
seems to really want you to use all four
corners of that device and keep your
hand moving across the canvas of the
display as much as possible why I don't
know now as many of you know matias
duarte who was in charge of designing
most of webos has since moved over to
google to become the head of the android
user experience and that shows a bit an
Ice Cream Sandwich most prominently in
the multitasking display where you can
call up a list of recently used
applications and if you want to get rid
of them from the list you can toss them
off the screen this doesn't appear to
close the applications or it does close
some of the applications and doesn't
others just remove them from the
launcher is inconsistent it's a little
taste of what webOS offered but it's
more window dressing than anything still
it's a lot more handy than what we saw
in previous iterations of Android as far
as task management goes a very basic but
very welcome addition to the touch pads
keyboard in webos was the addition of a
full number row at the top of the
keyboard which prevented you from having
to switch back and forth with Shift key
every time you needed to enter numerals
now that is not present on the Android
version of the keyboard it's a minor
inconvenience but it's still an
inconvenience by contrast both keyboards
both web OS and Android offer a tab key
which is really really handy when you're
filling in multiple fields like on pizza
order forms or address fields or credit
card fields anywhere in the browser
where you have to jump between many
fields you don't want to keep your
fingers hopping back and forth between
the keyboard and the display so I'm glad
this option was thought of in both
versions of the keyboard
let's talk a little bit about bugs now
we were using android version 403
cyanogenmod version alpha 0 dot 6 now
this is an alpha so bugs are going to be
there I'm not tearing them apart for for
bugs being present like this is
something you have to expect when you're
running cm9 on the touchpad so first off
the google music application did not
function properly i could not get it to
play any sound files at all in addition
the camera functionality is not included
in this particular build of cm9 for the
touchpad so couldn't get the camera
working and the touchpad only has a
front facing camera so that's not really
a big deal some more Exotic bugs
happened in pandora if you left some
applications running for a while went
away and then came back to them they
would fail to respond in this instance
pandora had stopped playing and no
amount of pressing on any of the keys
could get it to start playing again
tried to jump into the task manager and
throw it away like i would have done in
webos jump back into the application but
that didn't seem to have any kind of
effect a little frustrating try to
reboot and you'll notice some touch
screen responsiveness problems on the
touch pad that is not unique to android
by the way that is that problem is going
to be dealt with by any user of the
touchpad it seems no matter what
operating system you're running
thankfully a reboot did fix that
particular problem but then we run into
another one when the touchpad display
goes to sleep the music quality goes
with it
this is a bug that I could only
reproduce maybe seventy to eighty
percent of the time but it was still
annoying you have to keep the touchpad
awake whenever I wanted to listen music
the last bug I'm going to talk about was
the biggest one I ran into and the week
i was using cm9 on the touchpad and
hands down the biggest impediment to
productivity I ran into at all the
keyboard software on this build of
cyanogen mod nine cannot keep up with
your keystrokes if you're typing quickly
if you start off typing slowly if you're
a very slow typer it's not going to be
an issue for you once you start speeding
up though the bug becomes apparent the
best way to describe it is that the
spacebar trips on itself it probably has
something to do with the autocorrect
library lagging so that when it tries to
update the ribbon of possible words you
mean along the top of the keyboard it
trips on itself but the end result is
that when the spacebar is tapped it
registers as a DoubleTap more often than
not if you're going fast this leads to
periods in the middle of your sentence
all the time needless to say it's
awkward and it doesn't result in a great
typing experience in fact it's really
very very frustrating and it makes the
touchpad borderline unusable for any
kind of typing whether you're messaging
emailing facebooking anything that
requires text input via the keyboard
well it just turns to garbage thankfully
the cyanogenmod team is incredibly
resourceful and very talented if there's
not a fix out there already there
probably will be by the time this video
goes live so on the comments to our last
video featuring this device there were a
lot of requests for benchmark results
thanks for the comments guys and here's
your benchmark tests on the webOS we
used an app called lithium benchmark HD
which yielded us a performance index of
140 and on the Android side we got a
quadrant result of 26 22
so the takeaway is even though ice cream
sandwich has brought major improvements
to Android as far as user experience and
user interface goes webos is still more
elegant and it still runs more smoothly
than the Alpha that's available for the
touch pad right now that's not saying
it's better it's just saying that for
the majority of the functions I needed
it for in my week with the touch pad as
a content consumption device and
occasional social interaction device
webos worked better and more reliably
now I could not do as much obviously
even though the android market is no
place to brag about as far as tablet
apps go the heat palm app catalog or
excuse me the HP app catalog is even
more barren at least now that HP has
given up on things in addition one of
the notes I took during this review
period was pretty telling I was out at a
bar waiting for some friends to arrive
and I was using the tablet to do
something and I took a note to myself
that red I feel more like I'm using a
computer than I do with the iPad or with
webos depending on who you are that
could be a good thing or a bad thing
what I meant was that it felt like a
more complete computing experience in
Ice Cream Sandwich now that's
interesting to say the least there's a
lot of potential here just like in the
broader android tablet market but only
time will tell if it's going to be
fulfilled
that's it for this one guys once again
it's michael fisher with pocketnow.com
from the camera on the HP TouchPad
thanks for tuning in for this one if you
liked what you saw leave us a like leave
us a comment if you didn't let us know
what you didn't like most importantly
tune in next time we'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
