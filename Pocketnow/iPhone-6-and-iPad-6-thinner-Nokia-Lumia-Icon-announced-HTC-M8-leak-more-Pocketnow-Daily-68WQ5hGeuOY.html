thanks to some LED improvements HTC
leaks shows an m8 again aside from a new
desire phablet and Nokia leak the Lumia
icon so bad that it ended up announcing
it today I'm hi Mary that I am no I'm
not tired this is just me with my auto
power saver mode on this is parking out
daily let's just say off with some
official news that were not supposed to
be official as Nokia accidentally leaked
the video comparison between their Nokia
Lumia icon which is now official and the
galaxy s4 and the point of the video was
to show you how the Lumia icon is
capable of capturing audio from video
wherever you point the phone which is
really cool it's like a shotgun
microphone it's great technology
obviously in the Lumia icon is now
official on verizon you can pick it up
on February 20th links of the
description for full details and
speaking of Nokia one of our biggest
concerns for mwc 2014 was the fact that
we were just getting Asha phones or
whatever the nokia normandy will be
which is assumed to be another Asha
mid-range or entry-level phone and now
we finally get some rumors of a nokia
lumia 930 being the next flagship
successor to the 920 great flagship
specifications aside from a nokia lumia
630 and 635 to be the successors for the
mid-range 620 currently obviously these
are just reports we don't have any
specifics but stay tuned we could
probably get some better phones than
just ashes and the google chromecast is
getting closer into allowing you to
mirror your android display on to your
TV you can clearly do with this with iOS
devices on Apple TVs but obviously the
chromecast is a smaller product and as
it turns out since the SDK to developers
was launched last week one developer has
already figured out how to do this we
still do not have the official
application available but it's great to
see that the chromecast keeps getting
better especially for 35 bucks guys
let's move the spotlight over to Apple
as the company is now being rumored to
bring us a thinner and lighter iphone 6
and next generation iPad which is
something we were already expecting we
already know that the company is working
on giving us a bigger iphone 6 4.7
inches in 5.5 inches but apparently the
company is also working on bringing us a
point 4 mm
LED backlight to power the display of
the iphone and ipad that are coming this
year and this is definitely substantial
obviously it'll make the device lighter
as well so stay tuned as we are
expecting the iphone 6 to launch and
june according to this report so we'll
see about that and finally for the hot
news of the day we continue getting more
leaks of HTC devices to be announced
very soon first of all we get the first
leaked images of a desire eight and even
though this is a mid-range phablet 5.5
inches what makes it interesting is that
it actually looks very handsome looks a
lot like the HTC One and speed of the
HTC One we also get more photographs of
the HTC m8 which we expect to be the one
plus though obviously we did get a leak
that made this phone look a little bit
different to the current generation one
and this one just looks like a photoshop
job of the one without the HTC branding
it's really hard to know what to expect
just yet but that literature the
question of the day with the future HTC
One be your next smartphone because in
my particular case I'll admit if they
figure out the ultrapixel thing or give
us more ultrapixels I am definitely
getting this phone next but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get to do is earlier before this
video with stone which we follow us on
parking out comment subscription channel
as well you'd also follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Natalie then I think you
very much for watching you'll see
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
