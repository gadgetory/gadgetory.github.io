pocketnow.com and this is another
episode of the Android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started
this game is called bubble blast - and
if it's free on the Android Market it is
sort of a chain reaction bubble game in
which you must unlock these other
bubbles in order to move on to the next
level so if I hit this red bubble right
here a chain reaction occurs in which
all the other bubbles will become
unlocked and when you get all the
bubbles unlocked in the accept amount of
touches left you move on to the next
level so now we can go to the next level
and this one looks a little bit more
tricky so we'll try this one and the
game continues on just like this daily
finance is your one-stop free finance
application available in the Android
Market so this application has markets
it has news
it has movers and all that other great
stuff occurring on the market so we can
view the actives the gainers and the
losers here if I'd like I can also view
my stocks which I have put in so I can
view my watchlist and we'll take a
second to load so I have Apple Google
and Microsoft on here I can also get
news for all these watchlist
stocks and I can also go to get quotes
easy filter is a free application
available on the Android Market that
will help you filter out those unwanted
and annoying phone calls and messages
that you get from people so you can
either block the block list or you can
add various numbers to only accept your
contacts and block all if set block list
so we can go to block list and view a
phone number that I've added so I
blocked the messaging and calls from
this phone number I can also view the
filter records which show me the blocked
calls and the blocked messages if I want
to retrieve them in the future
explain is a paid-for a flight simulator
game that cost $9.99 on the Android
Market so the first thing I want to do
is increase my throttle tap here and
turn off my brake which is already off I
will just use my accelerometer to move
across the runway and when I've reached
enough speed all I have to do is lift up
and the aircraft will take off the
ground so I can probably lift up now
move my flaps to the center
and now I can fly around the mountains
and you choose many different worlds
and aircrafts on this game X piano is a
free application valve on the android
market that turns your android device
into a full-blown multi octave keyboard
so I can begin playing some notes here I
can use my multi-touch to play multiple
notes I can also change these instrument
using so if I want to can choose a
synthesized bass sound here it's pretty
cool I'll just click on here I can move
down an entire multiple axes and go back
the same way I can also record this and
save them as ringtones which would
probably make the most annoying ringtone
ever so this has been another episode of
the Android application weekly and if
you like our video let's make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below we'd like to hear
what you're saying and the name of this
live wallpaper is called a Firefly at
live wallpaper and they're two versions
available a free version and a paid
version which cost about one dollar and
as you can see the fireflies will be
attracted to the turned on lights thanks
