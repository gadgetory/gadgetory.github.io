here in London and still looking at the
samsung galaxy s4 zoom and this time
we're going to compare it with the
samsung galaxy s4 because they are part
of the same family and I'd say that the
zoom has about the same dimensions as
the galaxy s4 mini so it's much smaller
than the galaxy s4 in terms of thickness
there is absolutely no use to compare
them because maybe up until the bezel
point they are at the same with but once
you take a look at the actual camera on
the back of the galaxy s4 zoom then
there's absolutely no need for any
further comparisons we have a five inch
full HD Super AMOLED screen on the
galaxy s4 while the galaxy s4 zoom packs
a 4.3 inch qhd Super AMOLED screen and
we'll try to find the information from
somebody could you tell me which the
processor inside the galaxy s4 zoom the
what you want you to know the processor
the processor 1.5 so we are being told
that this is a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor thank you very much for the
information going third round down for
the specs we have 8 gigabytes of
internal storage on the galaxy s4 zoom
the s4 comes in 16 32 and 64 gigabyte
flavors and flipping it over to the back
we have a 30 minute
so sure on the LCS for while the galaxy
s4 has that 16 megapixel sensor but not
the size of the sensors is the important
thing but the actual optical zoom lens
which gives you a 10 x zooming
impossibility of course it's coupled
with the Xenon flash and optical image
stabilization and once you power on the
camera first we'll have to unlock the
phone as you can see it will extend
nothing nothing which happens on the
galaxy s4 unfortunately so this is the
main difference between the two aside
from the specifications at which we have
looked so here we were with the samsung
galaxy s4 vs the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
have an instant denied you've been
watching another pocket now video it's
been a long night and it's not over yet
but it's fun thank you very much for
watching till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
