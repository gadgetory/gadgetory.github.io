self-proclaimed best Network and you
want the best Windows Phone to match
your choices are limited to to the Lumia
icon from the artist formerly known as
Nokia and the new HTC One m8 for Windows
which we reviewed earlier this week so
which of these Microsoft flagships is
cool enough for your me tile I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and the only way I
know of to answer that question is to
compare them so let's do that
join us for HTC One m8 for Windows
versus Nokia Lumia icon if it's a
lightweight Windows Phone you're after
you might want to look elsewhere the
small phones these are not but their
size manifests in different ways on the
Lumia the sheer aluminum band bordering
the phone makes you feel every bit of
its nine point seven millimeter
thickness and the square corners and
matte polycarbonate back give it a
sturdy almost brick-like feel it's only
seven grams more massive than the HTC
product but it feels much heavier in the
pocket and those sharp corners do dig
into the palm which isn't very
comfortable the HTC phone is thinner and
much rounder making it more comfortable
to hold and easier to put into a pocket
it's chamfered edges and brushed
aluminum casing give it a flashy ER look
and its twin front firing speakers to
make it a bit taller - there were no
capacitive keys beneath the display on
the m8 nor a hardware camera button both
of which are present on the icon but
there is an IR port and more importantly
a microSD slot on the HTC device while
the Nokia goes without in exchange for
you fellow futurists out there the icon
sports Qi wireless charging support
while the One m8 does not let's talk
about displays for a second both are
5-inch 1080p screens with a pixel
density of 441 pixels every inch but
with different technology behind each
you get very different results from each
most notably the icons screen is capable
of almost perfect blacks relative to the
one mA it's more grey blue reproduction
and colors on the icon also pop with
much higher contrast
saturation making the tiles of the
modern UI really stand out we've often
said AMOLED screens are the better fit
for windows phones for just this reason
and it certainly holds true here the
icons screen can also get much brighter
but in broad daylight neither is going
to be your best friend gloved usage is
possible on both but slightly easier on
the icon thanks to super sensitive touch
annoyingly though the icon doesn't
support double tap to wake so you have
to press a button to unlock it finally
let's take a quick look under the hood
the processors here aren't that far
apart in either branding or clock speed
and theoretically the slightly newer
hardware and the m8 should translate to
faster app and page loads and better 3d
gaming performance but it's tough to see
that in the real world here sometimes
the icon beats the ma sometimes the
opposite is true
there's nothing really significant or
consistent about these differences and
we're already talking software so let's
make it official with the screen swipe
there's a version difference in Windows
Phone here that makes this comparison
troublesome our Lumia icon on 8.1 is
still waiting for the most recent
version of the OS while our m8 came out
of the box with the update already
installed as Windows Phone 8.1 dot 1 the
main differences are minor and include
native folder creation VPN support
Cortana updates and a few others but
since all this will eventually come to
the icon as well we'll leave those be
for now custom software is a whole other
folder though the Nokia used to be the
leader here with many exclusive titles
in the Windows Store that you could only
get if you own the Lumia now some of
that still holds true camera and media
titles but some big ones like the here
navigation suite are now available for
all windows phones and with the new m8
HTC brought over its own camera apps
from android along with the useful
blinkfeed news and social ribbon you
still get more fine-grained control over
some features on the icon like the
screens color profile but unbalanced the
software differences between Lumia
windows phones and others are getting
more minor by the month
yet the Lumia line can afford to
sacrifice some software specialties
because it still packs the best damn
cameras you can find on any Windows from
now any smartphone period on the icon
it's a 20 megapixel optically stabilized
sensor made into a Carl Zeiss lens and
operated by the Nokia camera the most
advanced and versatile viewfinder on the
market meanwhile the One m8 goes a
completely different direction bringing
a four megapixel sensor working in
concert with a dedicated depth sensor
and HTC's own camera app to offer a more
consumer focused viewfinder maybe the
simplest way to boil down the
differences here is to say that the icon
is for people who want the closest thing
to a professional camera on their
smartphone while the one mA it is for
folks who value fun more than raw power
despite their big resolution gap each of
these is perfectly capable of quick
informal shots and each one also does a
fantastic job in low-light Nokia's
PureView technology edges out HTC's
ultra pixel method here bringing more
authentic colors and less noise to dark
photos but they're both miles ahead of
most of the competition when the lights
go down HTC's duo camera offers a depth
of field effect that Apes a high-end
camera but that's easily replicated with
a third-party app on the Nokia the
principle advantage the Lumia enjoys is
resolution normally the software uses
pixel over sampling to whip up an image
not much bigger than HTC's but having
access to the raw 16 megapixel picture
on the icon means you get a lot more
detail when zooming in on distant
objects now surprisingly on the front
side the situation is reversed the 1m
eights 5 megapixel front facing camera
is a much higher resolution than the 1.2
megapixel selfie cam on the Lumia back
in the primary objects when you take
into account the lens expansions on the
Lumia it's for microphone audio array
and the smoother video made possible by
optical stabilization maybe the results
aren't surprising both smartphones are
more than fine for casual shooting but
the icon was built in large part around
its camera and it's the more capable
shooter over
all in much the same way the m8 was
built around it's big boom sound drivers
and while the Nokia speaker is pretty
loud it's located all the way around
back and it just can't hold a candle to
the One m8 setup
on headphones both devices can get
plenty loud but the icons dolby
enhancement is a little richer to our
ears and less grading at high volumes
the icon also does slightly better with
FM reception though reception on other
videos is comparable and for phone calls
we actually prefer the brighter and
crisper sound of the One m8 earpiece to
the mushy er icon sound each has
excellent noise suppression though
what about gaming and other high demand
tasks well the differences begin to
taper off here whether we're running
heavy horsepower titles or less
strenuous diversions like sparkle to
hear each Windows Phone can probably
handle whatever you can find in the
Windows Store the one eye mates aluminum
casing will get hotter to the touch over
time but that's about the only
difference we saw and guess what the
minor difference in battery capacity is
also not enough to make for any real
endurance advantage on either side keep
in mind that both batteries are embedded
and non-replaceable though so unless
you're aggressively policing your app
activity be aware that you might have to
hit up the battery saver toward the end
of a heavy day let's be straight this is
a tough choice they're both
class-leading well-made devices and each
has compelling features the other
doesn't so much of this comes down to
personal preference which of those
features you value more and which
aesthetic you like better the biggest
difference is the camera
HTC brings more fun to the table but the
icon wins by a landslide when it comes
to raw capability and when you consider
that the Lumia is free on contract right
now with Verizon and $100 cheaper than
the one I made at full retail we think
the Nokia phone offers the better value
at the moment but we'd be lying if we
said the ma it's more sophisticated
build and acoustic dominance wouldn't
have us thinking twice at the cash wrap
