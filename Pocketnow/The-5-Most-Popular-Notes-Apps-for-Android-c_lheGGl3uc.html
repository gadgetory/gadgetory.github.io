let's see I'm rules pocket now okay plug
it now and here are the top of Papa five
most popular note-taking apps for
Android all right ready to go three to
the five apps we have on our hands here
our Evernote Google keep OneNote ink pad
and color note apparently these apps
have at least 10 million downloads
logged with Evernote marked at 110 up a
notepad and type whatever you want all
of them even do checklists of some sort
but there are vast differences between
all of them and we'll go through each of
them one by one let's start with ink pad
from developer work pale and it's
basically the equivalent of store brand
new pad you can type or dictate if you
dare a note in some milquetoast typeface
although you can change it in the
settings you can also write up a
checklist or a shopping list the
shopping list part of it actually just
tags an Amazon search button to your
item if you plan on chopping out more
for the grocery stores this feature
won't do much for you each document you
make cannot be attached to a notebook or
a binder of any kind it's just notes
notes notes notes ink pad is free but
the add list version features unlimited
syncing really historical tracking for
up to ten revisions of a document
offline notes access and increased
storage for a couple bucks a month or
twenty a year if you can't tell I'm kind
of not impressed with this app and the
website it's attached to I mean look at
the lists there aren't even check marks
color note is our next step up and it's
also pretty Spartan notes and lists
and still no notebooks for the
hyper-organized but at least you can
color-code your notes and nine ways and
set a reminder an alarm or a passcode to
them you can archive notes for later
looking up to list entries are also web
searchable and at least all of this is
free no ads period coming up to one note
this runner-up contender gets to the
more comprehensive features of a
note-taking client instead of color
coding though we're talking about
notebooks divided into sections divided
into pages so that's how Microsoft's
taking that road there are a couple more
word processing features like type
formatting different listing bullets and
indentation change here you can add
pictures and audio memos as well as some
scrolling x' and highlights actually
scrolling czar called inking x' and if I
had a compatible stylus I could use it
to make horrible landscapes or whatever
I need to to remember things you also
have the ability to link notes directly
from the home screen what you do lose is
being able to set reminders for your
notes so there's the give-and-take
OneNote is free you just have to have a
Microsoft account which will remind you
of that
hotmail account you left a long time ago
Evernote is our first-place winner as
the most popular record-keeping app of
record there's a bevy of functionality
that puts it above one note yes it has
almost all of the above except for color
sorting but in place of that you have
tags real word tags there's also a work
chat function if you're collaborating on
a report though it's pretty bare-bones
as is and the camera has some beefed up
modes to document scanning does a pretty
good job doing what it's supposed to but
it's not an OCR program also you'll have
to grab the free sketch companion app to
make any annotations to your doc picture
there is integration to post-it brand
sticky notes although you can use any
sticky notes you want and business card
reading the latter function requires a
paid premium subscription though you can
get one year's use for free by
connecting your LinkedIn account the
basic Edition is free to use but you're
only allowed to upload up to 60
megabytes of stuff a month Evernote plus
ups that amount to one gigabyte monthly
and allows for offline access and note
locks as well as email
- no conversion that's just under three
dollars a month or $25 a year and
finally we have Google keep which is our
wildcard for this game while the column
interface doesn't exactly feel right in
a note app or processing lacks
formatting options and there's no
passcode locking keep has a huge
advantage there's color sorting labels
and reminders and rather rudimentary but
functional optical character recognition
now this isn't our top choice but we put
it here last because if a lot of your
paperwork is actually paper and you want
to work within the digital ether well he
was the most viable option for you for
now and it's free what about your notes
