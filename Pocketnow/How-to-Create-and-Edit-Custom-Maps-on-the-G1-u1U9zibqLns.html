calm today we're going to take a look at
custom google maps you've ever been to
Google Maps might have clicked on my
maps left hand side and notice that you
can create new maps and put waypoints
and markers anywhere you want on the map
for example here I have a map that I
created of New York City places to eat
now as you may know I can share this
list of restaurants via a link paste it
into an email or embed it into a website
I can also send it directly to somebody
I can print it off a few it in Google
Earth but what if I want to view it on
and drilling on my g1 or better yet what
if I wanted to create a map like this on
my team well that's easy just go to the
android market and download my maps
editor by google this application will
synchronize your maps between the g1 and
you're my maps account on google so on
the Android you can do particular map if
the locations you have stored on there
if you want to edit more information you
can edit the map you can add in the
description add a photo adding a photo
enables you to select a photo from your
picasa web albums a photo stored on your
phone you can take a new picture or
intern image URL you can mark your
location at a photo and address markers
or line or shape adding the line is easy
ked sheeps you can also go to the maps
listen to what other maps you have saved
up create a new man now what's great
about the Google my maps editor is say i
want to go to meetings ooh sushi hard to
see it's a blue tax but you can open
this location with the browser or maps
then it will open it up there on the
maps application on the g one now you
can zoom to the address you can set your
location here for Google Latitude you
can get directions to it or from it or
add it as a contact there's virtually no
limit to the number of practical
applications you use it the climax
editor by Google that's all for now sure
