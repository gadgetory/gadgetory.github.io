next up we're going to look at the
People Hub email calendar and office so
right up here is my people tile and it's
showing little tiny pictures of people
in my contacts so let's press that here
we get to the recent people these are
people that I recently emailed or text
message or a phone call so you got about
eight of them are going to show up here
and they're popping with their names are
showing up for their status updates
those are all I'm going to come up
occasionally if I go over here this is
all my people so I can scroll through
here and see everybody or I can search
and just type somebody and get right to
him and this little button will add a
contact so that's a quick way to add
somebody you can choose which account
you want to add them to and you know at
all their information they're over here
is the what's new feed this will show
facebook and windows live updates and we
got there it goes the little message
icon the plus symbol that'll let you
comment on those facebook updates and
you can see when somebody else comments
they'll show a number how many people
commented on that
so here we go to make a comment
and that should do it there it is so
that's your feet and then you're back to
the recent people okay if we tap and
hold what do you got settings we've
already seen those okay next up let's do
email which email account should I go do
well I mail each email account has a
separate kind of app icon that you can
pin to the Start menu or it'll show up
in the program's listing so here we are
you got all you got in red got urgent
and you got a menu so if you want to
delete a bunch of these I can just tap
on the side and that shows up our check
marks which is really nice because
they're not always there being
cluttering up the interface so you can
select a bunch of them and delete the
trashcan or move them all on once like
that optionally you can press that
button and bring up the check boxes so
the plus icon here we go if we bring up
the menu you can see the yeah what are
you check on means so there's new
folders or sink so let's look at folders
and by default it only syncs the inbox
but if we say show all folders we can go
to different folders and then i can say
sink this folder and that will turn on a
sink for this folder so they'll all
those download the new messages for this
folder you can see it's checking for
messages
I don't know if we want to wait so
there's folder let me go to another one
drafts this one does not sink at all not
in hotmail nuttin I map emails not in
exchange when it comes to draft messages
it's either going to be on your phone or
on your real email account which is a
total pain because what if I started
draft email on my desktop and I want to
finish it on my phone sorry you're at a
look no way to sync drafts that's pain
okay so let's see if junk folder synced
that's still working here's our settings
we can do an email signature you can BCC
yourself if you want to copy or send
message but usually it'll copy it into
the sent messages folder sent items
rather there okay let's get back to the
inbox
I have anybody with a picture here and
we the emails show up really nicely if
this was from a contract that I know a
big picture would show up right there
and it looks really good so by default
it doesn't download pictures in HTML
emails which is good because exam all as
one people knowing that you read this
message see it says internet pictures
are blocked so if I tap it then it'll
download all my pictures and you can
zoom out see the whole thing
it works just like internet explorer all
right so that's pretty good HTML lumen
next let's check out the calendar so you
got three views for the calendar agenda
day and month you can see the month
allow the little tiny tiny type in the
in the days that's not meant to be
readable it's just an indication of how
much stuff you have going on that day so
that's all that's really useful here's
the day and you can do a new appointment
you can't really drag the time so if you
want to do a new appointment you really
have to go in here and choose how long
does it or would you custom you can
choose the end time so that's kind of a
pain if you're used to the way windows
mobile classic used to where you can
just drag the area that the appointment
will take up
okay so there's our clock and change the
time and that's going to make an
appointment here we can choose which
account we want to add the calendar
appointment to okay I'm to cancel and
here we have calendars here's my windows
live calendar is going to be green
exchange calendar is going to be red and
my google calendar will be brown so that
way you can have different calendars
I'll show up there all right that's it
for a calendar and the office sub
starts off on one note and if i do all
that that this is our pages and if i do
refresh it's going to if I didn't do
already it would ask you if you want to
sync with SkyDrive and when it does that
it's going to create a notebook on
SkyDrive based on your live ID called
personal web and it's going to put these
pages in there automatically and then
you can sync that with your desktop from
Sky Drive and unfortunately it will only
sink that single notebook with SkyDrive
for now but there's still other
notebooks because you can sync with
sharepoint 2010 now here's another bug
well maybe it's a feature but it's a
limitation nonetheless if I make a
section in my notebook that is password
protected like this one right here
protected section it's not going to sink
you're not going to be able open it it's
not going to ask you for a password
you're not going to be able to access it
at all so that's kind of pain you can
only sync unprotected window sections
and when you're in the page you can pin
it to your Start menu you can email it
and you can refresh it this one I think
okay here where and when you're editing
mode you can type stuff and you got some
more options down here you can create a
list you can insert a picture or do an
audio recording here's some formatting
options
unfortunately if you do an audio
recording and then do something else
like we're going to answer call that
audio recording stops so see it's done
you can't be recording all meeting and
then also check an email so that's bug I
released a pain next up is our documents
listing and create a new document you
got Excel Word or PowerPoint these are
all pretty basic but they have
commenting support you can say that as
and send saying forward got the search
you got outline mode
and here's PowerPoint
during the edit mode you can change some
text
and you can also move slides over the
next one edit the notes that's pretty
decent then we got the sharepoint stuff
I don't have a sharepoint 2010 server
but they would show up here and your
SharePoint workspaces would show up here
there's no tap and hold menu there
that's pretty much it for office so
there you go and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
