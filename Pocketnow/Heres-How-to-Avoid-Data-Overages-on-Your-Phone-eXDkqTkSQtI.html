exceeding your data limit i'm taylor
martin this is PocketNow and this is how
to avoid data overages on your phone
just when everyone got used to having an
unlimited amount of bits consumed with
their smartphones each month the two
largest carriers in the u.s. pulled the
rug out from beneath us pressures on
wireless networks around the world from
a massive influx of data users over the
last several years has forced the rapid
expansion of 4G technology those who are
lucky enough to keep their grandfathered
unlimited plans now get to enjoy the
pleasures of LTE without limit but for
some the introduction of LTE was
bittersweet it came alongside dreadful
tiered data plans both with hard and
soft caps those with soft caps can
continue to use data once they've
reached their monthly allowance only at
heavily throttled speeds but those on a
tiered or shared data plan with a hard
cap face overage fees if they hit their
limit before the months end
fortunately there are several ways to
save your bits and avoid data overages
this may sound fairly self-explanatory
but the best method is to rely on Wi-Fi
whenever it's available too often I
catch myself leaving Wi-Fi off when I'm
at the coffee shop and streaming Spotify
over wireless data for hours on end when
I realize I end up kicking myself over
the 500 megabytes of data I could have
saved myself most Android phones and the
iPhone by default will notify you when
you're in range of an open network so
long as you have permission connect and
enjoy the free internet while it lasts
of all the things we may download
applications and games can sometimes be
the most taxing on our data allowance
chewing through hundreds of megabytes
and sometimes several gigabytes at a
time for our sake both Google and Apple
have put safeguards in place to keep us
from accidentally blowing through our
data allowance by downloading a large
file from Google Play or the App Store
on iOS you can't download an application
or update larger than 50 megabytes over
3G or 4G you must connect to Wi-Fi
before the download will begin on
Android you're simply notified that
you'll be downloading a large file and
prompted to use Wi-Fi also on Android
you have the option to automatically
update applications which is great
considering developers are constantly
pushing updates to the Play Store it
gets to be overwhelming updating all the
applications
manually all the time but Google also
added the option to automatically
download updates over Wi-Fi only a
simple yet necessary feature for any
files you may have automatically
uploading such as pictures to photo
stream Google+ or Dropbox make sure you
select the option to only upload over
Wi-Fi as well this will save a ton of
precious bits especially if you're a
notorious photo snapper in terms of
media the cloud can be your best friend
or a terrible enemy streaming media
while generally quite convenient is a
data hog just a few hours of streaming
Spotify Pandora or even Google music can
eat up several hundred megabytes of data
through some of those streaming services
however you can download some of your
favorite tracks to play locally Spotify
for example allows premium users to
create and save playlists to their
device for offline listening downloading
these just one time especially if you do
it over Wi-Fi can save you quite a bit
of data the same can be said of purchase
music from google music or itunes this
can usually be done with videos too with
YouTube on Android you have the ability
to preload your subscriptions and watch
later videos while on Wi-Fi movies or
television episodes you purchased from
Google Play can be downloaded to your
Android devices for offline viewing or
the same for television episodes and
movies purchased from iTunes on your I
devices podcasts videos and music can
easily account for the majority of your
data consumption so any way you can curb
your streaming consumption the better or
of course just rely on Wi-Fi when you
can if all else fails you might want to
consider upgrading your data plan to a
larger one sure that means your bill
will cost more than it does now but
chances are if you keep exceeding your
cap you can more than likely get more
data for the same amount of money you
pay for each overage if you're going
over your cap each time anyway you might
as well make the best of the extra money
so that's all we've got for you this
time if you like the video be sure to
give it a thumbs up below and subscribe
