galaxy s5 comparison you'll remember
that for a huge swath of the US
Samsung's Galaxy S line is the de facto
iPhone alternative in most ways that
matter these smartphones are as
different as can be
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow in
this comparison is brought to you by
Squarespace
join me for Apple iPhone 6 vs samsung
galaxy s5 the differences here start the
first time you wake these phones from
standby both give you the ability to
unlock with a fingerprint but Apple has
had two generations to refine touch ID
which is much smoother less awkward and
more reliable than Samsung's swipe
method this will become something of a
theme by the way both phones are highly
evolved versions of an older design but
something they have in common is that
neither is my favorite incarnation of
its respective family the galaxy s5
feels at best typical and at worst
chintzy with its plastic housing and
fake metal paint job while the iPhone
tries and I think fails to blend form
and function with these awkward antenna
inlays the iPhone feels much more
luxuriant though with its blended glass
and curved metal and if you're looking
for a phone that feels like it costs
hundreds of dollars the Apple product is
as usual the winner that's at least
partially because the Galaxy s5 has to
accommodate so many more features than
the iPhone their relative worth will
depend on your own priorities but even a
partial list demonstrates the
differences in strategy here samsung
adds features first and asks questions
later Samsung's obsession with tweak
ability gives its display at least one
really useful improvement being able to
ratchet down the brightness to just a
few nits is immensely helpful if you
read in bed or sneak the occasional text
at the movies elsewhere the difference
is hue to the more traditional divides
between AMOLED and LCD AMOLED features
deeper blacks and more vibrant color but
the s5 screen takes on a greenish cast
next to the iPhones bluish display and
the Samsung is not as readable in direct
sunlight
the galaxy screen is also slightly
larger it's higher in resolution and
everything on it is driven by a set of
guts
that's markedly different let's talk
software here again you can do more on
the galaxy thanks to androids
extensibility and customizability my
favorite example is multi window which
lets you run more than one app side by
side on the Samsung but there's also
lesser-known stuff like the toolbox a
floating orb full of custom app
shortcuts and some options for
controlling the phone via motion or
without even touching it but not all of
the Galaxy s5s features are fully cooked
or frankly useful and in exchange you're
forced to put up with a lot of cruft and
other underwhelming bits of software the
iPhone is no stranger to bundled
software of questionable usefulness but
that's the exception
most of what Apple throws in here is
very powerful from iMovie and GarageBand
for creatives to Pages Numbers and
Keynote for work time the company has
also addressed many of my old complaints
about iOS the back button being in the
upper left of most apps still makes no
sense but with the reach ability feature
it doesn't matter as much now the
Notification Center and task switcher
are more useful in streamlined than
they've ever been and control centers
system shortcuts being anchored at the
bottom of the screen makes so much more
sense than reaching up to the
notification shade on Android every time
you want to do something but as they say
you can dress a robot like a woman but
you can't make him dance I don't know
what that means nobody says that but
what I'm trying to say is that no matter
how much inspiration iOS 8 has drawn
from Android they're still fundamentally
different androids where you go if you
want extreme customization at the
expense of a consistent user experience
the iPhone is where you go if you care
more about moment-to-moment performance
which on the iPhone 6 is to quote my own
notes just stupid awesome to employ an
overused metaphor
it's beyond buttery also the fact that
you can get almost the entirety of
Google's ecosystem on the iPhone these
days is a huge
Plus with double the resolution and
roughly eleventy billion times as many
options you'd think the galaxy s5s
camera would spank the iPhones and
sometimes you'd be right if you like
vibrant color the galaxy s5 is the
camera for you again we saw some of this
on our moto x versus galaxy s5
comparison so it's no surprise but the
supersaturated Samsung colors are still
breathtaking there are some things that
Samsung just does better the higher
resolution of the galaxy sensor means
far away objects are more zoomable and
while apples HDR effect is admirable for
its subtlety samsung's more aggressive
treatment is once again more gobsmacking
you can also get closer to a subject
with the galaxy and the wide format of
samsung's image sensor means you can
pack more into a scene in full
resolution which I prefer to apples more
squared off framing Apple comes out on
top in other areas low-light photos in
particular are substantially better on
the iPhone mainly because it's much
easier to get focus on the iPhone in the
dark than it is in the galaxy
an in video mode focus doesn't drift
nearly as much on the iPhone and it's
quicker to correct to find light the
iPhone handles exposure extremes more
elegantly and delivers a more stable
picture it's more susceptible to lens
flare too but being a JJ Abrams fan I
don't care gaming alacrity tends to be
very similar across flagship phones
these days and frankly it's been a long
time since I gave one single frak about
benchmark scores so performance for my
purposes means day to day usability and
here the iPhone owns not that the s5 is
a laggy mess or anything it's not but
there are enough regular stumbles to
make for a frustrating experience over
time not so on the iPhone at least not
until you get closer to the two-year
mark this is a brand new iPhone 6 and a
freshly restored galaxy s5 and from
swiping to app launch times and Beyond
the iPhone is consistently the more
sprightly
the more confident ring up a friend on
the old blower and the iPhone keeps on
winning at least in speakerphone mode
the bottom mounted speaker on the iPhone
is both louder and clearer than the aft
firing unit on the s5 and of course
having the might of the entire iTunes
library at your beck and call is very
nice if you're not a cloud type person
you
switch over to the earpiece and while
the iPhone continues to sound great to
me callers tell me the s5 actually
delivers the brighter sound here with
better noise cancellation to boot
Samsung has never been a leader in this
arena so the result is frankly
surprising but there it is as for which
one will hang longer on a road trip
where you've forgotten your charger well
it ain't the iPhone don't get me wrong
apples battery life seems quite good but
Samsung offers both an ultra power
saving mode and a replaceable battery
we'll have more endurance data in our
full iPhone 6 review coming later in the
week generally though Samsung's
adaptability gives it the win here and
the Galaxy will always get the win if
you're confining your criteria to
customization think of the s5 as a hot
rod that requires some work to keep
running but which gives you many more
options in return that extends even to
letting you reskin the entire software
experience with an app like themer or
two adding more hardware storage via
microSD and don't forget you can drop
this hot rod in a river with no ill
effects but with its plastic build and
generic looks the galaxy s5 doesn't
really feel to me like a high-end
smartphone the iPhone 6 with the
exception of its questionable piping
around back does picking up the iPhone
feels like holding a museum piece you
shouldn't be allowed to touch
it's almost unbelievably well made in
the software
despite being more confining than I like
expertly echoes that which one you
choose will depend on your needs and
your own priorities as always for those
of you who'd like to know what I would
choose as someone who really appreciates
craftsmanship and attention to detail
I'd personally choose the iPhone here
which is something I haven't said about
any iPhone in a long time despite the
feature Gulf I genuinely find Apple's
product to be the better smartphone is
Samsung capable of delivering a
similarly compelling total package
