pakka calm and this is the software tour
of the motorola cliq 2 on t-mobile's
network so let's get started so the
motorola cliq 2 is running android 2.2
along with a motoblur user interface and
some people dislike the motoblur some
people like it I'm pretty impartial
either way it is nice to be able to
update your facebook status but at the
same time some of the widgets are rather
annoying so we can view the live
wallpaper that come with the device and
it doesn't come with anything too
spectacular it's just the generic
android live wallpapers that come with
most things it does come with this grass
live wallpaper and it changes during the
time of the day but let's see let me go
back home real quick but it doesn't move
or anything all it does is you can
scroll from side to side and the grass
changes so we can go into the
applications the first thing we have is
a 3g mobile hotspot unfortunately this
device does not have the hspa+ bands or
hardware that's allow you to get on to
the super high-speed on t-mobile's
network with their 4g speeds that they
claim to have so we can just click on
that it looks almost like the exact same
as the android 2.2 3g hotspot so go back
can go to our molar accounts we can go
to alarm and timer amazon mp3 app pack
which is patience that allows you to
download those for free audio post cards
you can send an audio photo and we have
a blockbuster application that comes on
the device this program allows you to
download movies directly from the
blockbusters site unfortunately i don't
have an account so we can either
activate it later and it allows you to
download and you don't have to have a
monthly subscription fee so you can play
the movies and you can either rent them
or buy them directly to your device so
just go home and go back and we have our
browser our calculator calendar
camcorder camera the camera is okay it's
a 5 megapixel and the hardware is pretty
good we do have some neat effects let's
see here we can change some effects
can go over and you can't really see
anything right now but but they're
pretty neat also pretty generic let's
just go back to some other applications
we have our car dock which allows you to
use your device in the car but make sure
that you do that responsibly it makes it
a little bit easier to call on a headset
or whatnot and you can also get a voice
searching add some apps and all that
great stuff so close this and we'll go
back and we have our contacts our diet
allows you to play media over a Wi-Fi
connection so if you have a media server
set up you can play that so let's say
why don't you play something I'll to do
is select my dl and AAA server on my
wireless network and i can begin playing
video audio pictures all that great
stuff you can just exit out of there and
go back we have our email which is the
other one besides the gmail event
reminder which ties into your facebook
account and whatnot and it also works
with a motoblur account we have our
files this allows us to view our files
on our server so it's kind of similar to
the DLNA except you can view all
different types of files like text files
and anything that you can probably think
of us we can go back we have our gallery
gmail google search IM which ties into
your four major I instant messaging
accounts we have our amazon kindle with
lodges to read books on our device
Google Latitude managed SIM cards you
can import your sim contacts Maps market
media share which is sort of like the
DLNA and allows you to share media from
this device to other computers and
whatnot on your network so we have
messaging music my account which is your
tmobile account my device which pretty
much just downloads an app to get your
account we have navigation news is
integrated into the motoblur news and
weather which is the android version our
phone portal which allows us to sync
either wise wirelessly or through a
wired connection so we can share files
we have Google Places quick office which
is a sort of a Microsoft Office clone
that allows you to do documentation and
stuff settings slacker radio is just
come with slacker radio built in that
allows you to play internet radio on
your device we have social networking
which ties into the motoblur account as
well i downloaded speed test because i
was checking the speed google talk we
have task manager tasks TeleNav GPS
navigation but that does cost a set
amount per month we have text messaging
voice command
voice search and voice mails now this
thing is pretty cool because it does
download ok so the keyboard does work
very well let's then I want to type
something like a text message the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog so it
does type very well of course it is a
little bit difficult on underneath a
tripod while being filmed so as you can
see it does work very well and the keys
feel really nice in hand it's a nice
because they're raised the raised keys
but they're also space in the exact
position that it makes sense to have on
a small keyboard like this visual and
voicemails which you don't have to dial
a number to get your voicemail is all
you do is hit a play button and it plays
what's up Wi-Fi calling but be aware
that that does use minutes on your
account even if you are calling through
a Wi-Fi connection so it's kind of weird
and we also have YouTube so this has
been the software tour of the motorola
cliq 2 and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
leave some comments down below and in
case you missed it you can view the
unboxing about right here in the
hardware tour right here and the full
review is coming up next thanks for
