medicom and this is another episode of
the iOS app picks in which review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it pump is a free application
avail in the app store the lecture to
send applications contact information
photos music calendars and social
network information to other users with
either an iPhone or an Android device
and with an android device you can
always send certain things so if i want
i can send a photo and will just choose
something pretty so now i have to do is
bump the two devices together and they
will connect and i can click yes on both
of them and it will send the image to
the other device automatically like that
addicting games is a free application of
elemak store that has many different
games that are very addicting let me
tell you so here we let's play the
sprite can and reloaded so we'll just
play this game so the options of games
to use our cannon and shoot these other
bricks on the side we don't need to hit
the brown brick what we want to do is
knock them off or either destroy them so
let me just try to hit this one there we
go okay so we're able to do that and a
certain number of moves if we move too
many times we lose a lot of money so now
we can either upgrade our weapons
directly from here or we can just go
back done and we can move on to the next
level Ridley's there's a free
application of it on the app store the
less you to scan barcodes QR codes and
other codes you have a bar code that I
can just scan and it will just take one
second or so okay so there its founding
barcode and now it will search for this
item online and I can also view local
prices of this item so let's say I want
to find something online that looks as
though newegg has it for seven bucks so
the local price has it for about 15 for
the lowest and a lot of places will even
match online prices nowadays I trail
maps is a light and paper application on
App Store that will show you practically
every single snowboard and skiing resort
in the world and will show you their
maps so here it can be one of the maps
of a local ski resort and as you can see
i can either zoom in or zoom out the
paid version gives you 3d views so we
can also go back and do one of our other
maps if we like so we can go here and we
can see the most treacherous i guess
skiing areas and it looks
though there's a double diamond right
there and there's a few more over here
tunewiki is a free application of
element app store that allows you didn't
find music IDs you can also view the
lyrics of any of your songs or any of
that I've already been submitted and you
can also submit the lyrics yourself if
you like so here we can go to my music
so now we can view the lyrics of this
song directly from here and they will
scroll when the lyrics come across as
they've been sung so here we can beauty
lyrics and they will scroll across when
the song has been started to be some and
from here we can get side ease we can
play some games and also search for
lyrics that we like so this is the
another episode of the iOS app picks and
