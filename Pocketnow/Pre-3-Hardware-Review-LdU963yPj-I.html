pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to talk about the hardware on the HP pre
three the best webOS smartphone that you
can buy right now let's get to it
so again as you know the pre three is
the last smartphone HP is going to make
with webOS that doesn't mean that there
won't be any more webOS devices out
there it just means that HP is not going
to be making them and it's the best
smartphone yet to run webOS it's got a
1.4 gigahertz clock on Snapdragon single
core processor I wish it were doing four
we've got 512 megabytes of RAM we've got
a 3.6 inch larger screen
finally WVGA they didn't push a well
beyond that just keeping with sort of
that high inspect of 800 down by 480
across which is much better than all
previous webOS devices which were only
hvga were even less in the case of the
beer the design is relatively boring
actually it's it looks just like a pre -
just a little taller it even looks a
little bit like the pre plus so there's
sort of the family of devices you know
it's a pre which is kind of a problem
the original pre came out in 2009 and
the pre 3 just looks like a
stretched-out
pre and so at that point you start
thinking well this device could really
use a refresh but they didn't do that
with the pre 3 they kept it with the
same design and if we go next to the the
vir 4G on AT&amp;amp;T they're almost identical
here except the ones much bigger than
the other now what they did with the pre
3 because the device is larger is that
they could make the keyboard better or
or bigger and it'll turn off the screen
we're going to talk about how the 8 the
WVGA resolution impacts webOS because we
haven't yet seen WVGA on a webOS device
so if we compare the keyboard on the pre
3 with the veer there's no contest you
could probably fit to veer keyboards in
the pre 3 and chase needs to be snapped
there if we compare it to the pre 2
you'll notice that even then the keys
are smaller so you get the best keyboard
biggest keyboard on the pre three which
really makes for a great typing
experience there is a good amount of
tactile feedback it makes kind of a
clicky sound it's a pretty good keyboard
but there still is no on-screen keyboard
in this version of webOS it's 2.2 so if
you want to tap out a quick email or
text message without sliding open the
slider you can't do that yet alright so
let's move around the device here okay
so starting off up here we've got the
yes the speaker there to the right
that's not a front-facing camera it's a
light sensor you also have a proximity
sensor up here we've got this 3.6 inch
capacitive multi-touch display again
it's WVGA resolution that's 800 down by
480 across down here on the bottom we've
got the little capacitive button there
that will also serve as a notification
if you have a new email or whatnot if we
flip over to the side we get a soft
touch of rubber stop soft touch plastic
actually covering the sides and the back
which makes it feel sturdy in hand have
a volume rocker adored and chrome on the
left side nothing on the bottom there is
the charging port for the micro USB of
course this is touchstone compatible if
you like to get your inductive charging
on and then on the top here in the upper
right corner same location is all webOS
devices power standby and of course from
the days of the trio the palm days we
have the quick way to silence the the
ringer there now over on the back like
the pretty - we do have a flash with the
camera this time it's been bumped to 5
megapixels we have a speaker on the
bottom and a nice HP logo interestingly
the pre - even though it came after the
HP acquisition had the palm logo on the
back so now they're full HP but again it
doesn't really matter because they're
not going to be making anymore webOS
hardware we can pop off the back battery
cover and see what we've got underneath
we've got a SIM card slot of course now
this particular model this is the UK
model has the band's necessary to do 3G
in the US on AT&amp;amp;T
when we did the unboxing we didn't
realise that but if you import this
phone if you really want the pre 3 you
can put in your AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and boom
you've got 3G so it can pop out the
battery here and take a look at the
capacity
it is twelve hundred and thirty million
powers will do further tests on battery
like to determine how good the battery
life is now that they've got a larger
screen to power on the pre three and
you're not going to find a microSD slot
the pre three has eight gigabytes of
built-in storage really not enough these
days but certainly is for some people
who don't put that many apps and that
many pictures on their device it will be
enough so pop back in the battery but
the battery cover back on so there
aren't any surprises with the hardware
on the HP pre three it is what you've
come to expect from from webOS or from
HP and that's kind of one of the
problems with it
with the whole platform in general
they're they they don't exceed
expectations ever since poem came out
with the product in 2009 it hasn't
involved that much beyond what it is
today
which is a big problem webOS needs a
company that can iterate faster that can
come out with hardware that doesn't just
sort of meet the the specifications of a
device six months ago but exceeds what
we think is possible right now when it's
released this device was first talked
about at CES or a little bit around that
time and by the time it came out in the
summer of 2011 it's just not interesting
anymore and that's sort of one of the
problems with the pre three which isn't
to say it's a bad phone if you want to
get one for yourself you can get one at
cloak topcoat UK stocks are dwindling
prices are actually going down they
started off around 500 bucks and now
they're in the 400s and again this is
the unlocked version UK version that
happens to work on a TN t--'s 3G network
if you want a pre three so leave us a
comment let us know what you think about
the free three are you going to get one
or is this totally off your radar and if
you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and of course thank you for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
