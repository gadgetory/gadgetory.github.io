continued to grow with the whole Apple
battery issue leaked images show us what
to expect for the possible Alcatel
flagship and it seems executives of
Apple music we're already starting to
hit the road
I'm Jaime Rivera and well I'm packing
for CES we're gonna be there next week
it's gonna be crazy but we would love to
hear your predictions in the comments
this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with
interesting developments if you remember
when Apple acquired beats by dre that
included dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine and
well Jimmy has just announced pretty
much to a certain degree that he's
leaving the company apparently by August
the reasons why are sadly not being
shared but we assume it's because well
Spotify has 70 million paid subscribers
and Apple music is still struggling now
it's talked about Samsung the company
has patented something very interesting
it seems like a regular watch trap for
the future gear s4 but as it turns out
there is more to it it seems that there
is a fingerprint scanner somehow not
exactly sure how that's going to happen
or if that's really gonna be in the band
or in the watch display but whatever
that will be fingerprint scanner on a
watch would be interesting as well the
spotlight over to Alcatel as we've got
some leaked images of an Alcatel 5
flagship and well the design is very
gold and it's got very little bezels at
the bottom we can't wait to see exactly
what this design is going to turn out to
be and hopefully CES will be the show
for now let's talk about HP we rarely
talk about HP here in the daily because
it's usually not focused on mobile but
we hear that the company is recalling
50000 computers over issues with
batteries and apparently we're talking
about very delicate aka galaxy note 7
type of issues so I would recommend you
follow the link in the description learn
more if you're using an HP computer and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with Apple the iPhone believe
it or not lawsuits continue for those of
you wondering exactly what's gonna go on
as it turns out we already heard that
Apple's gonna lose millions of dollars
and not gonna sell millions of iPhones
as a result of what's happening but even
more interesting there are 26 lawsuits
and the lawsuits are not necessarily
over the batteries but over the fact
that Apple has throttled the capacity
and the performance of iPhones without
letting no consumers and yeah I think
they've got a point but it leads me to
the question today I mean honestly I
haven't noticed those slowdowns just on
iPhones I've noticed that on pretty much
every other smartphone out there so
you know the question should be should
Apple be the only company that pays or
do you believe that every company should
be held up to higher standards in my
case I think that it's a global thing
and I'm liking the fact that this has
opened the eyes of consumers but leave
us a comment down below we would love to
know your opinion friends if you want to
get the news earlier follow us I'm
talking about comment subscribe to our
