didn't push the boundaries if thin and
light some of you may mark these efforts
but that doesn't change the fact that
the best-selling smartphones in the
world today keep getting thinner and
lighter i'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter with
pocket now and let's compare the
thinnest of the crowd
this is Oppo r5 versus iPhone 6
we have to state the obvious then yes
the Oppo r5 looks like a squashed iPhone
5s but it's not until you actually use
these phones side by side that you get
to notice just how different they are
both devices feel great in the hand but
believe it or not the Oppo r5 is
significantly thinner than the iPhone 6
by almost 2 millimeters even though the
camera hump is not going to help them
the smooth curves of the iPhone 6 give
it a smoother feel but the polish
Shaffers of the Oppo r5 do it almost the
same justice even so the r5 can tend to
feel massive since it's 10 millimeters
taller 7 millimeters wider and almost
the full ounce heavier than the iPhone 6
you could even say that this comparison
would have been more suited for the
iPhone 6 plus and not the iPhone 6 BR 5
sports a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED display
compared to the 4.7 inch 750 P iPhone 6
display which is IPs both displays are
gorgeous and very accurate but the Oppo
r5 display can tend to be more dazzling
at some cases and scenarios internals
are significantly different though and
where it would be pointless to compare
them what matters most to you is that
the r5 has a slightly bigger battery at
2,000 milliamp hours you can fully
charge that battery in less than an hour
with its rapid charger in the case of
the iPhone 6 you don't have this
technology but you do have more storage
options and an extra color option and
that could be important to some of you
as the r5 only includes 16 gigs of
non-expandable storage where things are
completely different is in the software
the Oppo r5 is powered by its color OS
2.0 point 1 on top of Android 4.4.4 and
the iPhone 6 is running iOS 8.1 to color
OS is similar to iOS and that there is
no app tray and where every application
you install goes to endless home screens
but it's different in that it resembles
the old days of iOS with its
skeuomorphic UI where color OS values
variety by giving you an insane amount
of customization through free
downloadable themes wallpapers widgets
camera mode
etc iOS is bare-bones in pretty much
every way some of these extras from
color OS or gimmicks like drawing
shortcuts to services as you slide from
the bottom but some of these like the
camera modes are actually really cool
sadly it's not until you actually use
each device side-by-side that you learn
to value what's important see the
biggest problem with this particular
version of color OS is that it can
really bark down the phone with
extensive use and where iOS clearly
seems to be something that was made for
the hardware that's pushing it we
actually contacted Oppo and they are
soon to release a software update to fix
some of the crashing issues that I have
with a launcher and in the case of iOS
there is no exception here either you
remember some brick the iPhones with a
recent update in the past if you're
worried about either device burning your
hand while pushing some graphics don't
I've really never ran into cases where
the iPhone 6 becomes uncomfortable and
even though you do notice that the R 5
heats up a bit because it's thinner you
know Apple was really smarting for some
reason the heating is at the top of the
phone and therefore you never really
feel it in your hand until you reach out
to it and even so it's not really
something we call uncomfortable battery
life on both phones is comparable as
well both devices have gotten me through
the day on a single charge but I have to
give a hand to the Oppo r5 with its
rapid charger I've gone from 20 to 90%
in charge in less than 20 minutes at
times and that is just unbeatable the
iPhone 6 is really fast to charge as
well but not compared to opposed book
rapid technology it's just night and day
where things get interesting is with
phone calls you'll notice that there is
no speaker on the r5 and that's because
Oppo uses the earpiece as a front firing
speaker and it's just this loud as the
bottom firing unit on the iPhone 6 over
regular calls people couldn't tell the
difference between one phone or the
other and the same could be said about
the speaker phone camera performance is
where things get tricky the r5 sports a
bigger 13 megapixel count than the 8
megapixel on the iPhone 6 camera
and you also have a better selfie camera
with the five megapixel shooter and 85
degree angle lens on the r5 compared to
the iPhone 6 that being said the r5 also
gives you a ton of additional shooting
modes that really make this camera
useful like super macro for example but
in real world use the iPhone 6 is more
accurate and faster at taking photos in
the r5 even launching the camera
application is much faster on the iPhone
but again that could be due to the
software bugs and the same can be said
with video both devices shoot really
good video but the iPhone 6 has an extra
kick and in the case of the iPhone 6 you
do end up enjoying the time-lapse mode a
lot more and you really don't get those
options with the r5 in addition to
better slow motion options on the iPhone
6 as well I guess it's best to end this
comparison with a very interesting
reality of Android users rarely would
you ever hear an Android users say they
don't like the iPhone 4 it's hardware
what they don't like is the operating
system and if you're one of them then
the r5 is definitely your best chance at
getting some premium hardware that's
running your favorite operating system
if you value variety customizability
elegance and you want to save an extra
hundred dollars on the price tag then
the Oppo r5 is your best pick if you
value reliability and elegance at a
steeper price tag then hey the iPhone 6
is your best pick as well we've got more
coverage of the Oppo r5 coming very soon
