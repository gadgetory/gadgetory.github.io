SmartWatch to come to Windows Phone and
to be honest I'm a bit dismayed that
Microsoft opted for a me to fitness band
as its first big push in this arena but
as I said on today's PocketNow weekly
podcast I just can't resist the siren
song of a Windows wearable whatever form
it takes I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is an unboxing and
first look at the Microsoft band so for
199 plus tax this is what you get along
with the watch Microsoft throws in a
free screen protector and a $5 Starbucks
gift card to use with the band as well
as a free month of RunKeeper
elite all in all a nice launch day
promotion taking the band out of the box
for the first time initially I think it
has some purple trim which might be very
nice but now it's just a remove before
flight tag the device is all black and
only black the only other items in the
box are a Quick Start Guide and legal
paperwork and a USB cable with a special
connector the band needs to be plugged
in first to activate and snapping the
cable on reveals a strong magnetic
attraction much more substantial than
say on the pebble and once I plug it
into the Lumia 2520 we've been using as
a background the band wakes right up the
first thing it does upon startup is
search for a phone running the band app
it's a good thing it provides a download
link because I can't find the app in the
Windows Store at the moment and by the
way we're setting it up on a Windows
Phone but it is compatible with iPhone
and Android devices as well just like
any fitness tracker the Microsoft health
app makes you enter in your vitals there
are a few bugs in this process but I
guess those should be expected on launch
day the rest of the setup is fairly
straightforward
similar to what you'd find with any
other Bluetooth accessory the health app
itself we can go into another time in
detail but in several respects it seems
quite similar to most other fitness
applications on the market what we're
really here to see of course is the band
itself the wearables interface is about
exactly what you'd expect from a Windows
powered SmartWatch it's very clean very
sleek and very minimal
the homescreen is referred to as the
meat aisle just like on Windows Phone
with just the time and the step counter
and you can also swipe to the right to
reveal a small notification tray showing
Bluetooth power and sensor status there
are only two buttons on the whole device
and pressing one of them
the smaller action button cycles through
calories burn steps taken time and date
and so on
swiping to the left reveals a slew of
other tiles allowing you to do
everything from checking your calendar
appointments to keeping tabs on
notifications like text emails and phone
calls into a degree you can handle those
notifications right from the band
Cortana is here as well pressing her
tile gets you to a landing page with
current events headlines and so on and
pressing and holding the action button
gives you access to the voice interface
don't ask her what's up or you'll get
burned by her snarky wit so what's it
feel like to strap on the little device
well in short not so little unlike this
felt gear fit or the Fitbit the band is
a big honkin bracelet it's meant to be
worn on the inside of the wrist so you
can read it's widescreen display and
there's no provision that I can find for
rotating that display or getting it to
power on by motion you have to press the
power standby button every time you want
it to wake up the cluster containing the
heart rate sensor and clever fastening
mechanism is on the other side and
that's where you get your haptic
vibrations from as well which is kind of
funky even cinched tightly the band
sticks out far enough to be quite
pronounced on my wrist and it gets
annoying
in some situations we're taking a longer
look at the band in the days and weeks
ahead and we'll have more defined
thoughts in our full review for now well
the title says first impressions so
here's mine the industrial design
doesn't look like anything special and
to be honest the band doesn't feel like
anything special either when the second
generation comes out this is going to
look well even more 1.0 than it does
today
weird to think that this device comes
from the same people who brought us
beautiful products like the surface pro
3
the continuous heart rate monitoring is
very cool the split battery technology
is a compelling use of space and having
Cortana on my wrist is just plain geek
heaven further for Windows phone owners
this is for now the only SmartWatch
option and as such I'm sure there are
plenty of things we'll all grow to love
for anyone on Android or iOS looking for
a connected wearable though well as I
say wait for the full review but my
initial take is that there are much
better ways to spend $200 let us know
