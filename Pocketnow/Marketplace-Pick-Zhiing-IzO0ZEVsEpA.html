pocket calm and if you ever need help
getting directions to either a friend or
family member pretty much anyone in that
instance you can use a little program
called zing and what it does is it
actually allows you to send a zing to a
friend or family or whoever your
location and it will send them a map and
directions through whichever mapping
program you have installed on your
device so the first thing I'm gonna do
is to go into settings and here's where
you're going to designate your screen
name so it can be up to 12 characters
long and go next and this is where you
can input your phone number and you can
also select if you want to use aim while
roaming we'll go next again and if you
want the program to update your location
you can select it here so you can have
anywhere from one minute all the way up
to 60 minutes you can set the timeout
for your GPS fix so I have it set for 60
seconds and you can also change the GPS
hardware settings so most likely it's on
GPS managed by Windows is just probably
the default but if your device is a
little bit different you can set it
manually so okay and next again so
here's where you can integrate the
program with your social network so you
can either use livejournal blog or
tumblr or Twitter and I it set to
Twitter because that's the one I use
most often so click Next again and
here's where you can set your alert
settings so if you want to be alerted of
an oozing you can just select this and
let's see i'm just going to hit classic
and save received locations and now
click Next and here's where you're going
to actually assign your mapping program
so i have it set to google maps but if
you don't have a mapping program you can
actually install one here so let's click
finish so now if I want to send a zing
to one of my friends but I'm actually
gonna send it to myself all I have to do
is click send to sing so here's where I
can either type in a phone number or an
email address but I'm just going to go
into menu add recipient scroll down till
I find myself and then just hit subject
if I want to subject or i can use this
and i'm just going to put tests on here
and send and now it will connect to the
zing network and find my location okay
so now that the new zing has come in as
you can see it went to my inbox and i
can just click on this and if i want to
see myself on the map all I have to just
click
show on map and it will launch Google
Maps and showing my location and that
little alarm is just indicating that
I've got news in so I can just click out
of this program and this is another
marketplace pick where we demonstrated
zing version 1.2 and the application is
actually free on Windows mold
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
