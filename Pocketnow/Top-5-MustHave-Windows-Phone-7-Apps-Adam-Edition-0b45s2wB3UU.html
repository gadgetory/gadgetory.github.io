i'm going to show you my five favorite
must have applications on windows phone
7 so let's check them out first off i'm
going to skip you know all the built-in
apps like zoom and one note that you
know everybody has already also skip
facebook mo tweets or Twitter Foursquare
of course will skip so here's something
obscure that I really like this is this
one is really important it's called a
while ago so this is a great place to
store all sorts of information like
website passwords vehicle information
insurance card information credit card
passwords and it's 256-bit encryption so
so it's really going to stay secure and
this a while ago has a nice pc companion
called a while ago where you can backup
and restore your file to the cloud and
restore on pc it doesn't do a real sink
like other ewallet programs have in the
past but i can back it up to dropbox or
google docs and then go on my pc and
restore it to the pc or vice versa from
a pc i can back it up to google docs and
then restore it from here so it's kind
of like a manual sync but it's a nice
way to keep all your password protected
information in one place and accessible
from the mobile device so that's one
that i really like next step opentable
this is a really cool app for finding
local restaurants and seen you know
which which ones have tables available
for you to go you know eat so here you
got the first screen find a table and
right over there you can see tonight for
two there's a reservation available
eight at Benjamin steak house and we can
scroll through and really easily see
local places nearby and what time they
have a reservation is available so that
i don't really like this lab you can
also log in and save some favorites so
here's one of my favorite restaurants
and it's going to load some review
information when here's our profile it's
a little slow first and I can add it as
a favorite here I already have it as a
favorite you can see reviews pretty good
scores there can get a map in directions
and we can look four times
obviously this is already booked for
tonight and pretty much month in advance
or so so we're not going to get there
tonight so I like that one a lot next
and this is kind of silly but I really
like the insider app and I'll show you
why really it's just for beginners over
here we got tutorials you can learn how
to use different things and you got tips
not really useful those things but the
thing that I find useful is the
wallpapers so every day this is updated
with a new beam wallpaper image so if
you really like these pictures you can
easily download one and then I can put
it on my lock screen I go to it
so there
I have a new lock screen image and it's
pretty nice so I really like that
application next must add app for me is
IMDb hang out in New York City you're
probably going to meet some of actors
and actresses so and you're probably
going to want to go to a movie once in a
while so this one has lots of
information about that you can see
showtimes for these movies this is a new
one and you can scroll that's news oops
notice search for somebody we like
maybe you're wondering did I type that
curtain
we are wondering what movies or TV shows
this person was in now this is normal
dinner conversation that you're you're
going to want to confirm and we can see
pictures of this person this is really
really nice
okay really cool app and lastly you got
to have something fun elow mellow is a
must-have game on windows phone 7 this
is an xbox live game fully 3d and we
tilt it in the background changes
any object is to get both friends to
meet up with each other there's usually
a puzzle this one is the last one it's
really easy so it's not going to be that
difficult and it's not going to take
long this is the one where you finish
the game and you can flick rotate in 3d
you see tilting the screen moves it
around a little bit
and now they're going to fly away so
that's ruined my favorite game on one to
spawn seven that's really really nice
anyway that's my five favorite windows
phone 7 apps hope you enjoyed this video
give us a thumbs up if you liked it
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
