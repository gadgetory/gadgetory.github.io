and we are comparing the Samsung Galaxy
K zoom with the Nokia Lumia 1020
both of these are contenders to the best
camera phone title you got a twenty
point seven megapixel shooter with ten
times optical zoom on the came zoom and
the 41 megapixel camera on the Lumia
1020 without any optical zoom but what a
huge sensor and we've got optical image
stabilization on both so we're going to
just ban around here just to see how
they adjust exposure and white balance
and we're going to start walking down
this riverbank and see how the optical
image stabilization kicks in and copes
with everything and let's get in for a
close-up just to see how Focus copes
and
now here in the grass and back up and
we're going to try to zoom in on a
distant object using both cameras which
is going to be tricky because we got
buttons to do that
on the K zoom we have to use the screen
so we're going to just do that on the
kasem now
and we're gonna do the same on the Lumia
1020 and doing the same on the Lumia
1020 now
there we go hey everyone this is Tony
from PocketNow and we are checking out
low-light video recording on the galaxy
k zoom and comparing it with the Lumia
1020 we are in an underground parking
this is as good as it gets in terms of
low-light because it's a bright sunny
day outside after a rain in the morning
and we're just going to pan around here
and see exactly how everything copes
there you can see the sunlight coming in
from that side and the rest is just dark
with neon lights and let's just start
walking here a little bit and moving in
for a close-up just to see how they
focus in a little light
there we go that you have a focus and
also walking a bit just to see how
optical image stabilization and
low-light performs and that's a wrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
