horrible antenna stripes finally
Samsung's processor plants might not
include sharing its crown jewel and
Facebook seems ready to bring some major
changes to mobile I'm high in memory
Venna and somebody asked me yesterday if
I was 22 years old thanks a lot this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
began with AT&amp;amp;T as the company continues
to improve its spectrum up to the point
where it just announced that reached a
major milestone with its voice over LTE
service as the company is now not only
testing it between its own phones but
apparently it's also doing it cross
carrier and doing it in particular areas
even though people don't really know
which areas or who is actually being
part of this test but yeah apparently
they are having some good results so
this should be the mainstream for 2016
other official news come from Facebook
as those of you that are bored of your
new speeds stuck with just the videos
memes and stuff like that the company is
about to actually push its new
specialized news feeds to everyone that
opted in obviously this was something
that was just being tried out a few
weeks ago and that gives you the option
to again filter more information for
your things you want to shop and stuff
like that this is just another way to
make money you know the way Facebook
works and even though Samsung's major
selling point for the galaxy s7 in
addition to keeping this year's design
is its 88-90 processor which will be
launched alongside the new Snapdragon
820 variant that they'll have but for
those of you that thought that Samsung
was going to be in the business of
selling the 88-90 it seems that it won't
apparently there is this 88 70 processor
which is built on the same architecture
but has lower Quoc speeds and that is
going to be the processor that Samsung
is going to be selling to third-party
OEMs because that's just the way sandy
can compete right and speaking of
Samsung the company is famous for its
patents particularly because some of
these actually make it to products and
pen that was filed back in June is
actually of the samsung galaxy ring I
guess that's probably gonna be the name
and if you're wondering exactly what is
the whole point that
having a wearable you know a ring we've
seen smart rings in the past and
attempts at least companies haven't
actually been able to launch any of this
but the idea here is that you tap your
ring to the display that'll give you a
special UI so you can only imagine how
many smash this place will have by these
rings let's just see what we get
and finally the very interesting news of
today have to do with the iPhone 7 as
we've got some trusted sources claiming
two things number one waterproofing
which is a almost something that
happened with the iPhone success and the
other is the fact that apparently Apple
is almost close to getting rid of the
antenna stripes apparently they'll be
able to deal with the antenna stripes by
using some composite materials which
could be some sort of an aluminium alloy
that allows this which I doubt or it
could just be that there will be a part
of the phone that will be made of
composites and allow this which is
pretty much just another antenna stripe
but then again hey it leads me to the
question of the day would you mind the
vApp will ever moved away from aluminum
on its iPhones and gave you some
different you know material in my case I
actually wouldn't I like the old iPhone
forward the glass and stainless steel
but leave us a comment down below what
would you like friends is always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was still
make sure you follow us on packing our
comment subscribe change channel as well
and follow me on Twitter hang on there's
quarterly that are on Instagram but I'm
every better this is this video a thumbs
up if you like what you saw I am hi Mary
