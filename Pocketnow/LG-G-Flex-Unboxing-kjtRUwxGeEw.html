now in a hotel room with horrible
acoustics but an awesome device on the
table this is the LG G flex we've done
some coverage on it at pocket now
already but we weren't able to do a
proper unboxing that unit was borrowed
from Negra electronics we thank them
again this unit is from LG directly and
we will be giving it the full review
treatment very shortly but first we
wanted to unbox it for you check out the
shape of the box it reflects the curve
of the G flex I would put it next to the
box for you but we're using the G flex
to shoot this unboxing video that's
enough of my drawing just enjoy that bit
of Metin s we lift the top off the box
still retailing for quite a lot of money
if you are not in South Korea the only
market this device is currently
available in there's the G flex itself
the pronounced curve we've become
familiar with check out our durability
test video if you want to see some of
pocket knives existing coverage on the
device this is just a spacer here let's
see what else is in the box
we need the hammer to come up top there
see if we can get a little bit of a yes
yes good life is good LG there's a solid
point this is a user manual probably
we're not gonna be able to read it but
it does call out a couple of the
features of the device Micro SIM etc etc
this is a wall charger this is a USB
cable not much exciting going on there
but these are the quad beat 2 headphones
which we remember I think from the LG g2
these are probably the same units no
battery in the box because the battery
is embedded a 3500 milliamp hour curved
battery which I tweeted some pictures
from the from the LG event tonight which
you can check out and a little G branded
sim removal tool so that's excellent get
this stuff out of the way the LG knowing
of our fondness for the unpeel has given
us two opportunities to do it the first
one is on the back listen close for the
fun
yeah that's cool stuff that's a
self-healing back coating there we
learned a bit about that tonight a
urethane like coating not quite actually
urethane but heels minor scratches
doesn't heal deep gouges but then few
things do screen protector up front here
a little harder to see but we can take
it from the corner here and pull it
right off this is a six inch display
720p resolution power standby key is
around back it's a couple more
protectors over those buttons and over
the camera but we're not going to deal
with them right now we'll just hold that
powered on there's our boot logo can't
tell you what the official review is
going to go live but it will go live
relatively shortly stay tuned to
PocketNow for that and drop some
comments down below
wow that's pretty loud loud speakers on
the back drop some comments down below
if you have some questions on the LG G
flex check out our existing content and
thank you for watching we'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
