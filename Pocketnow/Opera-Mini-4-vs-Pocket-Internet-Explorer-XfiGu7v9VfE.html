pocketnow.com and this is a video
comparison
Opera Mini 4 versus Pocket Internet
Explorer very curious as to how they
compare in terms of rendering a webpage
so let's take a look I've got my 18 th
tilt here and let's get in on the screen
a little closer now I've just hard reset
the device so there are no running
applications I've got no third-party
applications running on this to give you
an idea of speed and program memory
let's start off in opera to go to opera
it's actually not a standalone
application you have to run the java
application first and then select Opera
Mini now if you have it already in
program memory you don't have to do this
each time so I'm going to go to the
address bar and I'm going to go to
buy.com because I don't I know that they
don't have a mobile version of their
website so I want to see the full effect
and it asks you this every time you open
it for some reason so let's see what
happens here
it's taking some time I'm connected over
Wi-Fi right now but here it loads the
entire webpage kind of kind of like an
iPhone and you can click and drag on the
screen to see the rest of the page and
like an iPhone you can double click to
bring in you know bring the focus in on
a certain part of the page then you can
pan around and to zoom back out you
click the back button down here which is
also connected to the right soft key so
not bad that was about seven seconds or
so so let's let's get out of here okay
let's see how pocket Internet Explorer
does okay so I'm gonna go to buy comm
and I have Pocket Internet Explorer to
set to show in desktop mode so it
doesn't try to you know bring the
content down to one column which would
take an additional amount of time so
it's entered let's see how long this
takes
I'm gonna wait till this step progress
bar gets all the way to the right before
I stop counting
at about 27 seconds now and it's still
loading
there are some pages that pocket
Internet Explorer has a huge problem
loading for some reason you know I'm
sure by comm isn't made to be viewed on
a handheld device but if I'm out of bat
out and about and I want to get a price
on something well I don't want to be
waiting for this long okay it's finally
done loading out after about 35 seconds
and to view this page it's it's a bit
cumbersome so you can you can kind of
scroll around like that you can move
along the the scroll bars or you can use
the the d-pad to move around you can't
zoom out you can't zoom in I really have
no idea where the gardening section is
if I want to get to it I'm assuming it's
over on the left somewhere but I really
can't be sure
so although although opera requires you
to go into the java application which
takes a little longer to load if it's
not in program memory
it loads pages much faster and of course
it allows for better navigation there's
no question as to which of these
browsers makes it easier to view a web
page opera is definitely the winner I
just wish they would make a standalone
windows mobile application so that's all
