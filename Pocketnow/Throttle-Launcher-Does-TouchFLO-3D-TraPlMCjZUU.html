pocketnow.com and what you see on the
screen here is not touch flo 3d it's a
touch flo 3d emulator which i think is
the best that i've seen yet and it's
actually free through a program called
throttle launcher this is a skin for
throttle launcher among many others that
are available I'm going to post links on
how to get this in the description so
look out for that but for now I want to
demonstrate what this skin actually can
do it's pretty neat so I'm going to
start at this second tab and you can
drag your finger along the bottom or you
can just you know tap your finger on an
icon and this is the mail icon and right
now I have one piece of mail my inbox
well actually I have two it's telling me
and it shows you the preview it shows
you who it's from and what it's about
and now I have one email in my inbox but
if you had more than one you could flip
up and down through them with the arrows
here and you can also go and make a new
message by clicking on the new message
button right here and here will take you
into a new message next on the bottom we
have the SMS pain which is cool because
it lets you see all of your SMS right in
the screen you don't have to actually go
into the application so it says I've one
of six so i can flip through my SMS and
i can see them right here in real time
which is great and again if you want to
make a new message there's a new message
button which will open your SMS
application going over to the right we
have the calendar application and it
takes a minute to load this is still a
beta program so it has some bugs and
it's not as fast as it could be but the
but the looks like i have a message here
but the calendar application is really
really well done it shows you your next
appointment and you can click on a day
and it will bring up your calendar and
show you what you have on that day i
want to slide my finger to the right to
get to the whoops went a little too far
i want to go to the weather tab the
weather tab shows you the current
conditions where you are and if you flip
your finger to the side you get a
four-day forecast so that's really well
done and it's got a smooth animation to
the right of the weather tab we have the
music tab and I haven't gotten this
configure just right yet but you're
supposed to be able to see your album
art here it'll interface with Windows
Media Player or I think there's a few
other media players that it will work
with
going over to the right one more and
again sometimes it shoots all the way
over we want to go to this one which is
favorite people so you can kind of have
a bunch of different tiles that
associate the context that you want to
call and as with touchflo 3d if you have
a picture associated to their contact it
will place that picture there going over
to the right we have programs and again
it's loading it's a little bit slow and
these are kind of fake programs but if
you flick your finger to the right
you'll get to the actual programs on
your device and again these these
gesture-based animations are really well
done and they're really smooth and
responsive and here we are here's the
photo gallery tab and this one takes
especially a long time to load but once
it does it's a pretty good display of
your pictures and it's touch friendly so
you can scroll your finger to see the
next pain of pictures and I've only got
two panes worth of pictures here
clicking on a picture will bring it up
in the pictures and photo viewer and
next up is the wireless manager which it
gives you a nice visual representation
of all the wireless radios on your
device and you can flip them on and off
from here going over to the right we
have the internet pain which allows you
to launch specific websites and create
new pains for new website so here I've
went for Google and tapping on it will
bring open pocket Internet Explorer and
show me well obviously the Google
homepage and that's pretty much it for
the touchflo 3d skin on throttle
launcher again it's a little bit buggy
but if you like playing with new new
software and you don't mind tweaking
things because there's a lot of lot of
advanced settings in this program then
this may be something you want to try
out and of course it's free so that's a
good reason to try it in itself that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
