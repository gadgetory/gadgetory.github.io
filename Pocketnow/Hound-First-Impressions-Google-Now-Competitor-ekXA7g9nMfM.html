services like Google now Siri and
Cortana for voice commands and
personalized recommendations but now
soundhound it's trying its hand I'm hiya
to houston with pocket now and these are
our first impressions of hound so how is
a lot like google now or Siri and it
replaces Google now on your android
phone all you've got to do to launch it
is just go ahead and press on the home
button swipe up where you would normally
launch Google now and that will open
hound right up it's currently in beta
and you can only download it with an
access code or you can at least only
sign up with an access code but right
now we've got it in our hands on my HTC
One m8 and if you launch the app you can
see it just gives you a bunch of
different examples of the different
queries that you can ask it and get a
different response so you can see here
it's got something like hotels where it
says show me hotels in Seattle for this
weekend it costs less than three hundred
dollars once it gives you that answer
you can actually get some sort of
conversational responses back so if you
then add sort by the lowest price and
exclude anything below 150 it'll kind of
intelligently use the last question that
you asked it to kind of give it some
kind of some context and change the
response to fit that so where I go
through here look at some of the
examples it's got tip calculator
currency converter or translation one
thing I like down here is actually the
images where it says show me images of a
giraffe kissing its mother we'll go
ahead and run that test real quick show
me images of a giraffe kissing its
mother showing image search results for
giraffe kissing its mother so you can
see it's really quick to respond and if
I don't want to see this I can then say
what about cats showing image search
results for cats now here is where it
gets kind of interesting and you might
have already seen this in the internal
demo that sound hound already released
on YouTube but we kind of wanted to just
verify that these features were actually
working in the existing beta that's
available to the public so if we ask is
something like what's the monthly
payment on a million-dollar home
what is the down payment two hundred
thousand dollars okay using a down
payment of two hundred thousand dollars
what is the mortgage period 25 years and
the interest rate is four percent okay
using a mortgage period of 25 years and
an interest rate of four percent your
monthly mortgage payment is 4222 dot 69
cents very cool so you can see it asks a
lot of questions when you're at when
you're giving it some sort of variable
answers and questions and it basically
this is what they already did on the
internal demo but I kind of changed some
of the sum of the values in the
questions of the answer so that way we
can give it a bit of a different and
less controlled scenario there so that's
really cool that it still works in this
demo that we've got running so you can
see it's a really powerful system on
here there are a couple things that can
sort of catch it up a little bit so you
can ask it something like say who is the
director for django unchained showing
search results for who is the director
for django unchained so it doesn't
really know how to handle some questions
and you can still get the answers in the
search result so it'll say down here
like right here it says Quentin
Tarantino right here actually so you
know you can still get the answers to
the search queries that it that it gives
you back but it's not quite the same you
know it doesn't actually give you a
direct response you just kind of have to
sift through a typical Google search
like you would just you know manually
searching it yourself so not white the
same and it can be tripped up
occasionally but it does still have a
lot of potential here and it's a very
very powerful system especially for
being just a first beta and also
considering its from sound out it's not
from some major search engine or
anything like that it's it's just coming
from a sound house so it's a really
really interesting platform that I'm
really looking forward to seeing more of
what they can do here so that's going to
do it for the first impressions where I
have a little bit more coverage on this
coming soon in the meantime if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already visit us at pocket
this is ben hiya to houston for pocket
now thank you guys so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
