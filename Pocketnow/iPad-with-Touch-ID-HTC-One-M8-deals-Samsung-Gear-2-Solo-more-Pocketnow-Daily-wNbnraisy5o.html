already being built in with touch ID the
probable Samsung Galaxy gear to solo
seems to be almost confirmed and just
for tomorrow you can get yourself a
cheaper HTC One m8 I'm high metal iveta
and even though it's not cool for
smartphones to underperform the cool
thing is you get some really nice deals
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with the cool and official news is
I know a lot of you're still on the
roads trying to think if you want to get
the HTC One m8 and the time to buy us
tomorrow the phone will be a hundred
dollars off in sprint and AT&amp;amp;T even
though it's already hundred dollars off
and Verizon but it's obviously a cool
option for a smartphone that's
definitely cheaper than other offerings
that are out there that aren't as good
as the HTC One I made it almost
everything almost everything so leave us
a comment tell us a veer getting one and
ever since the launch of the nexus for
the Moto G the Moto X and other
smartphones that they're the price tag
it's clear that smartphones can get
cheaper but the question is exactly how
cheap can they get and according to arm
they built this new processor we just
based on the cortex a5 is a single core
processor but the idea is that this will
be able to power a twenty-dollar
smartphone obviously not for you twenty
dollars for the manufacturer so they can
sell it to you at an affordable price
tag and still it's probably not the most
beautiful thing in the world you'll get
h data speeds and we don't know anything
about the display but we do know that it
won't be that hot but obviously hey
twenty dollars an affordable thing it'll
obviously put things on the map and the
fact that it runs Android makes it even
cooler stay tuned for that and yes I
know a lot of you want the LG g3 me
included the g2 was probably one of my
favorite bones last year but only one of
the things that we did not like about it
was the fact that it was probably the
worst fingerprint magnet of the year
because of all the glossiness and we got
some leaked photographs courtesy of that
leaks and it shows us a brushed aluminum
back which apparently tease us to a
phone that will not be a fingerprint
magnet and apparently that's the issue
and that's the purpose of this image so
stay tuned it could be cool and probably
one of the biggest disappointments of
last year was the fact that even though
we did get touch ID on the iPhone 5s we
did not get it on the iPad
line up and we know that is because
Apple had some supply constraints we
know that the iphone 5s struggled
specifically because of such ID and we
get more rumors that points to the fact
that we are getting this on the next
generation iPad apparently the modules
have already begun being manufactured in
April mid-april so it could be that we
are getting these products by how they
seized and hopefully earlier but we
should not sure about that and finally
for the interesting news of the day we
get more confirmations that the Samsung
gear 2 solo is going to come soon and
the reason why this product is
interesting is because it is a gear too
but it doesn't need a smartphone it
actually is a SmartWatch that's capable
of doing phone calls on its own and it's
got a jack for sim card and that's it
that is your smartphone in your wrist
now obviously there must be a market out
there this is not the first time that
we've actually seen a SmartWatch that is
supposedly making phone calls we saw
this from LG so many years ago and it
really sucked but you know that means
you see the question of the day are you
interested in something like the gear to
solo this product will be priced around
three hundred sixty dollars apparently
which is reasonable but in my particular
case you know I don't know if I would
really want that for making phone calls
but then again I know that some people
only need phones for phone calls and if
you want to carry two phones it's cool
that your watch is one and then your
other is your phone but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this

talking out our comment subscribe to
youtube channel as well you also follow
