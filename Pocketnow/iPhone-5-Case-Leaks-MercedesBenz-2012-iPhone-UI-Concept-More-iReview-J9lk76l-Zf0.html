still no iphone mercedes best shows off
their iphone interface concept and SF
temper keeps ticking where's the music
event all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm hi everyone and
welcome to the pocket nail I review the
show we go through all this week school
and they're not so cool inside the world
of Apple's iOS devices let's start this
week off with the cool so far cases are
all we've got to predict what the next
generation iphone will look like we've
recently leaked some case-mate images
the probable cases for the next
generation device and they maintain that
curved back and also a larger design
other images show screen protectors that
have been leaked then yes they do have
the larger screen size and larger home
button but still some things are just
weird I mean you could look at these
images and they look so much like the
current generation ipod touch that many
of us have begun to believe that
probably Apple is just going to launch
an iphone 4 refresh with a lot better
specs probably 4G and other things and
well probably that larger device is
actually just a next generation ipod
touch that usually gets released in
September anyways for the music event so
time will tell VI a motor show is on its
way and Mercedes has just showed off
their concepts a Mercedes and they were
also nice enough to show off their 2012
plan iphone interface just slide your
phone into the dashboard and control
your phone's applications music and
other services with minimal distraction
being helped by Mercedes software kind
of cool interface if you asked me
because it actually reads email to you
so obviously you'll have minimal
distractions while driving which will
end up saving you a ticket Volkswagen
was also nice enough to show off how you
can park your car with new technology
and that technology actually includes an
iphone application that does it for you
so really good things coming to vehicles
and they all have to do with iOS well
the chronic dev team has recently been
tweeting about all their preparations to
already offer an untethered jailbreak to
iOS 5 obviously they won't leak it until
Apple releases the final version of iOS
5 just to not give Apple a heads up on
how to remove the exploits that allow it
so so far it seems that the preparations
are all go
well and well they're just waiting for
iOS 5 to be released for you to be able
to upgrade and then enjoy Cydia really
cool news though again we still don't
have dates for when iOS 5 will be
released and then obviously when the
jailbreak will be available and well I
message is still not part of everybody's
life because well it's only available to
iOS 5 beta testers and from our
experience so far it's actually really
good and rumors have it that Apple is
already working on enhancing OS 10 Lions
a probably ditch I chat in favor of
bringing an enhanced version of I
message now obviously the big difference
between i shet and I message is the fact
that you're able to do video
conferencing for more than one person so
if you compare that to facetime and
imessage there are really some
enhancements to ichat that's actually
really good news because most probably
FaceTime will eventually allow
conferences for more than one person and
then eventually obviously Apple will
most likely bitch I chat in favor of I
message and leave it just as as chat
only service that allows you to connect
with iPhones and obviously other a.m.
you know I mean services and well time
will tell rumors are still there well
what do you know before we get on over
to the National cool section have a look
at this Samson files this complaint to
the UK advertisement Standards Authority
claiming victor galaxy s2 is actually
thinner than the iphone 4 and well the
rules board ended up backfiring their
claim and filing in favor of Apple why
because well first of all the iphone 4
is currently 9.3 millimeters thin
throughout the whole body and the
samsung galaxy s is actually eight point
71 millimeters thin but in this in its
thinnest point if you go to the antenna
hump at the end it's actually 9.91
millimeter spin so obviously the iphone
4 maintains a standard you know casey
and the samsung galaxy s has this hum
that actually makes things or spoils
things now i really don't understand Sam
Samson why are they filing a complaint
well there's something that's really not
important first of all the samsung
galaxy s2 is 4g in comparison to the
iPhone 4 that still isn't so there are a
lot of really great things going in
favor of the samsung galaxy s2 for them
to actually be worried about what bones
thinner honestly
well that does it for the cool that's
considering while with the not so cool
we've already reached mid-september and
for some reason there's still no sep
tember music event announcement last
year to happen on September first and
every other year for the past five years
it still happened in September but for
some reason well the month isn't over
yet but still a lot of us are getting
bored with even more delays for the next
iOS lineup and with the yearly cycles
and a larger delay basack could actually
spoil things for Apple the competition's
actually getting fierce the fall lineup
of a lot of Android hands is and even
when those phone hansen's are really
good so the iphone 5 must really really
be a groundbreaker if it really wants to
justify this large delay hopefully
that's after they show thank you very
much for watching I'm high Meadow iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
