shows more speakers that it can handle
the latest Android and features
discovered also show as extended usage
of the Chrome browser and best buy is
really wanting to sweeten the pot with
the galaxy s7 I'm hi Mary Vera reporting
from Shanghai with no YouTube I don't
even know if I'm gonna be able to upload
this video but hey this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for the
Galaxy s7 I highly suggest you go to
best buy to buy it because well you're
getting a free 32 inch samsung TV when
you do so and if you pony up two hundred
fifty dollars more you can actually take
the 48 inch samsung smart TV it's an
incredible deal and it applies
throughout the galaxy s7 and galaxy s7
edge more details in the links in the
description and speaking of deal Samsung
wants to figure out a way to convince
you to use samsung pay we've seen the
company give money away and the deals
today also follow the fact that the
companies doing it again follow the link
in the description for more details on
how to get a twenty dollar gift card for
you to use samsung pay and you know i
don't know why people don't really want
to use it given the fact that it's just
so convenient and so practical but i
kind of get it because i don't know it's
just mobile payments are still something
that just hasn't taken off really well
and for those of you that are already
curious about what you're getting an
android and we continue to discover more
things one of them being the fact that
yeah you can do split window
multitasking but the thing we weren't
expecting is for you to actually be
doing that with the same application
meaning you can actually do it with
chrome you can have multiple tabs on one
chrome browser on one area and then open
another chrome browser on another and do
split window it is extremely convenient
apparently it only works on android
tablets but hey it makes a lot of sense
now analysts are predicting in the case
of apple's iphone 7 that dual camera is
happening the only problem is that
apparently sony which was supposed to be
the supplier is not capable of meeting
the amount of the man that Apple is
expecting so we hear that now Apple
plans to move to LG not necessarily with
the whole production but it could just
be that
s will be either played between Samsung
and LG or just LG in the dual camera
modules we will let you know as soon as
we learn more and finally the very hot
news they have to do with the iphone 7
the case makers are already leaking a
design that includes four speakers and
that's crazy it's hard to believe mainly
because Apple has been designing dual
speakers on the iphone for the longest
time and we don't really get dual
speakers it's a moto speaker and then
the other is a microphone but this time
it seems that Apple is planning to
invest into that quad speaker design
that we love from the ipad pro it makes
a lot of sense if you've never listened
to an ipad pro i highly suggest you go
to an apple store and listen to it and
if they bring that technology to the
iphone pro or iphone 7 or whatever the
case may be the company may be on to
something but it leads me to the
question of today what do you think
would you like this quad speaker design
do you feel that it could take the
iphone to a whole new level of media
consumption in my case i do believe it
can it sounds amazing on the current
products that Apple produces and we
would love to see it on the iphone but
hey leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
