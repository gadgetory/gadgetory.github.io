and users alike what our OEM is doing
they're putting in unique and
interesting ways to turn off your screen
or turn down your backlight what our
users doing some more writing apps some
of us are using those let's go take a
look
Samsung has been at the front of using a
front facing camera and other sensors
inside your device to help turn the
battery off whenever you're not looking
at it sometimes that works sometimes it
doesn't
low light in particular is a problem so
what can you do you've got all these
other sensors baked inside well this
developer came up with something a
little bit different a little bit novel
and it really works fairly well the app
is called
keep screen on it's available in a light
which is free version and a pro version
which costs about a buck and a half a
little bit less so what do you do simply
you tap the icon to launch it and you're
met with this very very basic screen
with this not very hollow UI looking
interface now you may wonder Joe why are
you holding your device up at this weird
angle like that we can see your
reflection and you look kind of silly
you know that's part of the issue or
part of the genius depending on how you
want to look at it so first of all let's
open up this test tab when you get it
you will need to turn it on just by
hitting the off button to turn on that
will light up this little green dude up
here letting you know that it is on you
can hide that with one of the settings
in here if I remember correctly let's
open up the test tab you can see now
this dude here is kind of grayed out but
when I tip him up he lights up green
when I tip him back he's grayed out and
he lights up green ok enough with that
what this is doing is it's using the
accelerometer and other stuff inside the
device to know when you're holding your
device in your hands versus when you
have laid it down flat on a table when
you've turned it or when you've laid it
flat it's going to turn off first of all
the backlight and then very shortly it's
going to turn off the screen now you saw
it just like that when I pick it back up
of course I've got to go through the
standard unlock process so I went ahead
and made sure that that doesn't happen
for 15 30 seconds after the screen
turns off you might have to do the same
thing let's look at some of the other
settings in here in basic we can start
this on boot by putting a check mark
there we can hide the icon by putting a
check now that's just gonna make that
box invisible it's still going to be
there taking up space but if you don't
like seeing the little green guy up
there you don't have to you can play
with the range come over here and make
this a little bit more or less sensitive
depending on the device and just play
around with it use what works you can
set your accuracy from normal which is
the default down lower or up higher and
then of course you can buy the pro
version which gives you a few other
options and features that we'll talk
about in the article over at
pocketnow.com how does it work well as
you can see here when I haven't messed
with this slider it's pretty accurate
when I'm holding it up tipped at my face
at a comfortable reading angle how does
the battery life respond to that not bad
it's been a little bit too short of time
for me to be able to give you a
definitive answer about whether this is
a good thing or a bad thing as far as
battery life goes but my general
impression is it seems to be saving some
battery life when I'm using it in a
standard you know reading format like
this when I'm doing non-standard stuff
they laying down or whatnot it can kind
of get wonky but you can always come in
and turn it off just like that and then
it will revert back to the default way
of turning off after next many seconds
or minutes of inactivity depending on
what you have set up the app is called
keep screen on with a capital o n
there's a light and a pro version we
just got done showing you the light
version we want to know what you think
down in the comments below give the
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw and of course who doesn't want
better battery life for pocket now this
is Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
