is called the lockdown commitment as of
now Motorola's plans if it was a
fifty-dollar smartphone seems to be on
its way and samsung is making it less
compelling for us to upgrade to KitKat
I'm hi Mary vetta and you better think
the pocket now weekly because that's the
reason why this video is going up so
late this is pocket out daily let's lay
off with some official news as those of
you interested in a wooden phone or
finally able to get the wooden variants
of the Moto X on moto maker it is now
available as of today and all the color
variants that you've seen you definitely
select whatever options you want and the
cool thing is that again it's gonna be
costing just 25 bucks extra for the
phone and not be a hundred dollars that
they were initially charging so it's
great to see that this feature is
already available we suddenly do not
know exactly how long it'll take for it
to ship to you but hey give it a try and
let us know in the comments down below
what your experiences and speaking of
Motorola the company's plans to
revolutionize the world have not ended
with the Moto X or the Moto G the
company's CEO dennis woodside just came
on record to state that actually the
reason why they got that price so low on
the Moto G was just to start they're
actually working on figuring out how to
give us a fifty-dollar smartphone that
is really something we want to see and
given the fact that KitKat was designed
to work on lesser hardware meaning the
spec race could probably be over with
this phone it's great to see that we
will probably get this as we do know if
the Nokia Lumia 520 on windows phone so
it is doable now let's talk about Apple
is one of the biggest dreams that a lot
of us have had is for the iphone to
support a bigger display and as it turns
out analysts are now predicting that
this is pretty much a lockdown thing for
the iphone 6 apparently some trusted
sources of these analysts are confirming
that Apple is working on a larger
display the promise we still don't know
exactly what it's being talked between
4.3 and 4.7 inches but hey you never
really know we've also been hearing
about a phablet but we do know that
Apple is really great at prototyping and
not necessarily launching everything the
big prototype so stay tuned this could
get interesting now let's talk about
Samson the galaxy gear and the Google
Nexus 5 and no I didn't get these right
there's a reason why these are together
you know that the galaxy gear doesn't
really work with
anything that's not a samsung galaxy
phone with android 4.3 but as it turns
out xda-developers is just figure out
how to make the galaxy gear work on the
Nexus 5 and even though the support is
not perfect links in the description for
the full procedure on what to do it's
kind of long but it is definitely worth
it as you will finally be able to get
that overpriced galaxy gear that needs a
battery charge every day with your
google nexus 5 yay and finally for the
very annoying news of the day one of the
most interesting things going back to
the whole galaxy gear issue is the fact
that sam says lately making everything
proprietary meaning that they're locking
down their ecosystem for you to only be
able to use their own accessories and
that is actually going to happen as of
now as it's being reported that android
4.4 kitkat for the galaxy note 3 will
lock down your ability to use
third-party cases meaning if you have
any third-party case with the S view
window that is not going to work on the
Galaxy Note 3 or so it seems we're still
not sure obviously we have to wait for
the update to reach the phone but that
leads us to the question of the day how
do you feel about Sam's and tactics of
making everything Samsung only because
you know it does make sense for Apple
since they have this big cult following
behind them but people are not really
big fans of galaxy phones they buy them
now and then they switch eventually
because they're not really that great
but leave us a comment down below is the
Galaxy Note lineup is a very good
ecosystem and we would be sad to see
that you're being walked down on your
services and friends you know the drill
