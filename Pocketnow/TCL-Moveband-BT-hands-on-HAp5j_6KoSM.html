on the edits and this is the TCL move
band BTE Fitness wearables continue to
gain popularity but most are rather
pricey or they look like if you brought
the band from some movie that was based
on science fiction CCL is approaching
things differently with the move bad
Beatty with a very elegant package we've
got a single sensor in the middle it
varies in color depending on the band
that you choose and these bands are
quite fancy have you asked me the sensor
is ip67 water in dust resistance and
even though it looks like metal it
actually isn't
there's no display so the sensor really
relies on your wrist activate music
playback trigger the camera on your
phone or other commands via bluetooth
the move band BT can be remembered more
as an activity tracker providing up to
30 days of continuous battery life
something great for those of you wanting
to calculate your sleep and charging

press release expect the possible launch
