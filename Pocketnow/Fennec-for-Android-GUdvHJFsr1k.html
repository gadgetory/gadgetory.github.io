pocketnow com Mozilla is working on
bringing Firefox to mobile devices they
try this with windows mobile with fennec
and they're stopping development of that
because Windows Phone 7 is coming just
around the corner and now they have a
version or at least an alpha for Android
let's take a look at how it works okay
so I'm gonna start off by opening it
here and it's kind of buggy but you can
actually use it a lot more than you
could use the fennec alpha for windows
mobile that we showed you a few times in
the past so here we are the big story
with fennec or let's call it firefox
mobile is that you'll be able to install
add-ons and extension so if you have
firefox installed on your desktop you
know that you probably use a variety of
customizations whether you have a
twitter plugin that automatically shows
you your tweets somewhere in the browser
or maybe you have an ad blocker or maybe
you have a way to synchronize your
passwords and bookmarks across multiple
computers that's really the promise with
fennec so let's take a look at how it
works as a web browser i'm going to
click up into the awesome bar as they
call it i can search right from this bar
or i can sweat to the right and see all
of my bookmarks so i'm going to jump
right to amazon.com and hide the
keyboard away and let's see we're over
an hsdpa connection right now so not as
fast as Wi-Fi but still pretty good okay
so rendering speed is pretty good and
it's kind of surprising for an alpha
it's really close to the default android
browser it doesn't have pinch-to-zoom
support so we have to double tap to zoom
in and we get pretty close and panning
and scrolling looks quite nice on this
early version of firefox mobile now we
can open up multiple tabs I love the way
that this manages tabs you just swipe to
the left and you can see your open tabs
and I'm going to go to pocket now calm a
lot of other mobile browsers sort of
sort of hide the tabs behind a menu so
it's really not intuitive to quickly
jump between multiple tabs like you
would on a desktop browser okay so
here's pocket now again it's coming up
pretty fast actually
has landscape support or accelerometer
support and here it is flash does not
work no word on whether they plan to
integrate flash into this product if we
get down to a YouTube video here it says
click here to install the plug-in and
when you click there nothing really
happens so I can swipe to the left and
quickly toggle between amazon and pocket
now calm very smoothly i really enjoy
how quickly you can do that if we swipe
to the right we get some other things we
can favorite quickly or unfavorite by
just tapping on the star and I'm gonna
favorite like I just did if I tap on
this little gear here I get the settings
so here there's some basic settings you
can show images enable javascript allow
cookies basic browser stuff but here's
where sort of the meat of the
application is it's any add-ons and
extensions manager and right now it's
trying to find add-ons and it's not
going to because there really aren't any
add-ons that will work right now with
fennec seats s bennett could not
retrieve add-ons but hopefully in the
future that will change and you'll be
able to get a lot of the great add-ons
and extensions that you use on the
mobile on the on the full version of
firefox on the desktop on the mobile
browser another promise of fennec is
through weave which is bookmark syncing
so it's an extension for firefox
although there's a lot of different
extensions that will do this but weave
is made by Mozilla and it allows you to
keep your bookmarks up to date on all of
your devices so soon you'll be able to
keep all of your bookmarks up to date on
your mobile phone on your desktop
anywhere that you're running a mozilla
product so overall the outfit is
actually not too bad and it's it's it's
usable but probably not as your daily
driver in terms of a browser but we like
where mozilla is going with fennec
mobile hopefully they continue on the
development path and they come out with
a final product like they unfortunately
never did for windows mobile i mean i'll
post a link on pocketnow.com on how to
get fennec alpha for your device and
please thumbs up this video if you liked
it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
