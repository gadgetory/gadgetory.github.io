thank them for supporting the PocketNow
weekly all right we're live and this
week huawei in hot water again this time
over potential trade sanctions motorola
is setting their sights high on sales
for the g6 we might have gotten a closer
look at the iPhone se too I'm very
excited about that the US government is
dragging their heels on repealing net
neutrality and this week we crack open
the pocket now mailbag to answer some of
your questions we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode three zero two of the
pocket now weekly a recorded April 27th
at noon pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid i'm juan carlos bag now
contributing editor at pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mister mister jules wong on the
east coast how's it going buddy boy good
well how about you husband nor week so
far while weeks been rad i was i would
just like to say I'm very excited that
I'll I've read through sponsor copy
through the top of the show and I didn't
fumble until I got to your name yeah
yeah just important parts you have to
satisfy the sponsor and then screw up
your co-hosts name I love it totally
it's exactly it's a good idea you should
keep on doing it yeah just bring that
forward as a concept keep that going on
I love it I love it but no we should
jump right into the show because we've
got some really hot news stories again I
mean we're sort of in that in-betweener
phase on on individual device
announcements you know getting through a
couple different phone reviews right now
then we're gonna be hitting another sort
of harvest season in a couple weeks when
a few more devices are coming out it's
never good I don't like this I don't
like having to divide my attention in a
certain week to like five different
devices that are watching at the same
time and it's just it's crazy and then
there's like the starving period that
you have to deal with between we think
it would be a little bit more like movie
releases where a manufacturer would be
like hey when's LG releasing their phone
well we've got another little phone we
should launch it the same day idea or
Aza you know like hey when's Apple gonna
be taking the wraps off the new iPhone
let's release three days before them no
like you had this whole month leading up
where you could have had the spotlight
all to yourself but instead it's like
well we need the summer blockbuster the
tent pole phone announcement and that's
not how any of this works no this is not
Nissan's 10:10 sales event thing going
on oh I've done so many castings for
every single I don't feel manufactured
the summer sales event the big tent
event here I go this is terrible
if you want to get into your own
consumer sales tent events you want to
get into a parallel with us actually you
can do so on Twitter via the hashtag P
and weekly I'm also monitoring the
YouTube chat although I won't be paying
as much attention to that as much as
parking that Weekly P and weekly under
the Twitter's because I can actually
read the comments and they're and
they're here and they stay there until I
scroll so that's that's actually cool
sorry about that YouTube chat but if you
want to head into your email client and
ask a few questions like that or have a
few opinions they want to share just as
the more friends here have sent in you
can do so just send it to a P podcast I
have to remember the thing podcast at
pocketnow.com and we'll be able to
answer those at the end of every month
so you can do that and have your say and
we get to respond to your say and then
and then it continues on the
conversation continues
well and I know it's like we always
struggle to remember our own email
address but I promise you we do read it
and the proof that we do is at the end
of this month or at the end of every
month we try and do a mailbag episode
we've got a couple of really cool emails
to talk about here some really techie
geeky and the weed stuff that I like to
talk about so we'll have we'll have a
fun wrap up discussion after all the
major news but as speaking of like
that's kind of what I was getting back
to is we had a couple really interesting
news stories pop up this week that are
gonna be fun to chew up a little bit and
so I think we should jump in top news
stories from pocketnow.com this week
Jules you want to help us run through
this this list of articles in
periodicals and topics periodicals there
are you talking about like the the mag
like the periodicals in the newspaper
again like I don't even remember what
the reading newspaper was like anyways
for the week of April 23 2018 this is
all the news that is fit to podcast we
start off with haul-away as with ZTE
getting some brush back from the
government far away is now another
Chinese telecoms company that is under
investigation by the Department of
Justice for sanction breaching with
doing business in Iran and details about
this have yet to be fully emerged as of
right now but we'll be keeping track of
that and we'll be talking about some of
the reactions still as this whole regime
of you know building tensions with China
in economy and as well as cybersecurity
goes on so we'll be talking about that
in just a few minutes motorola in the
meantime has announced that it's Moto G
Series has amassed seventy million sales
over the past five years of the series
and it hopes to reach nine digits with
the help of the Moto G 6 and the g6 play
g6 plus over the next year hoping to
target 30 million more Moto G sales
we'll see how many of the new models
make up that total in the meantime more
from the iPhone se 2
now hearing that it's coming up to
launch probably next month and we're
seeing a 17 second video released on to
Chinese video sharing site and Yao PI as
it shows off a headphone jack some glass
as it has been rumored that this thing
will get wireless charging of some sort
but again these details are pretty
sketchy at the moment and it's a pretty
blurry video so what's to take
especially with that Salt's that you
have over there sprints and t-mobile
again going into merger territory here
word to Reuters now is that they are
close to a deal Softbank and Deutsche
Telekom the parent companies of Sprint
and t-mobile are just hashing out how
much voting control each company will
get and we could have a deal announced
it by next week at the earliest
in the meantime Xiaomi has announced
that it will move to limit profit margin
goals with a top limit of 5% after tax
and if it ever achieves net profit
margins above 5 percent it will quote
distributes the excess to its customers
in a reasonable fashion now keep in mind
that Xiaomi is going through an IPO
process it wants to be able to expand
its reaches globally but being able to
do so with its low margin tactic might
prove difficult so it has a tight wire
to balance on at the moment right now
Apple is being accused of some antitrust
concerns that coming from the European
Commission it is looking into the
company's acquisition of Shazam music
identifying service and the potentials
there that upon acquisition of Shazam
that Apple could use the data existing
data from
referrals to other music streaming
services as a competitive advantage
against players like google play music
or Spotify they have about 90 working
days to reach a conclusion and in
conclusion and are expected to do so on
it before September 4
the US government has yet to approve the
FCC's a repeal of net neutrality now
that's not to say that the FCC has not
passed the bill the restoring Internet
freedom Act and that some of those
provisions have already come into place
on April 23rd but some of the measures
that have been listed on the act need
budgetary approval from the Office of
Management and Budget under the Trump
White House and that has yet to happen
and we do know that there has been
plenty of vacancies in the federal
government and that has slowed down some
of the work that's being done by it's
just everyday work we also know that
it's a midterm election year and that
could have possible effects as to how an
industry law might take place if a new
rules were to be drafted and sent
through Congress there might be a change
in how the republican-controlled
legislatures might be able to handle
that especially if they do turn blue in
September and finally Windows 10 mobile
still alive after haven't been called
dead again reports have said that
Microsoft the Microsoft Store online has
run out of Windows 10 mobile phones to
sell the last two models being the HP
elite x3 and the Alcatel Idol 4s with
Windows of course that stock outage was
temporary and now they're back up and on
the store for what it matters HP has
said that it would continue selling the
Elite X 3 through 2019 so even though
Windows 10 mobile has been at a
development developmental dead-end for
quite a few months now I don't know is
it still nice to see something still
kicking around no not really
alright now I it's it's the frustration
of having had this really elegant user
interface some really great ideas from
Microsoft and being ahead of the curve I
mean like Microsoft is consistently
ahead of the curve on a lot of this
stuff hololens connect a voice assistant
and then they let that fruit wither on
the vine fall behind their competition
and then they have to play catch-up
while we're still consistently seeing
rumors of a potential surface phone of
new implementation of Windows 10 for arm
chipsets and LTE always-on connected
devices and this is this is getting a
little tiresome of the of the evacuate
your bowels or get off the pot mentality
there be a part of mobile or don't but
stop stringing people along with these
kinds of products like I would be very
upset to be a part of the Microsoft
ecosystem with this little consistency
for for consumer solutions yeah I mean
especially as the odium czar just being
left out to dry here and Windows is
basically saying we're moving forward I
do want to catch a tangential piece to
this song and that is the iTunes app
finally appearing on Windows 10 a year
nearly here after Windows 10 is launched
with its app only ecosystem and and it
launched with the surface laptop and I'm
not sure if this is a if people are
still on Windows 10s or if they've just
decided to I'm the first taken if they
first taken it had just gone on to
Windows 10 but uh what do you think too
little too late
no I don't think so I tent Windows 10s
shifting from being a primary operating
system platform to being a setting now
so any any Windows 10 device you can
flip it into sort of a 10s mode it's
shifting but the full implementation
won't happen until like next year well
know that that's what I mean is is is I
look at Windows 10s what what Windows
10s was going to be was an app only
interface with the windows ecosystem
that was going to be sold that way but I
think there is some merit for a 10s mode
on every single Windows 10 device like I
could look at an ultra-light touchscreen
modular style PC and maybe that could
become a really good grandparent
computer where it doesn't matter what
the hardware is I can go into the
settings and say hey now you're in 10s
mode I don't want you letting my
grandparents install programs that they
click on in ads in their web browser I
just only want you to use apps and and
limit what they can have access to
having an app ecosystem or a Windows 10
store I think makes sense for that and
then pushing forward if Microsoft ever
can deliver a strategy for mobility
focused products mobility first focused
products aren't chipset devices and you
don't have to recompile stuff then I
think that that's an ecosystem worth
supporting again it keeps coming back to
a conversation about Microsoft and
potential and they've got a ton of
potential
I could see four or five like
significant paths that they could take
to get back into mobile too they could
get into better modular setups into
better multimode and mixed mode usage
scenarios but really it's will they pick
one will they actually iterate on it
will they improve it and that's where I
always feel Microsoft fumbles the ball
is the consistency of the approach of
the approach and then also learning from
their mistakes iterating and improving
upon their mistakes and moving forward
in a way that consumers can
well it's always the danger of the third
parties - I mean we're talking about
Apple in the specific case with the
iTunes app and this was announced at the
launch of the surface laptop at the
launch of Windows 10 s last May we got
word that it was delayed they were that
development had been suspended
indefinitely in December and now it's
finally taking so long to just get a
basic window win32 bridge over to this
little app that we have right now I mean
yeah that's that's that's kind of one of
the things I'm pointing to that we would
all agree that's disappointing progress
but the fact of the matter is is that
they are still getting something out so
what do we see we see a Microsoft that's
sort of dipping their toe into a
platform or a consumer product release
strategy that the company doesn't seem
to have a lot of faith in I for all of
the goodwill that the surface team has
managed to by Microsoft in terms of
consumer hardware we don't see
strategies that they can build off of in
a meaningful fashion timely execution
consistent iteration and we keep coming
back to these kinds of discussions you
announce something a year and a half ago
now we have it and that's I mean that is
kind of cool we're seeing cross-platform
compatibility on one of L Apple's
primary services in a way that might
help move the needle on making Windows
10 more of an app focused in ecosystem
but we need to see that across the board
we need to see that consistency with a
ton of other developers we need to see
Microsoft delivering hardware that takes
advantage of this not just uses it as a
compromise or uses it as sort of a
default mode like they tried to position
the the surface laptop as being
something of a lesser device in terms of
backwards compatibility there are
advantages to working mobile first and I
don't see where Microsoft has really
embraced that and especially well I mean
they've kind of backed themselves into
that third position out of Android in
iOS and just realized okay well we're
going to announce these bridging
initiatives
they completely dropped the ball on the
entering front and ILS right well it's
like okay ish but that's that really
doesn't you know that's beyond the point
now in 2018 so yeah ends with all those
that the numbers from this week 32
percent increase in surface sales over a
year ago like that that a lot of that
that may have to deal with the surface
laptop or something so they are
achieving for a software company they
are achieving a lot in hardware but well
it's the management of both yeah but
this is also what becomes so frustrating
is we saw them go through their Windows
Phone days Windows Phone 7 to Windows
Phone 8 to Windows Phone 10 or Windows
10 for mobile whatever they wanted to
call it and we saw them learn and stick
it out in the market for surface there
really wasn't anything that I feel could
have prevented Microsoft from emulating
some of their success in surface for
smartphone for their smartphone
platforms and at the same time we yet
again keep pointing to Microsoft as
being this safe consistent company
shareholders feel very comfortable with
Microsoft they tend not to do too many
radical things to their main moneymakers
but we've got Microsoft has I feel the
best potential for executing a one
operating system cloud focused services
focused strategy especially with the
server guy at the helm with Nadella at
the helm of Microsoft he's been
ruthlessly focused on making services
available across all screens and your
Microsoft account follows you really
well regardless of what hardware
platform you end up on the fact that
they haven't seen that that the
disparate teams at Microsoft haven't
fully realized the hardware success
strategy of the surface team and applied
it to other areas is what's so
critically disappointing about the way
that they're engaging with consumers
right except for a 0 for some reason
their servers are just exploding out of
the out of the water it's it's great for
them hooray for for
yes sir but whatever I mean sure I mean
but again I mean what we're talking
about here is a more consumer facing
product
which again the their acumen their
experience in the corporate and their
server infrastructure market would do
really well for for moving the needle on
consumer services and consumer solutions
we've got a comment here from Andrew sis
lack hashtag P and weekly Windows Mobile
whatever we're gonna call it because
it'll probably be something like that
again Windows Mobile will make sense
when they make Windows free again
Windows as a service is a viable
platform is a viable strategy in the way
that we've been positioning a lot of
these other pieces of software app
development and consumer services moving
it that way where window suddenly
competes on the same pricing tier as
Android but will likely have a tighter
rein over things like software updates
could be really compelling that could be
a significant consumer benefit but again
III don't think Microsoft has earned any
trust there right now they would likely
have to lose bad in the market with any
kind of cellphone strategy for at least
three generations of product before
anyone would start to take them
seriously and that's exactly when
Microsoft in the past has decided to
pull the plug on a lot of these products
and initiatives just as they start
getting into like you know high single
digit low double-digit market
penetration is exactly when they go up
not good enough and here we were showing
growth with Nokia you were like 10 to 12
percent throughout most of Europe you
were starting to get into four to five
percent in the United States I was
seeing Lumia phones in the wild from non
techie individuals and that's when you
decided to throw a bucket of cold water
on it makes the the the cliff of
expenses just might have kicked in at
two and a half years I don't know their
their timeframes are kind of ridiculous
in any case that's my opinion
out of left here left field here no life
to 6:19 when the chat I am still using
the original surface RT well I'm sorry
about that
dad so I need to fire it up I
just found it sits in my bedroom right
now I've run out and go grab it
I didn't know we'd be digging this deep
I just found my Lumia 2520 which is
still a gorgeously bill tablet and then
on my bookshelf I don't think I can move
no I can't but I have my surface to RT
well I'm sorry for that yeah I've been
I've been curious to see you know like
if I can if I can get it charged because
I think actually on my surface I think
the battery's dead I haven't checked I
like proper dead like the things just
completely just booth yeah if I can I'm
curious to see if any of those Windows
RT devices have gotten any kind of
significant upgrade with more app
support Windows 10 ecosystem or
environment like I do if they were
completely abandoned because that's a
shame you know the 2520 actually has
hardware in it right now that would do
fairly well with some of the strategy
that they're discussing it's LTE enabled
it's a lower powered chipset so you
wouldn't you don't have that Windows on
arm running on a Qualcomm 835 but it
should do fine for a nap first ecosystem
product if if it even has an upgrade
potential for Windows 10 which I doubt I
know I think we're still where we're
running away from the just tablet only
like just as a form factor as a slab
we're convertibles and you know just
something with a keyboard or a stylus
it's all it's more important these days
so there you go
in terms of Huawei nothing in particular
really is showing up here for a moment
that we can discuss other than just
adding on to the bone pile of this whole
fight between the US government in the
Chinese over trade over cybersecurity
over just a whole bunch of things here
yet so where I've been somewhat
skeptical about the government's
response
you always consumer division ideas
especially with the law enforcement
advisory which came out a couple months
ago this to me is a bigger deal from a
company-wide perspective and it's the
same same feeling I had was ete I felt
that some of the allegations of consumer
facing device security were a little bit
specious given that we had no evidence
that there was any actual wrongdoing on
the part of ZTE or kwame and protecting
consumer data at the same time we've
seen numerous other Chinese
manufacturers violate sort of the
sanctity of the manufacturer consumer
relationship by improperly protecting
consumer data this is a little bit
bigger deal and in the same reason why
it's a major bummer when it hits a
company I like like ZTE or Huawei but if
this is an organization which has been
violating trade sanctions or has been
breaking embargoes or has ties to
governments that our Justice Department
is going to deem unfriendly then we need
a more critical in-depth examination of
the corporate business practices whether
or not I feel like this is gonna affect
individual consumer security I still
don't see a smoking gun there but if if
Huawei went down this path in the same
way that ZTE ZTE did several years ago
and then broke the terms of their
settlement on going down this route then
yeah unfortunately I do feel a larger
hammer has to drop on the company it
just sounds like we're at the beginnings
of that investigation whereas etu had
already been found to be violating trade
sanctions and then lying about their
their role in future violations of trade
sanctions you know lying of the role of
the how they carried out the punch where
they were supposed to punish several
senior executives and they were found to
have not right exactly yeah yeah and
like it sucks as a consumer to be
talking about things that should be over
our heads that shouldn't have to you
know affect us I mean you know Iran you
know what's the deal with that like I
don't really care just give me my damn
phone by
in terms of just having to deal with the
government and the whole thing with
dumping of steel imports and whatnot
like that's it's yeah Oh totally now the
nice thing is and and because you know
this is one of those things where I feel
like those of us who are enthusiasts in
this kind of tech space the nice thing
is I don't feel that the consumers who
have already gone out there and
purchased products from these companies
are likely going to be overtly
negatively affected by the upper
governmental responses to things like
trade sanctions so that's a really
long-winded way of me saying let's say
Huawei is found guilty of doing some
really underhanded or dirty business
things with companies or with countries
that have embargoes or trade sanctions
against them and they befall a similar
punishment that ZTE did where it's going
to be a seven year moratorium on United
States backed technologies let's say you
bought a p20 Pro your p20 Pro should
still be fine like I I don't I don't
foresee where the fallout from this type
of trade sanction or this type of breach
is going to impact someone who's already
bought into a particular ecosystem it's
just unfortunate and it means that your
your next upgrade will likely have to
come from a different manufacturer but
this is kind of still the best possible
scenario for someone who is an early
adopter from one of these companies not
being completely cut out I don't foresee
a near-term embargo placed on carriers
blocking these products from being on
their networks like I don't think
tomorrow t-mobile is going to suddenly
blacklist off huawei products from
operating on their LTE towers like that
to me doesn't seem a likely outcome in
the near-term
it won't just hit a quick note about
that moto G I just in the overtones of
five gears of MotoGP which is in itself
an accomplishment for at mid-range
series
and it I mean great news for them I feel
like the mission overall mission is
still there but I feel kind of bummed
that the realities of the components
marketer and by the expected feature set
of a mid Ranger I thought that that
price has gone up a little bit and I
mean it could I don't believe the we're
going up to like near $300 days as a as
opposed to 180 so that's just my little
complaint there oh no and I totally
appreciate that too I mean that comes
into a longer and and probably not
appropriate for our podcast discussion
about like you know economic policy and
inflation yeah and and I'm I am NOT you
already have enough of that going on
elsewhere I I am perfectly willing to
jump into that conversation while also
absolutely acknowledging that I'm
probably not educated enough to
meaningfully discuss a lot of that stuff
byah um I gotta say what makes me
excited is the Moto G series helped
introduce a conversation in Android that
Windows Phone was really good at the sub
$300 product that wasn't an absolute
misery to use and it's evolved and
iterated phenomenally well there are
several family members my sister is a
perfect example she just finished grad
school I told this story a bunch of
times
moto G for she's happy she has a phone
that does everything she needs it to do
if it gets completely smashed she's not
out a significant amount of money in
fact replacing the entire phone is
probably less costly than replacing the
back glass on a newer Samsung so she's
happy my wife
destroyed her current flagship phone and
out of all the devices that I handed to
her blind cuz I didn't tell her you know
this is an entry-level phone this is a
mid-range ur this is a flagship her
phone is a g5 s that was the phone that
after kind of poking around on the user
interface for a little while
using each device for a little while she
ended up on a 250 dollar mode
the Moto g5s was her pick free of any
other influence from me telling her this
is a good phone this is a bad phone and
so if we could see a moto g6 that kind
of follows in that footsteps I am very
positive on this and this tier of the
market alongside phones like the honor
7x so long as honor can continue to sell
devices to North America those products
helping to shift a part of the
conversation away from the desire of
spending eight hundred nine hundred
thousand dollars on a smart phone like
what you would pay more towards the
desire of an HTC Desire our IP I you
know what I I think now would be the
right play for HTC to start pushing
entry-level and mid-range or hardware in
the United States and build back up some
of their consumer good well you release
a phone that's really good at two to
three hundred dollars and you've got an
argument a solid argument for folks like
what are you doing with your thousand
dollar phone really look at your
behavior because you might be doing just
as well on a product which costs a third
as much as a top-end high-end flagship
device and and I think it's got so gonna
be kind of on us geeks so once again
kind of help spread the word on some of
that to family members where that
conversation is appropriate the g6 at
least it will hopefully be a product
worth bringing up in the context of that
conversation like the honor 7x wise yeah
I mean again the focus on the premium
has always been about and well for for
security Hawks it's always been about
software updates and making sure that
those patches happen and as we've talked
about a couple of weeks ago that
omissions that the omissions of patches
in certain updates has been a little bit
worrisome for the low rent so rotaries
are roundabouts it is it is definitely a
conversation of pros and cons and and
where you can accept risk but also I
think a major component of that has to
come down to consumer behavior yeah and
if you've got a limited use outlook on
what you do with a smartphone then
you're probably already protecting your
device better just through the lack of
you
on certain services in certain in
certain platforms so but again that's
why that's why those of us who are
enthusiasts those of us who are geeks
need to approach this not just from this
is a cheap phone this is an expensive
phone this is a nice phone this is a
crappy phone but more what is the likely
behavior of the person you're talking to
and finding the best possible fit for
them and given the pros and cons on
something like you said like security I
still feel there are plenty of people in
my circles of family and friends who are
low risk individuals in terms of how
they share information online and would
benefit from saving five $600 on a phone
given those compromises
I'm with not so here on the YouTube chat
I do wish phone crisis if Roth would
start dropping in I mean it's just a
it's a bummer but you know I wouldn't be
too upset about some of these some of
these moves like Motorola pushing the G
a little bit more upscale is still only
Rho it's still great yeah still
relatively it's still relative to them
having the Moto e and there are still
benefits why someone might pick a moto e
over a moto G not not the least of which
is an even lower powered chipset often
with an even bigger battery you know so
like if if you've got someone in your
target you know and your and your help
me buy a phone conversation and they're
saying like I do very little but I need
to have a reliable device that's gonna
last all day maybe even two days I'm not
the type of person who takes care of
these things very well I'm not that
tech-savvy I'm not gonna sit here and
babysit a high-end phone something there
is a a good faith argument to be made
for why a Moto e would be an even better
fit for someone like that and now we're
talking about 200 and below so we are at
that you know a c-note in change gets
you an entry-level phone experience
which isn't miserable it's not nice it's
not a flagship phone but it's not
miserable to use that if you just need
to plug through the basics and comes
with the benefit of having ridiculously
long battery life especially considering
you're not gonna do a lot on that phone
I feel like we've come into one of those
exclusion
triangles where you can pick two but not
the other one we completely have it's
hilarious a couple of from the peon
weekly hashtag on Twitter appeared hatin
in response to Andrew sis likes earlier
comment about making windows free was
the cost ever really the problem though
some of their best friends were super
low cost I genuinely genuinely thank the
app gap and lack of continuity between
updates really killed Windows Mobile and
they need this they need to fix and
Andrew Wallace soda is a parallel to
that I honestly don't see much of a
future for Windows on mobile until the
industry moves past app focus to
functionality
actually that's you Andrew yeah yeah cuz
I don't cuz we're showing it right now
so into you know the you know just
focusing on specific programs specific
apps I don't right now I don't see the
the the the forest from the from the
trees but there are tantalizing little
hints you know cuz I agree with you
Jules like in this present time and I
would say through 2020 I don't see
anything significantly moving the needle
on this really tired metaphor that we're
currently using of touch squared get
serviced and it and it really was I mean
like Apple wasn't wrong Steve Jobs
wasn't wrong on the original iPhone that
if we had better data connectivity
having a more robust web browser would
have been a bigger benefit than all of
these little mini installable programs
that function like light versions of the
webpage services you already interact
with but when we see these tantalizing
little clues these little hints as to
what could be coming up next
things like progressive web apps start
to make a pretty significant impact on
the way that Android manages mobile
services and how you interact between
web browser or or standalone app
downloading tiny pieces of executable
program executable code just to fill in
the gaps on what a mobile web browser
can actually utilize that could be what
we need to move
windows into more of a chrome style
mobile space again that's a huge amount
of potential that I don't believe
Microsoft can feel but I mean to
andrew's point we're already heading in
that direction I don't want a ton of
little apps I'm perfectly happy with a
web browser first solution as long as I
don't lose functionality and progressive
Web Apps get me to that without having
to permanently install a bunch of things
I need to hunt through it's just a
different metaphor for organizing my
services and then probably interacts
better with things like voice controls
so if I could have a smarter assistant
that could launch you know a web browser
and take me to a bookmark in my browser
and that's a service that I really use
that to me is more beneficial than going
to an app drawer and loading up an app
and running the service that way I see
Android instant apps as it transit that
just apps like in general as a good
transition of all that but in terms of
just getting beyond that that's kind of
we're kind of in the Wild West of things
and there's gonna be I think that's
gonna be a big fight the metaphor for
how we interact with a service is gonna
be the major showdown between Google
Microsoft and Apple because I think in
the first generations as we shift away
from Android into whatever fuchsia style
OS system they use when we go from
Windows to Andromeda and when Apple
finally gets over themselves and merges
iOS with Mac OS every company every one
of those three is gonna have a different
metaphor for how a consumer interacts
with their data and that'll be I think
the major determining factor on who wins
and there's every opportunity that we
might see some kind of outside disrupter
yeah like a Linux might pop back up into
the consumer mind share in a meaningful
way through a manufacturing partner a
Tizen could walk into the space if
Samsung decides to allocate those kinds
of resources to really shake up how
consumers think about using their
products and using their services on the
go but again these are all really big
gifts and I seriously doubt we'll see
anything significant significant on this
until at least post-2020 some contrarian
part of me wishes that dense distance
was still factor in the digital well you
have to actually go out to the store or
to a diner and get food and get life and
get whatever the heck like that's just
but that's just me you don't you can't
just keep scrolling here and there and
what wouldn't it's just it's it's it's
not practical it's not like it just got
to make a bigger play on a are you know
like hey you could you could GrubHub
this or you can also get your AR points
to go to your favorite diner and like
you see the video about like that it was
like an art project where it's just the
bar bit of ads and like the surreal like
you have all genitive points and then
the woman gets hacked out of her
identity and then has to restart out all
over again or something III well the one
I remember is someone who there were two
jokes when Google glass first came out
and they had that fake at a day in glass
or whatever it was called and Google was
nowhere near close to giving us that as
a real AR platform which was a major
bummer they completely oversold the
imagination of what glass could be
they're gonna talk about that last week
and also there was a Tom Scott who had a
pretty pretty good video to parody
videos on that one was like the actual
Google ad Adsense version of glass where
you put pop-ups and ads throughout the
entire video and my favorite one was the
windows a day in Microsoft class where
it was like things with lag or you would
see like they dragged a cursor out of
the way and it would have like the after
image of all of the different you know
windows were Jing and a blue screens of
death at the end of the video it was
pretty funny but what I really like
again that it's funny because those
kinds of parodies aren't completely
wrong when when iOS and Mac OS merge in
a more significant fashion it's probably
gonna piss off both iOS and Mac OS fans
you know you it's really difficult it's
it's exceedingly difficult to manage a
transition like that well so it's every
opportunity for the entire market to be
flipped upside down while we wait to see
what actually resonates
with consumers consumers don't like
change they like to feel that
something's newer and flashier and
sexier they kind of want things to work
exactly the way that they've always used
them in the past and anytime that you
shift you change the location of a
button you remove a home button you
change a button to a gesture people
react viscerally negatively so this is
dicey territory for all three all right
so we've been skirting around this for a
little bit now i phone se - I think I'm
going to give you 60 seconds for you to
just vent out whatever you need to vent
out because this the we're not talking
about release yet we're not talking
about any specific dates and you know
what to look forward to it's just a 17
second video that I I should probably
just give you 17 seconds but I'm very
being very generous here so 60 seconds
and they start now if we maintain the
same overall form factor in shell I'm
gonna be very excited I still think iOS
has not managed the transition to larger
screen sizes very well and it's at home
best in a one thumb style environment
this could be an epic little Mighty
Mouse device and I would be sad to see
you go to glass back I don't feel that
there's a particularly there's any
strong benefit there even with wireless
charging over the loss of durability but
this is a product segment that I think
still does well for consumers who want a
portable one-handed device and are
looking at a more reasonable price point
with iOS running on more modern hardware
so I hope that this is what the the
phone is actually going to resemble and
are you an up and down or or down on the
headphone jack still being there well
that's that's the biggie if they if they
keep the same form factor I really hope
that that they they maintained one not
only the headphone jack
but to the flush camera sensor I really
don't think Apple design has has
improved since the iPhone 5 I think it's
been downhill I think the iPhone 5
represents the peak this is peak iPhone
this is the best of what Apple has ever
delivered from a design perspective
and it's little touches like that it's
the little accents I don't like camera
bumps and bulges on these you know
increasingly large phones minimizing the
barest minimum battery that they can get
away with in a mobile device the iPhone
5 in the iPhone se had all of this
better years ago delivered all of this
correctly long before we got to this
possible refresh on an iPhone se - I
definitely agree 2013 was peak iPhone
year for Apple except for the 5c I'm not
sure about that I mean it's definitely a
big misstep cuz I would like in like I'm
viewing this with retrospect but yeah I
think it was a good faith
a good faith attempt back in time at the
time the iPhone 5c made me crazy angry
because it broke this cycle of iPhone
trust I you you could always trust on
Apple refreshing with the S and then
selling the the last year number model
at a lower price and then you would have
a continuity of accessories the second I
saw a plastic iPhone and it was detailed
that it wouldn't be compatible with
iPhone 5 cases with iPhone 5 covers with
a handful of iPhone 5 mounts that to me
was an instant it was an instant
violation of that of that iPhone
continuity you you you suddenly had a
you you made a less desirable iPhone for
the purposes of making a less desirable
iPhone and you were showing off with the
manufacturing and construction of that
phone this was a consumer who is lesser
this is a consumer who spent less on
their product and it doesn't blend in
with what we're doing now whereas if you
you hold up an iPhone se you know people
just think you have an old iPhone but it
was still a nice iPhone you know that
was a good I phone it wasn't one of
these plastic e gaudy iPhones that that
looked tacky so for me it's always been
you you keep that through line you keep
that continuity and you don't punish
your consumers for buying a less
expensive product you just make sure
that you're building a product that you
can still you know let's to my class
is full effect here but it's like you
still there wasn't there wasn't anything
preventing Apple from building in a
profit margin and maintaining the iPhone
5
you know it's they tried to make a cheap
iPhone and they ultimately arrived at
making sort of a consumer punishing
cheap iPhone
no one wants now I shouldn't say no one
but fewer people wanted that and then we
saw sales of the iPhone 5 continued
through a lot of markets in the world
and then the iPhone se comes out and
again it's not gonna be a top seller
it's not gonna have a huge impact on
their overall iOS ailes but it's been a
fairly consistent performer for people
who want smaller form factor device
better one thumb or just a cheaper a
less expensive iPhone and it doesn't
broadcast this is the cheap iPhone and
like that kind of psychology matters
when Apple builds so much of their
product rep on that emotional response
to their products well I don't maybe but
I think it's more it's hey can i it's
more green bubble it's it's it's it's
more anti green bubble than anti-plastic
cheap case of whatever that i think all
things go together but we see cheap
older iPhones still being sold we don't
see any off tangential lines of plastic
iPhones being sold I think the market
spoke whatever the actual reasons per
consumer as a whole as a market plastic
iPhones don't sell so old iPhones sell
fell fairly well that that I think is at
least the last rule that we can hold to
but those were my feelings at launch and
they're still my feelings today and
every time because I have an iPhone 5c
and every time I pick up my iPhone S II
it's a wonderful little Mighty Mouse of
a phone
I love the build I love how snappy it is
I love how well it performs it's a
little Mighty Mouse of a gadget while I
had the iPhone 5c it felt like a tacky
cheap phone so for the winter not not
the holiday quarter but the winter after
they had debuted got about thirty of all
iPhone sales the iPhone 5c did so I mean
it was a failure in that sense but I
mean it's still
decently well and I say what the with
the sales on that the word though
because iPhone 12.8 of 551 million so
I'd be curious to see how that goes year
after year because I remember the year
before Apple launched the iPhone se
their year-over-year on the iPhone 5 was
somewhere around 20 something million
sales on older iPhones and I don't know
if the 5c was a part of that smaller
form factor sales estimate or if it was
just based on the iPhone 5 in the iPhone
5s so I'd have to look up those numbers
but I want to say that when the se was
announced they made the claim that 30
million of their iPhone sales that year
previous had been generated by smaller
form factor iPhones it was again the
this is with context that Apple was so
much more bigger of a beast in terms of
just emphasizing iPhone at that point
but yeah I'm just I'm kind of looking at
this from like sepia-toned glasses here
so no I was take of me what you will
Sprint t-mobile again this is happening
there could be a possibility that the
Department of Justice may have a little
bit more scrutiny against anything
happening in the US cellular industry at
the moment because it is looking into
AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon and the GSMA for
colluding on carrier walking rules for
the East's and standard but again this
is this is about money this is about
being able to it's about quality of
competition versus just having a
quantity of competition what do you
think I I think that there's a pretty
good chance this will go through because
we're talking about the third and
fourth-place carriers a significant
amount of resources are being tied up by
the AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon collusion
accusations and that I I don't know that
they'll they'll they'll deliver the same
kind of regulatory scrutiny with this
administration on these two companies I
think if there's any any potential for a
lot
gasp before the midterm elections
regulatory policy actually pushing
through some kind of merger or
acquisition this one actually looks like
it's got the legs to make it we've been
hearing about this on-again off-again
maybe they will maybe they won't Sam and
Diane kind of the meaning of these two
companies for so long that I think
consumers are sort of over it anyone who
would be overly concerned about Sprint
and t-mobile joining forces likely just
doesn't care that much as it you know
especially compared to agency and dish
or eighteen or just eight teams here in
the case of Donald Trump because of
course they go right arm orders yeah
yeah so so this one I think actually has
a higher degree I there's there's a
higher likelihood of this one just
sneaking through because people will act
like the stakes are much lower even
though we're still talking about
humongous multi-billion dollar
corporations joining forces where we
should be delivering exactly the same
kind of scrutiny even know Sprint's like
a distant fourth place and t-mobile has
been a pretty scrappy third place I you
know III think this one this one could
slide yeah in terms of impact to
services I mean well especially with the
regulatory picture being as it is I'm
not sure what kind of discounts left to
make in terms of spectrum in terms of
whatever that they have to do in order
to be compliant but it's just is does
this make I mean ideally we would have a
third place some sort of a state where
it could be more in the lines of a
hundred million subscribers or they'd be
able to carry their own way and just
really you know you know get yeah
elephant stomping with the trembling
yeah I I don't know about elephant
stomping no I I think in the in the
short term let's say Sprint and t-mobile
married got married tomorrow
moving you're gonna have to explain the
cheers reference to by the way no it's
just a generic joke at every single
sitcom where there's sexual tension
between two characters the will do that
that was based off of cheers I don't
take any anyone I don't know that
that was as much for me as it might have
been for anyone my age or older
no the the the biggie is sorry my wife
just got out of Avengers infinity war
and I just got free text her saying I
hated this film I'm not joking this film
made me so angry
well she got a one plus six out of it
right I'm sorry I just that just
completely floored me there I wasn't
expecting such a visceral reaction for
my wife but I think she's hit her
superhero movie burnout limit uh already
well no but I mean dealing with this
since like blade Cana and superhero
films that's what I mean is like the
overall superhero movie burnout but
sorry so let's say t-mobile and Sprint
got married tomorrow as long as they had
the right hardware on their phones I
could see an almost immediate benefit
for former Sprint customers getting to
piggyback on t-mobile's network the
project fry without the freaking well
there it is so let's say you know like
if phones if phones on Sprint were
properly built for international travel
international access it should only take
some software to open up the ability for
that phone to juggle GSM and CDMA
networks here in the United States so
that could be a significant purpose rent
consumers right away and a tassa would
bring I think a subtle benefit to
t-mobile you know they're they're
probably some areas where they're you
might be closer to a sprint tower than a
t-mobile Tower and you would get to
benefit from that signal hopping too and
then it would it would radically
simplify the number of devices that they
would have to manage and sell moving
forward so you follow the t-mobile
strategy of their devices largely being
unlocked versions with a couple
preloaded apps maybe and then from there
I think you would you would see an
easier consumer platform for selling
these devices you wouldn't have to skim
go the deutsche telekom err
and just like like freely choose which
apps you want to preload like that would
be great
oh yeah that would be cool too but what
I mean is like if you look at the
catalog of phones being sold by t-mobile
and by Sprint
one carrier I feel does a little bit
better in sourcing potential solutions
for consumers and is a lot more flexible
and is a lot easier for unlocked devices
on their network and I think that would
be a boon to sprint subscribers totally
totally
I totally you know understand that I
guess
well Teemo has always been a beneficiary
of unlocked because they're they're not
the leading carrier in the nation as
opposed to 1884 Eisen they don't have
any stake against 13 you know but unlock
the phones and whatnot and also the
Sprint's phones modern phones are to an
extent GSM compatible but those are only
world bans and I don't think there's
enough cross Venn diagram cross
compatibility going on there because
they have the sprint fronts out to be
working with a GSM international
carriers so yeah that's uh that's
something to be mindful
Rob from the wife Avengers infinity war
nothing about this movie was redeeming
you want to bring her on you know what
to do just call her up right now we
could do like a call in I'd love to have
a good plug in for like days to patch
directly into I'm sorry the the recap
the play-by-play on this is hilarious so
I'm definitely have to ask my right we
should probably move on move on to
something sort of gadget or to software
yeah let's talk about Apple and Shazam a
couple of concerns here from the
European Commission and that's this is
why they're doing their antitrust
investigation one is the data issue that
it can take all the data the referral
data for customers just trying to
identify a track and okay which service
would you like to access Spotify Google
Play or Apple music
they could use that data for kind of
advantage there is also the minor
concern that Suzanne that well it mine
our concern in the words of the European
Commission that shazam could be limited
to just referring to Apple music
although I don't see much sense in a
doom that's for Apple in any case but
yeah what's up here well I mean that
just is we'll have to see where they
eventually land on whether or not they
consider this some sort of any trust
move I just think that the stakes are
going to be really low I you know we
have a variety of music scanning data
collecting services you you know your
Google assistant has this type of
functionality built into it now
there was like sound hound and other
services just isn't that big a deal
anymore gleaning consumer behavior from
them manually scanning music to try and
find out what a song is or interacting
with the service like that so to me this
is something that I think is like I
don't think it's it's not worth
examining corporate behavior over
consumer identifiable information and
behavior but let's say they slam this
down and they did they determine it that
it is a major any trust issue it won't
really affect any current products or
services as far as I'm aware of you know
Apple music isn't going to take a
significant hit because they don't have
a good platform for utilizing Shazam's
algorithmic music search so III just
like again I'm gonna go back to that
earlier phrase I just think the stakes
are really low here and the worst-case
scenario for Apple is still like kind of
a shrug it's you know I just don't think
it's gonna be a big deal I mean it's you
know potentially because Apple you know
since the high part they've branded
themselves as being the place for music
and that's what they've been showing off
with beats doing that brand up and you
know adding these radio services to it
and then also just yeah Apple music in
to the detriment of iTunes and to
downloads and the shifting landscape of
how we listen to music they still want
to be a place for that kind of media and
you know be the center and again carpool
karaoke like they were able to grab onto
that like it's just it's but you know
that's a bit sonic brand they have a
sonic brand and things like this might
be a worse look for Apple in this one
case because we're talking about Apple
buying a company which uses a consumers
device to scan behavior and scan the
audio around them to to listen oh but
we're going to keep it private we're
gonna it's gonna be safe this is this is
a worse look for Apple than what we
normally talk about for Apple services
is because Apple would be leveraging
that acquisition of consumer behavior to
try and better market other services
that people can buy but why a so feel
like the stakes are super low here is
that it's still in Apple's bucket of an
ecosystem it would be augmenting Apple
music which again people would either
already be subscribed to or you just
deal with Apple saying like you should
buy Apple music you say no and then you
get on with your life and that this is
way less intrusive in my opinion way
less intrusive than the way that Amazon
and Google collect information on you to
sell similar products and services so
again even if this ends up being you
know falling into some kind of
worst-case scenario for Apple music and
Shazam I still don't think it's gonna be
there's gonna be much ado you know I I
think this is going to be one to pretty
easily shrug off and just get on with
their lives and incorporate similar
mechanics into Siri and then have that
be the leveraged utilization of consumer
behavior we did they ever get back to
incorporating features into Syria well
but I mean that would be a motivator
wouldn't it you know like oh we can't
use Shazam darn well here's almost
exactly the same thing built on internal
Apple developers utilization of consumer
behavior to sell you they've been hiring
but I I just I don't know we'll have to
see
some of the aspect but I want to see I
want to see what the Commission has to
say about this but if the Commission
comes cracking down hard on Apple here
where where are they gonna fall on
Google you know they've already screwed
Google's so much I mean the right to
forget and also just other default
search engine choices I mean they don't
have any more bones to pick unless
Google grows them with seeds and soil
yeah but but I this is again like if I'm
gonna try and put on my fairness cap if
they come crashing down on Apple in
Shazam and like Amazon music just sort
of skirts without the same kind of
scrutiny then I feel like consumers have
a good have a good a good faith argument
to be made for some type of regulatory
overreach or oversight into how other
corporations are also utilizing consumer
behavior and finally the impending doom
not but it's still impending again some
of these changes that the FCC has voted
on published in its rules for the repeal
of net neutrality require budgetary
changes and that requires signing off
from the director of the Office of
Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney and
there hasn't been any movement on this
well and it's already been four days
since other rules were taken into effect
so there's there's a whole bunch of
reasons that this could be happening but
um I don't know
Harold Feld of the wet machine blog
network as a few takes on this that
suggests
hey maybe the industry that's the
internet industry is what is working on
a bill that would ensure internet Bill
of Rights or whatever the heck but would
have some backdoors for them to be able
to take advantage of that you know
they're crafting legislation and they
want to pass it through
Congress maybe the government is winning
on that but we're in a midterm year so
it's kind of a we're kind of in a in a
in a rut we're in the same regulatory
uncertainty that FCC Chairman Ajit PI
has been talking about for three years
in terms of these freakin rules being in
effect for title two and whatnot and now
these just leave there's just this big
hole in terms of all right
it's art Internet freedom restored yet I
don't feel like any of that was well
there there are a lot of things that are
moving parts here one eye the
frustration of what a Jeep I sold
conservatives in saying we were going to
restore Internet freedom was always
specious because this is this is an
extremely complicated machine if you're
out there ranting and railing I don't
want the government in my internets the
government is not one thing the
government is an insane collection of
tiny pieces in parts all with varying
levels of power to execute policy so a
GP grossly oversimplified the process of
deleting title to after it was enacted
if you just thought he was capable of
going in and saying we're gonna hold a
vote the vote is is affirmed and now
we're gonna remove net neutrality and
you believed him on that then he
essentially misrepresented what he was
capable of doing and he lied to you you
know he he he oversold his ability to
get this done at the same time we're
also seeing numerous lawsuits over the
repeal of title 2 regulations
we're seeing numerous states involved in
state policy to enact even stricter net
neutrality policy than what the FCC was
going to be in charge of and we are also
dealing and that despite the fact that
the Act says that this this law
supersedes any state law and which is an
immediate which is an immediate Circuit
Court
Supreme Court issue because we then that
we if if you're a conservative now we
need to have that conversation on state
versus federal rights the state of
California says we want even stricter
net neutrality guidelines than what the
FCC repealed where do you fall are you
internally consistent in your
conservative ideology and protecting
states rights above the federal
government and allowing California to do
business in the way that California
citizens see fit or are you going to
fight us on federal overreach of
restricting states rights well it's a
liberal state and at the end that
argument doesn't apply but it's it's
like these are always you know a means
to another means to a certain point of
the day poor servants like always no no
that that's that's where that's where
I'm frustrated with politicians both
liberal and conservative politicians the
discourse even the discourse has been
I'm having a good-faith conversation
with a conservative or libertarian
individual outside of the realm of
government I remain internally
consistent on my liberal ideology and if
liberals in California decide through a
popular vote that the preferred method
that they wish to do business on the
Internet is through some sort of net
neutrality protecting legislation that
is a state's right and that should
supersede what the federal government
can enact through a diminished
regulatory agency like the FCC so again
those those kinds of conversations are
all coming to a head at the same time
that both a Jeep I and several FCC
appointees appointed by the FCC chairman
at JP are also under investigation for
potential collusion with the very
agencies at the very corporations this
agency is tasked with regulating so this
but by removing a lot of the power and
authority of the FCC the timing on this
is actually really bad for the FCC being
able to change policy so their resources
are already stretched thin because
conservatives love to gut regulatory
agencies like the FCC and that means
their ability to enact policy is for
reduced even when the policy they're
trying to enact is a rollback that
conservatives are in favor of so again
they've completely oversold what they
were capable of doing they've been
working to diminish what they're capable
of doing and that's also affecting the
time line of what they promised they
would be able to do all of this
shouldn't stop ISPs from already just
cranking down the hammer on what they
want to do because FCC's enforcement
Bureau even though it has but I would be
good stuff recently and the FT and the
FTC which is already a small enough
Bureau as it is but eul's we've been
seeing the lobster pot on that happen
already on a bunch of those stories too
you know like Verizon already holding
tests on their network on how to
throttle competing services like Netflix
we've been watching in numerous areas of
the country start lighting up even more
restrictive data caps in areas that are
already underserved competition we're
also seeing you know of it's very slow
at the state level rolling back
regulations on things like
community-funded broadband or
initiatives that would improve
competition in areas that are only
served by one major totally agree I'm
just waiting for the floodgates and you
know there aren't any floodgates then
maybe the carriers have a long service
brothers have a long game in mind that
they want to be able to be completionist
on no no no this is also why I think
we're seeing the pause that we are what
we'll see a very quiet announcement that
the FCC is stepping aside probably
before or during some other major
announcement you know I wouldn't be
surprised of like a three-day weekend
they deliver the news like 5:00 p.m. on
a Friday to say oh yeah and that
neutrality is dead goodbye and then like
you know kind of walk out but at the
same time ISPs aren't going to rush to
suddenly eliminate a ton of protections
because what they want is the first wave
they want that first week at the end of
the first week of net neutrality you're
gonna have a whole bunch of consumer
conservative news outlets saying see
look nothing changed the internet still
works
everything's fine and from there is Peas
and carriers get to lobster pot up
whatever
dastardly revenue-generating policy that
they wish by eliminating that neutrality
that's that's always going to be the
game because that's why we've been
seeing so many little pushes and little
little policy changes from major
companies Verizon relocking smartphones
you know they're trying to see what they
can get away with and how how far they
can push the public in individual steps
and they can push the public pretty far
on tech stuff they don't the American
populace does not pay attention to tech
like they should so it won't be soon
after the official repeal that I think
we'll see these corporations start the
process of changing a policy but at the
same time you're not wrong we're leading
into a midterm election with a very
unpopular current administration they
would be foolish to push too far right
before a potential change of control or
change of power in the House of
Representatives because then they would
be changing policy at exactly the time
that they would be under the most
scrutiny from Congress so again I think
it's gonna be to their to their benefit
not that I have any faith that they'll
do this well but it'll be to their
benefit to slow play this to make the
American population feel secure that
nothing bad is going to happen before
they start driving up prices start
throttling services and start
restricting access at the same time they
also have to spend a lot of money
lobbying and placating politicians which
is why we need to be ever more vigilant
as consumers and enthusiasts of
technology I mean there are concerns
here I mean how long are they going to
do this for because we have elections
every major elections every two years
they can't just say oh we're gonna do
this on month 17 in between healthcare
again and infrastructure and and what
what not like there's just a whole again
you said it moving parts it's crazy yeah
and this is also another thing too is
you know from the corporation standpoint
it's infuriating watching pendulum swing
politics happen every two and four years
like if you try and incorporate
structure and you try and get
ship moving in one direction then two
years later a new administration or a
new crop of senators and congressmen
come into play and start start really
dismantling the things that you were
going to be basing your corporate policy
on then it becomes extremely difficult
to have long term forecasts and long
term long term goals that make any kind
of sense that's why these companies
would prefer bait like case law or
legislative law and they as opposed to
just proclamations from some good dance
yeah no that's so really what I was
driving towards I totally agree with you
there so with that's with the news over
and done with let's hit up some meal why
don't we got two really great really
great emails here so I'm going to take a
stab at both of these yeah indeed so
let's start off with Wasim sookay
talking about Mac Book math books and
what not hate duels in want
I like the discussion about a possible
$7.99 math book and I believe Apple
should bring out such a math book for no
other reason then who else can possibly
compete with Microsoft Windows Intel and
AMD and laptop race Linux has it's very
specific fans I'm a partial fan of Linux
but would like to see a macbook be more
price competitive with Windows laptops
and I think there's still some things
you can't do on a cut-down version of
windows and chrome unless if Apple does
do a cheaper in that book they'll do it
right well I think um I think Lewis
Lewis rossmann that Apple repair tech
would likely disagree that Apple can do
it right I just saw one of his more
recent videos detailing like the last 15
years of MacBook construction and how
like every single Mac has had these
amazing problems but don't you see
Johnston's like the the the celebrity of
point recently just from being you know
that that's stupid a butterfly switch
article for the outline right but he was
even talking about
things like the original MacBook that
claimed to have a unibody design
actually didn't glue point that the fans
would melt the glue and then cause your
screen to snap you're like holy crap I
remember that you know these people
talking about their unibody MacBook
slike having these snapping hinges but I
digress
the thing that I really wish Apple would
do is come back to the iBook you have
branding there you have an iMac and you
have a Mac Pro you have a macbook why
not have an iMac and then you would
instantly train the consumer to
understand that that was gonna be a
medium to your product it was gonna
probably be made out of like poly carbs
and plastics and lower weight um you
know you didn't need to have
bleeding-edge processor and storage
storage designs you could glue that
thing shut just like every other laptop
manufacturers now sealing preventing
consumers from getting into the guts of
their machine I think Apple could do
really well reviving the iBook and also
having sort of a nostalgia campaign
about Oh remember how funky-fresh these
plastic laptops used to be in clam
shells and fun fun funky colors and
people dancing have to acknowledge what
a computer was because apparently
post-millennial children have no idea
what computers are eff that already
passed that in their own marketing
timeline into their own universe like
they kid it has to fit the head Canon
Man the Apple reality distortion
alternate universe um no but I think III
I would be very surprised if Apple ever
undercut the the luxury idea of a
MacBook that if you if you put MacBook
on a product it should be a high-end
premium device so I don't think they
should water down that branding because
again one of the major things Apple has
going for it is the emotional
relationship with brands brands like
iPhone brands like macbook brands like
iMac but I think you could make a huge
argument to have a new
super-clean lower-cost I book in your
Apple store sitting right next to an
iMac and I think running an hour based
processor or something like that yeah
consumers would instantly recognize the
value there and you could probably like
to your point and again you're you beat
me by by just a couple of sentences
there giuls to that point you could also
use the iBook as your leverage to start
moving laptop consumers more towards an
iOS style ecosystem imagine an iBook
which is essentially an I an iPad with a
clamshell keyboard touchscreen modular
design arm powered mostly app focused
you beefed up some of the stuff would
totally be a watered down experience and
my name is Tim Cook but I think you
could make a big plan I think consumers
would join you I I would be excited
about something like that
being a lower cost maybe you know again
in that five to seven hundred dollar
territory but make it an iPad laptop and
people will trip over themselves to say
how revolutionary how forward-thinking
yes this is this is a good fit in every
single way that most tech pundants
pooped all over windows 10s Windows 10 s
was too early Microsoft doesn't have the
apps no one wants this but Apple can do
this right will be the commentary and I
think you could make a huge play by
reviving the iBook name I'm just being
too much of a cynic for the 7-segment
let's move on to a meal Matthew Eskander
who writes greetings I happen to have
come across a verge article claiming
that high megapixel count on selfie
cameras doesn't really matter having
been already mentioned on many reputable
sources of office release of its F 7
selfie master phone so because of course
it has to be the selfie master I was
kind of wondering what's your say to
this direction on evolving selfie
megapixel count pocket now subscribers
since 2015 and still rocking it cheers
and more power to all of you so thank
you a meal from that well and yeah
you read the The Verge article I I
caught it just it was just a quick no it
was a quick rundown of oh it less lights
more megapixels and because well they
don't say in the article itself but just
because sensor size is you know as small
as it is for a selfie sensory typically
it's not really gonna be effective in
low light and that's where a lot of
selfies are taken so fair points there's
only going to be so much that like a
screen flash would do yeah so we pretty
aggressive about putting in things like
front-facing flashes yeah and they're
there they're getting into the whole AI
thing and you're just making sure that
people know that their cameras are
smarter it can output brighter stuff
without but less noise and whatnot so I
don't know there's a gives them gives
and takes yeah I read this article this
is from Jacob Katherine Castro nacos
I've probably mispronounced his last
name and I apologize there's one major
part of this article that to your point
there giuls that I feel is completely
lacking and that's when all other
technologies are equal an increase in
resolution will deliver poorer low-light
performance there their article just
sort of takes it for granted that let's
say we had camera sensors with backside
illumination Hardware image
stabilization different sensor sizes a
bigger sensor can soak up more light
than a smaller sensor that a twenty five
megapixel selfie shooter would be
undesirable because of low light
performance so unfortunately even though
they've got this article they could have
spared one extra sentence to say all
other technologies being equal higher
resolution or more pixel dense sensors
perform poorer in low-light environments
but I think they've also missed some
other aspects here or or I feel like we
could be having a chicken in the egg
debate they make the verge makes a point
out of calling out certain types of
consumer behaviors like you take your
selfie picture and you don't want to see
the pores in your face or you don't want
to do a lot of cropping and that's what
resolution sensors are for and I I think
I would be inclined to agree we don't
see a lot of people doing a ton of
cropping or a ton of really close-up
editing on selfie photos but is that
because they don't want to do that or is
it because selfie cameras don't deliver
images that are worth editing or
cropping you know you know so they go on
to mention you know a Samsung selfie
camera might only have an 8 megapixel
sensor
well if Samsung delivered a 20 megapixel
front facing shooter do you think we'd
maybe see a few more people editing or
cropping and I think I think we could I
think we might you know I think that
could be something that some people
might be interested in but there's
always so much field of view to crop
from but practically speaking be it has
yeah you'd be taking a chance on a
better quality selfie and I also can see
you yeah go ahead go and finish your
point you know just one thing about you
know more face facial recognition
features as as people just keep bond
shove them in like you like it means
nothing to them but you know just having
more pixels and being you know if you're
able to ensure at least a certain amount
of accuracy just by having more pixels
and being able to selectively choose
which ones would be your data points for
the facial map then yeah I mean I see it
as a good potential yeah so the other
thing that I would point to in this
article is is also taking certain
behaviors for granted in a context of
the the the forward reach of
computational photography and
computational editing you know looking
at looking at different players so so
you were saying field of view if I pull
out a Sony Xperia like I've spent some
time with the xz1 the XE one actually
has a really wide lens and
computationally does a great job of
changing the sort of fisheye look of
your photos from the actual lens into
something that's a more normal field of
view so if I had that on a twenty five
megapixel sensor I could shoot a lot
wider
and then have much better resources to
crop in on an image that I thought
looked good for me and the person that I
was with or trying to capture some
element in the background and again that
software you know you don't need three
different camera sensors to achieve that
like the experiment the early experiment
with the LG v10 I'm having multiple
front-facing camera shooters just so you
could have different focal length lenses
but the last thing kind of comes down
into where we're seeing trends go with
phones like the pixel if you have a
twenty five megapixel camera sensor you
can do things like pixel bin much more
effectively so you can capture a higher
quality lower resolution image by
combining the pixel data of a higher
resolution camera and arriving at a
lower resolution final output depending
on what articles you reaks I did a
little homework on this you can expect
something akin to a four to one
signal-to-noise ratio which helps
significantly when it comes to capturing
selfie or capturing any kind of photo in
indoor lighting or in low-light
conditions I don't worry that over
that's gonna give us that but that's
another potential like what we see on
Sony rear cameras where the normal rear
camera delivers an 8 megapixel image but
it's got a 23 megapixel sensor and
that's because they're taking all of
that raw data cramming it down into a
more social media friendly file size and
then also getting the benefit of
increasing the amount of information per
pixel decreasing the noise per pixel and
arriving at a higher quality image for
that image reduction again I don't think
Oppo is gonna do that but there would be
the potential to do something like that
if you're investing in a more pixel
dense front-facing camera how would you
compare pixel bidding to just having a
larger pixel say oh well they'll let you
drink your your water for a little break
and then I'll ask you about that yeah no
kidding so this this is all determined
again but it's it's tough to have a good
answer to that because we have so many
different technologies to
princes and sensor sizes I you know like
is it a backside illuminated camera
sensor is it an optically image
stabilized camera sensor is it a rapid
burst camera sensor something that can
clear information radically quickly so
that you can so that you can smash
together for raw files into one final
image and and maximize light and
minimize noise that way there are so
many different data points that we would
look at but ultimately yeah so many of
these great technologies that can be
used in some in some ideal cases all at
once especially with dedicated ISPs that
are supposed to be AI enhanced again
these days well but but but again if we
could hypothetically come up with the
situation where somehow we had exactly
the same sensor size exactly the same
sensor technologies and exactly the same
support technologies like oh is and the
only difference was individual photo
site size then we would I think we would
arrive at something where the
differences would be negligible you know
so let's say you had let's say again
you'd want to keep it somewhat
consistent so you you would you would
have a camera that had like 8 megapixels
on a certain surface area and one that
had 32 megapixels on the same surface
area then when you pixel bin we should
expect that the differences in photo
site should be nearly the same you know
a four to one image reduction so that
should be pretty close and again we're
talking about scientific differences to
the human eye which the human I probably
couldn't detect and then you would also
have the benefit of being able to shoot
in good light at 32 megapixel and Mecca
pickles haha that one I didn't do on
purpose on 32 megapixels whereas the
other camera would still be stuck at an
8 megapixel image so you start playing
with some of these differences like I'm
wrapping up my time with the honor of
you 10 and even just doing simple simple
crops you know like I've got a little
bit more room to manipulate an image
than I do on a samsung because there's a
resolution advantage on this phone that
costs
dollars less you know so again it's it's
never a one-to-one this is good this is
bad and this is why I feel the verge
article is looking at one specific data
point and as blinders on to the
realities of all of the other mechanics
at play when what makes a good camera
and especially how important software is
to this whole equation now the the the
post-processing and the software
manipulation of our images is kind of
the biggest deal going right now for
manufacturers as to what makes a good
camera on what makes a poor camera just
focusing on the resolution isn't
necessarily it isn't in my opinion very
constructive well-well put a resolution
on this podcast from basically the verge
is wrong so that is the resolution of
this podcast the verge is wrong gene
caress the neck is some some name I'm
sorry sir but you are wrong and that is
the stance of the pocket at weekly well
but but you know again it's is I I have
one piece in my upcoming view ten camera
review it doesn't really matter I mean
however good you make the highest end
bestest selfie camera
it still pales in comparison to even a
lot of entry-level phones rear-facing
camera like why if you really like
taking pictures of yourself get good at
using the rear camera and you will take
substantially better pictures of
yourself I can't stress this enough get
a little practice in shooting blind and
your your photo quality improves
tremendously for the final output these
these facing cameras are really only
good at keeping you looking at someone
in a video call that's that's that's my
my main opinion on it I totally agree
Quan I mean the thing is you're joking
but you've wind up a pretty good shot
Jules and I know you've got another web
cam to help you do that but now that you
see where the camera is in relation to
your face it only takes remember to
remember
hilarious so anyway yeah that's that's
my feeling on it
selfie cameras shouldn't be given any of
the we shouldn't be focusing overall on
phone design to the degree that we have
and if you delivered a phone tomorrow
that didn't even have a selfie camera it
would affect me very very little in the
overall use of my phone the biggest
bummer would be no video calls and I'm
pretty sure I could get over it I don't
I don't think it would be a complete
deal-breaker for me I'm definitely a
minority there but you know these these
cameras are virtually kind of terrible
so yeah Oppo the selfie master they
they're they are the masters of you so
can be you can be the master of the the
worst feature on a phone you are the
best of the worst good job yeah before
you incriminate yourself a little bit
more cuz of every single manufacturer
who might want to send a phone to pocket
now folks there you have it another
episode of the pocket now weekly has
come and gone want to throw a huge shout
out because again this was a listener
mailbag week and we got some great
emails to talk about definitely keep
those coming our way join the
conversation in the live chat during the
broadcast using the pn weekly hashtag or
if you're listening to this after the
fact hit that email podcast at
pocketnow.com this show is over but the
conversation continues on twitter where
you can find jules as at point jewels
and i'm humbly at some gadget guy pocket
now is around the web on twitter
instagram facebook google+ youtube and
our home site pocketnow.com
it shows like this cannot exist without
your support sharing the weekly with
your friends who love mobile technology
and dropping reviews anywhere you can
review a podcast so we can help get more
eyes and ears on the show once again we
want to thank this week's sponsor
intercom again intercom dot-com slash
growth to help you qualify leads and
schedule demos and really get some of
this manual work done for you and you
business I you know they're helping us
keep the lights on but ultimately there
wouldn't be a show if it weren't for our
listeners and subscribers who have kept
us on the air since 2012 the PocketNow
weekly we'll be back next week with all
kinds of delicious technology goodness
- make sure you tune back in man I'm
just reading about Sprint and t-mobile
going into a twenty six billion dollar
deal perhaps on Sunday so yeah more
