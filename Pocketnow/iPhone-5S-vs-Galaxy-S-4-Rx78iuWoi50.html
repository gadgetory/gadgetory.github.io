smartphones in the world and they are
also the dilemma that many of you are
facing should I get the new Galaxy or
the new iPhone well let's find out which
one is right for you
I'm high memory beta this is it now
and this is iPhone 5s versus the Galaxy
s4 this is one of the most difficult
comparisons ever since these two devices
have very little in common except for
three things
they're both iterative updates of their
predecessors they are both very powerful
devices and they are also polarizing
phones that are either loved or hated by
everyone their hardware is a clear
example of just how different these two
phones are Apple's iPhone 5s retains the
same aluminum and glass design of last
year's model with the exception of some
low-light enhancements the camera a new
a7 64-bit processor that's yet to be
proven and there are a new touch ID
fingerprint scanner that state of the
art for the most part by contrast
Samsung's Galaxy s4 retains the same
plastic design of last year's model with
some minor refinements on the curves a
much better camera significantly better
and the adoption of the Snapdragon 600
processor in our AT&amp;amp;T unit here I won't
bore you with comparing specification or
benchmarks side-by-side because that
wouldn't be fair especially with the
iPhone an existing four bit processor
but both devices performed great in
daily and hardcore usage and really
that's what matters I think the whole
discussion of AMOLED versus IPS or RGB
versus pentile is over both devices have
great displays with great color
reproduction great viewing angles and
awesome pixel density so obviously the
galaxy s4 abides to a better 1080p
standard the question here is if you
want bigger not so big and the other
question you're left with us if you want
plastic and hyper glazed or aluminum
some people consider aluminum to be
better build quality but neither of
these is scratch nor dent proof if you
will use them so I like plastic as much
as I like aluminum it really depends on
you now I'll tell you this much apple's
choice of colors with the 5s the tears
fingerprints much better than samsung's
hyper glaze if that's really an issue
for you
the Galaxy s4 is more suited for those
interested in a better multimedia
experience with less compromises since
the displays a full inch bigger than the
iPhones it has expandable storage up to
64 gigabytes and a replaceable battery
and yes this phone is big by the
standards of many the iPhone by contrast
is more suited for those wanting a
simpler experience with great one-handed
usage since this device is very easy to
handle and it is small by most people's
standards
there's nothing expandable here as well
so there is one less thing to worry
about for most people keep all these
things in mind when choosing between
these devices when it comes to hardware
now both of these devices were actually
designed to disappear in your hand and
are more focused on giving you a more
comfortable software experience sadly
that is also a significantly different
thing in both these devices on the
galaxy s4 we have Android 4.2.2 covered
by Samsung's proprietary version of
TouchWiz which is either loved or hated
by many I personally don't like TouchWiz
because it seems more toy like in my
opinion but I will hand it to Samsung's
for providing as a very reliable
experience there are minor stutters here
and there but you'll hardly ever be
bothered by them the biggest selling
point of this phone is how many things
you can do even though you won't
actually use half of the things you can
actually do with it most of them are
actually gimmicks Samsung includes air
gesture to hover through photos or pages
even though it's easier to do this with
your thumb and air view which allows you
to see messages without entering them
which is actually cool and comes from
the Galaxy don't line up aside from that
you get smart features like smart
scrolling smart stay which some are good
some are not usable at all I personally
turn them off the only feature I do
praise very highly a Samsung's multi
window support buying a big display is
pointless if things are just bigger you
actually want to do more with that
display and Samsung actually allows you
to multitask between different
applications in a very smart way here
Apple's iOS 7 is a complete departure to
TouchWiz what Samsung gives you an
abundance Apple gives you in refinement
this is no version of the OS is more
grown
more aesthetically pleasing and even
more feature-packed than its predecessor
yet simple it wasn't designed for you to
show off hovering gestures to anyone but
instead to focus on doing what it can do
quite well logical enhancements like
control center or the photo gallery are
much needed and actually quite cool but
there isn't really anything that the
iPhone can do that the galaxy can't do
the difference is that for example the
keyboard on iOS is extremely reliable
when it comes to text prediction and the
galaxy keyboard is just terrible
I had to install SwiftKey out of the box
but other than that again iOS is not
about cramming features but more about
giving you the features that matter and
making them work quite well when it
comes to software it's really hard to
recommend one more than the other both
platforms have the healthiest ecosystems
you can buy and yeah I won't bore you
comparing Siri with s voice because it's
just the waste of time more on the side
of s voice still you get Google now on
both these phones so there's really
nothing to worry about in that end in
the end if you want more and not
necessarily better Samsung is your best
pick and if you want more refined and
not necessarily limited then iOS is your
best pick the only worry I have with
Samsung is that they've become really
slow when it comes to updating their
Android software and then in the case of
the iPhone that's really never going to
be a problem now what's it like to
actually use these phones on a daily
basis in a word it's actually great both
devices are awesome performers in daily
tasks and awesome performers and hard
core tasks we tested them with games
like asphalt 8 and neither of them have
heat problems or stutter problems when
it comes to performance on these games
are in their hardcore daily usage I mean
I really have no complaints and its
touch ID cool enough to pick the 5s over
the GS 4 well that actually depends on
you I've come to love the feature
because I am a password type of person
the 5s rarely gets it wrong and it works
in seconds sadly the Galaxy s4 does not
have a fingerprint scanner but and again
if you're not a password type of person
then you won't have to miss this and
again if you like pens you will be
covered battery life on both these
devices is quite similar there will get
you through the day
that's pretty much it the only great
thing about the Galaxy s4 is you get a
replaceable power pack as long as you
buy one now they're cameras are a topic
of unfair comparison I say unfair
because obviously the 5s is six months
newer than the Galaxy s4 and they like
these are two of my favorite camera
phones great color reproduction great
level of detail and just amazing photos
overall now when it comes to low-light
photography the iPhone 5s just destroys
the galaxy s4 even without optical image
stabilization the larger pixels do mean
cleaner and usable photos with the 5s
whereas in the galaxy s4 the photos in
low-light are just unusable and when it
comes to flash
well not everybody likes flash photos I
personally don't like them but both
phones perform quite similar in call
quality again I found the 5s to sound
significantly veteran colors felt the
same this you know just follows my
complaint with Galaxy phones the list
date I have not found a galaxy phone
that has been call quality and the same
case happens with the galaxy s4 now both
devices have awesome speakers their
speakers sound louder than normal and I
do recommend them for speaker phone
calls and even yeah listening to music
but then again for phone calls the
iPhone 5s has the edge so autumn line
iPhone 5s or galaxy s4 well I'll tell
you this much you won't go wrong with
either both are great performers though
the iPhone 5s just push the bar with
their camera technology and touch ID
still the galaxy s4 is no slouch when it
comes to the added software features and
I'm sure most of you will like these
things if you're out there for a better
multimedia experience a bevy of software
added features in little to no
compromise when it comes to hardware the
galaxy s4 is definitely your best pick
but if you're out there for a more
refined than focused experience with a
future-proof camera and security and
probably better build quality in the
opinion of some the iPhone 5s is
definitely your pick as well

s4 and the iPhone 5s thank you very much
