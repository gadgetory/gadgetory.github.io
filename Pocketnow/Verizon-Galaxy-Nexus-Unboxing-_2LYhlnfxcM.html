now calm we just got the new verizon
galaxy nexus so we're going to unbox it
all you are now it would seem what we've
got here is more of a reviewer aspersion
box since there's very little branding
here there's a little beveled verizon
logo there and just some package
contents listing on the back so we got
the nexus battery USB well let's not
spoil it let's just open it so there you
go and we have sure which end is up but
top comes off and there's some red
coloring on the inside and there's the
Galaxy Nexus and if you have questions
you can go to VZW calm / Galaxy Nexus
here's the device with plastic on the
front and back pretty nice let's set
that over there for now and let's see
what's inside here well nothing in there
it's just a holder master your device
there's our documentation warranty is
the thickest one got that
and this one is our little booklet
changing the battery all right that's
good what else we got is our micro USB
cable got open this and how does this
look just your normal USB cable little
lip on the end but that makes it easier
to pull out and here's your headphones
let's see what kind these are ok we got
the little rubbery in your kind which I
personally do not like not very
comfortable for me but you may like them
and here's the microphone with one
button that looks like a answer button
pretty good and then we have a charger
and that's it there's your charger with
a USB plug nice and compact that travels
well I'm sure all right and there's your
unboxing let's just do some little size
comparisons while we got it out so
Galaxy Nexus and let's just see how
compares with the focus s bit taller bit
thicker bit heavier imagine the
batteries already in there and here's
the infuse 4g also from samsung similar
size there but the Galaxy Nexus is
thicker and heavier
alright so stay tuned for our next video
where we will take a closer look at the
hardware and talk more about that if you
join this video give us a thumbs up and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
