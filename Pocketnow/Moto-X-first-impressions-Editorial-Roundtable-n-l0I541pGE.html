decor of the office welcome to pocket
now live everybody this is a special
edition we are talking Moto X the
biggest deal for motorola i guess since
the droid ultra which shows and Hounds
not to recently we've got a bunch of the
coolest guys I know around here we've
got Adam down hi may Rivera Michael
Fisher and Stephen shank I am on a
rocking chair so if you see my picture
moving back and forth that's why it's
unintentional unintentional so Michael
has a phone and I want to start off with
a question and I want Michael to answer
it first real quick let's pre frame this
the motorola x is a mid-range phone that
is available in a wide variety of color
combinations which is very unique in the
industry well my question to you Michael
is who is this phone for this phone is
and I will apologize to viewers for my
noise level right now I'm in a coffee
shop right next to the venue where the
Moto X was announced in New York City
it's the same coffee shop I spend some
time with Taylor Martin who with before
he worked for pocket now and with our
friends at board that works i'm having a
great time just right loud in here the
moto x is not for any of you I think
that's the main takeaway from this six
knots per that's not for us it's not for
our typical audience it is for the mass
market if I had counted the number of
times motorola said mass market in this
announcement i would have been well i
wouldn't have been taking real notes but
the thing is they are pushing this thing
at everyone who wouldn't buy a nexus
basically it's going to be available on
all five US carriers by the top of
September and it's going to be rather
affordable at 199 suggested retail on
contract but it's for normal people and
it has features for normal people that's
that's funny now are there any features
that a power user might enjoy or is this
kind of like a kind of water down phone
with just the basics yeah so so first of
all here's the device itself this is the
Moto X in the box and when Jesus who
just got shot and when you when you pop
open the box
what happens is you get a phone app here
and we have the unboxing up on YouTube
and all this kind of stuff we have three
videos on YouTube right now showing
various aspects of the device but yeah
this is the this the black one and the
feature that we spent the most time on
we got a wonderful tour from Motorola's
product manager telling us all these
kinds of things but it's the voice
activation feature the ok Google now a
bit and so have you tested that I
haven't because I've been too busy
editing video and as usual the venue was
too loud to do it but it's funny because
so what the deal is if you're not
familiar the phone is always listening
and it's always listening for a keyword
and the keyword the key phrase can't be
changed in its oh ok Google now or ok
Google now I want to do stuff I don't
know if this is on I don't make it on
it's not even set up yet but the point
is you don't have to press a button to
activate it the phone doesn't have to be
in a specific mode it doesn't have to be
awake it just needs to be within 10 feet
and it's always listening from the key
phrase that is actually quite handy
considering like your phone can be in
your pocket your phone can be ohad
across the room and you want to set your
alarm clock and without getting up it's
very futuristic I wonder how sensitive
it is because if it's true that the
phone can be across the room that's
really awesome I also wonder if one's
listening all the time it could take
signal and battery life right and that
was one of the first questions that we
were at some impress people including
myself asked at this wonderful QA where
it was a very very genial atmosphere
everyone was just like yeah interrupts
just come on what's your question um
even with that feature turned on and the
other stuff that Motorola is talking
about with this phone they are claiming
24 hours of useful battery life which
coming from another OEM I'd be like okay
whatever but from Motorola we know these
guys know how to make good batteries
right then that now one question Michael
that that feature you know turning that
phone on is only for Google now meaning
I can't be like phone turn on launch
text messages or you can't do that it
was only for Google now no you can do
that you can launch third-party apps you
can set calendar appointments you can
divide them yeah you can set reminders
all that is anyone else super concerned
about this being a security issue I mean
is a kid going to go on the loudspeaker
and Motorola stores say okay
now the legal contacts and everything I
think I mean this is your voice Irwin
alright so yes security was was brought
up and some people were asking well how
do what do you do if you keep a lock on
your screen and you can set permissions
for what you want the phone to respond
to when it is locked if you use a lock
code there are some features that will
get around it there some features that
won't and you know the phone is supposed
to get to know your voice like if to
train it so but will only reply your
voice in theory but um that totally
didn't work at the demo pick somebody
else maybe guy was like just try it you
know I'm sorry that I've forgotten the
product managers name but he was like
yeah somebody else tried 8c won't
respond to you and then somebody in the
press with a totally different voice was
like okay Google now what's the time and
the phones like oh the times you know
1230 I want to jump I wouldn't jump into
the main feature really of the Moto X
which is the customizability you can
choose to front face colors black or
white you can choose 18 back colors and
what is it five accent colors do along
with that it's 77 trim colors to go
along with it and the trim is to find as
the the keys on the side and the little
kind of bezel thing and then the camera
trim ya know but that's really
interesting because historically we've
had black and white phone lumia maybe
the upcoming iPhone 5c or whatever and
we're going to have some color choices
but the motorola x takes it to another
level and my question and I'm gonna ask
Adam this did motorola answer a question
that nobody asked or they are they
really onto something do people really
want a lime green back phone with the
red accent and black front foot well i
would say if people don't want that than
all the iphone kiosks and you know you
needed can't hear you and here you are
mute Adams keep stopping yeah Adam you
should though if you start up his voice
we can hear you that stop typing hello
I'm not read it yeah the kiosks you were
saying that if if people don't want this
then all the iphone kiosks are like
basically dead so you're saying okay uh
um you hear me now well yeah yes okay so
yeah where that is if people don't want
that then all the kiosks and every mall
in America that sell these different
colored cases different phones are way
off base I'm just not sure that people
want to commit to a certain color scheme
they might want to buy a twenty-dollar
case this week in a twenty-dollar case
the next week and you know rotate it
that way well you have to explain this
area there's such a huge industry
surrounding color changing options I
mean just the iphone front and back way
that you say Adam industry is is huge
there's every mall has a kiosk work in
five minutes you can get a new front and
back plate but and cases are obviously a
mega huge industry but my question is
personally I like to have a black or
white phone because if i get a cyan
phone or a yellow phone this question is
going to Michael next I would get tired
of it because even though the first
month or two on my tan then cyan is just
hot it's unique after mom 3 i'm like
this doesn't match my awesome pink shirt
this doesn't like you look good on a
table anymore Michael do you think
people really want to live with such
unique color choices for the length of
their contract from a man you know
article well to use a tired analogy and
one that Motorola actually used at the
event I mean people do that already but
you know maybe not met with phones but
they do it with cars which are a much
more substantial investment people get
funky colors and cars they get funky
customized sneakers another thing that
Motorola was talking about today so yeah
I think there's a market for this I I do
and the maybe you know maybe after a
year and a half all these colors will be
tired people will be like God I wish I
got a I wish they'd just let me change
the color all the time but the process
of selecting your color looks so easy
and so fun using the Moto picker or
whatever they call it it's it I think
people are gonna get sold on the
experience right up front and they're
gonna like seized on the value of it and
love it the right initially it is it is
a unique process that we haven't seen
before usually you by phone off the
shelf for this way maybe you can come or
emotionally
to it even think about this idea of
color on a phone I'm also kind of
wondering if the model of ordering a
phone enough ahead of time to get it
customized is going to be such hot
action so what's the turnaround time
once you place your order four days I'm
is four days that's correct yeah and
thats four days for it to reach your
door or four days for it to start
shipping that's four days for it to door
to door and that's why motorola it's one
of the reasons motorola established this
giant plant in fort worth which i've
heard is an old nokia plant but i
haven't confirmed that but anyway yeah
it's it's one of the big reasons the big
push behind this assembled in USA thing
is so that that ordering can happen and
i should note here that the moto x is
made for other markets non-american
markets will be made unless we're yes ok
ok so what we have is so what we have is
let me just understand because there's a
question on our youtube comments right
now from i'll see these were born
everybody's asking is this a replaceable
backplate it's not right you gotta
replace Welbeck plated you order it and
it comes and this this does not come off
at all this is all integrated and single
unit okay so i guess the biggest
question is so we have a non-replaceable
black backplate and you know even you
make a solid point you know you make a
much larger investment in buying that
blue honda that i have parked right
there at the driveway and that's the
color that I chose so they do have a
point it's just we've been used to I
guess 15 to 20 years of cell phones
where that hasn't really been the case
and and in computers it's the same case
I mean I guess we're just not used to
that mentality or else everybody would
be wearing a blue watch or a red watch I
guess I guess there are certain things
that we just don't want in a specific
color that's not your point Michael we
made a big deal about how the phone is
crap that they always everyone always
does this but they seem to have made a
phone that feels particularly good in
your hand how does it feel in the hand
is it is it better than anything you've
ever felt or is it kind of like an HTC
One smaller in the hand the phone feels
quite nice now
a surprising thing about this i
mentioned this in the hands on that just
went out is that this is only 130 grams
it's the same exact weight as a mass as
a galaxy s4 but it feels so much more
substantial and that's because it's a
smaller device overall but it feels
great this texture on the back sort of
echoes Motorola's soft soft touch Kevlar
kind of stuff even though it's not the
phone really really does feel quite good
in the hand might not be the best phone
i've ever felt with sex oh wait a second
sorry I man it's got this dimple to
where you put your finger which is Oh
something every phone should have you
see that a dimple for your fingers
simple for your finger okay Michaels so
you're saying that this phone is not
nano-coated no Kevlar not now no i
didn't i didn't say it's not
nano-coating I never said that it is it
is in fact nano coated so it is splasher
system ok ok so it is so so I guess that
it varies from previous motorola
technology in just the fact that it
doesn't have the Kevlar right instead
it's they're calling up this composite
material on the on the back here and i
have yet to look into it further i don't
want to say anything that's wrong but
it's not it's not the kevlar microwave
that we're used to seeing unlike the
droid models this is a totally different
design language and you can see that
little curve there which which it just
it really does feel comfortable in the
hand i have to say i think a lot of
people are going to think that way to
and from the front it kind of looks like
a nexus 4 it looks identical to a nexus
4 seriously one on the more on the more
extreme end Michael you put up a video
showing the screen looks darn good there
with the am alone by the way because
blacks need to look at those deeply I
gotta set this up so we can actually see
the thing go ahead and ran away on the
workstream and Michael you were showing
off some wood back panels that are gonna
be coming out in in later in quarter for
I I've never seen a wood phone and I
think I haven't seen one for a reason
because it's a little bit garden what
did you think when you saw the wood
phone was a kind of lame or was it like
wow they're really on to something here
so I saw the wood phones when I was on
my way over across the demo floor to go
do something else and I stopped and I
spent like 10 minutes
just shooting video of the wooden phones
because it's not like they're just like
okay here's the throw away wood thing
they have four different kinds of wood
including like ebony and red wood and
bamboo and like their you know that they
went out of their way to make it cool
and it's like you don't just get a wood
phone you get a wood phone that's like
the the right shade for you and the wood
is coated so it doesn't get you know dry
rot or whatever just just don't change
your king it that's probably this was
probably a good joke at a man in here
yes a okay i guess i guess my biggest
and we were target about this with
Steven recently um I guess my biggest
concern with this is okay so if you
always wanted a wooden phone this is
your chance but the problem is you won't
be able to buy it now you're gonna have
to wait until q4 and I hate that
mentality where they come and they
announce this really cool new unique
thing but now you have to wait until q4
by the time to your point gets here by
the time q4 gets here we're gonna have
the iphone 5 we're gonna have so many
phones in the market which the iphone is
pretty much the phone for everybody else
I guess let's let's admit that oh so I
mean is this phone really gonna stand a
chance if people are gonna have to wait
for the phone the unique fellow that
they want and then they're gonna be
hotter phone finder that happens there's
a couple parts to the answer and I think
that it's gonna depend as it often does
on the advertising on the marketing push
this is not this was not confirmed today
by any means a lot of people were
reporting a possible five hundred
million dollar ad push behind this thing
is that correct soon I have been seen
that figure about that I had believed it
somebody was tossing that around and if
that happens and this thing is going to
probably blow up because the only way
for a phone to sell in the millions is
because there's so much noise in the
smartphone industry is if the company
spends hundreds of millions of dollars
on advertising and you look at samsung
and apple and HTC hasn't really done the
hundreds of millions of dollars on
advertising yet but Motorola's going to
do that if they want it to be mass
market they can only do it with a really
rich advertising spending is blanketing
the world with Motorola X advertisements
but even if they're paying a lot to
advertise it that price could be a deal
I mean one is on 95 yeah but I mean it's
competing against know the one the
galaxy s4 with this have it done better
it launched at you know 1 50 or even 100
yeah a lot that's a good question I
don't think it's I don't think it's dead
on arrival by any means I don't think
we're looking at as serious a price for
paws we did on the Lumia 1020 at 299 but
I really do think that if they push the
right elements on this like this phone
you have to understand guys that even
for us who are geeks and you're used to
this stuff to be in a room where a phone
is just sitting there 10 feet away from
somebody and somebody's like okay Google
now and the phone wakes up I mean that
that's even cool for somebody who's used
to being loud the public is going to be
blown away by this and that combined
with the camera which we have to talk
about and a couple of these other
features I mean this is I saw this
headline on another site and I'm sorry I
don't remember the site but there was a
great headline it was like the what's
this called Leo X from the motivation
the headline was the Moto X is Google's
iphone and is more true it's going to be
more true for this phone than it ever
was for any nexus found a google play
edition all that stuff is for geeks and
developers and enthusiasts this is the
one that's going to be for the consumer
something it's gonna do well speaking of
google play edition they're doing a
google play edition of this phone did
you hear that yeah 66 something in the
google play store actually i haven't
announced pricing yet I'm wrong I'm
wrong on that I'm sorry don't don't
don't scary guys it's not yours yeah
buer sorry too sorry apparently and we
are reading your comments we do know
that some of you are having issues with
our with our livestream this is a
YouTube thing our live stream is working
fine on our end and I just tested it
right now it is working but just so you
know if for any reason this live stream
is broken for you it'll definitely be
live within the next couple of minutes
once we in once we get in broadcasting
you'll be able to watch it you know just
seconds later so just the heads up we
are reading your comments and sadly
that's a YouTube problem that we can't
fix I can jump in here real quick before
we move on Brandon to a different
category well just to close out
availability we're looking at an srp of
1 99 99
contract it's going to be available in
all 50 for us nationals and a fifth
who's never forgot a villa cellular US
cellular yeah but there's another ones
like ting or something like that and
then available end of month too early
September other countries will be
available later we don't know unlocked
in developer versions will become
available 16 and 32 gig version spending
on the carrier no pricing established
after full retail okay what processor
does this have and how much RAM this has
got a very customized piece of hardware
called the x8 which is basically an s4
pro and what its undeserving big hurts
its dual core it's the dual-core s4 pro
writes the dual-core s4 pro but it's
also got so and then it's got the Adreno
320 which were used to saying but it's
got two additional cores that are not on
the same chip so it's not it's a system
it's not an SOC and those two cores one
of them is completely dedicated to
linguistic analysis and that's what
controls the listening and it's a low
power system and then the other one is
dedicated to roping in all the phone's
sensors and using them more
intelligently than a lot of other phones
do like when the the phone was lying on
an ectopic and click over that sent that
core is so that the gyro and all the
accelerometer all that stuff can listen
for these events and then turn on that
special little notification screen you
see in the in the hands-on video that's
awesome that's some pretty good stuff
that is poor pros making a comeback I
thought it had died with the tablet Z
but Nexus 7 is using it the Moto X is
using it the Xperia lineup is using it
but Nexus 7 is doing quad-core right
yeah enjoy vaca mark right yeah and
importantly Motorola has said that all
their optimizations are not confined to
that s4 pro the s for Brosius what they
happen to use in this case they can use
their system that can plug in basically
any CPU they want into their eggs into
that x 8mm architecture so this is say
oh like it sounds like an add-on to give
some Snapdragon 800 like abilities
especially this listening all the time
thing to non 800 chance yeah alright I
guess is it just me guys or do you all
agree yeah I know this phone is not for
all of us but
I don't know for that price tag is it
really Michael do you feel it's worth
the price tag and we can buy an iphone
or galaxy s4 for that money on a wish to
see one and what you get with an iphone
is a very complete very well thought out
very well cooked experience in my
opinion what you get for a the galaxy s4
is not that you get a bunch of features
and half of them work right if if things
on this phone work properly then I think
it'll be it will be worth the price
absolutely I won't know for another
couple days of abuse okay I don't do
this I'm sorry I feel like Adam has been
talked over like 16 tanks out of your
right you can also get an HTC One for
that things are brother hey I'm just
like see it is I I don't know what's
going on with your mic Adam but yeah
you're breaking up every other work we
we lose you how much like it's the
computer go ahead sorry my motion camera
features what's up what's he looking out
the camera how many megapixels what does
it do that's cool how are the photos so
we were theorizing on yesterday's weekly
that the it gets well so 10 megapixel
sensor but we were acting on some rumors
that maybe it was doing some pixel
doubling action to you know to spit out
like two and a half megapixel shots it's
not doing that it is they're calling up
the clear pixel camera we knew this it's
got an extra set of clear pixels and
that the purpose of that that are GBC
imaging is to gather more light while
simultaneously shortening the exposure
time so they had some cool snapshots of
like the product developers children
running around in a fountain and you can
see individual beads of water being shot
up into the air as part of this fountain
and like you can see there's almost no
motion blur even though as kids are like
running dead out it you know it's it's
interesting I mean the shots are 10
megapixel I have yet to try it in low
light if it delivers on its promises of
good low-light performance and fast
exposure time if you know I think it
could out do some phones it might outdo
the one which I like but which kind of
delivers some muddy shots you know a lot
of the time did we find out out of the
the 1080p at 60 frames is confirmed that
is on board you can shoot 1080p at 60
frames let me confirm this with a little
right now I'm reviewers guides whether
that make a difference will someone be
even tell them it's about the things I
don't know what the reason why you want
60 frames is you know slow motion video
you know editing stuff like that that's
really why you want 60 frames your video
size is gonna be twice and it's it's not
gonna be it's a bit complicated but it's
good to have the feature every now and
then yeah it's so worth it i love i love
slo-mo video that's your out of the
galaxy s4 active plummeting into the
bucket of water at the end of my galaxy
s4 active review i shot that with the
HTC One at 60fps and that's why it looks
good um I actually guys I can't confirm
that right now I it does shoot 60fps I
don't know if it's 1080p at 60fps might
be 720 I was about to say I think that's
up it most likely will be 720p I mean
most high-end cameras are still stuck at
that well yeah I mean this isn't it this
thing isn't a GoPro or anything like
that exactly exactly well I think we are
actually running out of things to talk
about which is interesting and good too
because we have a hard stop at five but
it's kind of indicative of the phone
that we're dealing with here I think
Michael said it well when this is not a
phone for us this is a mass market
android device that does some really
cool things the next question I want to
propose and perhaps the last question is
do you think that over time a first you
think that this will set a trend and
color customization is going to become a
thing ah it's you know this is not going
to be the first phone with color
customizations and we've seen no cave
and try replaceable back plates and that
hasn't really taken off um I think that
you know it'll happen it's just not at
that price tag not at the mass market
that they want to cater to unless this
phone is like s you know unless those
features are not gimmicky they don't end
up being gimmicky to the market I don't
think that it's gonna set a trend
because the phone is not going to be hot
enough that's my perspective sadly
there's not enough people are going to
buy it exactly that's my perspective
sadly the phone doesn't that doesn't
have enough to generate enough top of
mine that's just me even if they have
the marketing push what do you think
Adam do you think this is going to start
Rendon phone mom it could I well you're
not hurt after sending his opinions via
postcard i think all right you're him
yes it oh sorry Adam back I'm the guy
who's in a coffee shop in a different
city like on our mobile hotspot and you
guys can hear me yeah um and it does
anybody want to read a story book or
have a blanky I should I should make the
point that before we gloss it over I
this phone is one of only three so far
to use the nano-sim standard so there is
a nano-sim inside here instead of micro
salmon that's a no scissors out
everybody yes very your sharpie is it me
or does this remind you of the HTC tears
yes yes esli exactly okay it's Kentucky
smaller screen size with less than
cutting edge specs but and it's aiming
high concept on its software right
exactly and the the HTC first might have
had a different story to tell if it had
not gotten into bed with with Facebook
and all this kind of stuff but what we
have here is is a phone that's being
it's going to be aggressively pushed by
Google not by HTC and not by people not
by basically people don't want a
facebook phone that was exciting that
hurt my face but also like I mean this
thing is going to sell much better than
the first day I yeah I mean it does so
much more than the first there are so
many more headlines than the first and
there's a company that really cares
about the success of this product I
don't I never got the sense that
Facebook cared that much about the first
I just don't but they still promoted it
heavily and how else would you be better
exposed to like to add then on facebook
everybody's on facebook all the time
yeah I don't know about I don't know
heavily like maybe it was promoted
heavily on facebook that you know
there's only one sector of the thing you
know I mean we need a samsung sized
marketing push to to move phones and if
Google does that I really do think that
this phone and you know I wish I the
white 1i I had asked for the for the
white one book we got we got mixed up
but we thank motorola for the review
unit anyway but um if I had a little if
I'd one of the blue ones i was playing
with before if I had one of the magenta
ones in my hand with a green trim like
it really says something different if
those funds are much more alive and it
gives you a much more positive outlook
on the possible success of this product
they're doing something you know they're
committed to doing something different
and I should add that there was a
picture on the wall of uh i think it was
somebody's like but whatever but the
deal is it was denim they were they were
calling out denim specifically in a
promotional shock and if if they make a
denim back for this phone i will buy it
i will buy a lot of it I could just go I
could just go out to the store that's
like three blocks away and buy a denim
case for my iphone and that'll solve my
problem yeah but then it would also be
really lame you wouldn't be like if just
dumb good I don't know I guess my collar
in the back of my phone like with a
ballpoint pen like I used to do to my
jeans and couple like a whiteboard
backplate dry erase put a note on here
get milk it's a racist issue then that's
the new moto note 3 all right close this
out because we have a hard stop thank
you everyone for watching we want to
know what you think about this let us
know in the comments if the motorola x
for Moto X or whatever they're going it
is going to be something that you're
going to buy we're gonna have a lot more
coverage on at Michael's gonna do review
