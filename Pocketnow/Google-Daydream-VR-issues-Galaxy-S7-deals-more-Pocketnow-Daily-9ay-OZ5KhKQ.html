service might not reach current
flagships a ton of deals are ramping up
to make you go crazy over Memorial Day
and the new ZTE axon 7 proof so you
don't need to break the bank to go
flagship I'm home every veteran from a
very gloomy day in Hong Kong having to
even use it damn balcony this is
PocketNow say Li okay this is going to
be what I call deal Friday because
pretty much everybody is offering
something for Memorial Day let's begin
with t-mobile though that deals not only
gonna last for the weekend or the first
week days right now you can get buy one
get one free on pretty much every single
samsung galaxy that's on t-mobile lineup
meaning yeah the current galaxy s7
galaxy s7 edge are included on the list
and yeah that deal is extremely great
though there are some conditions that
you should follow in the links of the
description another company that's
knocking off some deals over products
I'm not gonna go crazy over are the
Apple watch right now there are select
units on Best Buy that are dropping $200
from that price tag and that is really
crazy I'm not saying that the Apple
watch is worth it but then again I know
a lot of people that are crazy to try to
get a smart watch they want to get the
full Apple experience and the Apple
watch is pretty much the way to go $200
off is compelling even though the next
Apple watch might be just a few weeks
away and if you're in the market for a
very powerful tablet that's also a
computer the two that we most recommend
are the surface pro 4 and surface book
and Microsoft is now dropping the price
tag as well you can get them for as much
as 150 dollars off and remember these
are probably the most powerful computers
you can buy right now for the whole
package that you're getting and so yeah
that is another really compelling deal
the deal to consider and for those of
you that have been following our tour
through China ZTE has showed us probably
one of the hottest phones we've seen yet
the pre-production model that we've been
testing of the axon 7 is every flagship
that you would want but it took the
company a lot for them to tell us what
the price tag was we actually then find
out the price tag until the event and
given the fact that that's the biggest
question we've been getting on the hands
on videos 450 bucks for 450 bucks you
can get pretty much all the
specifications of the galaxy s7 with a
display of the galaxy s7 edge
with pretty much everything and even
they dream compatibility whenever that
comes in the future this is a very hot
phone but the price tag just makes it
even crazier but yeah this is for the 4
gigabyte 64 gigabyte model the 128 gig 6
good model obviously goes higher and
finally the very interesting news - they
have precisely to do with Google's
daydream service as the company's lead
clay Babur was just recently on record
talking about the specifications that
were required for this new product and
obviously he can't mention chipsets yet
or anything but according to him it
seems that all the current flagship
store at least a good deal of them are
not going to be compatible and that's
really weird as pretty much every
flagship in the market currently rocks
the same specification snap try getting
24 gigs of ram quad HD displays so we're
not really understanding exactly what is
missing for these products to provide an
immersive experience especially when
devices already do offer something like
in the case of the gear VR but it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you think that they dream will have a
future if it launches this year and
current products won't be compatible
because I'll tell you this much if this
is gonna be just another one of those
Nexus products that's only gonna work
with Nexus devices whenever they come
out it's gonna flop its gonna really
really flop because people are not gonna
go crazy buying another phone just for a
VR experience they haven't proven but
