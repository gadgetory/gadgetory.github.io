eight pointing to a display without
bezels the LG G six then takes the rumor
mill with a probable glass on glass
design and Snapdragon is now officially
capable of running Windows 10 I'm hi
Mary Vanna and yeah pretty much
everything that's rumored for 2017 has
taken over the news already this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with new organizations the
global virtual reality association is
now in full effect it's just started by
HTC Samsung acer oculus and pretty much
all the heavy hitters that are already
providing virtual reality headsets and
the whole purpose for this company or
association should we call it is to lay
down the rules for what VR headsets
should do and the standards and
everything this is great it's great for
things to get organized let's just wait
they start by making these things
lighter other official news have to do
with the black pearl Samsung Galaxy s7
edge it is now official in select
markets the funny part is that these
select markets are not mentioned yet
what we do know is that there will be an
exclusive 128 gigabyte option that's
also expandable but again we're not even
sure if this thing is going to launch in
the United States so stay tuned we'll
keep you posted now let's call the
spotlight over to the really cool news
Microsoft and Qualcomm have announced
that's Windows 10 is now capable of
running on ARM chips there is a
Snapdragon processor that will be
capable of doing this as of next year
this means a ton of things obviously I'm
not saying that I would really like
Windows 10 in its full way to work on
mobile but given the fact that when
those 10 mobile really needs a boost
into popularity and less of a convoluted
operation this makes a lot of sense it
also makes a lot of sense for less
expensive tablets let's just see what we
get now let's talk about some of the
flagships that we are expecting to get
next year the LG G 6 has taken the
spotlight mainly because the company
really needs to regain its limelight now
we hear some very interesting changes no
modularity we're actually talking about
glass on glass design with this phone we
heard the rumors that there isn't a
removable battery so this makes a lot of
sense we also heard water resistance so
this makes a lot of sense you know what
the cool part is that apparently the
headphone jack is not going anywhere
we'll keep you posted and finally the
interesting news is they have do the
samsung galaxy s a 10 corroboration for
the rumors that we heard yesterday got a
more trusted source now claiming pretty
much that we're getting just a single
lens camera and that the display is
apparently going to take over the whole
design of the s8 edge or whatever this
device is going to be now apparently yes
this home button is going away it's
going to be part of the display but it
seems that this will be a bezel s
display that would be a very beautiful
thing but given the fact that Samsung
has had a very hard time with
experimentation lately we wonder if this
is really going to happen so it leads me
to the question up today do you think
that it's a smart move for samsung to go
all out with a drawing board here and
come up with a really innovative galaxy
s 8 or do you think that the company
should lay low and keep it safe and
regain its limelight with everything
that happened with a note 7 in my case
oh I look up to Samsung for an ovation I
can't wait to see what they come up with
