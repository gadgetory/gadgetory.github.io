headphones do I use for running and by
now I think you've noticed that Jabra is
mostly my go-to brand I'm high net event
I would pocket now here are the quick
look at the Jabra sport pulse
I spend at least two hours at the gym
every day and one of the main reasons
why I've used a lot of Jabra products is
because one they sound great two they
fit great and have been the only ones
that have really survived how much I can
sweat what's hot about the Jabra pulse
is that these are not conventional
headphones these actually include a
permanent heart rate monitor that saves
you the need to carry a chest strap to
calculate your workouts and then there's
the optional Jabra Sport application
that keeps track of your workouts
including training routines you can also
control these trainings with the button
that's on the left ear and provide
results through information that even
includes your training zones I also
really love the fit and the headphones
include a couple of attachments to help
you accommodate these to your needs and
this adequate fit allows these
headphones to sound amazing probably the
best sound that I've heard for fitness
headphones which are usually not that
good what's not hot about these
headphones is really the fact that this
job report application doesn't
necessarily sync with services like
Google Fit which creates a walled garden
and complicates the usage of the heart
rate data with other applications like
Nike Plus for example you might find the
$200 price tag to be steep but out of
experience testing sport products from
bose and other competitors I actually
find that I get a lot of bang for my
buck with these headphones not
necessarily because of the heart rate
monitor but because of the amazing sound
they provide whether these headphones
are right for you depends on your needs
but I will admit that I really love the
Jabra sport pulse so far folks we've got
