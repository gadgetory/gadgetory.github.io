and this is the blue pure Excel yes blue
is mostly known for budget smartphones
but this device is actually one you
should pay attention to 2015 has been
blues Bowl this year when it comes to
design and hardware improvements and
this phone is proof of the company's
evolution for starters believe it or not
the blue pure excel is not only huge in
dimensions but also sports gorgeous and
very powerful hardware the gold finish
on our review unit here is actually a
combination of the metallic border met
with a plastic back that's so well built
it's really hard to tell the difference
when you hold it in your hand this frame
houses a gigantic six-inch W quad HD
Super AMOLED panel with 490 pixels per
inch and decent viewing angles under the
hood lies at 2 gigahertz octa-core
MediaTek Helio x10 processor 3 gigs of
ram and a crazy 64 gigs of expandable
storage via microSD dual sim
connectivity options under the battery
cover in a non removable 3500 milliamp
hour power pack there's also a whopping
24 megapixel camera at the back match
with an 8 megapixel selfie shooter at
the front yes this phone also includes a
capacitive fingerprint scanner below the
primary camera meaning you can actually
unlock the phone from standby without
reaching for the power button first
which is really cool the phone feels
surprisingly premium in the hand with a
hardware finish that does a really great
job of deterring fingerprints even if a
phone this large is really not for the
average hand or also the average pocket
probably my only complaint with the
phone's finishes the fact that the
capacitive navigation buttons don't
light up but that would probably be
nitpicking
another interesting surprise lies in the
company's approach to software blues
proprietary skin on top of android 5.1
lollipop the first in that it lacks an
app tray and also offers different
navigation animations but manages to
retain the rest of lollipops look and
feel we must clarify that this is just
the skin though as the company also
bundles different skins for you to
choose from and even extra applications
like a sound recorder the Opera browser
and minor additions like the File
Explorer to my amazement though the skin
doesn't bog down the phone one bit I
know for a fact that people are still
skeptical about mediatek processors Blue
has done an amazing job at providing
snappy performance with this hardware
and software combination over the last
few weeks I've been testing the pure
Excel I can't really say that I've
noticed any lag when it comes to
day-to-day usage you'll probably notice
that your average game will take a good
deal to load which is definitely common
for these types of processors but once
you start playing the game you won't
notice any significant lag or anything
that will disappoint
now battery life is oddly not the phone
strong points even with the size you'll
definitely be able to finish the day on
a charge with moderate to heavy usage
but it's clear that the choice for
display size and resolution would have
been benefited by a larger battery pack
phone calls are also a mixed bag and I
assume that it's Deutz the phone's
gigantic size mainly because I can hear
colors just fine through the earpiece or
the back speakers but colors don't
really praise the call quality and
sometimes claim that I sounded far away
for odd reasons the same can be said
about photos where the added punch in
megapixels wasn't really matched by
great photos unless you had adequate
lighting conditions even then photos
tended to overexpose during the day and
become extremely choppy during the night
these issues could be due to a need for
further software optimization as you
will notice a few extra bugs here and
there which the company claims to
address in a software update coming soon
for example you'll notice that features
like the fingerprint scanner are blazing
fast but the sensor only works if the
display is turned off which makes no
sense you'll also notice that the
fingerprint scanner stops working after
you restart the phone and forcing you to
toggle it on and off from settings again
just some minor issues that should be
fixed with software overall though if we
had to balance this review and rate the
blue pure Excel it's really hard to not
recommend this phone for starters we
really can't think of another phone that
offers specs like a good quad HD AMOLED
display a snappy fingerprint scanner
or even 64 gigs of storage for 350
dollars that price tag alone is really
hard to beat for all this package and as
long as you don't mind the monster of a
phone when it comes to its size we
really doubt that you'll be disappointed
in spending so little for so much we've
got a lot more coverage of pretty much
every hot smartphone in the market today
