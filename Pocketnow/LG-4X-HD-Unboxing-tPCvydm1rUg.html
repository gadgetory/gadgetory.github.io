being announced at Google i/o it's
important to remember other companies
other than Google exist as well today
let's unbox the LG 4x HD so this is the
box that the LG 4x HD comes in and let
us it is shrink wrap will cut through
that in just a minute it's got this
really nice divided look where you've
got a red stripe all the way around it
not a lot of information on the sides a
little security seal over here that will
get to break and then the logo with some
nice branding and black on black
lettering there on the front the back of
it it's got just some very basics about
this the model number LG p880 its
quad-core has true HD and a 2150
milliamp hour not lithium-ion battery
will have to tell you more about that as
we learn more android running the
Optimus UI version 3.0 and some other
stuff but enough with that let's go
ahead and cut into it cut through the
security seal and we'll put the
pocketknife aside lifting the top we
have a very clean experience here this
is the white version of the phone tells
you a little bit about the device let's
go ahead and lift that out they supply
that nice little tab for us we'll set
the phone aside just for a minute see
what else is in the box first thing that
we have is an NFC tag that we can use to
get into car mode very very cool you've
seen some of our MSC videos if not we'll
have a link at the end of this one over
here if I can get it out is just a quick
NFC tag instructional I guess it says
attach this tag whenever you want to
just tap your phone on it I'm reading
that wrong your smartphone will be
simply optimized at once a little bit of
a translation
there I suspect let's open this up that
just folds up out of the way here's the
battery that they talked about in the
specs now again very nice size trying to
find the the milliamp hours printed on
here so I can read it back to you again
but it's being kind of there we go 2100
milliamp hour so not too bad in fact
that's 2150 at the top with the minimum
of 20 100 so little discrepancy
variations there some books the Quick
Start Guide over here we have our USB
cable which is just a standard microUSB
we've got a USB wall wart of course this
is not the u.s. prongs because this is
not a US phone and then some headphones
go ahead and open these up so we can
take a look at sea they're like nice
Squishy's on them and microphone with an
action button so nice a little bit
longer plug there you go let's get back
to the phone so here is the phone itself
we will take the protective screen off
set that aside feels really really light
in hand now something to remember is I
don't have the battery in this just yet
it also feels like there's an additional
little protective film around the side
and I can't find where it starts so
there we go pull that off the bottom and
offer around the side on this side we
have it's very clean looks like a volume
button up and down that almost looks
like it could be a stylist but it's not
remember the old Stiles's over on this
side just very very clean as well on the
top you have your power button a
microphone headphone jack on the back
flash with your camera will tell you
more about the specs on the camera in
the full review we've got this speaker
on the bottom we've got our USB port
another microphone that's the main one
that's about it back is kind of rough
and rugged really easy to grip on the
front we've got some notification lights
front facing camera and of course our
speaker and just very very simple LG
branding there so let's take this apart
comes apart very easily go ahead and put
this in now this will accept your gsm
sim and also a microSD card we're not
going to put either one of those in
right now this does have some antenna on
the back of it as evidenced by the
contacts says don't scratch or damage
this area that's where the NFC antenna
is they're not doing that inside the
battery like Samsung is doing go ahead
and close all this back up goes together
just like that push to turn on there's a
vibration the LG logo and of course the
boot sequence noah on-screen buttons on
the bottom instead they're capacitive
down at the bottom of the the bezel not
the bottom of the screen which gives you
some more real estate very nice boot
animation here with audio and then of
course that's going to go ahead and boot
us up for an unboxing there you go let
us know what you think of the LG 4x HD

review and additional videos as we get
to them for pocket now I'm Jolie bye
