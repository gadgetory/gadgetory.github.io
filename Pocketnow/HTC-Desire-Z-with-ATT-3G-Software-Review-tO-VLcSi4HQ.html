pocketnow.com and this is the software
review of the HTC Desire Z the one that
happens to have the bands necessary to
do AT&amp;amp;T 3g let's get to it now you heard
me mention that this has AT&amp;amp;T 3g benz
it's not sold over the AT&amp;amp;T network you
can actually buy unlocked from negri
electronics it's actually the bell
canada version which happens to have the
same 3g bands as AT&amp;amp;T here in the united
states so it works very well over AT&amp;amp;T
network i might add getting about 2.6
megabits per second down on hsdpa and
about 1.6 megabits per second up so
let's talk about the software we're not
going to talk about the hardware the
hardware is identical to the HTC g2 that
is on t-mobile so we've got the z10 Z
hinge here and they caught a Z hinge
because if you look at it like this you
can sort of see how there's a Z design
and something that's very interesting
about this hinge design is that there
are two supports here but on the other
side there's only one support that is
because when you open up the desire z
you're probably going to be using your
right thumb to flick up the screen and
so it needs a little bit of extra
support over there this mechanism is
really fun to open it's very different
than what you get on side say an HTC
touch pro2 or any other device out there
with a slide-out keyboard it's just a
lot of fun to pop this keyboard open to
reveal this nice court to keyboard now
this keyboard isn't as good as the one
on the touch pro two it looks very
similar but the keys are smaller the
feel of the keyboard is quite nice they
have kind of a softness to them I think
they're made out of a rubbery material
and they've good tactile feedback the
keys are large enough to where someone
with with big hands won't find a an
issue with using this keyboard so a very
good keyboard and of course you have the
on-screen keyboard too but it's nice to
have this physical hardware keyboard for
long emails but then this is not a
hardware of you as a software review and
we're going to talk about software in
this video because the t-mobile g2
didn't have the new HTC Sense interface
it comes with a stock installation of
android 2.2 so
we're going to cover all of those new
things that HTC has brought to the table
in the latest version of HTC Sense okay
so there's a lot to cover starting with
the notification tray if you pull down
the notification tray you'll see
immediately then it's been redesigned
for this version of HTC Sense we
actually get a little row of icons here
that will allow you to jump in and out
of applications recently used it's
basically the same thing as tapping and
holding the home button and getting the
recent apps button but it's just another
way to sort of access that list of items
now of course you have the leap feature
that was present in the last version of
HTC Sense lets you zoom out and see all
of your home screens in a quick view now
what is different about this version of
cents compared to the last generation
version of sense that it works in
landscape and it actually works very
well everything rearranges within about
one second it's a little bit slow in my
opinion but you'll see that if you add a
variety of widgets they're all formatted
for landscape now which is quite nice
and leap works in this view as well so a
very nice way to jump around from home
screen to home screen now the whole
interface has been just redesigned a
little bit right off the bat you can see
that the buttons down here look a little
bit different if we tap on this button
in the quarter this is the personalized
button and there's a lot of things that
we can do here that you couldn't do in a
previous version of HTC Sense for
example you can choose different skins
so right now we're on the music lover
skin we've got the metal skin it changes
the bottom bar it also changes the
slider in various applications this
one's really cool blackboard it's
actually a very informal theme it
changes all the system fonts we have
wood and we have slate and you can get
more through the HTC hub application so
let's actually apply this would skin
looks pretty cool changes the background
it changes the notification tray a lot
of complaints that people have with HTC
sentences that you can't customize of
this that much but now you can with the
skins which are really nice so let's go
back into this personalized menu and see
what else we can do here so this is
categorized by the different ways that
you can customize your device you can
personalize the scene wallpaper or skin
you can add widgets or apps shortcuts or
folders to your home screen then you
have a wide variety of personalization
settings for sound so you can change
your ringtone
fication sound in your alarm HTC has put
all of the personalization components of
HTC Sense within this nice handy screen
so it's very good to use so let's go
back to the home screen and let's add
some widgets see what kind of widgets
they have in this newest version of
sense when to dive back into the
personalized screen go to widgets you're
going to see a lot of familiar which
'it's here that came on previous HTC
devices with the sense interface we've
got bookmarks calendar but you know
there's a really cool thing that you can
do here that is new that allows you to
browse through all of the widgets in a
very nice screen so I'm going to click
browse all widgets and what I can do now
is just swipe through one at a time and
see what every widget looks like in this
full screen preview you want a
calculator you can select it see details
and as you can see there are 68 widgets
obviously you can add more but this is a
really cool way to just go through and
see what all of the choices look like
for your HTC device so we're going to
choose this one here nice full screen FM
radio and here it is on this screen and
we're going to delete it so let's go
back into the personalized menu and see
if there's anything else there that we
want to show off so a lot of these
widgets are carryovers from previous
versions of sense some are new like the
HTC likes widget which will show you an
apple recommendation which is cool
because every day it changes there's
also a neat word of the day widget which
I actually don't think is new but it is
made by HTC so you can select that and
every day you'll get a new word of the
day updated automatically practice your
your vocabulary a little bit so let's
throw this away now so the skin that you
have selected will impact how things
look in a lot of other programs so if
for example we go to the music player
over here we'll see that everything is
skinned here if we go into the sort of
broken down view these touchflo 3d if
you remember how that looked at the
slider this has all been skinned for
this particular skin that we've selected
the wood theme okay now let's take a
look at this HTC hub this phone will
integrate with HTC Sense calm and we
showed you this in the previous video
allows you to remotely turn off your
phone lock it it allows you to find your
phone on a map if you are hooked up to
HTC Sense calm which is free it's a
great service that really allows you to
get more out of your phone and HTC hub
kind of ties into that because you have
to log in with your HTC Sense calm
account and from here we can download
new widgets wallpapers scenes let's go
into wallpapers this is a great way to
get more person personalized stuff for
your device so let's go to abstract and
browse through the gallery of abstract
we're pulling this down from HTC Sense
calm right now and it's kind of a cover
flow like display we can even go into a
landscape view here and it reflows very
nicely and you can download these right
to your device and as if you are
downloading from the marketplace you get
a little indicator over here that shows
you the abstract 10 5 is complete so
let's go back and check out HTC hub a
little bit more here so also from here
you can get sound sets ringtones
notification sound so he can really
personalize your device let's go into
that application called HTC likes
because that has a really cool way of
showing you new items to download that
may be of interest here it is so this
gives you a bunch of different options
down here we can go into featured most
popular friends comments there's
actually a social feature to this Sophie
of someone else if you know somebody
else that is using a desire HD or a
desire z they can send your
recommendations of apps to download but
it's not you can flip through the
featured applications with again this
beautiful cover slow-like design it
shows you some really cool key
applications that actually tie into the
android market so let's say we want to
download dropbox actually got a text
message there so i'm going to click
install and it's going to pull it from
the android market here i'm in the
android market i can click install and
proceed to get it that way let's go back
to the HTC likes application and what
school is over here in the my downloads
section it actually synchronizes with
the market like the other panels do so
you can see all the apps that you've
downloaded to your phone within this
nice app management and from here you
can jump to HTC hub to get
more add-ons go to the android market
you can see some apps that are featured
by HTC so a really cool way to discover
applications every device that has the
new version of HTC Sense gets this now
one of the major downsides of this
device is that it has an 800 megahertz
processor if it was running the stock
default installation of android 2.2 that
would it be a problem in fact the g2 has
the same processor and is running stock
android and it's fast but the desire z
can be slow at times I think the HTC
Sense interface is taking up a lot of
system resources this device should have
had a 1 gigahertz processor but instead
it has an 800 megahertz processor
probably the save on battery but things
are a little bit slower than then you
would expect on an Android device that
is brand-new it's not too bad and I'm
sure there's going to be a way to remove
sense from this device in the future but
just something to be aware of if you're
getting this device so overall HTC has
done an awesome job with upgrading the
new version of sense here we have skins
and themes and different ways to
personalize your device and of course it
integrates very well with HTC Sense calm
so that you can remotely manage your
device if you're looking for the desire
z and you want it on AT&amp;amp;T again you can
get that Bell Canada version from negri
electronics com it works very well on
TNT's 3g network you see here's an
example of where things are a little bit
slow but of course it takes a minute for
the screen to redraw so overall a very
powerful device if you like Android and
you want to have this really great
keyboard hopefully some software
modifications will come out on the
development sites to allow you to lean
things up a bit so that it runs nice and
speedy if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
