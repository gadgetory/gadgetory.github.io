come here at the new tnt unwrapped event
in new york city checking out some new
devices from HTC from samsung nokia a
bunch of other manufacturers we're going
to go downstairs and take a look at some
hardware will show a multi in the same
video it'll be a lot of fun a little
loud down there but come party with us
come on down it out this is the one
x+ and you'll notice that the buttons
are white on the bottom because this is
the AT&amp;amp;T version and as such you get to
see the AT&amp;amp;T logo appear different kind
of ATT branding that is a little bit
different than before we get that kind
of little globe they're kind of in a
nonchalant way it's kind of out of the
way which is nice they go over to the
back we just get the beats audio and the
HTC logo totally different feel here not
the polycarbonate with a salt touch
plastic that we've had on devices for
years now it just feels really nice in
the hand but beyond that it's an HTC One
X but better for example we have the
really nice screen screen that many
think is better than the iphone 5 better
than anything out there you can galaxy
s3 tremendous viewing angles on
something to the side so you can just
see how great the viewing ads are this
is the same screen as the One X the
difference here is we've got a 1.7
gigahertz NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor the
newer Tegra 3 processor is supposed to
be faster in a lot of ways we've got
jelly bean so project butter is in the
house we've got a new notification shade
cleaned up a lot here if you notice that
I'm not exactly sure what's different
here but I can tell it something is
indeed
it's just a lot cleaner than it used to
be so we've got also new technology on
the front facing camera actually want to
show you that and by the way I've never
seen a camera app open this fast watch
this boom it's instant I I really have
never seen a camera app hope in that
fast and that's awesome because you want
to be able to take a picture quickly so
we're flip with the front-facing camera
which is now a higher resolution and yes
that's Michael and that's me and new
feature so if you tap on a face what's
up on my face you get a countdown Wow
smile yea biden smile i'm sorry what it
does is it doesn't count down there
which is pretty cool so you don't have
to fumble with the buttons or anything
like that and that's that's pretty much
it it's a faster one x it looks like a
1x it feels like a 1x just faster hey
guys i'm staying with the HTC pattern
this is the HTC one VX not the poison
gas from the film The Rock but the
mid-range offering that complements the
HTC one x+ this is running a 1.2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor backed up by a gig of ram it
is a it is backed up by a storage
capacity of I believe eight gigs but
that is expandable via microSD just like
a lot of other mid-range handsets
released today as we've discussed before
as far as Hardware goes the device feels
actually really really quite good in a
hand we have a nice silver bezel here
and that white polycarbonate that we're
familiar from from the HTC One the
initial release popular to open with the
front HTC Sense very responsive on this
display very much like an HTC sensation
as far as the spec sheet goes and as far
as the feel not quite so much to look
but obviously not an over performing
gaming powerhouse just a mid-range
offering that happens to look quite nice
once all the prototype numbers are
removed so I've always wanted to run
android on my camera now I
we can pick galaxy camera we showed you
this at etho but now I'm going to take a
look at this camera and it doesn't make
phone calls as you'll see in a second
what's interesting about this camera is
that it's actually got the pretty much
the same innards as a galaxy s3 it's got
a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core Exynos
processor it's got a gig of ram it's got
a screen that's about the same size four
point seven seven inches which is
essentially 4.8 inches now if you turn
on the device you don't get android
right away you get the camera and that
makes a lot of sense there's a lot of
cool stuff we can do with the camera but
first I want you to take a look at the
optical zoom and hopefully the cameraman
mr. Michael Fisher can take take take
the view up here we are in beautiful New
York City we're going to use the 21
optical zoom again this is Android doing
this this is your dreams coming true if
you if you like photography guys and
optical image stabilization wear and
take a picture of this far away please
like I had to hold my breath 30 seconds
there and we got a picture there let's
look and see how the picture came out
very lightweight device in the hand a
little bit of noise but that's to be
expected when you're zooming that much
I'm gonna bring it back down at the
table here and we're going to take a
look at what can Joe it's like on a
camera so we're gonna hit the home
button and that's how you get back into
Android or at least I think that is ok
back button ok I see the kind of a
camera retracting sort of for suppose
that's ok for those comments final
software not final suffering oh my gosh
we've got jelly bean here this is let me
remind you this is a camera with jelly
bean and it is super smooth and super
fast this has data hspa+ data not 4g LTE
which is great because you can instantly
upload your photos to dropbox you're
using instagram you can pimp out your
pictures press defy them or however you
might want to like to apply your filters
but at the end of the day this is
Android you can do all the cool stuff
you can do with a droid unlikely that we
are going to get internet connection
here because we are running with very
little large that
but you know it runs in portrait and
landscape this is a really interesting
idea and I am personally curious to see
if this device takes off or not it's a
very polarizing device do you really
want a dedicated Android thing that has
a camera that doesn't make calls are you
willing to do that or are you okay with
just an android phone that takes really
good photos like the galaxy s3 and other
phones like that so this is the galaxy
camera and I was delighted to take a
tour of it here hey guys it's Michael
again we've all seen the Nokia Lumia 920
we're up here on the rooftop to try and
get a little bit better light on this
this is obviously the banana yellow
version not sure if that's the official
color name or not you can see the gloss
here on the device we've also handled
the the cyan version here which probably
will be will be my phone just to give
you an impression of what it feels like
in the ham this is absolutely the 186
grams of this device are definitely
apparent when you hold it but they play
into the the hardware the hardware
positivity that I'm a giant fan of of
devices that are not too light also we
have some good mechanical feedback here
on the volume rocker the standby button
and of course the shutter button /
camera launch key there's a lock screen
of course Windows Phone 8 we're not
allowed to do to handle Windows Phone 8
on our own but we have Kevin from Nokia
is going to just show us a little bit
not much new in that respect but let me
hand over the phone to him trade places
sure same as before press and hold and
you see the little arrow right down here
press it you get the smaller towel get
the full size tile it one more time
and you go back to the third size time
and when it's in the smaller size that
will still show notification yes you can
see here this one shilling one text
message missing right there on one of
the smaller tiles if you had an email
same thing so the other of the unique
things differentiators for this device
or our pier view imaging technology so
with this device we actually have
optical image stabilization when you
take that combine it with our carl zeiss
optics with the to davao after we had to
get amazing low-light photography with
the optic and stabilization regularly
the lens open longer which allows more
light into the sensor which gives you
great energy and low light conditions
maybe that would be a stabilization we
can do that at the end what we also have
here is our peer motion HD 4.5 inch
display and what we have here is we've
overclocked in this place you actually
get 60 frames per second on the display
itself so you get no lag or blurring you
scroll you can see the easily just
rolling here we also have our clear
black technology on this device allows
great outdoor readability and high
brightness situations the other thing we
have integrated wireless charging you on
this device so you don't have to plug it
in you can set it on a wireless charging
accessory and charge it that way we also
have NFC capabilities for tampa chair
tap tap air and then we also have 32
gigs at built-in memory on this device
so the optical image stabilization i
will give you a brief demo here at booth
will activate the camera might be
texting life yeah we'll do our best here
so so as you can see here is I start
shaking the device you can see it's
shaken but when I press the shutter down
halfway the Sheikh stops but I'm still
shaking my hand let up again and start
shaking again once I press it again and
were there but it is in person
and the same thing for video so that
actually works on big video and imaging
murders so not a whole lot of headline
news here in New York City from the AT&amp;amp;T
event but a lot of awesome technology
that we were really happy to get it
first and sometimes a second look at
thanks to AT&amp;amp;T for having us out a lot
of cool technology on this plate
