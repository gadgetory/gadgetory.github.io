with 16 gigabytes of internal storage as
well as a pre-installed 16 gigabyte
microSD card the iPhone 4s has 512
megabytes of RAM the Droid Bionic has 1
gigabyte of RAM both offer Wi-Fi a total
Evan B G and n the Droid Bionic also has
support for DLNA bluetooth on the iPhone
4s only went out there 4.0 with support
for a2dp the Droid Bionic has version
2.1 with support for a2dp both offer GPS
or support for a GPS both phones can be
used as Wi-Fi hotspots operating system
on Apple's iPhone 4s is iOS 5 on the
Droid Bionic it's Android 2.3.4
Gingerbread UI on the iPhone 4s I'm
going to call it iOS 5 under the Droid
Bionic I'm gonna call it motoblur I'm
assuming that's the flavor of the month
next up what do you say we run our
unofficial speed tests and close down
all the apps running on the iPhone 4s
and apparently there were just a few huh
and then after this is done we'll get to
I download a task advanced task killer
on the Droid Bionic so we'll go in here
should be right up there it is and well
kill selected tasks go back to the home
screen
alrights kicked us off with the calendar
and IDN I'll try and be as close as I
can but obviously I'm not perfect that
definitely seemed to be the Droid Bionic
let's try a gmail on both that was
difficult for me to tell I think it
might have been the iPhone 4s let's go
to maps on both definitely the iPhone 4s
I'm not quite sure what the
Bionic is up to there it goes so it's
definitely the iPhone 4s
let's try contacts on both that was
definitely the joy Bionic let's go to
the gallery on both I don't have a much
in either one looked like it was the
Bionic was a bit quicker let's try the
markets on both again they're both
different but let's give him a shot and
that was definitely the joy Bionic what
haven't I done let's try messaging on
both that was definitely the Droid
Bionic all right now let's give it a big
30 third party challenge discover to
Netflix I've got a bow throwing out the
same Wi-Fi network and let's spin a TV
show and so far it looks like definitely
the iPhone 4s is loaded up quicker and
good to go so one that portion of our
speed test now let's load the video mi5
which I'm thoroughly addicted to and
let's you can load that up and spool it
up first and it looks like the Droid
Bionic it's gonna cover that part of it
there we go we've got both of them run
take a quick look at the qualities of
the screen again you've got two very
very nicest plays here all right that's
a look at our unofficial speed test
next up artificial intelligence text
Craig message see you at Starbucks
tomorrow at 4:00 question mark listen to
Michael Jackson
meeting with Bob next Wednesday at 5:00
p.m.
yes what is 20% of 585 divided by 12 you
can see they both came up with the
correct answer
navigate to Starbucks Starbucks there
are directions to Starbucks
set an alarm for one hour from now all
right let's try the little gaming on
both yeah here we go
iPhone 4s gamer I'm doing the sir camera
or around itself who took him down oh
I'm out of control
I'm back oh I was
yeah it took a few people down with me
all right how's the iPhone 4s
Troy bionic up next see you bath
all righty let's wrap up today's
PocketNow face-off between apple's
iphone 4s and Motorola's joy bionic with
our browser comparison kind of both
running up the same Wi-Fi network clash
cache in history easy for me to say it's
been cleared on both and I do not have
flash enabled on the Motorola Droid
Bionic and we'll start to soft we'll
head over to end gadget and I'll try and
get this as close as I can and they're
off
looks like the iPhone 4s is serious
about winning this here comes the Droid
Bionic and it is the iPhone 4s is done
and is our winner
very smooth droid Bionic has just
finished as well and it's not quite as
smooth at the beginning but once you get
it rolling it is very smooth let's find
something we can look at on both here we
go it's double tap to zoom in give you a
look at the text on both I got two very
very nice displays both very sensitive
to touch as you can see here they both
offer pinch to zoom one of the nice
things is on the Droid Bionic you can
double tap and rewrap the text so that
you can read it with the display double
tapping on the iPhone 4s will simply
zoom you back out and we'll zoom all the
way back out any rendering issues on
either one looks like both of them
handled it very very well no problems
alright when you see we hit over to the
mother ship let's go to bookmarks and
where are we I want
there's smartphone reviews smartphone
reviews and we're off so far the iPhone
4s was quickest I'm guessing that both
go to the mobile site and again the
iPhone 4s was the quicker to the mobile
site let's go to the full desktop and
we're off good clean start see you takes
this and again it looks like it's gonna
be the iPhone 4s here comes the Droid
Bionic what's it gonna be who's it gonna
be excuse me
iPhone 4s as it's done here but it's
still loading up here at the top as you
can see and it is done yes it's done and
again very smooth no prob
and Droid Bionic just finished and again
a little sticky not as smooth as the
iPhone 4s let's double tap to zoom in
and again you can see when it zooms in
it's not quite as smooth what do you say
we open up this and see you takes that
so far as the iPhone 4s is our winner as
far as from a speed standpoint and also
a user standpoint it is a bit smoother
let's see iPhone 4s is still running up
here at the top try bionic is still
loading as well and the try bionic
actually took that one again though not
as smooth as the iPhone 4s so there's a
look at our browser comparison for our
pocket now face off this is Craig for
pocket now I hope that's been helpful
don't forget to stick around I'll have
the video comparison coming up directly
after this take care
