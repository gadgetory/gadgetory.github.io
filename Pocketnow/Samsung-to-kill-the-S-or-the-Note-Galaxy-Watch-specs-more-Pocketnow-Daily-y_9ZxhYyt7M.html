to see anymore galaxy s or galaxy enough
devices after the galaxy s 10 we get
listings for the galaxy watch which tell
us the screen size and other features
and remember that phone that brought 16
cameras yeah I don't either but it seems
they want to do it again
I'm high metally that are happy Friday
and for those of you asking for more
videos on the Spanish channel that are
different to the video there will be
more this weekend stay tuned this is par
go down daily the official news today
begin with statistics it seems that
Huawei is getting very close to beating
Apple and iPhone sales and you know
that's rather interesting given how many
more phones are sold by Huawei but yeah
the company is closing in 200 million
phones and last quarter they nearly
reached Apple with the amount of
shipments that they sold it seems to the
p20 and p20 Pro are making a huge dent
up to the point where I want another
review and I still can't get one we'll
see how it fares out over time now for
those of you to join me and not
remembering that light smartphone that
launched with 16 cameras lately well it
seems that the company wants to do it
again they've got funding from Softbank
there's a partnership with lekha we hear
that they plan to do something really
cool that will be launched with Sprint's
at some point because soft band and
sprint you know that thing about it as
we wonder if we're still gonna retain
the same 52 megapixel resolution out of
16 cameras at a time when the Huawei p20
Pro can do 40 megapixels we'll see what
the case now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy watch lineup there are
some leaks that show that there are two
watches one of them is apparently going
to be regular with a 1.19 inch display
and then the other one is going to be an
LTE watch that's going to have a larger
display what operating system is coming
man companies continue fumbling around
with the rumors we'll see what happens
in the end now let's talk about the
Galaxy Tab s4 and I know I rarely cover
information about other tablets because
none of these cell but it seems that
Apple is not the only company that wants
to bet in facial recognition when it
comes to tablets we heard the rumors of
the iPad pro bringing face ID now we
hear that the Galaxy Tab s4 is going to
bring iris scanning and
we wonder if that's going to be some
sort of improvement to what we've seen
with the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lineup
which hasn't been that great whatever
the case may be
oh my god I wish Android tablets sold
like seriously and finally the hot
rumours today have to do with Samsung in
the feature of its flagship lineups as
we've got two sources claiming two
different things about what's going to
happen in the future if you know well
the Galaxy Note 7 tarnished the Note
brand and even if the node eight sold
well the Galaxy S nine didn't so it
seems that Samsung is considering a
couple of possibilities and one the
Galaxy S line of dies and we don't know
what the galaxy flagship name is going
to be going forward and another we hear
that the Galaxy Note line is gonna die
but it's gonna merge into the S line and
then the Galaxy X branding will be the
other flagship smartphone or tablet or
whatever that combination is going to be
whatever the case may be in today's
question let us know what do you think
that Samsung should do should have
killed a note call it the Galaxy S pro
which would be my recommendation or do
you think that the Galaxy Note lineup
should remain in the Galaxy S should die
and probably the s-pen works on
different screen sizes oh man if the
s-pen would work on different screen
sizes and we call them all notes I feel
that that would be cool but I also feel
that the Galaxy Note is more of a pro of
the S and then the Galaxy X is more of
that Vanguard smartphone according to
rumours leave us a comment down below
