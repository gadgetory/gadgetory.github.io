smartphone for 2014 but it's the Galaxy
alpha that's running away with our
hearts at Aoife 2014 join us for a quick
tradeshow comparison from Berlin spoiler
alert
TouchWiz is basically identical between
these devices so this quick comparison
is all about the hardware it's not just
a difference in size but footprint
definitely plays a part the 4.7 inch
display on the Alpha is just a touch
smaller but it makes possible a hugely
reduced footprint on the Alpha compared
to the 5.1 inch s5 really it's more of
the material and build differences that
make the Alpha so special where the s5
feels a bit like a fluffy pillow with
its plastic on plastic construction the
Galaxy alpha is hard edged with sharp
beveling on its metal side rails and a
color choice and backplate finish that
makes it much more attractive to our
eyes and the fact that you can wrap your
whole hand around it is a great bonus if
you value one-handed use with your
pretty fit and finish whether this
cosmetic improvement is worth all the
sacrifices and power will be up to you
the resolution comes down from the full
HD to 720p on the Alpha the snapdragon
on the s5 gets transmuted into an Exynos
octa-core megapixels and the battery
gets a huge demotion from 2800 to 1860
milliamp hours which is almost
frightening also the Alpha isn't water
or dust resistant so it's not for the
clumsy or the super active but even with
all those sacrifices and probably a few
more which we'll discover in a full
comparison later in the year it'd still
be mighty tempting for the aesthetic
appreciators on our team to choose
Beauty over power in this case which one
would you pick let us know in the
comments below and stay tuned for many
more quick show floor comparisons as
Taylor Martin and I bring you more from
Aoife 2014 in the days ahead until next
time this has been michael fisher with
pocket now captain to phones on twitter
thanks for watching and we'll see you
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
