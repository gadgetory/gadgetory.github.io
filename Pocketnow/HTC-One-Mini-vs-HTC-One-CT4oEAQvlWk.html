watching the HTC One mini vs. HTC One
comparison on Pocket now but you notice
that I don't have any devices with me
that's because we're gonna do things a
little bit differently this time we are
using the HTC One mini to record this
intro so let's get to the comparison
when we started using the HTC One mini
as our daily driver after installing
everything and mirroring our HTC One
setup we were surprised to see that the
HTC One mini was snappy really snappy of
course if you want to see just how
snappy the HTC One is check out our full
review over at PocketNow for all the
details while you're at it follow us on
social media to be among the first to
see our videos and posts we thought
you'd like to see a side-by-side the HTC
2013 mini flagship and the ness four
mini competitor versus the HTC One
flagship the Samsung Galaxy s4
competition so here it is and we're
looking as usual at hardware software
and user experience as well as the
camera you can almost think the HTC One
mini is an HTC one if you don't know
what to look for that's not only because
it sports the same design and materials
but also because it is not much smaller
than the HTC One that is on paper and
compared side-by-side however when you
hold the phone and you start actually
using it you will instantly realize that
it is a mini version of the flagship
just like the one the one mini is made
out of aluminum however there are a
couple of differences while the HTC One
has plastic inserts along the edges the
one mini extends the plastic further
towards the front and back embracing a
little bit from the aluminum and from
the glass this way the taiwanese company
eliminated some of the complaints with a
few HTC one units that had a slight gap
between the aluminum and the plastic
itself everything else is apparently the
same to the untrained eye upon close
examination you'll see that the power
button no longer acts as an IR blaster
like on the one the volume rockers have
also been redesigned a bit and the LED
flash on the back has been repositioned
the boom sound speaker grilles are
narrower but just as precisely driven
and a detail HTC payed attention to and
were happy that it did
the camera is slightly recessed so it's
much more difficult to scratch it while
laying down the phone on its back these
are about the only differences in design
and build however there are a lot of
contrasts under the hood we have a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
processor clocked at 1.4 gigahertz
versus a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
600 running at 1.7 gigahertz one gig of
ram versus two gigs of ram 16 gigs of
internal storage versus 32 or 64 4.3
inch 720p s LCD to display versus 4.7
inch 1080p s LCD 3 display 18 hundred
million power battery versus 2300
million power battery no IR blaster and
NFC on the mini well the one has them
both the main camera is matched at 4
megapixels wearing the ultra pixel tag
but the webcam is a 1.6 megapixel unit
versus a 2.1 megapixel shooter on the 1
Android 4.2.2 now runs on both devices
out of the box on the mini via update on
the HTC One and sense is nicely
complementing it which brings us to the
user experience as you can see we've got
a mirrored setup on both devices and we
can tell you that the user experience
HTC is delivering on the one many
matches the one found on the flagship
there's nothing you can do on the one
that you can do on the 1 mini if you
disregard of course hardware limitations
referring to NFC and IR blaster this
means that blinkfeed is there whether
you like it or not and since has been
further tweaked and fine-tuned with the
4.2.2 update on the one they're both
featuring the new notification shade and
some other minor tweaks under the hood
for a detailed look at HTC Sense
experience on one and implicitly on the
one mini make sure to check out our full
HTC one review on pocket now
performance-wise
HTC and /or google managed to achieve a
great thing a slower device on paper
manages to keep up with a flagship is it
possible for a snapdragon 400 with half
the RAM to keep up with a snapdragon 600
with double the RAM yes give or take a
couple of milliseconds which are really
negligible we've compared at launch
times for most daily tests for browsing
the web YouTube Spotify
email Facebook calendar Google Plus
Twitter messaging
and other app launches will let these
side-by-side comparisons run for a bit
until you get a sense of how well the
one mini is keeping up with the one
see what we mean
now let's move on to the camera its
performance should be similar to the
ones let's run the slide show while we
tell you more about the camera
HTC fitted the same four megapixel ultra
pixel camera under one mini its lens
cover is a tad smaller and the LED flash
has been slightly repositioned but aside
from that everything should be the same
on paper and it also is in reality
everything we said with the occasion of
our HTC one review concerning the camera
applies here two shots are good outdoors
and while HTC doesn't miss an
opportunity to emphasize its ultra pixel
camera performance in low-light
conditions we are not impressed there's
just too much noise and the sensitivity
is not appalling either it's not a bad
shooter but it's not the best either and
we're not comparing it to the one on the
either way PureView or the Lumia 1020
but two other films like Samsung Galaxy
s4 or Lumia 925 the camera interface and
the entire experience is identical to
the HTC One this means that you can snap
pictures zoe's have special effects as
always experience the live gallery with
highlights and all photo editing
manipulation live effects everything is
well we'll look at some of these aspects
in our upcoming review you can always
check out our HTC one review right now
for more details in conclusion the HTC
One mini is worthy of wearing its bigger
brothers the HTC one's name it is a true
miniature of the flagship from the outer
looks and premium feel to the entire
user experience even in the performance
Department while lacking specs on paper
it delivers a solid experience if you
think that the HTC One is too big for
you or too expensive the One mini is a
great solution if you prefer the HTC One
looks and feel stop right here if that's
not a must on your list you can also
look at another mini phone is direct
competitor the samsung galaxy s4 mini
which we also reviewed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
