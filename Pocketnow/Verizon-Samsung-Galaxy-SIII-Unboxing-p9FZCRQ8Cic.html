pocketnow.com we've already seen the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in a couple different
varieties today we've got our hands on
the Verizon version of the phone let's
unbox it see what comes with it all
right the first thing we've got is a
very nice clean face on it
simple black on white rotating around to
the side we've got some Verizon 4G LTE
branding over on the bottom we've got
some barcodes and whatnot sides are
empty and the back has some very basic
just specification information really
DivX HD I always love to see that so
this is just a sleeve we'll go ahead and
slide that off and set it out of the way
we have essentially the same type of
branding on the front of the box empty
sides the bottom says that this has been
printed in China I've got some friends
over there Nihao go ahead and open this
up inside we've got a nice paper holder
with the phone sitting neatly inside go
ahead and set that over to the side just
for a minute here we'll come back to
that I just lift out tab no
documentation in there over here now
we've got a little thumb hole see if we
can pull this side up and we've got our
manuals nice and individually wrapped
we've got some headphones with volume
control mute it looks like extra
squishies and then squishies on the end
really kind of nice white headset now
white is usually synonymous with Apple
so people are gonna think you've got an
Apple product when you've got these
headphones in but the phone itself is
white so it matches well go ahead and
give that to him over here we've got our
wall wart which is really nice and
low-profile
it comes out beside so you're not going
to be blocking up other wall outlets
with this we've also got a micro USB
cable see if I can find the ends for
one thing I like about Samsung's USB
cables they've got this little flange it
makes it easier to pull out let me open
that up so you can see it you've already
seen this I'm sure but it's worth
illustrating just for the three of you
who haven't so here's the little flange
it's just a little bit of a flare out
that helps you be able to grab onto that
and kind of pull it out of the phone a
little bit easier very nice high gloss
it has some printing on it so you know
which way is up on the other side very
nice low profile again branding nice USB
logo there relatively long cable and
it's relatively flexible so really nice
setting that aside we've got the battery
which we'll get to in just a minute
and then nothing else at all just the
bottom of the box so we'll go ahead and
set that aside to pulling the the
battery out of its plastic you can see
over here that this is indeed a Samsung
battery with a Near Field Communication
and NFC antenna built in now that's just
the antenna not the chip something to
keep in mind there traditional 3.8
lithium-ion battery see if we can find
it 2100 milliamp hours which for LTE I'm
a little bit suspect we'll have to wait
and see how that works let's get over to
the phone looking at the phone we've got
some protective wraparound stuff on the
front and the back I'll go ahead and
take those off that's about it now if
you notice the screen has the nice
beveled edges the rounded edges nice and
smooth really light right now again the
battery is not in there but it feels
swell just like any Samsung Galaxy s3
it's got the one Omni button on the
bottom up at the top of your camera some
sensors and of course your grill and
some very modest samsung branding huge
screen really nice it's got the nice
silver band running around the whole
thing up here at the top we've got a
little sticker that says that this is a
qualcomm 4g we could take that off i'm
not going to got your noise cancelling
microphone on the top your headset jack
and your little finger grip to pull the
back cover off we'll do that in just a
second again we talked about the front
down to the bottom your main microphone
your microUSB and charging port right
there over on the side we've got the
power button just very nice clean one
button right there the other side we've
got again very clean a rocker for volume
up and down that feels like it works
really well it's very distinct but it
doesn't stick out away from the phone
too much turning to the back we've got
of course our rear facing camera with
flash and our rear speaker here at the
top we've got some Verizon 4G LTE
branding right there in the middle and
of course the Samsung Galaxy s3 branding
at the bottom let's crack this guy open
and just like most Samsung's it's a peel
off the top is kind of tight it's got a
couple contact points down the sides and
then the bottom just toggles or pivots
right up move that off to the side now
what we've got over here a couple things
first of all we've got this micro SD
slot so it is empty doesn't come with
one in the box but you can supply your
own micro SD card for future expansion
next is a SIM card and as far as I can
tell this is a standard size SIM not a
micro sim I'll pull out my AT&amp;amp;T Micro
SIM right here and you can see well it
just might be looks like it is a micro
sim I stand corrected now of course
that's not going to work because of
course I need a Verizon LTE sim but it
is in fact the the Micro SIM that you're
going to need so you've also got some
rear contacts right here and then your
battery goes in right there as well go
ahead and button this back up get the
bottom seated in first walk your fingers
up the side and then press in the top
and just do a press around to make sure
everything is nice and tight and there
you go press and hold the power button
to first boot and within moments you'll
be setting up your brand new Samsung
Galaxy s3
we'll get to that in an upcoming video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
