hands-on we've compared it with the lg
optimus G and the Galaxy Note 2 but
before we send the HTC Droid DNA down to
resolution expert Brandon minimun for
more videos and editorials we need to
compare it with one other device a very
important device in a very popular one
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
dot-com and this is the HTC Droid DNA
versus the Samsung Galaxy s3 American
edition we don't want to go on forever
with this one and we've already done
in-depth reviews on both of these
devices so we'll keep this confined to a
few key areas build display benchmarks
and camera kicking things right off with
build quality these devices almost
couldn't be more different the galaxy s3
ours here is the Verizon version is
curvaceous and smooth coated in hyper
glaze gloss and weighing in at a
featherweight 133 grams the Droid DNA
sends a completely different message
adding 9 more grams to the equation and
trading all that glossy Sheen for a
matte finish soft touch back as a result
the DNA feels more substantial rugged
and less prone to breakage whether
that's true or not is up to the drop
testers to decide we're just talking
perception here moving on to the display
it should come as a surprise to no one
that the DNA's display absolutely owns
the panel on the galaxy s3 that's not
because Samsung makes a bad display it's
just that the 1080p 440 PPI panel on the
DNA is in a class entirely by itself the
5-inch SLC d3 and the DNA reproduces
colors better instead of over saturating
them like the 4.8 inch Super AMOLED
panel on the sgs3
and the resolution and pixel density are
much higher as well as the viewing
angles about the only area the galaxy s3
wins is on the depth of the black
reproduction to be perfectly clear
Samsung's Galaxy s3 display is still
wonderful but the DNA is currently
unbeatable in this for
for the benchmark comparison we're
comparing benchmark scores in five apps
remember that even though both of these
devices include two gigs of RAM their
processors are completely different with
the American sgs3 running on a dual-core
Qualcomm s4 and the Droid DNA packing
the quad-core Qualcomm s4 pro we may
have more detailed gaming comparisons in
the future if our focus shifts but for
now we are just playing the numbers game
in quadrant standard the sgs3 squared of
49 53 and the DNA scored 78 44 in antutu
the sgs3 scored a 68 oh 6 and the DNA
scored 14 5 14 in smart bench the sgs3
scored 27 86 while the DNA scored 46 77
the SunSpider stock browser tests where
lower is better sgs3 scored at 2150
point 8 and the DNA scored 1140 point 3
and finally in Geekbench to the sgs3
scored at 13 11 well the DNA has scored
18 30 and because we like to know we're
able to get into our apps quickly on our
smart phones just one or two app
launches here now keep in mind that
these devices are also running different
software the Verizon sgs3 is still stuck
on 4.4 with TouchWiz nature UX while the
Droid DNA runs 4.1.1 jelly bean with HTC
Sense 4 plus so let's see if we can jump
into the camera here and see if we
detect any difference we'd like to be
able to make sure we can capture those
moments when they arise 1 2 3 no
noticeable difference viewfinder
launches in about the same amount of
time let's make sure we can make our
phone calls properly 1 2 3 boom dialer
is up at exactly the same time let's try
a third-party app we'll get a little
more social with things let's try
Twitter 1 2 3
Twitter loads in exactly the same amount
of time and the internet browser stock
browser on each 1 2 3
excellent and while we are in the
browser I'm going to wait for the pages
to load
here we're not getting an auto load on
Pocket now so we will just go ahead and
cheat that while we're in the browser
here we'll go ahead and do a text reflow
check we are not not testing speed on
loading just testing re-rendering really
really really impressive on the droid
DNA as we've gotten used to in the past
few comparison videos in the review we
can see that there is absolutely no
problem
despite the much higher resolution with
this device in its text reflow
capabilities and it's clearing up that
text it is just absolutely buttery even
on a relatively heavy page such as ours
with animations going and so on and so
forth but responsiveness on the sgs3
lags just a little bit behind the DNA
the device takes a little bit longer to
resolve that that text but it's not
terribly significant you are just going
to be waiting another couple beats for
the page to redraw itself
as far as the camera goes there's
unfortunately no comparison both devices
deliver excellent software features and
a whole host of options but while we
actually like HTC's viewfinder software
better the quality of the dnase images
lag behind the galaxy s3s
both cameras are 8 megapixel shooters
but the sgs3 handles low-light better
and renders crisper images overall also
taking the edge in video quality again
we really like HTC's innovations on the
software side of the viewfinder and it
delivers good performance and ample
outdoor lighting but in any other
circumstance it really suffers where the
sgs3 cameras doesn't these are both
excellent smartphones with their own
high and low points but it's very
obvious that the DNA is the newer phone
in several respects most notably of
course its display and more powerful
processor we also like the better build
quality of the HTC product still the
Galaxy s3 has some key advantages in
battery life where it is out the DNA
with a removable battery of higher
capacity and the galaxy s3 also features
expandable storage whereas with the DNA
customers are stuck with 16 gigs for the
life of the device the choice between
the best display and processor on the
market and excellent build quality
versus a less physically appealing but
proven more versatile product might be
an annoying one but it's one that
customers choosing between these two
devices are going to have to make
