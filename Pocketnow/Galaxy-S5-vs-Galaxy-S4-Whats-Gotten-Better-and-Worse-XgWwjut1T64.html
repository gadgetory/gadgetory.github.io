flick Top Gun you'll remember when Tom
Skerritt and his sweet mustache told Tom
Cruise that Mavericks a lot like his
father only better and worse well that's
also the story of the galaxy s5 from
Samsung or part of it anyway how it
outpaces its predecessor in some ways
and falls short of it and others so if
you're on the fence about springing for
the latest galaxy or saving some scratch
by picking up last year's model here's
what you'll get and what you'll give up
in each case I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Samsung Galaxy s4
vs. samsung galaxy s5 most of the
differences that are ultimately going to
matter in this comparison or
hardware-based because it's safe to
assume Samsung will eventually bring
most of its software enhancements to the
s4 so let's have a look at the most
important Hardware differences starting
with the casing bucking Samsung's usual
trend of the galaxy s5 is actually
slightly more massive than the s4 and
it's also just a hair thicker the bezels
flanking the display are also wider
there's a protective hatch cover on the
USB port and that fake metal trim has
gone from unobtrusive to pronounced
giving the s5 of an almost retro 50s era
look in the hand the s5 also feels
substantially bigger than its
predecessor you can even say it's
clunkier these could all rightly be
called downgrades but they'll be worth
it to a lot of people for one big reason
the s5 is ip67 compliant making it
essentially impervious to dust and
immersion resistant up to a depth of 1
meter of fresh water this means not just
that you can take the s5 swimming with
you but that you can take underwater
photos and video while you do it
that alone may make the extra bulk of
the s5 worth it to you you may also
appreciate like we do the feel of
samsung's new backplate which does a
much better job at resisting the
accumulation of skin oil and looks
better on our white unit
despite its oddball divet pattern
hopefully we've finally seen the last of
hyper glaze in other ways the galaxy s5
adheres to the typical upgrade trend its
display is slightly larger and much
brighter
unless you're reading in the dark in
which case it can be made much dimmer
the s5 also offers support for faster
LTE and it's USB port is 3.0 to the
earlier models 2.0 around back the
battery is still removable and it's seen
a slight boost in size while the
processor underneath powering everything
is now the Snapdragon 801 versus the
older snaps 600 backed up by the same
two gigs of ram but running at a higher
clock speed microSD expansion has also
been bumped you get an additional 128
gigs if you're willing to spring for a
card that big double the potential
additional size of last year's 64 gig
cards the other big difference in specs
is the sensor loadout the home buttons
might look the same across generations
but the one on the s5 hides a
fingerprint scanner we wish it was more
reliable but it'll please those looking
to keep up with their iPhone 5s toting
friends there's also the new heartbeat
monitor nestled below the primary camera
which does an okay job and adds an
important data point to those looking to
make full use of Samsung's surprisingly
powerful s health sweet speaking of
sensors one of the most important
differences or one of the ones Samsung
is stressing anyway is between the 13
megapixel camera on last year's model
and the 16 megapixel unit on the new s5
suiting in broad daylight you almost
have to squint to make out differences
between most shots though the s4 in good
lighting was a pretty good camera after
all and the only thing the s5 seems to
be doing in normal mode is delivering
more saturated colors we also like the
ability to take wide shots at full
resolution on the s5 though the s4 made
you take 4 by 3 photos if you wanted to
use the maximum number of pixels and the
s5 looks to be a hair better at picking
out detail in the shadows even without
HDR enabled but the big deal with the
s5s camera is its new focus shift
ability which seems to be the hip new
trend of smartphone photography in 2014
this allows you to call out your subject
through selective focus even provides
the ability to focus
for the shot is taken which is a neat
trick and it works quite well
the s4 doesn't have that feature though
apps like Google camera can approximate
it once the s4 is updated to KitKat our
Verizon model here is still stuck on
jellybean in dim shots not much has
changed
despite the s5s new iso cell camera
neither one does exceptionally well
especially not compared with competition
from Nokia and HTC back in bright
lighting video results mirror the still
shots saturation is significantly higher
on the s5 and the camera seems better
able to handle big swings and exposure
there's less blowout in brightly lit
areas unfortunately since neither device
offers optical image stabilization shots
are going to be shaky unless you're a
very steady handed individual we drink
entirely too much coffee as you can see
in these videos as the cameras pick up
even the tiniest tremble even with
software stabilisation turned on the s5
offers very high-speed capture for
slow-motion video though which can be a
lot of fun particularly if you're
playing with fluids also you can shoot
4k video on the s5 to a consideration if
you have a 4k TV at home we're still
testing many aspects of the galaxy s5
like battery life and the new TouchWiz
build and our findings will go into our
full review going live this week
subscribe to us here on YouTube and
follow us on social media so you don't
miss it
now while the s4 was no slouch in areas
like gaming that required a lot of
horsepower the added muscle of the s5s
Snapdragon 801 really puts the new
device over the top while also doing a
better job of power management back in
2013 test callers said we sounded muddy
on the galaxy s4 giving that device a
score of only 7 out of 10 and voice
quality and complaining about a lack of
noise cancellation the galaxy s5 does
better at coping with a stiff breeze but
our test callers in 2014 still won't
give it a score higher than a 7 in sound
quality many people say we sound like
we're talking through a pillowcase and
speaking of speakers we can't detect any
significant improvement on the rear
mounted loudspeaker on the new device
compared with the old one whether you go
with the s4
s5 you'll want to keep a good set of
earbuds handy because the speakerphone
isn't one of its high points so if
you're shopping for a Samsung smartphone
and you're the kind of person who leaves
your phone in the bag when you go to the
beach or hit the trail you're not going
to miss out on much by picking up the
cheaper older Galaxy s4 this year many
of the s5s software improvements will
eventually trickle down to the older
model whose guts should still be plenty
powerful enough to last you a year of
solid use but if you describe yourself
even sometimes as an active individual
the s5 is absolutely going to be worth
the extra dough water-rats will like its
immersion protection while exercise
mavens will appreciate the ability to
sweat all over it during an s health
driven workout then take it in the
shower afterward for a rinse off and
make sure their heartbeats return to
normal at the end of all of it
the s5 s top shelf processor and bigger
battery only sweeten the deal so while
it's not the biggest update the world
ever saw the Galaxy s5 is absolutely a
big step up over its predecessor as long
as we're talking about the right kind of
customer itching for more check out our
