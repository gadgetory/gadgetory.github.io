successful products ever and the company
aims to one-up itself in 2013 but what's
changed between galaxies let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is samsung galaxy s4 vs samsung
galaxy s3 before we get started two
things first these are the American
variants of the galaxy s3 and s4 because
those are the review units we were able
to secure so this comparison is us
focused second we have a ton of
additional galaxy s4 content on our
website at pocketnow.com and here on
youtube as well follow us so you don't
miss any of it for the galaxy s4 samsung
decided to iterate conservatively on the
design of its 2012 flagship presumably
reluctant to change a good thing as a
result these phones look quite similar
side-by-side despite the varying colors
of our demo units here but there are
some significant differences between the
two generations of galaxy and we'll be
checking them out in four main areas
hardware UI camera and some test notes
Samsung pulled off quite a stunt in the
construction of the s4 at first glance
it doesn't look much different than the
s3 because it's not but from a certain
perspective that's the real
accomplishment here
the s4 is 3 grams lighter and a bit over
half a millimeter thinner yet it packs a
larger display 5 inches to the s3 s4
point 8 that Super AMOLED display is
also 1080p resolution to the s 3s 720p
resulting in an astonishing pixel
density of 441 PPI to the s 3s 306 PPI
all those numbers boil down to this both
of these phones feature stunning screens
but the Galaxy s4 s is almost impossibly
sharp it offers automatic color
adjustment some air gestures we'll get
into in a while much thinner bezels and
the protective layer shielding it from
the elements is Gorilla Glass 3 not too
it's an improvement in every possible
sense and when the software takes
advantage of it it looks fantastic the
rest of the device has also been refined
button travel is sharper and less mushy
the cheap looking border plastic has
been replaced with a more refined ring
that glints
more without looking tacky an IR port
has been added and the notification LED
has been reduced in size slightly the
camera lens has been expanded along with
the sensor size from 8 megapixels to 13
and the speaker has been moved down low
and expanded significantly in size as on
the galaxy note 2 the whole device looks
much higher end than its predecessor
though its hyper glaze coating gives it
the same slick feel in hand and it's
just as adept at collecting skin grease
it's also remarkably easy to scratch
moving inside and once again these are
the American specs the Qualcomm
processor has taken a step up from the
dual-core Snapdragon s4 to the more
modern quad-core Snapdragon 600 at 1.9
gigahertz LTE is of course still here
and the galaxy s4 adds AC support to its
Wi-Fi suite the 2 gigs of ram stay the
same as do the storage options 16 32 or
64 gigs of storage with expandability to
an additional 64 gigs via micro sd
finally the battery gets promoted from
2100 to 2600 milliamp hours we have more
thoughts on battery life in our full
review but for now we'll say that the
increase in size has served the new
device quite well getting past the lock
screen we can see that despite the
additional android point bump Android
4.2.2 on the galaxy s4 and 4.1.2 on our
GS 3 here there's not much different
sure their support for lock screen
widgets and all the other goodies from
the latest version of jellybean on the
s4 but TouchWiz looks almost exactly the
same there are some adjustments here
some good ones like an expanded
rearrange able toggle area in the
notification shade and some bad ones
like a tabbed Settings menu that's
somehow more confusing than before the
s4 also brings easy mode for first-time
smartphone users by and large though
those comfortable with Samsung's
TouchWiz skin will have no learning
curve with the look of the UI it's the
new functionality that might take some
getting used to in the form of the new
air view and air gesture features air
view is familiar from the galaxy note 2
but here it requires no stylus just
hovering your hand over the screen lets
you preview messages magnify text and so
on and it's quite useful in some
situations the
you need to be careful where you put
your hand air gesture is less useful and
more buggy but for those who often
handle their phones with dirty hands it
could prove handy once or twice added
features like these and the new bundled
s health and s translate apps among
others in concert with the redesigned
Samsung hub and a refocused push on home
media integration are the big hallmarks
of the s4 software as it relates to its
predecessor the new TouchWiz is familiar
yet refined its aging but it works and
it's responsive usually there's probably
some additional optimization needed here
as there are a few bugs and stutters to
be found but overall the new TouchWiz
experience is a pretty standard
iteration we've talked a lot about the 5
megapixel boost and resolution on the
Galaxy s4 s camera over the s 3s but
there are a few caveats here the camera
is capable of 13 megapixel photos but
those are captured at a four to three
aspect ratio resulting in a very square
picture so out of the box the galaxy s4
defaults to nine point six megapixels at
sixteen by nine that's probably the mode
that most users will shoot photos in
additionally the galaxy s4 camera offers
a narrower field of view than the galaxy
s3 now that means the s4 can render
sharper photos but you have to step
further back to get as much in the shot
that's a pet peeve of ours it makes us
feel like you were perpetually zoomed in
too far while shooting but fortunately
the results outdoors in good light are
often sharper on the galaxy s4 with more
color depth indoors there's a bit more
noise to the shots and photos can easily
appear washed out in some situations the
s4 s camera still produces more detailed
photos than its predecessor but it's
once again a marginal improvement not a
revolution the real upgrade comes in
added camera features and a UI overhaul
of the viewfinder offering a simpler
Galaxy camera inspired interface and new
fun features like animated photo drama
shot dual shot and others these won't
appeal to everyone but they definitely
follow the trend Samsung started with
the s3 of throwing as many features as
possible into a smartphone camera
almost a year ago we called the Sprint
Galaxy s3 a solid performer in terms of
voice calls and that holds true for its
successor solid though is all it is the
past year has seen some great
improvements in smart phone call quality
as a result of noise cancellation
hardware and software but it looks like
Samsung has focused its attention
elsewhere callers said we sounded just
okay talking on the s4 and the device
didn't deal with background noise like
wind very well at all
some colors said we sounded less fuzzy
on the s4 but otherwise there wasn't
much difference reception was OK in our
time with the s4 but keep in mind we're
comparing a sprint unit to a Verizon one
here Sprint's 4G deployment in the
Greater Boston area lags significantly
behind its larger counterparts
connectivity was less reliable on Sprint
and speeds were often considerably
slower again that's a complaint against
the network not the device speaker phone
calls were comparable on each device but
the speaker on the newer s4 outperformed
the smaller unit on the earlier device
in media playback it's still rear
mounted on the s4 which is a shame but
it's definitely louder with a richer
fuller sound saying the s4 is a moderate
iteration over the s3 is true but it
isn't terribly useful the question is
does it offer enough improvements to
justify the cost of buying one over the
s3 well if you're in the market for a
phone with a beastly CPU and a
top-of-the-line display in arguably one
of the best you can find on any smart
phone the s4 is for you that also
applies if you're interested in an
above-average camera remote control and
media hub capabilities slightly more
modern aesthetic design and a new suite
of features that are half useful half
gimmick on the other hand the s3 is
still no slouch it doesn't pack the
latest and greatest anymore and most
American versions will likely be waiting
longer and longer for updates to the
newest version of Android but it's still
a great all-around smartphone and it's
going to be selling for a lot less once
the s4 hits the shelves if you're in the
market for a solid proven performer at
an affordable price point there's no
shame in springing for last year's
Galaxy s3
and because it looks so similar 9 out of
10 people you pass on the street won't
know the difference
folks we have a lot more coverage on the
Samsung Galaxy s4 both here on YouTube
and at pocketnow.com so follow us on
social media like I say before so you
don't miss that throw us a like here on
YouTube if you liked the video leave us
