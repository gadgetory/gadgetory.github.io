brought to you by D brain before we jump
into the review a minor oversight the LG
G six actually represented the first
full year of real camera reviews from
one generation of phones to the next a
little milestone that I thought was kind
of important because this means with the
galaxy s 8 we have a similar review of
the s7 that you all can reference to see
how these two might compare the main
talking point for the Galaxy S 8 has
been this new screen aspect ratio and
very little has been mentioned about
camera improvements which has led some
in our audience worried that there might
not be any improvements to this camera
we've shot a ton of footage to check out
so buckle up folks we have a lot of
ground to cover and I'm going to move
pretty quick to spoil some of the
conclusion right up front the Galaxy s8
is definitely an exercise in evolution
not revolution a lot of the specks on
paper will feel exceedingly similar to
last year's phones same sensor size same
aperture same number of megapixels same
photo and video modes we shouldn't be
surprised if output feels similar to the
s7 but we want to see if this newer
image sensor and more powerful processor
deliver any improvements over its
predecessor jumping right in with some
daylight shots Samsung has a reputation
for heavy saturation and sharpening and
the s8 is no exception this looks lush
on cooler colors darker greens blues and
earth tones but it can squash detail in
warmer colors like this yellow flower
the sensor is more than capable of
retaining petal detail but the JPEG
processing Clips some of that texture
and even this lighter green consists a
little bit in afternoon light there's a
lot of eye candy here and photos will
largely Auto process in a pleasing way
but we still have some concerns with
things like blue skies grain and blue
gradients is a bit busier than we'd like
to see but this color processing feels
heavy-handed this is where I say most
cameras have issues with Reds but what
concerns me with the s8 was some of the
inconsistency in processing red from the
same position shooting in succession we
end up with noticeably different warmth
again the raw file for these
Bougainville blossoms is spot-on
left to its own devices like most phones
the s8 tends to overexpose but happily
performance here is far better than most
of its competition where I
and feel like I need to dial back
significantly more I only needed a few
minor adjustments on the si in the
brightest of conditions and spot
metering in manual mode actually landed
just a bit darker than I would have
wanted well done there Samsung moving
over to white balance the SI plays with
warm light in a very satisfying way
complementing the saturation there's a
pleasing glow to daylight shot it might
not be the most accurate to your subject
not true white but it does a better job
of retaining the feel of the lighting
objects in shade likewise avoid the
problem of sliding to cool where some
phones can make a shot like this feel
icy or cold night shots also err on the
side of exposing for the lighting more
than the subject this white gate lit by
really ugly yellow security lamps in
general this is my preferred method of
white balances I usually want to capture
the feel of a moment more than I want
some notion of true scientific white
looking at dynamic range the SI captures
a fantastic amount of info when saving
RAW files purposely over exposing a shot
by two stops and walking it back in
Lightroom I couldn't quite recover all
the detail in this wall but looking at
what info was still retained I have no
issues with this performance from a
phone a larger sensor big pixels in a
wide aperture when this phone is pushed
bright it goes bright but there's still
plenty of safety net here for folks
capturing RAW images a very quick look
at lens performance and there are subtle
improvements over the s7 I'm seeing a
bit less lens flaring and night shots
but a wide field of view paired with the
fastest aperture on a phone makes for
some hazy elements most noticeable in
macro shots and speaking of macro this
is another use case which hasn't changed
much from the s7 working near the
phone's minimum focusing distance we get
the prettiest natural bouquet we've seen
from a phone but this also makes macro
shots a bit trickier to pull off you
have a razor-thin playing a focus to
work with we've also noticed in video
that the phone doesn't seem to focus
quite as close as it can for still shots
consistently we had to scoot back a
little from where we had landed focus
for a photo now in a world of dual
sensor cameras the zoom function on the
s8 isn't going to impress anyone it's a
very normal crop zoom that will blur out
detail at the farthest end
any video is just a blown-up image with
lots of pixels totally normal
performance for a single camera sensor
phone Apple II autofocus speed and
accuracy are still on point it was a
genius move to use dual pixel technology
on the s Evan and we still benefit from
it here it's not any faster than its
predecessor but it really didn't need to
be looking at high dynamic range Samsung
already layers on quite a bit of image
processing so HDR shots tend to only
show a subtle difference from normal
Auto processing photos if anything most
end up looking like they've just been
given a slight brightness bump which is
disappointing I was hoping for more of
the highlight and low-light balancing we
might see from a phone like the pixel
sadly that's not the case here happily
panorama performance remains top-tier
excellent exposure some subtle wobbles
in these power lines but still this is
one of the only phones capable of
correctly piecing together all of the
elements of a busy scene like this this
is fantastic image stitching and
processing now you should all know by
now that I hate reviewing selfie cameras
but Samsung might just have one of the
best performers around autofocus is
definitely appreciated we get great
detail and bright light solid
performance and shade one of the more
natural odo modes for those people who
like to look like disturbing uncanny
valley mannequins and it's still one of
the only selfie shooters available that
will produce quad HD video this might be
one of the best vlogging solutions
available on the market moving to some
nice shots this Hardware continues to
guarantee that galaxies are low-light
champs wide aperture solid stabilization
for the most part night shots are pretty
easy to pull off our only concern here
is the heavy-handed noise reduction a
little grain or texture really isn't a
bad thing especially for retaining
detail and clarity the s8 is not
destructive
but sometimes photos are softer than I
want them to be this processing can
start to resemble a beauty filter when
shooting people in medium to low light
this is a terrific capture for a phone
I'm taking the shot blind handheld from
the rear camera sensor and you can see
this had a
long shutter for the car streaking
behind me but I really wished I had
captured this in manual mode for the raw
image I just looked a bit too plasticky
here at night we can also see some of
the downsides to shooting an auto where
the camera decides for you how long to
expose trying to be subtle in taking a
street candid it's really difficult to
predict how long the phone will hold the
shutter open and I ended up with a
blurry shot coming back a few minutes
later so I didn't look like such a
creeper and using the manual mode it was
much easier to lock in a crisp exposure
even with indoor lighting say you're
trying to photograph kids Auto mode will
often make a choice to expose for the
environment at the expense of a faster
shutter speed taking a look at video the
essay captures a high quality 50 megabit
per second UHD but still with a 10
minute limit on files a limit we don't
see on phones like the LG G 6 or current
kua ways most everything we see in still
photos will hold true for video in terms
of color processing and exposure vivid
sharp saturated ie pleasing content a
bit hazy at the macro end but well warm
for outdoor afternoon samples in
Southern California one main difference
from stills might be the blockier
pixelation in blue skies as the image
compression tries to figure out what
info is important but that's not
terribly uncommon to see this kind of
tearing on most phones night video is
often significantly brighter than it
needs to be though and the phone
obviously can't process moving images
with noise reduction filters as well as
it can for still photos where the phone
nailed the creepy tunnel and creepy gate
photos the video feels washed out and
noisier than it should be what's new for
Samsung is the ability to shoot UHD
video with both software and hardware
stabilization one of the only Android
phones capable of such a feat I shot
almost all of the samples using this
mode enabled now I'm still not the
biggest fan of this hybrid stabilization
as the lens still distorts the scene as
the software crops out movement even
though the frame is more fluid and less
bouncy you can still see how objects in
the frame retain that jello we look
it'll be up to the individual if they
prefer that over the more normal wobble
we see and only
using hardware stabilization when trying
to hold still this combo does help
smooth things out over just using lens
stabilization the concern I have with
this feature though it seems to tax the
phone a lot more and the software
processing does not like lateral panning
iPhones and pixels can get twitchy but
this is terrible stuttering from a phone
which is set to be one of the most
powerful on the market even when you're
not panning expect more dropped frames
with this setting enabled we've had some
windy days in LA while reviewing this
phone which has made microphone tests a
bit more challenging but on the whole
Samsung remains an upper tier performer
here solid audio capture good dynamic
range and nice stereo separation
slowing things down for just a second
the s8 produces some of the better 240
frames per second 720p slow-motion we've
seen a small improvement over the s7
this is what the video will look like
using Samsung's built-in editing tools
not too shabby
but we were disappointed to see that
there's no 1080p option and nor is there
any kind of fancy burst mode like what
we might see on Sony phones soon
Samsung definitely has room for
improvement on this fun feature lastly
we wanted to take a look at the app
layout and as requested by our news
editor Jules a little discussion on that
app performance at first I still feel
we're wasting a lot of space in this
camera app the new taller screen doesn't
seem to bring any benefit to photography
and unlike LG Samsung has done nothing
to embrace this extra real estate a
perfect example is the manual mode which
still encroaches on your viewfinder to
adjust settings instead of a mode button
Samsung seems to have been inspired by
Huawei in migrating to gestures sliding
from left to right brings up your mode
options sliding from right to left is
where your filters live this works
really well and keeps your viewfinder
open when making quick changes in those
modes but I'd still really like to see
the main settings menu adopt this
layered effect consistently my biggest
gripe with samsung menus they completely
remove you from your composition window
and at night blind you with a bright
white background the changes Samsung
focused on are completely unnecessary
and do little to improve the camera
experience pinch-to-zoom
works terrifically well but Samsung has
complicated the shutter button to add a
rocker style zoom in software this alone
has caused me to miss more shots than
any other change this phone isn't the
easiest to hold in your fingertips but
now if you don't nail a perpendicular
press of the shutter button if you hit
at an angle or slide even just a little
the phone will think you're trying to
zoom also annoying for us folks who like
manual modes Samsung has been inspired
by LG in providing a gesture to flip
from the
rear to the front camera works great in
auto mode but if you're quickly trying
to adjust manual settings I often found
myself making eye contact with myself
it's a tough call expecting people to
deliver that kind of user interface
accuracy when they're focusing on trying
to take a photo
another LG inspiration this one more
positive for the s8 is the addition of
focus peaking the s Evan had a pop-up
zoom feature but from a composition
standpoint locking focus like this is a
lot easier to do in the moment this is a
terrific addition other than those
mentioned changes Samsung seems more
focused on fun things supernate I can
slap on some animated skins like I can
and snapchat I'll never use this ever
again and bixby vision is also something
I'm not likely to fire up very often
I just don't search for things like this
with a clumsy facsimile of Google image
search delivering similar but usually
unrelated images and I just don't care
to shop through my camera interface at
all even if it could give me options
which it often couldn't
lastly we should talk about speed and
processing the s8 follows the s7 and
being one of the snappier performers
we've handled yet this phone doesn't
feel quite as consistent as its
predecessor like LG we won't remember
the 100 times the phone performed
quickly as expected but that one time
you really want to capture a shot in the
camera lags that'll stick out like a
sore thumb I had more of those moments
with the SI then I remember having with
the s7 but that might just be me
romanticizing last year's phone when
shooting video I regularly encountered a
delay between starting the video and
being able to focus often a longer delay
than I would find on an air quotes slow
shooter like the g6 or how we criticize
the V 20 the s8 was also routinely one
of the slowest phones at saving a video
preventing me from shooting again as
quickly as we might from Huawei or an LG
g6 and also it bears repeating
neither LG nor Huawei have 10-minute
limits on their video it's early days
still for the s8 so I'm hoping to see
some of these performance issues ironed
out in future updates but for all this
extra horsepower in the new Qualcomm 835
chipset
I'm not seeing any real advantage in
speed for Samsung this year so let's
wrap this up where's that leave us with
the camera on the galaxy s 8 now I'm
going to need y'all to take a nice deep
breath I can already see the SM H
comments about how I'm being too
nitpicky or how I'm a Samsung hater
with the hater-aide I need everyone to
repeat after me there is no such thing
as an objectively best camera we can
only try and illustrate the pros and
cons for you folks so you can make the
best purchasing decision you can I never
try to score or rank because this tech
evolves quickly over time even over the
life of one particular phone instead I
like to look at phone cameras as a
spectrum on one end of that spectrum we
have phones that excel at being Auto
shooters or feature nifty crowd-pleasing
HDR processing and maybe those phones
don't satisfy the manual shooters or the
pro photographers at the other end of
the spectrum we have phones that deliver
incredible control to the consumer but
often those phones might not always have
the best auto modes or fun features my
experiences with Samsung in general and
the s8 specifically land it as one of
the better examples of a healthy Venn
diagram overlap between these two
philosophies that's not always the most
exciting territory to be in if we're
only looking at the extremes a pixel
will probably win for people who only
want to push a shutter button with no
additional input or control and a v20
will crush it for those folks mounting
their phones on tripods to dial in
exactly the composition that they want
but few phones will cover as broad a
range of consumers with very good to
excellent performance in a majority of
shooting scenarios as the Galaxy sa it's
a top-tier all-rounder even if it's
rarely the master of a specific feature
did you know that a moves can dive
underwater down to nearly 20 feet in
search of food we'd like to thank our
sponsor D brand for reminding us that if
you're going to die for food near a
moose make sure it's at least 21 feet
deep this bizarre ad and all of our
Samsung Galaxy sa coverage is brought to
you by D brand check them out in the
link below as always thanks so much for
watching these camera reviews
need your support this is a substantial
amount of work to do this deep of an
examination and sharing is greatly
appreciated if we're going to continue
producing these reviews in the future
for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now
