Apple so before we bore you with a full
Apple edition of the bargain out daily
let's just make a separate video where
we try to condense everything that we
saw at Apple's March 21st event and
obviously our opinion on it I'm every
better with pocket now and let's try to
condense it as much as we can as with
every Apple event we start with updates
the company is turning 40 and they
boasted about it in addition we also
heard of the company's environmental
efforts and how they're able to raise
cattle along their solar panels and we
also heard about the iPhone 5c an FBI
debacle and how the company continues to
stand upon encryption the first product
update if you could call it that way was
the Apple watch it continues to be the
same watch by the way we were expecting
an update but no all we got is this new
lineup of woven nylon bands in addition
to new color options for the sports
watch model and we also see this face
black Milanese loop that looks gorgeous
but it's probably gonna be priced crazy
that's with everything in the Apple
watch we wanted to see watch OS 3 or
something that would make the operating
system less clunky sadly we didn't we
were expecting another watch again we
did not get it either the only thing
that we got was a new price tag it now
starts at $2.99 which still makes it
expensive sadly the other update comes
in the flavor of the Apple TV which we
assume is still Apple's hobby because it
hasn't really proven to be popular Apple
boasted 5,000 applications for the
platform we haven't really seen much of
that but hey there's new software
hardware remains the same the new
software now supports dictation in
addition to the fact that you can now
search for applications within the App
Store using Siri you also get the option
to watch live photos within the whole
Apple TV because you now get support for
iCloud photo sharing which is great
again the Apple TV is still a work in
progress I still don't think I would
suggest people to buy it but then again
hey if you're in the market and you're
in the Apple world and yeah it probably
makes sense for you and speaking of
software updates Apple is a now making
iOS 9.3 available to you within the rest
of the day and it's
there are some major improvements in
this operating system but Apple spent
its time boasting on things we don't
care about like for example touch ID
support notes or the fact that the news
application gets some updates we now see
that the Health application will suggest
other apps that integrate because people
actually forget that the health
dashboard is there I know I do in
addition to other updates for carplay
even though there are still very few
apps that actually support carplay but
pay the hottest news with iOS 9.3 is the
whole night shift the improvement why
because it's scientifically proven that
the bluish tint of displays actually
don't help you sleep so the whole
purpose of night shift is that the phone
or tablet is able to detect whenever
it's sunset and then will make the
display warmer for the rest of the day
in order to help you
apparently acquire sleep this is
something that I will particularly want
to test because I have horrible sleeping
issues I don't think that that's
actually gonna make a difference but hey
I'd like to be proven wrong and no not
everything in this event have to do with
software we got two very hot products
today and we start with the iPhone se
and please share them in the comments
what do you think s e stands for some of
us believe that at special-edition
others believe that it's small edition
and I inclined to small edition because
this is pretty much an iPhone 5s and
looks but with 6s internals I looks the
only differences really are new color
options you now get rose gold and you
also get matte chamfers which is great
because we hated how the shiny sham
first looked after the buzz but by 6's
internals this is a big deal first of
all you get the a9 chip you get the same
12 megapixel camera capable of 4k you
get pretty much everything like hey Siri
functionality the m9 motion coprocessor
you get Apple pay and it starts at $4.99
which is definitely speak for most
people but it does poison very
interesting debacle number one the
iPhone 5s is now retired so the
entry-level is pretty much the iPhone S
II but then you have the iPhone 6 and
this one starts at 549 whereas the
iPhone se starts at $4.99 and you're
getting much better specifications the
only difference is you're getting us
while their display so we would love to
know in the comments down below of you'd
have to choose which one would you pick
because I don't think I could bill for a
smaller iPhone in my opinion at least
but then again we do know that this
phone will be popular for a lot of
people a quill actually made it a big
deal over how a third of iPhones last
year were four inches in diagonal so
there is a reason for this phones
existence now we're still debating
considering Apple's new nine point seven
inch iPad pro the hottest product today
but Apple made the biggest steel out of
it and for its other reasons mainly
because its tablet lineup is on decline
and the company needs to do something
major about it now this is pretty much
an iPad air 2 chassis with iPad pro
specifications and yes the name I've had
Pro remains it's just called the 9.7
inch variant and you get the same a 9 X
chip you get the 12 megapixel camera
that's on the iPhone 6s and there's even
a protruding camera lens that looks
horrible
but yeah you even get the two-tone flash
and the front 5 megapixel camera even
includes the selfie flash functionality
yeah it seems the tablet photos are here
to stay but yeah this new tablet
supports the Apple pencil and the only
difference between the smaller iPad pro
and the larger one is the new true tone
display what it does is that it has four
ambient light sensors and the whole idea
is that they detect the light
surrounding them and if the iPad notices
that there is warm light then it will
adapt to that warmer light if it notices
that it's cool then it will give you
cooler light this is very interesting
functionality there's also less glare on
this display 40% less than on the iPad
air 2 but overall this is just a apple's
new way of rebranding its tablet lineup
it also allows the company to bring in a
new price tag the iPad air 2 actually
drops in price of 399 this one starts at
$5.99 and yes you get the crazy keyboard
for 160 bucks as well I don't know if
this is actually going to be the best
deal for Apple mainly because of this
price point but according to Apple
people are going to go crazy for it we'd
love to know in the comments down below
what do you think about this iPad pro do
you believe that this is what Apple
needs because I believe that using the
name Pro to start is not really good it
really doesn't hater to pro users it's
not a computer in a lot of senses it's
powerful but it's not a computer so yeah
there are pro people that could use the
Apple pencil I still debate it but hey
leave us a comment down below I could be
wrong prove me wrong in the comments
