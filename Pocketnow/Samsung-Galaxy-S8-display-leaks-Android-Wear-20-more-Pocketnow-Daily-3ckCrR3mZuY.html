screen of the samsung galaxy s 8 Android
wear to togos official along with two
new LG watches i think that samsung will
showcase foldable displays them that you
see sort of i'm hi meri behna and isn't
it funny at least i don't remember
seeing deadpool saying chimichangas
anywhere throughout the movie this is
parking out daily official news today
begin with deals for those of you that
want to still buy a samsung galaxy at
seven or galaxy s of an edge right now i
would highly suggest you consider the
option at the samsung store the company
is offering from now up until
valentine's day i think a little further
the option to get a free 256 gigabyte
microSD card and since you do get
expandable storage on these phones i
mean why not now focus a little on
software update so one of those
controversial updates was to the ZTE
exon 7 it happened yesterday and for
those of you that were questioning if
Google's daydream feature is going to
work on the exon 7 or not this nougat
update actually enables it we were able
to see it in action back when we were at
CES in Las Vegas now you're able to test
it out and that that is a great update
you should definitely consider getting
it and if you haven't gone the exon 7
that is another smartphone that we do
recommend and some software updates are
the topic Android Gortat Oh went
official today along with two new LG
smart watches as we were discussing in
the rumors to watch sport and the watch
file now bear in mind these two watches
are extremely different we cannot wait
to get our review unit to tell you more
about them what's important is that
Android wear sudado is what everybody's
been waiting for and the coolest bars
you don't really need to buy a new watch
at least for most cases there is a full
list of the link in the description of
the watches that are getting the update
over the next few days or few weeks as
the statement says for those of you that
remember Samsung plans to show as its
foldable display concepts smartphone
soon the question was how soon and we've
got some trusted sources claiming that
mwc will be the time but the problem is
apparently it's not going to be for
everyone it's going to be a closed door
but we're not even
sure we do get showcase if we're going
to be able to share about it but anyways
we will keep you posted if we do and
finally a very hot because they have to
do with some recent images that have
emerged on Weibo of the samsung galaxy s
eight or so we hope there are people
that are debating that this is a fake we
kind of think it's real apparently
they're debating that there is a sticker
on the front and what's wrong with a
stick or somebody was probably just
trying to cover I don't know names or I
don't know it's probably a prototype
it's got a code whatever the case may be
look at those curves I mean curves on
the display curves on the borders that
thing looks beautiful at least I really
like what I see but it leads me to the
question of the day number one thing you
believe that these pictures are real and
number two what do you think do you like
this new I don't know design where the
display is curved on the Border's in my
case I love it leave us a comment down
below e listen on your opinion friends
you know the way it goes if we want to
get the news earlier before the video
was filmed follow us on park and calm

thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am

watching we will see small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
