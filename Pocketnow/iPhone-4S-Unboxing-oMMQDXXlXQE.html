pocketnow.com our iPhone 4s just arrived
let's go check it out and while people
are kind of disappointed that the iPhone
4s is not the iPhone 5 with a bigger
screen a thinner body it's still going
to be one of the best selling
smartphones of all time because Apple is
making a great phone the iPhone 4 and
has made it even better so let's take a
quick look around the box not much to
talk about here we've got the 4s which
actually borrows from the 3GS branding
in fact you get that same exact S icon
there so Apple kind of reusing of the
logo from the 3GS got an iCloud logo on
the bottom and that is pretty much it
let's break into this guy and now you
might be wondering why did I go with
white that's a good question because
that's a decision that you're going to
face if you're getting an iPhone 4s or
an iPhone 4 for that matter white is
better with fingerprints it's it hides
fingerprints much better and it's also a
little bit different there aren't as
many white iPhones out there as there
are black iPhone so just something
different and of course the fingerprints
is a big deal so here it is you wouldn't
be able to tell it if it were an iPhone
4s or iPhone 4 just as you'd expect
slightly modified antenna kind of move
around the device and kind of see how
the camera lens is bigger or at least
the part inside the actual lens itself
and that's really it that's the only
difference and of course in the box we
get some finger tips they still do that
the finger tips let's see finger tips
there you go
and the charger and some white earbuds
so everyone knows that you have an Apple
product so we've got a lot more coming
up on the 4s mostly we're going to do
comparisons how does the 4s compare to
the four running on iOS 5 how does the
4s compare to the best Android phone out
there and we'll take it from there a lot
of cool comparisons leave us a comment
let us know how you want us to compare
the iPhone for us to other phones this
is going to be a hot phone up for 2011
and into 2012 if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
