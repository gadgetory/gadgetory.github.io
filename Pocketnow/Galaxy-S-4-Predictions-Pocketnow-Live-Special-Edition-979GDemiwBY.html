edition of pocket now live we are
talking galaxy s4 predictions we've all
been waiting for the galaxy s4 since the
galaxy s2 came out so this is a
momentous event coming up next week
Michael and I will be in New York to see
what Samsung has up its sleeve and we're
just gonna hang out because we were
going to talk about the galaxy for any
way galaxy s4 anyway so we thought we'd
record it and make it a pocket now live
and we've got a bunch of people here
from pocket now we've got Tony we've got
hi May but we've got Michael hello and
we have Steven ahoy hoy now before we
get started I was wondering if Tony
could do his dance for us but first if
you don't know what I'm talking about
I'm about to show you turns out tony has
a really good dance move that he did in
the bloopers yes and it's gonna play it
here for your enjoyment wait he doesn't
think yet with his arms yep oh you get
out no the dance the dance of the guy
did when the other guy was bothering at
the back at the sign that was like the
perfect dance man oh yeah that's
everybody was fightin oh yeah well
that's all that's all everybody gets for
a second I thought you had made it
animated gift and animated Anton dancing
good we'll make it a man i'll be like
this non-stop he that's a good idea that
should be your byline photo from him
from now on it should be can you set up
twitter avatar as a animated gif i will
most probably you can you can yeah I
thinking are good at the Internet I
think that's what you do so anyway let's
get to the business let's talk about our
galaxy s4 predictions and so there's
some obvious stuff and then there are
some surprises that might happen and
every time we see some surprises some
features that make the device one up or
two or three up the HTC One any xperia z
so let's just get started to talk about
what do we think this phone is going to
have what is a sure thing i think
particular quarterly want us to talk
yeah i do cuz yeah alphabetical and then
by height ooh oh I'm the first in both
categories oh okay the obvious thing is
that we know from CES that there will be
four point 99 which is a five inch super
amoled full HD screen that is for sure
we're taking that for granted and then I
don't mean interrupt I'm going to that's
neat because we've never seen why shows
you say we've never we've never seen at
1080p Super AMOLED screen so it'll be a
it'll be a screen of the first type no
but the question is do you guys think
that it's going to be pent allegan like
whenever they came out with the 720p
they had the they had lead they had the
wvga version of the galaxy s2 already
non pentile and then they went back to
pentile with you know guys I don't think
it matters anymore because at that high
of a BPI rating you won't be able to
distinguish jacked images or jack text
even if it's bent I'll write as a decent
point you know it's an irony but for
example if i compare an image on the on
the s3 which has a higher pixel density
than on the note 2 for some reason i see
images better on the note 2 with a lower
pixel density than on the s3 that's just
a note to the size of your car drew but
no I there are degrees of pentile right
because I remember being very irritated
with my galaxy nexus pens I'll displayed
horrible horas it's not just the RGB G
it's the arrangement the shape that they
put the subtitles in exactly yeah
pentile is not the dirty word it used to
be yeah it's it's gotten better so that
screens going to be awesome they're
they're kind of going with the bigger
with every generation which is
interesting the galaxy s2 rests its
lovely heart was a lovely 4.3 inches and
then we went to 4.8 inches now we're
going to five inches and flirting with
the the Galaxy Note a little bit in that
in that upper sighs and that's if I may
the question that I have most going into
this and going into the future really
for samsung is how can they continue to
how do they insulate those two brand
you know because the Galaxy Note line is
they care about that a lot and you know
they're not going to be bringing an S
Pen to the galaxy s4 because they want
to insulate those those two product
categories so how do they when do they
stop with the galaxy s well they don't
stop because the note 3 according to
rumors and also according to what I
think will have an even larger screen
they'll go beyond 6 inches so the
difference will be still there between
the s4 and the note 3 the question is
what happens when the note for note 5
will be so close to that note 8.0 and
there's no more line between phones
phablets and tablets you have a floating
buffer zone at the moment that keeps
moving farther and farther nor is it I
think I think Michael put it best in his
review is just you know the note 2 is
just unapologetic and its size and it's
just gonna get bigger I mean if Samsung
is gonna put an earpiece on the no date
they're not gonna care about giving you
a six inch pro with the note 3 words is
the way it's gonna be no holds barred no
plausible let's let's talk about the
other obvious stuff what kind of CPUs is
gonna have we're going to see the
octa-core okay so there are the so far
there are two main ideas circulating on
the internet we have the of course
Exynos octa core processor which was
also launched at CES and then at one
point there were those rumors of the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor now as
far as I'm personally concerned I
couldn't care less about processor and
about Graham because we've reached a
point where where android is so fast and
these devices are right there that it
doesn't really matter whether if it's an
eight-core it's a dual quad-core or it's
a simple quad-core processor now one
question to you Brandon I mean both you
and Michael were able to test the
Snapdragon 600 both at CES and also in
the HTC one I mean that you really
notice a difference because the rumors
are that you get a Snapdragon 600 in the
United States and the Exynos 5 in Europe
I think you know as Michael talked about
in the review the DNA is fast and it's
capable but it's not without flaw and
sometimes it does stutter a little bit
and I think the snapchats that's the x4
pro is it the s4 program right so the
Snapdragon 600 is just like a little bit
faster than that so that you kind of cut
out some
that lag maybe know the best processor
can still be bogged down by unoptimized
software go ahead time sir no I just
want to say you all know the note 2 and
the note 2 was the first samsung phone
which had the same processor in Europe
and in the u.s. so I think that Samsung
would shoot themselves in the foot if
they came up with the s4 with an Exynos
processor in Europe and the qualcomm in
the US I don't think they're gonna go
back there I think that whatever
processor will have is going to be the
same across all regions I'd have to
agree with Tony there and when I'm kind
of worried about is we've seen a lot of
benchmarks that give credence to this a
snapdragon theory but we haven't seen
any really thing but rumors suggesting
and be the exodus we haven't seen you
know that was it mally GPU in any of
these fish mark results yet yeah now I
think that we we've come to a point
where I seriously do not notice the
difference between the dual core
snapdragon on the s3 that i have on
these AT&amp;amp;T variant and the XO knows that
i have on the note 2 which is quad-core
i honestly do not notice the difference
they did a good job at keeping those you
know equal and and let's see there were
some early benchmarks that said the
Exynos was slightly faster but the
snapdragon version was almost faster
like launching apps and day-to-day
browsing the web so they're they're very
they're very close to one another one
thing's for sure though if they do this
octa-core thing I think it's going to
have a neat party trick I you know it's
the ideas it's going to have two sets of
four cores one for light duty one for
heavy duty and the truth is that ninety
percent at a time you're going to be on
this light duty batch of course and so
your battery life is going to jump a lot
but then you're gonna be able to tell
your friends you have an active cord
that's nothing it's not really true
because it's not like an IBM cell
processor in the ps3 where all those
eight cores are working together like
magic it's kind of a marketing thing you
sound like if you're talking about the
Tegra 3 where you're being marketed a
quad corn you're actually getting a
single core yeah probably less I yeah
totally let's jump to design what do you
think this thing is gonna look like
welcome mmm samsung recently left to its
own defense and an article in an
interview with CNN which i think we
talked about on the weekly yesterday
where there
who's saying here's why we use plastic
we need to use plastic to scale
appropriately we need to use plastic and
we we can't use metal for these reasons
basically so I don't see there being a
giant leap in hardware design here these
they're going to stay plastic shape
though so we have seen some signs that
is going back to an S to kind of look
rather than the really smooth pebble
design of the s3 yeah and if that
happens in my opinion that was the only
thing about the s3 that actually excited
me was that if the design yet felt cheap
in the hand but at least the design
looked like they were trying to do
something different if they go back ps2
I gonna be sorely disappointed you know
you know it's interesting that Samsung
is copied apple and just about
everything except the gs3 but then the
question would be if they're going to
follow the trend of Apple in not
switching the design of the X of the s4
and just adding more hot more better
specs and a better you know software
which was a rumor like two weeks ago so
like an s3 body with different with a BP
yeah yeah you know they'll probably
switch one thing here they're probably
make this the display a little larger
within the same the same bezel and just
add more you know beef your respects and
stuff I you know you never know i mean
how more could you differentiate this
phone i asked myself that question i
mean what's next seriously you think i
look Amy your piece sorry you know use
if they use across the galaxy s3 and the
achieve s and the note to like it's the
same earpiece little money oh yeah you
know it was the same on the s2 but what
they did was in the s2 it was black
colored instead of a metallic colored it
was actually the same earpiece when you
guys think about this this technology
that will follow your eyes as you're
scrolling which kind of seems weird
because when you got your phone out
you've got your thumb right on the
screen you can just do that right but
with eye tracking make life better let
me try first because I'm gonna be the
shirts we're gonna be my shortest answer
I'm gonna kill that switch right out of
the box I've got a creepy long I found
the house the smarts they feature creepy
so first thing I'm gonna do is disable
them and that's why I'm looking at me
phone I like the smart stay I I might
give it a chance until I have to you
know drink advil or something you make
makes you make sure you're in a well-lit
situation because that thing is only
only working and daylight and not by
night when it would be logical for it to
work a good point it's a gimmick
ultimately it's gonna sell a couple
phones but like Tony said who's gonna be
using this thing in the long run if it's
you know constantly goofing up in low
lighting conditions or lazy eye it might
be a gimmick but let's go back to smart
stay for a sec because Tony you turn it
off what about Michael and I made you
guys keep it on and keep it on and and
doesn't help I you know I just it's
there I switch it on and every now and
then I noticed the display turns on no
that's cool you know but it's like still
a gimmick for me as your battery life
goes boo boo boo correct well I haven't
noticed the difference honestly no I
mean like I i keep my display timer so
long that it doesn't really matter but
I'd smart say to me was a really cool
idea and the implementation was what
failed with smart say but if they can
implement this eyeball based scrolling
well it's something that I've actually
wished for for a while because I use the
S Pen on the note 2 to scroll
automatically by by hovering over the
bottom of a browser screen or a Twitter
feed or something and it's actually
really convenient so the eyeball is
really the next step it's just a
question of implementation and Samsung
has shown that they can roll out about
40 features into one phone but they
can't really haven't really shown that
they can make them all work well yet
their work yeah oh so let's let's move
on we only intended this to be about 20
minutes it's probably going to be about
30 minutes we've got 204 viewers which
is awesome for those just tuning in this
is just a roundtable hang up kind of
thing what we're talking about galaxy s4
predictions because in just like five
days we're gonna see this galaxy s4 and
so we're talking about predictions let's
jump to some surprises a samsung gonna
come out of the gate with something
that's like wow HTC is in trouble Sony's
in trouble good question
well let me let me start again first
because this is a tough question no I
don't think we'll see anything more
special than the usual Samsung gimmicky
features which are not gimmicky for
everybody are you making for me smart
stay the eye tracking scrolling they're
going to emphasize a lot on that and
we'll probably see a new version of
TouchWiz which will probably look a
little bit the same as TouchWiz nature
UX but with a couple of improvements
they're gonna emphasize a lot more on
the design and they're gonna mark my
words they're gonna publicize the camera
so badly that everybody who thinks of an
HTC One will immediately compare 4
megapixels is there to 13 yeah 13 yes
yes well it's interesting that you
brought up touch with his first turnin I
think these are two different things you
get a camera and TouchWiz because
because we know we sort of know that the
smartphone group inside Samsung is what
drives TouchWiz innovation you're not
going to see a new version of TouchWiz
launched on a tablet you'll see it on
the F galaxy s first and then it'll kind
of disseminate so like I think that's
more important almost than the camera
for you I people like some of us because
TouchWiz has aged pretty quickly over
the past year I mean it's starting to
look as cartoony as its previous version
now with the new version of sense coming
out looking a little more businesslike
with new platforms kind of taking that
minimalism and implementing it you know
I mean does everybody else's tired of
TouchWiz or am I completely off base
here I'm not tired i like it and i hate
the design but i love the fact that it
never stutters that's me I know tired of
it either but then again I'm not tired
of iOS either so I'm that kind of guy
who works with whatever he has same here
same here I don't know in my particular
opinion it's like you know for example
what is there gonna be something awesome
about the s4 compared to the one no
we're you know we're at that point of
innovation where you know processors get
more cores and stuff but you don't
really see a difference yet you know
there's just so much an arm-based chip
can do anyways um and so much that the
apps can do in kernels and stuff I don't
I don't think I'll see much you know I
just I I want an HTC One but I could
imagine Samsung's marketing in every
bathroom of the whole wide world even a
antartica and I just you know even if I
want an HTC One I'm gonna want to miss
three just because of the fact that
bathrooms are gonna be full with that
you know it's gonna be in your mind and
in your friends mine and everyone yeah
three I mean you're you remember when
the 1x came out I wanted a 1x and I got
the one action that I just dog Michael
get me an s3 get me in a street just
because of the ads true and yeah yeah
well if that will prompt a certain
amount of backlash too because I mean
that would be that would drive somebody
like me to instantly reject anything
yesterday and say alright everyone else
you enjoy your s3 and s4 is I've got my
HTC One and you know i like it because
it's special but i don't know you know
we're talking about the s3 but that's
what it takes to beat the one what if
the ones actually are the s4 what are
the ones actually be more attractive
phone hear me it's smaller it's got
those for some people don't care about
the front facing speakers but i don't
use headphones on my phone a lot I like
to listen to stuff on the phone and that
could make it a lot more attractive and
we had the jury's still out on the
camera the poor megapixel is going to
cut it or not but I think it has a
chance to be competitive you're you're
making an excellent point and I tend to
agree with you but let's not forget that
Samsung has a humongous your base so
regardless of even if the HTC One is out
of the box twice as good as the s4 the
s4 will probably sell three four five
six ten times more than the HTC One
exactly because Samsung is now riding
the wave and HTC's unfortunately
continuing that slow slow trend of going
down yes fortunately I think you're
right about that we should all remember
that what happened with the one ex I
mean reviews on the One X were just
unbelievably good from from us from from
other outlets I mean with the One X was
roundly praised in 2012 it didn't really
matter one Samsung's juggernaut got and
you know God got up to speed and they
started spending something like 12
billion on advertising you got a typo or
is that for real that's what it said
that's but before all of Samsung
Electronics not just sort of loans okay
I'm looking at this camera thing as a
really interesting point of
differentiation because you've got the
iphone 5 which has a very very good
camera as and the galaxy s3 is as good
and then you've got like the Xperia Z
which early indications are that has a
very good camera
Taylor's done some comparisons and it's
it's awesome and then you've got the HTC
One and the jury's still out on that 4
megapixels and I heard this in that
editorial is is just not enough so I
think Samsung is going to take insane
insane image quality and high resolution
and it's like wow look at this photo you
can take and until the iphone 5s comes
out that's going to be the best camera
on the market and people care a lot
about cameras and that's going to be a
big point of differentiation true true i
I'm I don't know that 13.1 megapixel
sensor on the Xperia that's going to be
the same sensor on the iphone 5s and on
the s4 you know that Samsung buys the
Sony sensors and apple buys the Sony
sensors as well so that we're going to
get the same camera on these three
phones and then you got the HTC one I
don't know I think HTC should really
stop trying to convince us of whatever
that camera can do in the liver but they
haven't historically shown that they can
deliver on what they say I mean they've
got awesome design but then their
implementation is really not as great as
they say it is so I don't know exactly
very good well I think we're going to
wrap this up soon just some final
thoughts from everyone a galaxy s4
what's it going to take for it to be
your daily driver to have in your pocket
for two three four five six months let's
start with shortest to two or five six
months nice room number there if we're
starting from the shortest that would be
me something that I was going to say is
that I think the biggest surprise of the
galaxy s4 launch an introduction into
the world is that it's not going to be
that much of a surprise I really think
that Samsung is going to play it safe
they have a model that works they are
winning and all they really got to do is
iterate the galaxy s3 is still an
amazing phone they need to do something
better than the galaxy s3 market the
heck out of it market it against HTC and
they and they win and it's it's a shame
when it comfortable when a company gets
comfortable like that but it's business
they're not going to do some risky new
feature that that puts that risk of
people saying hey I don't get it what is
this this is too high tech this is too
weird from
I think they're going to play it safe
but I'm excited and I hope that that I'm
wrong next in line in terms of order of
height is Michael wow that's really i
would go ahead Michael go ahead it'll
get Brandon I think you're something up
very well for me personally for the big
Alex s4 if everything we're seeing is
that will not be my daily driver if it
is the result of pia the strategy that
you I think rightfully predict
interative improvements do not impress
me in iterative improvements on a phone
the galaxy s3 which I respected but
which I never really loved in the first
place will not get me to pocket it I
like bold moves and I like something
different and this this this unless it
has a something really really special I
don't see myself carrying again I'm a
how about you okay in my face one of my
biggest disappointments about the HTC
One X was compromised um you didn't get
expandable storage you didn't get a
replaceable battery but then you have
HTC designers being like we've had to do
this so that the phone would be so thin
and then you get the galaxy s3 and you
know these guys just completely marked
the designers from HTC by showing you a
thin phone that could have everything so
for me I'm getting a galaxy s4 just
because of the fact that Samsung is
known to not compromise that's just me
and obviously you've got the marketing
push you'll have a great camera you know
for me it was like oh it's a beautiful
HTC One but the camera sucks uh and then
you get the galaxy s3 which gives you
everything so that that I think best for
is gonna be that and that it is going to
be my daily driver that's just me a
no-compromise device very good and
Steven what do you think I think and
we're getting to a point now where all
these headlining devices from the
various big companies are looking a lot
the same spec wise so Samsung really
needs to nail this guy in a design
department means a little bit bigger
than the HTC One so if they keep that
bezel small and you know fits nice in
the hand and for me 4.8 inches is
already pushing how big I want a phone
so simple I can make this guy feel nice
to use that could make all the
difference in the world and and and yeah
that's a really good point because 5
inches even bigger than 4.8 inches you
want mom and grandma
sister and brother you want everyone to
be like I can use this in my hand this
doesn't feel like some cumbersome device
that I can't slip into the pocket so
that is a good point and Tony what do
you think as I said I don't really care
about specifications at this point in
time so I think that it will take two
things to cumulatively happen with the
s4 first of all it will have to have a
better design than the HTC One which I
like and it will have to have a camera
better than the one on the HTC One if
Samsung delivers both of these two
within the s4 not only one of the both
at the same time I'm going with the s4
else it's the HTC One for me this year
it's a tough choice it's a tough choice
indeed but we will find out in five days
guys thanks for for joining this is the
first time we've done this and it was a
lot of fun and guys that are watching
sorry that we didn't make this
participative said a word what's the
word it is now participate able that's
all we can make this participated what
we just wanted to try something
different please leave us a comment let
us know what your predictions are and
what it will take for you to carry the
galaxy s4 in your pocket when it's
released and if you think it's gonna
beat the HTC One or if HTC is sitting
pretty with the coolest Android device
we've seen in a long time so that'll do
it and be sure to check out the other
version of pocket now live on friday at
two p.m. where you can participate and
come and hang out and talk you know all
right with that thanks guys see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
