to product and there are certain devices
that are just to feature-packed to be
judged by one video I'm high net
embedded with pocket now here with our
first impressions of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 7 after 24 hours
brought to you by deep brand pocket aus
galaxy note 7 coverage is made possible
by D brand manufacturer of precision cut
vinyl skins for smartphone tablets and
other gadgets go-to deep brand.com slash
galaxy to pimp out your new galaxy note
7 to call the samsung galaxy note 7
justin s7 edge with an S Pen would be a
huge understatement
we're actually preparing a full
comparison between both to show you just
how superior the note is physically the
Galaxy Note 7 feels different given the
thinness of the metallic trim it almost
feels like if you're holding glass and
no metal thanks to the curves these
elements contribute to a design that
almost seems like if there are no
borders between the display and the
chassis and Samsung even remove the
sharp corners of the display the curves
also serve to make you feel like if
you're holding a phone that's smaller
than it really is the setup process of
the note 7 doesn't really change much
the standard Verizon intro with Google's
option to tap and go to restore from a
previous phone in the security settings
I actually decided to go with the
fingerprint for now since we're
preparing a separate video just to
detail the iris scanning features this
being a verizon phone course the company
stopped to recommend us their Verizon
cloud which I obviously declined to be
honest I'm waiting to see what the
Samsung Cloud feature is all about but
bear in mind that rumours claim that
Verizon variants won't include it what I
did use for the first time ever is smart
switch and boy do I recommend you do -
this is like Apple's iCloud only far
better on iCloud you do get a carbon
copy of the phone you're storing from
but only samsung's Smart Switch allows
you to select what you want to restore
and this even extends to the memory card
I chose not to sync things like contacts
and calendar appointments to avoid dupes
with Google Sync for example and to see
that the app will restore my launcher
folders just the way I had them is
really a dream word of warning do grab
some coffee as this might take a few
hours and make sure your note 7 is
charged as it will use the battery of
the note to charge the old device by
default you will be prompted to
disconnect the old phone once app
installations begin you can continue
using your phone during the process
though beware of the obvious lag as this
is normal with app installations once
the setup process is done we're greeted
by the gorgeous 5.7 inch Super AMOLED
display and what Samsung is calling
their new refine UX on top of Android
6.1 marshmallow the company claims that
the idea is to create a frictionless
experience and we agree in everything
except the Verizon bloatware that you
can disable the new icon pack has a
smoother look to it and the feel extents
of the drop down menu the icons now show
more of a minimalistic design you can
rearrange these with a long press we
were met with a pleasant surprise of a
blue light filter within the settings
which mimics Apple's nightshift then
dropping blue tones at night but Samson
goes as far as to activate the settings
at the precise time of the sunset in
your area which is awesome the settings
menu also receive the visual revamp that
follows the old color grouping scheme
you can customize shortcuts at the top
even the keyboard receive changes with
rounder borders and finally the option
to get resized and to remove the number
row
sadly text prediction remains the same
meaning yeah I moved back to SwiftKey
Samsung has also improved that's always
on mode dramatically now you can add
color to all screen options available
there are new background options to
choose from and notification icons are
actually useful this time including
third-party applications will discuss
the s-pen integration to the always-on
display on a separate video coming soon
Samsung steam store approach also got
some changes for the better an existing
Galaxy units finding wallpapers in the
store was a pain and let alone a
separate icon pack back then it was all
or nothing now we see wallpapers with a
dedicated tab and the same goes for
themes and icon packs which you can now
choose separately and finally returning
to the note is Samsung's custom edge
features at a quick glance these look
identical to what we see with the galaxy
s7 edge but our full comparison video
will shed some more light on the subject
now using the galaxy note 7 over the
first 24 hours has been mixed and it
makes sense it's a brand new phone
battery life has scratched 4 hours of
screen on time for less than the 6 hours
of the s7 edge on our first battery
drain I'm thinking that it could have to
do with the fact that Verizon's network
isn't the best in my neck of the woods
but time will tell there's a new app
power monitor that allows you to
selectively disable background
activities for certain applications and
I also love how this power saver mode
now tells you how much extra time you'll
be getting depending on what mode you
choose and as for those quick charge
times over the cable we went from 8% to
44% in 30 minutes on our first charge
which was not bad the camera still
launches with a double tap in the home
button and we now get a slider for
filters along with different camera
modes one bag now went into detail over
all the changes in our hands-on video
last week and that a quick glance let's
just say that this is a galaxy it
follows on the legacy of its
predecessors with amazing photographs
and speed of taking them but one will go
into more specifics in our full camera
review coming very soon other than that
performance is smooth upload times have
been quick and it's hard to deny that
Samsung's UX changes have added an extra
level of elegance of the experience
match this with the gorgeous looks
provided by its design and the amazing
feel in the hand and let's just say that
we have enough material for this phone
to be the year's best we've got more
videos coming every single day to detail
all the elements of the Samsung Galaxy
seven so please stay tuned folks this
video was made possible by deep brand to
