that fits in your hand sony has
something to offer you for pocket now
I'm high as a human at Aoife 2015
bringing you a quick showroom comparison
between the Xperia z5 and z5 compact
we've praised Sony in the past for
keeping its compact series nearly spec
for spec on par with the full-sized
Xperia alternatives and thankfully
that's still the case here both phones
run on the powerful Snapdragon 810 SOC
and feature the same updated 23
megapixel sensor that Sony calls its
best smartphone camera ever there's a
fingerprint scanner tucked into the
power button on each phone first for the
Xperia line and longtime features like
ip68 dust and waterproof certification
remain here as well each phone features
front firing speakers microSD support
and triluminos display technology for
better contrast and color reproduction
but for all the similarities these
sibling phones share there are also
quite a few differences between the two
the most obvious one is in size the 4.6
z5 compact is dwarfed by the Xperia z5 s
5.2 inch display and the resolution
jumps from 720p on the former to 1080p
on the latter the compact is also
lighter at 138 grams versus the z5 s 154
and the three gigabytes of RAM of the z5
beat out the compacts two gigabytes less
specs aren't the only change the z5 has
a much nicer filled with aluminum
railings as opposed to the compacts
plastic frame but that very plastic is
what allows the compact to avoid the z5
s antenna lines other small differences
are present like the z5 s hybrid nano
sim and microSD card tray but while
he'll make a few compromises in design
by buying the compact both phones will
undoubtedly be premium devices likely
with reflective pricing once they launch
