monday disaster and will they be looking
into 4k displays on the next iPad and
HTC finally see some light in between
some other additional darkness I'm hi
Natalie that and trust me motorola CEO i
want a free phone not apologies this is
pocket now daily Lister's day off with
some official news from HTC which are
both good and bad on the good side their
revenue was up three percent compared to
last month which is great since they
haven't really had an economical break
in probably a year already it's been
really bad for them but sadly on the bad
side if you want to get the HTC One many
of the UK you're out of luck as the
phone is currently banned for patent
infringement from Nokia so you thought
that the company would get a break but
they really haven't now let's talk about
Apple is the company is reportedly
working with five different prototypes
of that 12.9 inch iPad that they're
apparently working on which is
interesting but even more interesting is
the fact that apparently we're not just
going to get one 12.9 inch iPad
apparently Apple is working on bringing
us two different tablets and it seems
that one of them will retain the current
render display resolution which is 2048
x 1536 which is close to 2k and then
apparently the other tablet will have 4k
resolution it's really interesting how
Apple plans to bring this to the table
with all their iOS you know limitations
but stay tuned let's see how that goes
and for those of you that are interested
in a better camera experience on your
current Nexus 5 or any Google edition
phone well it seems that the company is
already testing android 4.4 point one in
the crowd so this could mean that the
update is very close to being released
and that's actually a big deal is
probably one of the biggest enhancements
that everybody is waiting for is
enhanced camera technology now obviously
we still don't have any specific dates
this could take a couple of weeks but
stay tuned that's worth that and
speaking of Google companies motorola
CEO dennis woodside just issued a public
apology for their cyber monday disaster
as it turns out they were selling the
Moto X at three hundred forty nine
dollars and their moto maker website
just went ballistic it crashed it could
not take even half the orders that they
were receiving on demand then they just
couldn't figure it out and as it turns
out they are offering a consolation of
starting this deal again on this
number ninth now links to the
description for details on how to apply
to that but it's really interesting to
see that the Moto X is making a dent
even though cheating and finally for the
interesting news of the day the cyber
monday deals results hurt in and well
laugh it turns out that the company that
had the worst deals ever is the one that
sold the most and this is Apple they
always have the most terrible deals and
they sold more software and hardware
than anybody and we're talking more
about the ipad and yeah the ipad air had
a lot to do with that but you know that
leads you to the question of the day
what did you buy for black friday or
cyber monday what is your new
acquisition in my particular case I had
to exercise some restraint as I actually
have too many gadgets right now but

you buy and friends you know the drill
