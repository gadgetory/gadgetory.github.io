packing.com and today I'm going to show
you a program from windows mobile
marketplace called contact changer and
what this allows you to do is actually
arrange your context either by first
middle last last name first name and
first name and last name and one thing
that is a little bit annoying about
Windows devices is that when you put a
new contact into your Outlook or onto
your windows mobile device it always
wants to start with last name and first
name which is nice if you like that but
I personally prefer to have first name
and then last name so what this program
is going to do is actually change all of
your contacts to whichever preference
you prefer so i'm going to show you my
contact list right now so i'm just going
to go home and then go to all people and
as you can see all of my contacts are
arranged by last name and first name
right now which is a little annoying
because i usually call my friends or
family by their first name so i'm just
going to go to start and back to our
program contact changer and now i can
change them to first name and last name
so i'll just click on here click change
and it's changed all of my contacts that
were not on the first name last name
basis so i can go back to my contacts go
back home and contacts all people and as
you can see all of my contacts has
changed to my first name last name order
okay so another neat thing about this
program is that it actually allows you
to add a contact name to the end of a
business name so if you call businesses
quite often makes it easier to arrange
your contacts so all we have to do is
going to settings click on this which
says add company name and that will add
company name at the end of the name to
make it easier to search your contacts
based on company and it's another
marketplace pick and this program is
called contact changer and the full
version does cost 99 cents on windows
mobile marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
