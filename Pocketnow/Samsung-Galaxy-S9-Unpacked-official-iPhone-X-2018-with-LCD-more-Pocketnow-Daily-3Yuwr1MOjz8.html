unpacked event on the galaxy s 9 the
rumors of the LCD iPhone have returned
and it's not gonna come cheap and it
seems the Huawei P 11 might still be in
plans but yes I said P 11 I'm Jaime
Rivera and fun fact I had to record this
video again because the hottest news
changed about an hour ago this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
began with the deals that I actually am
having a hard time sharing because well
pebble support is going to end in June
if you have a pebble smartwatch sadly
there will be no more software updates
after that as a consolation prize Fitbit
is offering $50 off its ionic SmartWatch
the ugliest SmartWatch you can buy but
yeah it's there now let's talk about iOS
for those of you that notice there is
iOS 11 point 2 point 5 already available
to everyone or at least the devices that
are compatible but the most interesting
part is that we thought that the battery
improvements and the way to toggle
performance changes on and off was gonna
come in this update it's not it seems
that the update only brings changes for
the home part those of you interested in
updates for the whole battery thing
you'll have to wait until 11.3 according
to sources now as well the spotlight
over the Huawei we were expecting the
p20 to be announced at MWC then we got
word that it wasn't now we hear
registration trademark information for
the P 11 P 12 and P 20 so apparently the
P 20 is still going to happen but in the
United States and then the p11 p12 is
going to launch in Europe what the
differences are it's still hard to
predict it but yeah MWC might still
bring something now let's talk about the
next generation iPhone as we've got
trusted sources claiming that there will
be an LCD iPhone that is going to be
mid-range but listen to this so the
differences are that it has an LCD
display that it's going to be an
aluminum body with 6.1 inches diagonal
on that LCD display so yeah it's gonna
have a less strong body with the same
design elements of the iPhone 10 the
problem is that they're calling this the
mid-range iPhone and apparently it's
going to cost between seven and eight
hundred dollars
like really mid-range and finally the
very hot news today have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 this video was
already recorded we had to record it
again because this dramatically changes
everything unpacked event details are
for February 25th which is obviously the
day before MWC begins in Barcelona we've
already been invited we're gonna
participate in that event we'll give you
all the coverage live most interesting
is what is being said about this
unpacked in the event details it says
that it's going to reimagine the camera
so up and today's question what exactly
do you think Samsung is going to do to
reimagine the camera with the Galaxy S 9
because about the only rumors we have
are of the variable aperture in the
camera do you think that's going to be
enough to reimagine the camera
particularly at a time when Google has
proven that it could just make everybody
look bad with the pixel to excel in
pixel to leave us a comment down below
