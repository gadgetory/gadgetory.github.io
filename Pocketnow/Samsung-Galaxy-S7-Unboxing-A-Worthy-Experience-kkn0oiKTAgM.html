never been good historically but it
seems that somebody finally got the memo
i'm hi meri better with pocket now when
it's time for our unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy s7
for years the whole concept of an
unboxing experience has been ignored by
AT&amp;amp;T and for reasons I've never
understood that first impression of any
expensive product is everything and
we're glad to see that things continue
to change for device is important the
new Samsung Galaxy s7 is probably one of
the most anticipated phones of the year
and this time it's not just for the
marketing hype the Vox exudes the word
expensive from the metallic text for the
black diamond pattern of the material it
does a good job at honoring the 750
bucks you just invested on even the
internal packaging resembles a hardcover
book and we're greeted by this beautiful
gold platinum variant inside the
accessories include a new design for a
sim ejector the same fast charging wall
wart from last year a white microUSB
cable and even a small USB OTG connector
which is great to have and then the
whole reason for this video the galaxy
s7 presented in two plastic protectors
but you know we enjoy peeling off oh and
yeah I guess I did get too excited with
that there are many reasons to be
excited though as this phone feels as
great as it looks in the hand from the
front that resembles last year's galaxy
s6 in every way but the added curves at
the back resemble its phablet cousin the
galaxy note 5 the result is a rather
surreal feeling as this phone feels a
lot smaller in the hand than it is
something we praised the lot from its
edge sibling last year
this gold platinum color is actually a
little darker than last year's gold
variant if you look closely and in that
same vein the metallic trim is also
silver as opposed to last year's
yellowish tint and even the flat accents
of last year's galaxy s6 have succumbed
to a curvier finish one interesting note
about this unboxing experience though is
that even though Samsung offers a free
gear VR the deal is rather cumbersome
it's only available for those of you who
get a new phone line or upgrade your
existing device so yeah we have to
follow the online request that takes
four to six weeks to verify other
carriers also offer additional bonuses
like a free year of Netflix so make sure
you redeem these when you unbox your
device as well that aside though the
initial experience is going so far so
good
Samsung is desperate to make a statement
with its new flagship and even though
we're here to test out all the hype
let's just say that this is a great way
to start folks this is just the
beginning of our Samsung Galaxy s7
coverage Tonys unboxing first
