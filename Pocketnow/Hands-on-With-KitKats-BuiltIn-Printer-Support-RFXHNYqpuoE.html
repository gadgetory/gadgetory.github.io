personal computer the promise of a
paperless office has been omnipresent
today that promise hasn't been fully
realized even with tablets that are
excellent reading devices we still have
times when we need to get that
information from the screen and put it
onto paper till recently that hasn't
been very easy I'm Joel Levi for pocket
now let's go hands-on with printing
support one of the lesser-known features
that comes with Android 4.4 KitKat this
is my Nexus 5 but what I'm about to show
you will work on any device that is
running Android version 4.4 or above see
one of the new features with KitKat is a
plug-in architecture the one we're going
to show you today is the printing
infrastructure and that lets you set up
various printing services the one that
comes kind of default and stock with
pretty much every version of Android is
Google's own cloud print which lets you
use their cloud printing service to
print to any printers that you've got
set up there today I'm going to show you
a different one it's the HP print
service plug-in but any other print
manufacturer that has a plug-in in the
Play Store or work just fine and it'll
show up in here so what I've done before
this video is I went out to the Play
Store and I download it and install the
HP print service plugin and that's
pretty much all I had to do once that's
installed then we come over here and
turn it on do we want to use this our
document may pass through one or more
servers on its way to our printer now
the reason for that is this device is
connected to a wireless network my
printer is connected to another network
or possibly the same network but for the
processing it may go all the way out to
HP and back in so we'll go ahead and say
ok to that right now it's searching my
local Wi-Fi network for printers and it
should find the printer that I have
sitting just behind me if it takes a
little bit longer than you think it
should to find your printer make sure
your printer is turned on
and that it hasn't gone into its sleep
mode which mine had once I turned that
back on everything was fine it detected
the printer really fast and I'm good to
go you can see here it's using the print
service plug-in that we just downloaded
and installed previously so that's good
if you want to turn this off you can
just by toggling that if you did not
find your printer you can add it over
here by IP address or by name so that's
nice but ours is all set up so we don't
need to worry about that what I do want
to show you is the settings because this
is kind of robust and that's why I like
using this plug-in over some of the
others out there let's go ahead and go
into settings you can change the
protocol if you want to change for the
default to the EP CL protocol this is
not the default setting but you can I
don't have any reason to do it so I've
just left that off my printer has a
duplexer so I can print to both sides of
the page I like that it saves me on
paper so you know save a tree or just be
cheap and don't buy as much paper
whatever I don't care but I can do that
very simply and I can toggle that on and
off I want there's nothing worse than
having just really really block G print
jobs come out so this will show me a
notification when they inked in the
cartridges is low if I want to I can
share the data of my usage with HP
services I've opted not to do that
because that's just extra data that is
flying across what I'm already paying
for so not getting anything extra from
it from HP so I've just chosen not to of
course I've got the obligatory
application versions and the legal stuff
but that's pretty much it now all we
have to do is find something to print
and print it that's where android kitkat
really excels as opposed to some of the
other apps for example what I had before
was at the HP ePrint ER selection if I
can come back in here you can use ePrint
and it does essentially the same thing
but everything you print has to be done
through the app this app rather than the
app that you're trying to print from let
me show you what I mean I fired up quick
office and I've created a new document
let's go ahead and open that up again
it's going to open it from my
we'll drive says hello world let's go
ahead and change that too hello
pocketnow complete with spelling
mistakes and all so that's good let's go
ahead and save that change just go ahead
and save it in place there we go we're
all done if this were the old HP
printing app or if you're trying to
print from a non KitKat device you're
going to have to exit this app open the
HP app open this in that app and then
print very clutchy here we simply go up
to our menu hit print it brings up our
print dialog which we can now change
what printer we want to save it to or
send it to rather our printer or save it
as a PDF or look at an all printers list
so very nice there especially with PDF
integration we want to send it there so
we'll leave that we only want one copy
but we could select more if we wanted to
we can print this in color or in black
and white this is just black and white
so I'm going to select that orientation
we can change and the paper size which
letter is what we want now all I have to
do is hit print and if you can hear over
my shoulder that document is coming out
right now so that's how you set up
wireless printing from your
android-powered device again remember
this is just with Android 4.4 KitKat
anything below that and your options are
relatively proprietary and not nearly as
smooth and is integrated into the
operating system as they are with the
latest version of Android if you liked
what you saw here and want to see more
tips like these go ahead and give the
video a thumbs up and make sure you
subscribe to our channel so you don't
miss out on those when we do release
them we're also on your favorite social
media networks you can tell your friends
all about us there over on Twitter we're
at pocket now and I'm at Joe Levi thank
you very much for watching and we'll
catch you next time I'm Joe Levi for
pocket now and if I had people not
making noises outside my door that would
have been a good take
