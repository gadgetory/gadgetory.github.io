renders that reveal design changes Apple
closes the year with yet another crazy
record in revenue and for those of you
that are worried about the successor of
the HTC 10 you actually shouldn't I'm
Jaime marioneta and I really don't get
why people don't understand the
relationship between Voltron and the
Lion King
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin not with deals for some
reason that's becoming kind of hard to
find that to the holidays but we've got
MWC just around the corner we hear that
Huawei plans a big splash these are not
official news yet but we do know that
the Huawei p10 is in the works and as
much as some of us did not like that
design that dual camera was amazing we
cannot wait to see what Huawei plans to
bring and yes I do know that some of you
were worried about the future of the HTC
10 surely the you ultra made a big
splash but that doesn't mean that it
didn't bring some of the specifications
of the 10 but those of you worried there
apparently will be a successor the
company hasn't really come clear about
the fact that there will be but it has
T's that they you Ultra is not the end
of it so stay tuned yes I am a big fan
of Google Maps and I am a big fan of
either uber or lyft the problem is that
sometimes you have to use application
separately Google Maps used to recommend
that you carry an uber and the uber will
tell you how much money you would spend
but as of today the companies are
rolling out a change you can actually
order an uber or a lift from the Google
Maps application this is an awesome
change obviously the rollout will take
some time as usual
and yes I know that a lot of people have
started claiming that because this is
the first year that Apple started
selling less iPhones than ever that that
could be that the miss of the iPhone
that's actually not the case we've got
analysts already claiming the company is
about to close the year with one
trillion dollars in revenue one trillion
dollars in revenue is a lot of money for
just one product line but obviously this
includes sales of the products in
addition to all other things that are
sold around it so yeah Apple is not
going anywhere anytime soon
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy s8 we do know that there
are some design changes but sadly the
renders that we've seen everywhere
haven't really shown as much what we do
see today our case renders and we know
that case makers do an amazing job at
getting these we see a difference in the
backlash where apparently it's going to
be a tough cut off and not on the side
edition apparently there will be a
headphone jack at the bottom Alleluia
and if you notice the way that the
device is cut at the front apparently
there will not be a home button then
it's gonna be rather interesting but it
leads me to the question of today what
do you think about these possible
changes to the Galaxy s8 do you like
them do you feel that the phone should
retain its home button in my case I
think that change is always great let's
see what we get leave us a comment down
