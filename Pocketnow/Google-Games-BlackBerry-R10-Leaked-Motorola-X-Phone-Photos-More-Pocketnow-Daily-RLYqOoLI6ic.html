game expansion the blackberry r10 is
spotted in photographs and the Motorola
X phone is also spotted in photographs
but it's ugly I'm high muttering that
iron do I even need to repeat it thank
God it's Friday this is PocketNow daily
let's start today off talking about the
acer iconia a1 tablet that looks a lot
like the iPad Mini at seven point nine
inches diagonal in the display and it's
also got some these and specifications
but what really makes this tablet hot is
the price tag it costs 169 books for 8
gigabytes it's actually a lot better
than the nexus 7 until you actually try
to use them but anyway subscribe to our
YouTube channel for future coverage on
this tablet coming up now let's start
talking about the motorola x alone which
is just linked in photographs and looks
ugly really really just the product that
only a mother could love but hopefully
we are expecting that this rubber thing
that we see around that is actually a
case and not really the design of the
phone but what's interesting here is
that it's being tested on AT&amp;amp;T and not
verizon usually Motorola's partner has
always been verizon so stay tuned for
the rumors hopefully it'll get prettier
and more carriers and everything now
let's talk about the Nokia Lumia 928
we've bored you with all the recent leak
photographs of what the device is going
to look like but what's interesting is
that no key just held a concert recently
for some specific people and they gave
out Nokia Lumia 920's to everybody to be
able to film everything that was
happening but there was some nokia crew
that was actually using a different
device which is the Nokia Lumia 928 on a
case but listen to this I mean this
concert was at night and apparently that
was the only camera that was being used
meeting the okay Lumia 920 it was pretty
much used to film everything so could
this camera really be that good stay
tuned most probably the verizon event at
ctia that's when we'll probably see this
phone and let's move over to blackberry
remember the road map that was recently
League where we saw blackberry r10 being
talked about with a curity keyboard up
front well we've already got some leaked
photographs of the Bison judging by the
materials and the red color this is most
likely a mid-tier drone as was expected
apparently the q10 is the high end and
the art n is not now this device is
being meal according to the roadmap
rumored to be launched in q3 of this
year
is pretty much the fall so I wouldn't
wait for it even for the device itself
and finally for the interesting news of
the day which ever rumors and
speculations of Google going into the
gaming business should be put to rest as
of now the company has just hired Noah
falstein which is famous for games in
the 80s and well apparently this guy is
their new cheap game designer and now
think about it chief game designer is
Google actually getting into the game
design business meeting are they getting
into making games like for example
Microsoft which actually has their own
games on xbox or are they getting a game
center are they actually building a game
console so that leads you to the
question of the day if Google would ever
bring a game console would you ever
ditch your xbox or your PlayStation over
this device my particular case it all
depends on Google I mean if this product
will integrate better with everything
and not become another nexus q that's
just going to die a couple of weeks
later I would probably invest on it but
it up gettin it also depends on Google
let's see what happens leave us a
comment down below what would you prefer
so far the Xbox stays with me and of
course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet rubbishy follow us
