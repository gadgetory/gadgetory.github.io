serious game expansion the BlackBerry
r10 is spotted in photographs and the
Motorola X phone is also spotted in
photographs but it's ugly I'm high
netting that I am do I even need to
repeat it thank God it's Friday this is
PocketNow daily let's talk today off
talking about the Acer Iconia a1 tablet
that looks a lot like the iPad Mini at
7.9 inches diagonal in the display and
it's also got some these at
specifications but what really makes
this tablet hot is the price tag it
costs 169 bucks for 8 gigabytes it's
actually a lot better than the Nexus 7
until you actually try to use them but
anyway subscribe to our YouTube channel
for future coverage on this tablet
coming up now let's start talking about
the Motorola X alone which is just
leaked in photographs and looks ugly
really really just the product that only
a mother could love but hopefully we are
expecting that this rubber thing that we
see around that is actually a case and
not really the design of the phone but
what's interesting here is that it's
being tested on AT&amp;amp;T and not Verizon
usually Motorola's partner has always
been Verizon so stay tuned for the
rumors hopefully it'll get prettier and
more carriers and everything now let's
talk about the Nokia Lumia 928 we've
bored you with all the recent leaked
photographs of what the device is gonna
look like but what's interesting is that
no key just held a concert recently for
some specific people and they gave out
Nokia Lumia 920's to everybody to be
able to film everything that was
happening but there was some Nokia crew
that was actually using a different
device which is the Nokia Lumia 928 on a
case but listen to this I mean this
concert was at night and apparently that
was the only camera that was being used
meaning the okay Lumia 920 it was pretty
much used to film everything so could
this camera really be that good
stay tuned most probably the Verizon
event at CTIA that's when we will
probably see this phone and let's move
over to blackberry remember the road map
that was recently league where we saw
blackberry r10 being talked about with a
purity keyboard on front well we've
already got some leaked photographs of
the bison judging by the materials and
the red color this is most likely a mid
tiered phone as was expected apparently
the q10 is the high-end and the ar-10 is
not now this device is big meal
according to the roadmap rumored to be
launched in q3 of this year
just pretty much the fall so I wouldn't
wait for it even for the device itself
and finally for the interesting news of
the day whichever rumors and
speculations of Google going into the
gaming business should be put to rest as
of now the company has just hired Noah
falstein which is famous for games in
the 80s and well apparently this guy is
their new chief game designer and now
think about it chief game designer is
Google actually getting into the game
design business meaning are they getting
into making games like for example
Microsoft which actually has their own
games on xbox or are they getting a game
center are they actually building a game
console so that leads you to the
question of the day if Google would ever
bring a game console would you ever
ditch your Xbox or your PlayStation over
this device my particular case it all
depends on Google I mean if this product
will integrate better with everything
and not become another Nexus Q that's
just gonna die a couple of weeks later I
would probably invest on it but it's not
gettin it also depends on Google let's
see what happens
leave us a comment down below what would
you prefer so far the xbox stays with me
and of course for an earlier scope of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet rubbishy follow us
on bogging down comment subscribe my
youtube channel you could also follow me
on twitter at Hyneman underscore to be
better please give this video thumbs up
if you like what you saw I am hi I'm
Adam Eve Anna thank you very much for
watching we'll see you on Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
