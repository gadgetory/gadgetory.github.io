of you that can spare some cash ever
watch is a bevy of new software updates
for its mobile devices the blackberry
proof may not be as pocket friendly
after all I'm hi Mary betta and can
somebody please explain to me where is
my damn hoverboard this is parking out
daily the official news today they go
the next bit Robin probably one of the
coolest ideas that I've seen in Android
in a long time not just for its design
but its whole way of handling Android
storage management and everything and
after a very successful Kickstarter
campaign the phone is now available for
pre-orders for dollars for either the
cdma or gsm barians and yet you can bet
i'm really looking forward tomorrow
other official news that are still of
mixed bag as youtube's new red program
which is your option to pay ten dollars
a month and with the subscription
service you will get to be able to
download content to your device locally
you will also be able to watch videos
without any ads but it seems that at
some point you'll also be able to get
premium content from certain channels
that won't be available for ad based
video watching which is okay that's not
available yet that is starting to roll
out today obviously you can subscribe
and let us know what you think as we are
still debating what we think about this
household the spotlight over to Apple
and other official news you can now
download watch OS to point out point one
which brings a ton of bug fixes I highly
recommend you get that but in addition
to that there is also iOS 9.1 that also
brings a bevy of bug fixes that are
mostly focused on the iphone success and
success plus actually look to the
description for full details on what
things get fixed and yes believe it or
not we are still in official news that's
a weird one this time with android 6th
auto marshmallow we learned that google
is not allowing OEMs to tinker with the
sleep mode but it doesn't really end
there OEMs are also forced to bring
additional encryption they're also
forced to give you information on
viruses and stuff and your expos√©
ability to these but even more
interesting is the fact that when it
comes to battery life OEMs are no longer
able to fix what you see is consuming
your battery
there's full transparency here and this
is great to see that google is enforcing
more guidelines let's just see if it
ends up working and finally today is
underwhelming news have to do with the
blackberry prib a lot of people are
stoked about this phone because yeah
it's blackberry design running Android
it's apparently bringing a more secure
version of Android as well I just think
that these new administration of
blackberry has totally forgot the
enterprise mentality because of the
price points we must have it that it's
going to be costing between seven
hundred and seven hundred and fifty
dollars which is a crazy amount of money
at a time we could just buy any MX's or
the Moto X or a ton of other great
phones for half that amount of money the
price tag is definitely crazy and we
have to consider there are a lot of
things that this blackberry doesn't
bring that new android phones to bring
so it does lead me to the question of
the day what do you think about this
price tag for the blackberry proof do
you think that it's warranted in my case
I don't I think they're crazy and I
would not pay that amount of money for
that phone but leave was a common town
below we would love to know which of you
were brave enough and as always you know
the drill if you want to get the nose
