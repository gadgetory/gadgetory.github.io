pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
review of the new HTC incredible s let's
get to it are you now this boat is sold
unlocked and it actually has the band's
do t-mobile's 3g which is quite nice you
can get it right now negri electronics
com it's about six hundred and forty
dollars yes expensive but if you get an
unlocked phone you know that you're
going to pray pay a premium for that
right now the HTC incredible s has
somewhat of a vanilla design as you can
see looking at it right from the front
there's not many interesting
characteristics about it probably the
most interesting part of the design of
the front of the device so that there
are no buttons on the bottom it looks
like a buttonless phone until you turn
on the screen but there's a reason for
that and there's an actual downside to
having that and we'll talk about that in
a minute but let's talk about the rest
of the device so we've got a speaker
grill up here with a nice LED
notification always nice to have that so
you don't have to turn on your screen to
see if you have a new email I've got a
1.3 megapixel front-facing camera which
is a resolution bump from the typical
vga resolution the screen is a pretty
good size 4 inches across and it's 800
down by 480 across resolution the
contrast on this display is fantastic
the color reproduction is great it's a
super LCD panel let's compare it to
another super LCD panel here on the
desire HD well this is actually the
inspire 4G it's a bigger screen and
we've got the same skin loaded on here
so we'll really be able to tell sort of
how the contrast looks and if we bring
these up close look at the difference
these are both set to automatic screen
brightness and the screen on the
incredible s just seems a lot more clear
more contrasty there seems to be almost
a bluish tint over the entire inspire 4G
screen here whereas on the incredible s
it's clear as crystal it just looks
really really great in colors really pop
so a lot of points here for the
incredible esas display which is super
amoled now a few things about these
buttons what you're going to notice is
that these button
we'll actually rotate which is pretty
cool so if we goes into say the web
browser and we rotate the display well
the buttons rotate that's really cool
right well sort of I mean it helps but
there's a problem with the buttons
depending on how you look at the buttons
they will have different level of
brightness so looking at them head-on
look at this area right down here in
fact I want to zoom in a little bit
hopefully I can show you this on video
if we tilt the device a little bit
towards the camera they get really dim
and then the search button becomes extra
bright and then these are sort of
different brightness levels the
brightness is very inconsistent and if
we go to the center and kind of tilt it
more directly at the camera they're all
very bright and then if we keep going
they become dim again so it's just it's
really strange how they've done this and
you can actually see that this is sort
of the tipping point where they get
bright and where they get dim so the
buttons kind of look very low-quality
the home button is always a little bit
more dim than the other buttons maybe
this was done on purpose but it kind of
creates a lower sort of quality feel
okay so let's zoom back out and continue
our look around the hardware on the
incredible s so if we go to the bottom
we've got a microphone and we've
actually got some other microphone holes
potentially but they don't actually look
like microphone Holt's talk about that
in a sec turning over to the side we've
got a nice size volume rocker a micro
USB port for syncing and charging the
the power button is actually on the
right side of the device and I wish HTC
would make up their mind because on
their last generation of devices they
put it on the left not a big deal if
you're getting this phone you'll get
used to it but in the world of phone
reviewers we kind of get frustrated when
they change the location of the power
button which with every generation of
phones and they also have the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the top on
the desire HD it is on the bottom so
just a small design change not too big
of a deal then we get this pretty cool
backing back here which is very
reminiscent of the the droid incredible
on verizon we have an 8 megapixel camera
with dual-led flash and a speaker now
this also takes video at 720p now back
here we'll also see a hole here
and also two holes here what are they
for well if we take off the back and we
see where they sort of go to they kind
of are part of the antenna system you
need an engineer to come in and tell us
what this is all about so here is the
first hole over here comes through where
these two contacts are and the other two
holes down here are from these other two
contacts will calls why are there holes
in the back battery cover where the
contacts ARF to help with the antenna
system we're not sure we're gonna have
to look into that but the back is pretty
cool because you've got this sort of
stage where the battery and the camera
lenses and then the rest of it is just
razor thin would be cool if one day
smartphones were as thin as the thinnest
part of this kind of down here so the
battery is fourteen hundred and thirty
milliamp hours I've actually got to show
you here that it comes with in eight
gigabyte class for micro SD card so good
size there on the incredible s when you
buy it
now let's talk a little bit about build
quality the incredible s is a lighter
device and when you get a lighter device
that often means that they're using less
metal and glass if you look at a device
like the you know desire HD here which
has metal on the back a big piece of
glass on the front it's quite heavy and
it feels high quality of the incredible
s as you saw is using a lot of plastic
it's got a glass screen of course and
you know go like that so they take care
that it's glass but beyond that there's
not any metal on the device it feels a
little bit low quality again it feels
light which is good but it feels low
quality which is not so good and one
final design note the incredible s has
actually a raised lip to be very hard to
show here around the device it's about a
half of a millimeter that protrudes sort
of up and around almost like a tray
really doesn't matter very much although
it may collect a little bit more
pocket-lint than your average phone
overall the the hardware of the HTC
incredible s isn't really what we expect
from HTC nowadays there are no chrome
accents there are no interesting design
elements it feels lightweight and a
little bit low quality but some people
again like the lightweight feel but
overall it's a little bit of a downgrade
from some of HTC's higher end devices
like the desire HD so coming up soon
we're going to talk about the software
on the incredible s talk about
benchmarking speeds now web browsing
performances and everything else like
that if you like the video please give
it a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
