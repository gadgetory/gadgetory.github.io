expect the g5 in the United States
Google unwrapped its Android end
developer preview and we go hands-on and
some iphone 7 case League still paint a
pretty picture for changes I'm hi Mary
Vera intentionally testing probably the
worst color combination ever just to
test this camera out and so far so great
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with feels those of you
interested in a Microsoft Surface three
not the pro 3 amazon has got some very
interesting deals free 385 bucks of you
buy it right now it's not the best
tablet in the world but then again some
people only really need a tablet and
they want windows on it so that's an
option and there are also some deals in
the huawei watch again in the length of
the description now one of the most
surprising things that happened
yesterday was google hunching android
and usually we have to wait for google
i/o to happen we're still more than a
month away for that and yeah we have the
Developer Preview we've already gone
hands-on make sure you watch Jolie wises
video in the link of the description as
well there are a ton of changes that are
really good including split-screen
multitasking in a very intuitive and
smart way we cannot wait to give you
more information as soon as we continue
testing it now let's fill the spotlight
over to Apple for those of you wondering
exactly what the changes will be with
the ipad air 3 or ipad pro mini a lot of
people are having a tough time because
we know the name is going to change but
hey the speakers that we saw on the ipad
pro are coming to the new ipad which is
great those speakers sound better than
the macbook pro but in addition to that
we also get support for that keyboard
that nobody really likes stay tuned for
more and speaking of apple and case
leaks we've got two more for its
smartphone lineup in the case of the
iphone SE it'll look a lot like the
iphone 5 according to some of the case
leaks that we found but in the case of
the iphone 7 we were expecting some
major design changes we even heard that
the phone was going to get larger but as
it turns out apparently it'll remain the
same even in design aesthetics only the
only thing that's changing is the lack
of a headphone jack and if the phone
doesn't get any thinner we're really
not going to complain as long as that
allows Apple to bring better battery
life but to hey a lot of things could
change from here to there as you know
the way case leaks go and finally for
the very hot news today let's talk about
the LG g5 we've been wondering when to
expect that in the United States we
heard Canada would be April athan rumors
now the company has provided official
press information that says early April
for the United States for the LG g5
along with some of its friends though no
specifics were provided and this is
great this is probably one of the most
anticipated phones of the year major
changes from LG but it does lead to
today's question we already started our
coverage of the galaxy s7 and we wonder
if you still wait for the g5 I'll admit
in my case I do for me this is the phone
i'm waiting for even though the galaxy
s7 has kept me some really good company
