clearly not enough deagle is the
vanguard product of Hyman true that
enjoy your hooker man hey Millie that's
180 what can I say that it was one of
your comments that mine that's right
it's that time of the week I am hai
meetha meetha now this is PocketNow and
this is the bargain out daily recap of
your comments for last week on Monday
and by the way
forgive my allergies but the topic was
the Infiniti ill display for the Galaxy
S ten I asked you what did you think
about this design we had 423 comments
the Infiniti o display looks way better
than the knotch ah alright I'll give
that to you I just I don't know how what
is worse like honestly I prefer small
little bezels with some sort of a
solution like for the earpiece and stuff
like that
then to have something that's not
symmetrical you know a spot there that's
in front of your video but that's me
honestly I think samsung's approaches
lightyears ahead of the competition in
terms of pure aesthetics alone no I mean
there's nothing symmetrical about a hole
in the corner of your display but that
being said yes it is far better than an
it's far better than a notch I have to
agree with that small bezels are better
than holes and disgusting notches and
there's nothing that will convince me
otherwise
see I rest my case I'm not the only one
who thinks this way then on Tuesday the
topic was the President of the United
States who I don't even want to mention
and the fact that there apparently will
be terrorists for iPhones that will make
him more expensive in his argument that
people in the United States can pay more
for iPhones we had 726 comments I asked
you if you thought people should
Apple is going to drop soon as their
products are very expensive yeah I think
that Apple is definitely gonna have to
figure that out because people are
already showing that they're not willing
to pay so much for an iPhone the
overpriced iPhone getting more
overpriced lol like seriously I mean I
know that it's a bad thing and put
Cupertino like seriously I know that
these guys are like they're pricing the
iPhone high because it doesn't sell the
same and therefore this is how they
compensate to investors and everything
in the stock market that's all fine but
that's not gonna last them long and
especially not with phones getting less
expensive and more powerful make iPhones
affordable again lol alright I'm not
even gonna laugh at that
iPhones have never been affordable then
on Wednesday the topic was that McLaren
at the of the oneplus 60 we got
some leaks and I asked you what do you
think and we had 357 comments if they
give me an actual McLaren and raised the
price of $2,000 I'm in keep dreaming bud
60 salute to speed I'm guessing a
hardware upgrade or some way to speed it
up more interesting true that we're
wondering what exactly does it mean as a
salute to speed obviously oneplus has
been using slogans like the speed you
need and stuff like that for the 6 so it
makes sense to see that they're saluting
it in some way not just design oneplus
mclaren version should be a gaming phone
it would be great true that
I wonder what's taken oneplus so long to
actually be like you know we've got like
a premium line of gaming phones that are
not expensive because that's the main
problem with certain gaming phones then
on Thursday the topic was Huawei trying
to beat Samsung to the punch of the
punch hole on the display I know
platon was terrible but the point is
that I asked you I mean this is coming
to a mid-range ER with a design like
this make you want to buy a mid-range
err we had 477 comments get in my pocket
you notch less beauty you uh that's not
necessarily a not such beauty dude why
are Samsung and Huawei making holes in
the screen I think it's just as bad as
the knotch
totally agreed I don't think it's a
symmetrical design
that provides any benefit but that's me
why not put a hole in the middle you
know I've been wondering exactly what is
the purpose and that's the reason why I
want to see the user interface I mean is
there a change of enhancement in the UI
to allow this to be the best option I
think it's not but that's just me
and then finally Friday the topic was
once again that infinity Oh display for
Samsung the fact that we saw screen
protectors with more information I asked
you what you thought and we had 300
comments I want to believe no s-10 will
have the infinity Oh display and that
Samsung will leave that for mid Ranger's
only you know it would be great to see
the same the company experiment and to
see that people either liked the design
or not and to that use that to either
implement or not the problem is we're so
close to the launch of the Galaxy S 10
of you do the math that I don't think
that's gonna happen
why not slap a display on the back for
rear camera selfies you know if not a
display but that's actually not a bad
idea though but yeah that's actually not
a bad idea seriously I mean selfie
cameras are always crap so why not just
solve it with a secondary display I
don't know I think it's just observed
that people care so much about little
bit more of a bezel I like a little bit
of bezel it's easier to use I think that
certain bezels serve a purpose I feel
that Samsung is the company that does it
best so I don't know why should we it
reinvent hot water here but true that I
like your point I mean there's no need
to just go full display it's not like if
it makes the experience any better
that's it for the volume out daily recap
