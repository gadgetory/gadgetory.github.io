pocketnow.com the htc inspire 4G and the
HTC Thunderbolt are two of the hottest
4G smartphones available today in this
video we're going to put them
head-to-head let's get to it how you
want okay so previously we've compared
the HTC Thunderbolt with the iPhone 4
and if you want to see that video we'll
put an annotation up right now and at
the end of the video so you can jump to
that if that's a more relevant
comparison for you so let's talk about
these two devices we're going to start
off with pricing because they have
different pricing schemes the AT&amp;amp;T
inspire 4G will run you $99 with a new
two-year agreement you'll probably want
to add a data plan to that the 2
gigabyte data plan for $25 and if you
want to tether its another $20 on top of
that for 2 gigabytes of data transfer
now the thunderbolt is much more
expensive it's two hundred and forty
nine dollars with a new two year
agreement and the data plan that you'll
probably get is the $30 per month
unlimited plan
so yes it's $5 more expensive than the
inspire 4G but unlimited data can't
argue with that
also it has a tethering plan $20 extra
for two gigabytes of tethering which
will allow you for both of these devices
to tether with 8 devices which is a
pretty cool function to have now another
thing to note is that the Thunderbolt
comes with a 32 gigabyte microSD card
the inspire 4G comes with just an 8
gigabyte microSD card so if storage is a
big deal to you the Thunderbolt is
definitely something that shines a
little bit more in that respect but the
price is quite different you're paying
150 dollars extra what are you paying
for exactly why the big premium well the
Thunderbolt has LTE and that is a new
technology it's very much sought after
and it's a it's a really big deal as
we're going to see in a few minutes when
we compare the the download speeds on
these two devices LTE
is much faster and as far greater
potential than ATT's HSPA+ network
another way that these phones are
different and we're going to talk about
specs in is in a minute is that the
Thunderbolt has a front-facing camera
the inspire 4G does not so whether you
use the front-facing camera really is up
to you and if that's it
important to in terms of other specs
they are very very similar they both
have a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor both have 768 megabytes of RAM
both have an 8 megapixel camera that
takes 8 720p video so really a lot of
things that are the same in terms of
hardware we actually like the inspire 4G
better show you why first of all it's
much much thinner after using the
Thunderbolt the desert the it's kind of
a Desire HD the inspire 4G feels really
thin as you can see it's it feels it
almost looks half as thin as the
Thunderbolt and of course the
Thunderbolt has a 4G modem and a CDMA
modem inside so it needs the extra space
additionally the Thunderbolt has a
larger battery 400 milliamp hours
compared to twelve hundred and thirty
million hours on the inspire 4G so far
we're fine during battery life to be a
little bit better on the inspire 4G
which makes sense because the LTE modem
probably uses more battery than does a
3G modem now also with the Thunderbolt
you get this kickstand which is kind of
cool although who knows how often you'll
be using that it's nice to have but it
definitely adds some depth to it because
they've had to build out sort of this
part of the phone in order to accompany
the the kick stand back here things what
kind of similar dual LED flash as
mentioned the speaker on the thunderbolt
actually behind the kickstand but that
doesn't really impact anything it's a
loudspeaker speaker on the inspire 4G is
up here we've got metal unibody
construction on the inspire 4G which
looks and feels awesome
over on the Thunderbolt you get sort of
a plastic back battery cover it doesn't
feel a sturdy in hand but it's not too
bad it's an HTC phone build quality is
always going to be pretty good so let's
turn these back over and turn them on
and talk about sort of how they compare
in other ways so here we've got pretty
much the same home screen setup they're
doing exactly the same thing at the same
time which is perfect so let's talk
about the bandwidth speed we're going to
open up speedtest.net we're both over
these are both over Wi-Fi we're not
going to run the network speeds but I
just want to show you some results that
we've gotten now 18 G's 4G network and
we've talked about
this a lot on pocket now is kind of like
a phantom Network we haven't really seen
it anywhere except in Detroit it's
certainly not around here I've run
benchmark after benchmark the best data
speed I've seen is about 1.7 megabits
per second down this is definitely over
3G and not there 4G and and upload
speeds are paltry they're worse than a
3G phone because this device doesn't
support HSUPA so if you don't have the
HSPA+ you revert back to HSDPA without
HSUPA I know that sounds confusing what
it basically means is you think you're
getting a 4G phone with the inspire 4G
but as of today it's really hard to find
their 4G network on the other hand
Verizon's 4G LTE network has a lot of
penetration in most major markets around
the around the United States and you can
pull up their coverage map we'll put a
link in the video so you can see that
but look at the speeds that that I've
been getting so on average probably
about six to seven megabits per second
these upload speeds are not accurate
because the speedtest.net application
doesn't work with the the LTE network
yet kind of interesting there so if you
want the fastest device in terms of data
connection it's no question that the
thunderbolt is the one to get and just
for the heck of it let's compare them
over the same Wi-Fi network and see if
there's any significant difference go
they should be pretty much the same and
it looks like they're going to be the
same okay so about 10 on each down and
about 10 on each other okay so no
difference over Wi-Fi although that was
certainly expected now both of these
devices have a super LCD screen 800 by
480 WVGA resolution although I gotta say
that the screen on the Thunderbolt looks
a little bit better
not sure if it's coming across on the
video but it just seems that the inspire
4G has a bit of a purplish tint and
maybe that's because we're in the wrong
screen but even if we go over here I
know it's gonna be it's very very subtle
but I think the Thunderbolt screen is
superior to the inspire 4G let's see how
they perform on the web it will probably
come to no surprise as you as that they
will perform
pretty much the same on the web because
they have the same interest we're also
going to run a quadrant benchmark test
in a minute so let's go to Engadget here
and here there we go and go they're off
they both have plugins set to
undemanding n't slow it down okay they
came up with the site at the exact same
time let's get to the bottom here we'll
go to desktop view if you can do that
what went too far there okay let's try
that and probably from here you can see
the purplish tint on the inspire 4G
let's go desktop okay missed that we're
gonna stop that not let it load okay
we'll let it load and we'll just refresh
the page and this particular test won't
be for speed
well we'll click on another link and get
it at the same time it's harder than
it's got as a to click two links at the
same time they can get to three devices
on the screen and wow that's uh that's a
big challenge okay so let's try to get
these at the same time make a little
bigger so get a bigger target see which
one loads it faster good at the same
time again these should end up exactly
the same pretty much
okay so the inspire 4G actually finished
wow something's happening with a
thunderbolt it is taking its time
perhaps this is an anomaly let's assume
that it is we'll go back to the previous
page and we'll try another link maybe
there's something wrong with that page
at the last minute there these phones
also both have an LED notification like
you can probably see them blinking one
here and one here which is a very very
useful feature so you don't have to
always turn on the the phone on your
screen to see if you have a new message
so let's do these
okay the inspire 4G finished again it
looks like the Thunderbolt is done it's
just that the status bar is showing it
as still loading but the page is
completely there so we're gonna have to
call it a tie because it wouldn't make
any sense that these devices would have
different speeds of loading web pages
let's take a more quantitative look at
the benchmark we're gonna go into
quadrant rent them at the same time and
see if anything is conclusive there all
right and we'll be back in a minute all
right then we're done here so click yes
let's see what we get okay so the
inspire 4G 1718 the thunderbolt 1729
that's not big enough of the difference
to say one device is faster than the
other if you're looking for speed in
terms of day to day operation they are
the same device at the end of the day
they both have the same specifications
basically a final measure that we can
look at and this is not that big of a
deal is how much bloatware comes inside
of the the app tray so let's go to the
top and on the thunderbolt there seems
to be more junk we've got bit bop
blockbuster of course comes we have city
ID and actually I can sort this by date
so that we can kind of filter out the
applications that I've downloaded and
you can see here the last app I download
here was voice so we've got bit by
blockbuster city ID I'm just kind of
looking for the the third-party apps
let's go
a lot of these are trials which is crazy
they should include the full software if
you're paying this much mobile I am is
added Rhapsody rock band slacker VZ cast
1vz cast 2vz cast navigator visual
voicemail and tune wiki there are a lot
of a lot of pieces of crap we're on the
Thunderbolt let's see here on the
inspire 4G let's go down the most recent
app downloaded was to do a lot of apps
on here okay
adobe reader so added to this is asphalt
18 to family map AT&amp;amp;T code scanner 18 to
navigator blockbuster going down the
list
live TV my AT&amp;amp;T
do let's see what else Wi-Fi hotspot
which is good to have YP mobiles
so certainly more junk on the
Thunderbolt and it's annoying because
you can't even delete the junk to go
into the the add/remove screen of B of
the settings it does they don't even let
you delete bit Bop for example I mean I
don't want a bit Bob to be in my
application drawer just just a little
minor annoyance so at the end of the day
these devices are very very similar if
you're looking for the thin device that
feels good in the hand it's lightweight
the inspire 4G is the one to go with if
you want the fastest internet possible
over cellular data no question you want
to go for thunderbolt if you want to do
a lot of data unlimited data the
thunderbolts the one to go for if you
want a lower price up front and a lower
data plan each month the inspire 4G is
the one to go with for you so again
hopefully this video was a little bit
helpful in helping you understand the
differences between these hot 4G devices
and if you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now
