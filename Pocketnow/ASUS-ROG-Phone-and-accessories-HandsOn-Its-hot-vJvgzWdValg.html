had the opportunity to get my hands on
the ROG phone this is a Seuss's gaming
phone for 2018 a company known for
making really good gaming pcs and
accessories is definitely going to take
out all the stops when it comes down to
a smart phone let's go and check out the
ROG phone with a quick hands-on from
Aoife this is TK and this is PocketNow
and XDA the ROG phone is a phone that is
not trying to look like any other phone
on the market right now it's trying its
best to look very unique and really fit
in the Heritage that we have from a
sous-sous is known for gaming implement
by gamers for the Republic of gamers and
that's how we have the ROG phone now
this device is definitely a very unique
device on the aesthetics has two bold
front facing speakers a six inch 1080p
panel that has really good color and a
refresh rate of up to 90 Hertz under the
hood we have the snapdragon 845 capable
of being overclocked all the way up to
two point nine six almost three
gigahertz we have the ability of going
with eight gigabytes of L ddr4 Ram on a
device that is mobile ufs 2.1 of course
is supported here with 128 gigabytes of
internal storage or 512 option that's
going to be coming out later this year
device is definitely intended to be
released in 2018 and I think it has a
lot of unique features I had the
opportunity to check out some of the
accessories that they had all the way
from the dock the connection to a TV or
monitor to be able to be a games or
using wireless controllers as well as
the actual cooling vent that was really
just a snap-on option on the back of the
device that has a built-in fan to help
reduce the heat and dissipate the heat
away from the device once that's being
overclocked as you can imagine with any
PC if you ever overclocked it you know
that there's going to be a lot of heat
that needs to go somewhere and this
device does a good job about dissipating
it gameplay was pretty good 90 frames
per second was actually very nice and
was easily seen on the display I
definitely appreciate having this type
of technology in a mobile phone and I
can't wait to get my hands on this in a
full review the device should be coming
out in Europe and US hopefully within
later this year price and availability
has not been shared with us but what we
understand it should be somewhere around
a thousand
like and subscribe as usual let me know
in the comments below what do you think
about the ROG phone for masseuse could
this be your next gaming phone thank you
very much for the support and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
