phone that money can buy for now we hear
that there is an HTC u 11 plus coming
and with some interesting changes and as
iPhone day and Apple watch day emerges
it seems people didn't go crazy I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes we have new phones
yes we have new watches we're going to
try to enjoy this weekend as much as we
can this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with product launches
today is iPhone day and as expected our
iPhone 8 and Apple watch series 3 are
already in the house we have our Apple
watch series 3 unboxing already live
expect the iPhone 8 plus unboxing from
Juan coming very soon and the most
interesting part is that we always
expect iPhone day to be of crazy lines
and it seems that there are still
certain variants of the iPhone that have
not sold out so this just proves that
people are waiting for the iPhone 10 it
seems now if we could call this a deal
Google is now offering trading programs
for the Google pixel and Google pixel XL
yeah I know these are last year's phones
and it's even more interesting we notice
that the only trade-ins available are
devices like the LG G 6 for example that
are much newer than the pixel still for
those of you that want to get one this
is an option for you you get credit for
it I just don't know if this is going to
be available for the next pixels and how
about if we discuss some of the
interesting changes to Android Oreo and
a recent blog post we noticed that what
are the changes is that in the past you
would hit the software update button on
your device and most likely you would
get a notification that was you didn't
get a software update and what we didn't
know is that actually the phone wasn't
really pinging the server for it one of
the interesting changes in Oreo is that
this will ping the server every single
time I'm not saying you're getting the
update I'm just saying that the phone is
actually doing what it's tell you it's
doing and I actually got tongue-twisted
there but you get the point
now let's move the spotlight over to HTC
those of you concerned if there are
going to be more HTC devices or not
we've got this new ocean master codename
and apparently this is going to be au 11
one a two by one aspect ratio from Japan
display and this is rather interesting
we didn't really
fact more from HTC later this year but
apparently we're getting the taller
aspect ratio which is pretty much what
was missing from HTC getting rid of
those bezels what are we getting it we
don't know yet
and finally the very interesting news
today come in the form of the DxO mark
rating for cameras according to them the
best camera you can buy right now is the
iPhone 8 plus being rated at 94 then
we've got the iPhone 8 being rated at 92
and after it it's only the you will love
it in the Google pixel which are rated
at 90 and I don't understand how the
galaxy s 8 could be an 89 and other
great flex of smart phones to have great
cameras are rated lower but yeah it
seems that the iPhone 8 and they Plus
are the best cameras you can buy right
now obviously our units have just
arrived we have to actually test them
expect Kwan's real camera review to let
you know more but it leads me to the
question today I mean is this the excel
mark enough for you to want to go buy an
iPhone 8 I mean you want the best camera
on a phone and that's what it's gonna
make you buy the new iPhone in my case
we've been you know we agree in certain
of the ratings from DxO mark but then in
the case of the Google pixel I mean the
photos are great but then that lens
flare is like really this film got rated
higher
I mean fix the lens flare because the
photographs are great it's just that
problem but anyways leave us a comment

opinion and friends you know it if you
