now calm and we're excited to give you a
preview of manila 2.5 also known as
touchflo 3d 2.5 that's going to be
coming out on future HTC devices this
comes from a ROM from XDA developers
it's very buggy doesn't work too well
right now but I can kind of give you a
an impression on what it will look like
when it ships now we're likely to see
touchflo 3d on HTC's next wave of
devices so that's the firestone the
whitestone we may see it on the touch
pro 2 and the diamond to when they get
their windows mobile 6.5 upgrades here's
something very very interesting this
whole interface the new touchflo 3d 2.5
doesn't work well with a stylus it works
very well with a fingertip which makes
us possibly think that HTC is a
capacitive device coming down the line
especially the fire stone which looks
very very similar to the HTC touch HD it
has a lot of the same specifications
although we're thinking that there's
gonna be one big differentiating factor
it could be that it has a capacitive
touchscreen we're hearing conflicting
reports on whether windows mobile 6.5
will support capacitive screens right
now we're going to say right in the
middle it may or it may not but there's
a good chance that it may especially now
that we see that manila 2.5 does really
well with finger navigation and you're
going to see a lot of the things have
changed to be more finger friendly
starting on the main screen so we're
going to zoom in a little bit from this
main screen we can add a shortcut and
we're taken to this ad ad quick list
where we can add a program or contact or
bookmark which is pretty cool because
you can put pictures right on your main
screen of people that you call on a
regular basis and I have no context
right now in this phone so I'm going to
go back and we can go to program and
this is very buggy it may freeze during
this demonstration and we can add any
program to be an item on the main screen
and so we have bubble breaker and
activesync we can have a picture of
somebody we can flick our finger and get
even more shortcuts right on this main
screen if we flick our finger again we
are taken to the time
we tap on calendar we are linked
straight to the calendar tab and of
course is the new deeper calendar tab if
we go to menu and new appointment we are
actually taken to this new HTC
appointment screen if you remember on
the touch HD and the touch pro 2 and the
touch diamond2 we kind of had the ugly
windows mobile interface for the new
appointment but now we have a much
deeper implementation of touchflo 3d
through the new appointment it's very
very beautiful and it really hides
windows mobile a lot so let's go back
over here and next we're going to go to
people and people we no longer can flip
through pictures of people I think HTC
found that this was very much of a
novelty and it makes a lot more sense to
have just a grid of people a grid of
pictures that you can click on and you
can dial people directly from the screen
so that makes a lot of sense and
furthermore it's very finger friendly so
you don't have to take out your stylus
and try to get something more precise
messages I've nothing there email looks
the same although I things set up email
on this device not sure if that is the
same if we go to Internet we also have a
different screen here we can search
Google right from the top here or we can
scroll down and add again finger
friendly links to websites that we visit
on a regular basis and presumably this
will add icons that represent the
websites that you're trying to visit if
we go over to calendar we already know
that it goes a lot deeper than it did
before on the previous touchflo devices
stocks not connected to the internet
although I'm assuming it's going to be
about the same if we go over to pictures
it's about the same we've seen this
before we flip throw pictures we can
link to our camera or to the video
camera if we go over to music this is
also going to be very similar weather
again very similar and it says there's
an error trying to connect the data
which makes sense and now we have
footprints and footprints was first
introduced on the HTC touch cruise the
new touch cruise basically it assigns
geo-coordinates two pictures that you
take so if you take a picture of a nice
Italian restaurant that you found in the
city you can assign a place to it on the
map so you can get back to it it looks
like footprints is coming to all future
HTC devices which makes a lot of sense
all devices have have that capability
and then
get into settings where we see a lot
more of this deeper integration with
Windows Mobile so if we go through a few
of these things we recognize some
screens we've seen the screen before
it's included on the touch pro 2 and the
diamond to you can use the nice touch
flo 3d interface to manage your profiles
and the system settings like that if we
go into communications were linked
actually directly to the communications
manager and again we've seen this and
then if we go into personalization
things start to change so we can go into
wallpaper and we can choose a picture to
make our wallpaper we can go into home
screen which allows us to move around
the items on touchflo 3d we can actually
change the fonts and before this was a
setting in Windows Mobile in the
standard interface and now we can
actually change it right from touchflo
3d in this nice environment if we go
back we can change the contact card and
we can also go into advanced
personalization settings which just
gives you an option of to vibrate
certain items on the screen so let's go
back and see where else there is deeper
integration with the touchflo 3d and
finally we can take a look at other
things in here such as phone information
which will show you things about the ROM
you're running and so on and so forth
this rom is so buggy this is a
pre-release obviously that it freezes
half the time I've actually had to reset
the device many times while filming this
video so anyway touchflo 3d 2.5 looks to
bring a lot of deeper integrations with
Windows Mobile it really skins the
interface so that you're staying in
touch flo 3d most of the time also there
are a ton of finger friendly
enhancements that have been made which
leads us to believe that there may be a
capacitive HTC windows mobile device
coming out in the near future we'll have
to keep an eye out for that it would
make a lot of sense and we'd be really
excited to see something like that so
