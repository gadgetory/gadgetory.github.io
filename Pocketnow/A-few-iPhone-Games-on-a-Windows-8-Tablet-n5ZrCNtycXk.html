windows 8 release preview comes with a
few free games for the towel operating
system some about nice touch features so
let's check out a few of them see how
they work so before we go start some
games I just wanted to quickly show you
what this tablet is running it's a one
point three gigahertz I used some 7303
old cpu and here's our task manager back
on the start screen I have a few games
over here mostly is there while all of
them are iphone ports so they're popular
iPhone games and you'll see they have
some nice live tiles we see actually my
score showing through here so let's try
do god it's already running I guess and
we can choose different types of
elements
and creating relevance so let's do maybe
this one nope
so here we have cut the rope we're going
to play that see how that works the
usual animation okay so touch screen
working pretty nicely so for that first
time that i miss Oh miss that scar and
lastly let's do fruit ninja
a bit of lying there all right you might
be able to see a problem win this game
playing this like it's a little more
intense there we go sometimes if you hit
the edge it's going to pause the game
same look the side edges oh no see that
if you accident accidentally swipe your
kind of switch to a different program so
that's a potential problem with games on
Windows 8 if you swipe too close to the
edge like one pixel over there you might
accidentally do a Windows Phone a
gesture that will cause the program to
pause or clothes like so so those are a
few cool games for the windows 8 tablets
I pretty nice touch features so if you
enjoyed this video give us a thumbs up
and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
