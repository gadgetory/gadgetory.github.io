s6 internals and design Microsoft
finally unwraps its Lumia denim update
for the masses hcc already spills the
beans on mwc 2015 in an event I'm hina
Ravenna and even though Fridays are
supposed to be quicker and for
celebrating there's a lot of work
involved on them this is parking out
daily we have a lot of significant
official news today starting with
Microsoft's launch of Lumia denim we've
been waiting for it since Kiba 2014 and
yes the company has now confirmed that
it will start rolling gradually are
different Lumia devices but even mind
not every Lumia device will be able to
do the same things with Lumia denim so
make sure number one that you watch our
full video with the camera features in
the links in the description in addition
to our Lumia 930 after the buzz that
should go live very soon as well if you
want to learn what Lumia denim could do
as a yes it is extremely hot else how
about MWC 2015 and particularly HTC the
company has just unwrapped its event to
happen on march first and according to
the company the utopia is in progress we
do know that the company is planning to
make some major changes to its lineup
and hopefully continue with the same
tradition of high quality designs as
well biggest problem is that last year
them WC the only launched desire phone
and they launched their flagship until
later let's hope that's not going to be
the case of this event but we will see
that's how about the LG g4 and I know
we're months away from that and we still
haven't seen the launch of the G flex 2
but their force claim that the g4 will
bring most of the specs of the G flex 2
like the Snapdragon 810 processor but
it'll also follow on certain trends for
example apparently the display will be
smaller instead of 5.5 inches like the
g3 will have a 5.3 inch display that's
still quad HD in addition to other of
the specs that we already have on the G
flex 2 a stay tuned that will most
likely happen mid-year but we could be
wrong let's move the spotlight over to
Samsung we've heard a lot of rumors of
the company working on around SmartWatch
for the longest time but the the company
apparently plans to do it better meaning
that in addition to bringing us the
round design
we've liked in the Moto 360 and the G
watch are the other concept is that
Samson plans to make the whole bezel a
rotating bezel like what you see on
certain watches in the market and
apparently that will bring added
functionality to the watch we only have
pans at the moment we don't really know
exactly how Samsung plants to innovate
here but cool to see that companies are
still wanting to experiment with this
and finally for the very interesting
rumors of the day let's talk galaxy s6
and I'll begin by stating the obvious
that'll bring a 64-bit processor we
still don't know if that'll be the
Snapdragon 810 or if it'll be next to
nose but that's the rumor in addition to
a quad HD display duh that was bound to
happen but reports claim that it'll
bring a better fingerprint scanner
because we hated the one on the galaxy
s5 apparently this time instead of being
a slide-out a feature it'll be a button
that you sort of touch like in the same
way you do with touch ID on Apple's
iPhone devices which is great as those
actually do work but it does lead me to
the question of the day when buying a
smartphone how important is it freedom
that it brings a fingerprint scanner in
my case because of how easy it is to
handle the iphone and yes it has become
important to me but then again I've
learned to live without it in the last
few weeks that I've been testing the
Moto X in blue be 930 so it really
depends on your taste leave us a comment
