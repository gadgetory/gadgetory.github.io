cameras on the Galaxy S ten yeah you
heard that right
believe it or not the iPhone ada
stopping sales this past month even with
strong competition
it looks like we'll see a foldable
Galaxy X before the S 10 launches I'm
high metal Iveta and it's definitely
great to be back for another week I've
been fighting the flu over the weekend
so that was fun this is PocketNow daily
the official nurse today begin with
deals if you want yourself any of
Google's current hardware this is about
that time as the company has just
launched a couple of deals particularly
with the pixel to pixel to excel $100
off on each meeting starting at seven
forty nine and eight forty nine if you
go for the Excel and then if you want to
get yourself a Google home Mini that's
34 bucks and then the Google home is $99
the Google home max is sadly a deal of
two meaning over 650 of you want both
but anyways you can learn more in the
description now for those of you that
have been dealing with battery issues on
iOS 11.4 you are not alone I have
actually been dealing with the same
prawn where users are complaining of two
things number one the battery like this
and really last the whole day but
iPhones have always been notorious for
that I'm saying even worse than that and
up to the point where people are also
complaining that their personal hotspots
been active when they have never
activated it I have not had the personal
hotspot issue but definitely battery
drain has been the worst right now
apparently iowa's 12 fixes that but
that's not gonna happen until the fall
if you were wondering which is the
best-selling smartphone of the last
current months believe it or not because
I don't believe it yet it is the iPhone
8 not the 8 plus actually the iPhone 8
followed by the Galaxy S 9 and then the
iPhone 10 and then the iPhone 8 plus all
the way at the end at number five this
has been for the month of May and it's
rather weird as usually by this time in
the cycle iPhones don't really sell well
because of all the phones that have
launched later but this is just to prove
how bad sales have been for the galaxies
lately it's just so weird
and speaking of galaxies those of you
that have been interested in the galaxy
x foldable smartphone tablet whatever
thingy it seems that it will launch
early next year we've got some trusted
sources claiming
yes and for those of you the thought
that we were getting the galaxy s 10 at
sea as apparently that's not gonna
happen until MWC which is the usual
timeline obviously Samsung needs to
figure out sales for the Galaxy S 10 or
whatever they're gonna bring to the
market so yeah galaxy x CES Samsung
again that's gonna be interesting
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus
or whatever the larger unit is going to
be we've heard rumors that we're getting
three cameras on this unit two cameras
on the one in the middle and then one
camera on the smaller one now we hear
that they're not just three apparently
we're getting three in the back two in
the front because you didn't have enough
camera lenses already so we heard the
rumors that we've got a telephoto and
the wide-angle at the back and
apparently the two cameras at the front
are gonna assist for portrait mode
because that's the thing lately so
competition with photography doesn't
seem to be reaching galaxies in the S 10
probably the most interesting part is
that apparently this phone the five
camera lens smartphone is going to cost
over a thousand bucks
so in today's question let us know I
mean five cameras do you think that this
is enticing for you do you think it's
worth $1,000 cuz in my case I don't
think the iPhone 10 is worth a thousand
dollars probably more cameras will do it
for me we'll see when it launches but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
