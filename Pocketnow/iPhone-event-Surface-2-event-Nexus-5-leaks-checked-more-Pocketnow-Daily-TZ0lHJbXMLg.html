and rumors don't stop coming Microsoft
has just sent out press invitations for
their future surface tablet event and
the LG Nexus 5 theory is on the FCC have
just met a curve I'm hi Mary Vanna and
wouldn't you just wish that more
holidays would happen on a Monday this
is out daily let's are they off
with the official news Microsoft has
just sent out press invitations for
their surface to event to happen on
September 23rd and a lot of rumors are
happening here we still haven't seen
Windows 8.1 but apparently we're not
getting a surface RT or at least not the
name we are getting two tablets one of
them let's arm-based according to rumors
but apparently it will be called RT
anymore so the question is what exactly
are we getting another interesting point
is that apparently we're moving into a
1080p display which is a good upgrade so
stay tuned links in the description for
full details on what to expect in rumors
and others and speaking of official news
those of you that we're waiting for that
free phone from amazon for prime
customers just kind of made a curve as a
spokesperson for the company just spoke
to The Wall Street Journal and confirm
two things number one they're not
building a phone this year which could
mean though building a phone next year
and the second thing is that sadly well
even if they were they're not going to
be launching the phone out for free the
spokesperson was very clear so i guess i
should have not mentioned the fact that
all of us just want the phone to root it
let's see what happens now let's talk
about nokia those of you interested in
the Bandit project aka the Lumia 1520
which is there a phablet smartphone well
we've got some leaked photographs of the
phone and it is quite pretty I mean it
looks like a Lumia 925 in every way just
the bigger chassis and these photos are
real the phone is happening the question
is when obviously we're waiting for
Windows Phone 8.1 to happen most
probably by then now aside from that if
you're interested in the Lumia 1020 this
is the time to buy the phone just
dropped a hundred dollars on AT&amp;amp;T and if
you buy it on the Microsoft Store you
will get a black camera adapter for free
so yeah go to the Microsoft Store and
those of you that were waiting for the
LG Nexus 5 which was apparently already
at the FCC just got shot down as it
turns out well some credible tipsters
have confirmed this is actually just the
CDMA variant of the LG g2 and not real
the LG Nexus 5 we've seen mock-ups we've
seen the phone showing up on the Google
campus the question is when we're
getting the phone and all you have to do
is wait for the iphone to get launched
and then everything will happen trust me
on that and finally for the hot news of
the day yes tomorrow's probably one of
the most expected days in the smartphone
world is apple's event for the next
generation iphone will happen iphone 5s
iphone 5c there will probably be a lot
on the table probably iOS 7 being
announced officially to the public and
so many other things but anyways we will
be covering this event live as you know

editorial roundtable where we talk about

the question of the day can you please

that the iphone 5s would be just not
enough i think that apple should launch
