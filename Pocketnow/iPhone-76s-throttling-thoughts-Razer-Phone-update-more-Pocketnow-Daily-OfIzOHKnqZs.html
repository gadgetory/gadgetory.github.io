made the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s slower
than before the razor phone is
reportedly getting a very significant
software update to fix complaints and
merging iOS and Mac OS applications is
apparently a work in progress at the
moment I'm hi Melanie Vera and I
apologize for the face I've been
traveling since 5:00 a.m. I was gonna
call it a night but I can't leave you
guys without the news this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for the
Moto z2 force and is currently on sale
and Best Buy but the sale really depends
on what carrier you pick like for
example if you go for a TNC I think this
is the one that offers the best deal
where the phone is pretty much $350 less
expensive and you also get the typical
Moto mod projector that nobody ends
abusing you can learn more in the
description depending on your carrier
now let's talk about the razor phone
those of you concerned over issues like
the camera there is a software update
for this phone that's apparently going
to fix a ton of things there are a list
of bug fixes that are included but most
important apparently the camera is going
to get a major overhaul and this will
apparently fix all the complaints that
there are with the camera obviously we
will let you know if that's true or not
now so the spotlight over to Apple and
the iPhone 10 2018 and 2019
according to mini quo there is a roadmap
of battery growth in the iPhone coming
since the next iPhone and then the
following one not necessarily because
Apple is looking to improve the battery
life that you get but because the
company wants to bet very heavily on
both AR and true theft sensing and
apparently these two features require a
ton of battery life so expect these
changes and speaking of Apple it is no
secret that the Mac App Store is not at
all as successful as the iOS App Store
and I think a lot of it has to do with
the price difference in applications
surely the ones in the Mac OS App Store
are more complex but apparently Apple
wants to bridge the gap there's a
project codenamed Marsha Fionn that
apparently will allow applications to
work between themselves alright could
bet more on iOS applications working on
mac OS and not necessarily vice-versa
and that would be awesome for things
like Twitter which the Twitter Mac
terrible but yeah stay tuned let's see
exactly what it brings and finally the
very interesting and to a certain degree
disappointing news that they have to do
with Apple the company has just chimed
then over the news that we reported
yesterday if you remember we discussed
that there are benchmarks that prove
that Apple has been throttling the
processor on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7
Apple has confirmed that it does and the
reasons for this is because according to
Apple the only way for components like
the battery to last as long as the
average consumer uses an iPhone it's the
throttle the processor in order for it
not to tax the battery after a year of
use that makes sense that's fine you
know the problem is when you have the
iPhone 6s still on sale iPhone 7 still
on sale meaning why are these devices
that people have not bought yet that are
still in a store and that people will
probably buy tomorrow or the day after
going to be throttled or how is Apple
going to figure that part out because
according to what we know the company
doesn't so you know it leads me to the
question today do you think that this is
a fair practice for OMS to have these
measures in order to avoid taxing things
like the battery in my case Apple's
argument is that this actually causes
phones to shut down and it's just
preventive so that makes a lot of sense
it's just I don't know how the company
can figure this out for people that are
buying an iPhone 7 now because that
phone is more than capable why should it
be throttled leave us a comment down
