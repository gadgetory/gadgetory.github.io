another calm and this is a software
review of the HTC EVO 3d on Sprint's 4G
WiMAX network so let's get to it
so the HTC EVO 3d is running the latest
version a sense 3.0 along with Android
2.3.3 Gingerbread build so we have some
great features to this new sentence 3.0
one of the best features is the ability
to scroll across the entire circle and
previous builds we had to go all the way
just to the side and then we have to
start over now we can just go back and
view more pages just by panning either
left or right and if we double tap the
home screen we can view all seven home
screens and now I can rearrange them if
I like let's say I wanted to this one in
the middle I have to do is go there and
now it'll be my default home screen just
like that and let's see what else we
have the notification bar at the top
that's really intuitive so here we have
all of our previously launched
applications that we go to quick
settings we can view all of our radios
so we can either turn those on or off
and we can also go to settings and view
our memory so let's go back home let's
go to some of the widgets so we can view
lots of HTC widgets and we can even
download more widgets directly from this
little icon here so we can download more
HTC widgets if we like and we have of
course all the other default Android
widgets that are great to have on any
Android device so we can just go back
home and let's go to some of the live
wallpapers I don't think it comes with
too many live wallpapers but we can see
here let's see what else we have
we have HTC Sense we have a slideshow
weather which I have right now streaked
and just some other default Android live
wallpapers that we've all seen before so
I'll just go back home so let's check
out some of the best applications
available on the evo 3d that comes stock
pre-loaded we have 3d games which
launches a web browser and you can
download 3d games and you can either
bill it to your sprint account or you
can use a credit card if you like and we
have these other applications that we've
all seen before Amazon mp3 and of course
Adobe Reader these are a couple of games
that I downloaded asphalt 3d and
Assassin's Creed 3
and the gameplay is actually pretty
phenomenal unfortunately we won't be
able to see it too well because of
course this is a single lens camera we
have the blockbuster app which allows
you to download and play movies directly
from your Android device and we can go
and get that just apparently a shortcut
to the blockbuster app we have a
calculator and it's probably skinned to
the O it's a little bit different a
little bit different re skinning by HTC
so we can view that calculator more
calendar called history let's see our
camcorder which we're not gonna be able
to look at right now in our camera I'll
show some displays or demonstrations of
how the camcorder and the camera work
where a car panel which looks pretty
similar to how other sense devices in
the past look so actually we have to
exit this out and it works really great
if you're in the vehicle and you just
need to make a quick call or something
we have a clock all these other
applications let's see we've have an FM
radio which is a great thing to have on
any device footprints which allows you
to do a geotag your photos we have Gmail
and Google search there's another game i
download GT racing 3d we have the HTC
hub let's see what else do we have
that's pretty new we have media share
which allows you to share your media
over a Wi-Fi connection so you if you
have a DLNA network setup you can share
your media directly from and to your HTC
EVO 3d we have messages Amir which turns
your front-facing video camera into Amir
so let me see if I can just see my
camera right here and it's a little
Panasonic so just go back we have our
music a NASCAR apparently Sprint really
likes NASCAR course they do sponsor
NASCAR and we have our Google Navigation
our news another game I downloaded Nova
3d we have a peep people places polaris
office I don't have any documents on
this particular device but if you do
have some you can view them directly
from the polaris office application we
have quick video which is a great app if
you're going to share video when I was
in Hawaii a couple months ago actually
showed my mom the beach while I was
right there and she was able to watch
and I was using my iPhone but a quick
video is a great thing to have we have
our quadrant standard which I installed
let's see we have a few other games it
did come with Spider Man 3 D which is
pre-loaded on this
we have our sprint hotspot which allows
you to share up to 10 mobile devices
over Wi-Fi connection by sharing the 4G
and 3G cellular speeds in your evo 3d
whoever sprint mobile or sprint radio
and our Spring TV in these are all paid
for services we also have spring zone
where you can download other things
whatever stocks or talk or task manager
TeleNav GPS which is a full turn-by-turn
navigation Program if you don't like to
use the Google Navigator you can use
this application a full version of the
Green Hornet and 3d we can transfer
things this is a new application I
haven't seen before you can transfer
previous cell phone data let's say you
add another device in the past and you
just want to transfer all your contacts
and everything else from your phone you
can select one of these devices here and
will automatically sync up with the evo
3d we have all these voice services
voice dialer voice recorder and voice
search along with voicemail and that
does allow you to view visitor visual
voicemail over the Sprint network and
it's not set up right now so we'll just
go back we can go to watch and this is
where you're allowed to view and
download movies directly to the evil 3
and was unable to find the many 3d
movies but it did come with the Green
Hornet 3d and if we wanted to we could
watch that right now another great thing
about the apps menu on this particular
devices were able to go down here to our
favorites so if we have many apps that
we like to view all the time it will
automatically launch those these are my
frequent apps and I can just go here to
view my downloaded apps and these are
the apps that I downloaded so now let's
run a couple of speed tests ok so I
should mention that I killed all the
running applications before I ran these
speed tests so let me go to display
index scores and we can view these
scores from smart bench 2011 and it
shows that my scores when I ran this is
2485 on the productivity index and 1685
on the game index so that's pretty fast
let's try to run another one so in
quadrant standard we have 2195 and
that's pretty fast so let's run our last
benchmark using link pack so running the
single thread we got 44 point 1 2 3 m
flops in 1.9 seconds so that's pretty
fast let's run in multi thread with a
multi thread we got 67 point 9 to 9
which is really fast we can view how we
rating upon the top devices so let me
just go down here and I'll show you how
it compares and so it looks as though
overclocked Nexus S is are apparently
getting the fastest Linpack speeds and
let me just go down here it looks as
though it's at 1.8 gigahertz which is
pretty fast so this is the masaf preview
of the HTC EVO 3d on Sprint's 4G WiMAX
network and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
leave some comments down below in case
you missed the unboxing you can check
out a video right about here and I will
also post the hardware review video
right about here and make sure you stay
tuned for the final review coming up
next and we'll also post some video and
photos samples on that so you can check
those out and we'll even post them in 3d
so if you have a 3d capable display or
television you can probably watch them
over the youtube channel so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
