will go all out and features and
probably cost a little more the Oppo
find nine may be something that truly
ends up being hard to find at all and
it's great that the Black Friday deals
continue even a day after I'm Jaime
Ravenna and I don't have any doorbuster
stories but hey if you've got some leave
it in the comments down below this is
PocketNow daily the official duce today
begin with lame deals believe it or not
AT&amp;amp;T is not only late to the Black
Friday deal game but they've also
brought the worst ones I mean I think
the hottest device in the list is the
samsung galaxy s6 6 and what you're
getting here is a two hundred dollar
Visa card if you're compelled over
anything to learn more in the
description now a company that is
definitely not lame when it comes to
deals is Amazon the company has just
announced 7 days with 75,000 products
going on sale over the holidays now
figure this much in addition to those
crazy amount of deals Alexa products
will have 20% off and Fire tablets begin
at $33 when the tablets become so
affordable like seriously those who the
spotlight over two software updates HTC
has it made promises and has to kept
them for the most part the HTC 10 omits
unlock variant is now getting Android
7.0 nougat oh this is right because well
HTC has been one of the companies that
has done the better job and not skinning
the user interface and allowing you to
enjoy the best of both worlds obviously
we can't wait for the jump to be made to
7.1 given the fact that there's another
HTC device already running it aka the
pixel and there was a time when Oppo
made a ton of headlines over its
flagships to find seven to find five at
its time and there had been repeating
rumors over the last two years over the
fine 9 mainly because Oppo has dedicated
itself to focusing only on the premium
mid-range and we haven't really seen any
of the compelling flagships that we saw
so well for those of you that are
waiting for the fine 9 we've got some
sources that claim that it's not going
to happen there were rumors of a
snapdragon 835 power device to be
now sometime in March apparently
according to the rumors that's not gonna
happen we'll see and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy s8 as we've got some
other trusted sources that are claiming
a very interesting change
apparently Samsung wants to go all out
in hardware in a way to make this device
compelling for consumers and pretty much
a no-brainer one of these changes is
apparently 256 gigabytes of storage
apparently this is the first ever
Samsung device that includes so much
storage as a smart phone we're not sure
if that's obviously the base model I
doubt it but it seems that Samsung wants
to play ball up to the point where the
cost of building the galaxy estate will
apparently be more than 20% over what it
currently costs to build a Galaxy s7 and
hey it makes a lot of sense but it also
leads me to the question of the day if
you have to choose in the case of the
Samsung Galaxy s8 would you prefer the
cost to remain where they are and a way
for you to get a phone that is less
expensive in the $500 tier for example
or are you okay with Samson going a
little higher on its costs and selling
you the Galaxy S a to the same price but
with more features in my case I prefer
the same price with more features but
