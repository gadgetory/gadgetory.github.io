and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview okay so what's new with
Bing first off like i said before the
search button is always going to go to
bing now it's no longer
context-sensitive any of the programs so
we're going to go at the vein and you
got the text field is still up here at
the top but we have some new buttons
down here the voice is the same as
before but we now have music and vision
as well as scout we'll look at that
later but let's try the music search so
let me there's my zune HD with a speaker
and i'll play some music and then i will
press this
maryo found the album and now i'm going
to press marketplace and here we are i
can download the whole thing i press it
there we go so really easy
nega i'm downloading that whole album so
this is kind of like a Shazam except
it's right here one buttons well two
presses one button away no matter where
you are so if you're in the grocery
store you hear song it only works on
recorded music not live tunes or humming
so don't try like that the voice search
still works the same as usual but we
have some new features so let's try this
images of Angelina Jolie
that's right being on Windows Phone
finally has image search this is
something you've had on all other mobile
platforms in the beam app for a while
but now it's here unfortunately you
can't swipe to go to the next or
previous ones there's a link to where
this picture is from so that's really
cool about that web locals still there
there's no video search so let me try
one more thing let's do voice again
movies
so here's movies and this happened
before but now I have a much more
extensive listing let me choose one with
some ratings so now we're getting much
more information we have show times and
yet buy ticket buttons those don't work
on this one because it's a preview and
supposedly there should be an apps menu
pivot here that links us the IMDb or
other movie related applications but
it's not working on this one next let's
try the Bing Bing vision search let me
zoom out a little and I'm going to put
something down here how about this is a
CD cover
and there you go so that's linking me
right to the description of the CD this
artist and strongly prices so i can go
and buy this right away now let's try
some other things how about DVD the
sping vision works on barcodes microsoft
tags DVD covers books CDs QR codes as
well so there you go I can click the
thing and go to reviews about that movie
so let's try a barcode it seems to be
bugging this implementation that doesn't
auto focus unless you do it so there's
some manga I'll do the barcode
if you're hungry for more mango we can
just go off to the website right now
kind of expensive though and now let's
do one more feature and this is a really
cool one I wish I scan go back to the
DVD notice this button down here scan
text so you see little squares around
the text and look at this button
translate what language should I choose
didn't do that well but there's some
superimposed translation let's try a
different language
and what is this copy all so that's
going to
copy what it was able to recognize and
now i can paste it into a new note or
whatever oh by the way selected search
doesn't work in OneNote but it still
works in other programs like Internet
Explorer
so if I select something and then press
the green button it will search for that
back in the vision
there we go I search for a movie and now
it's recommending this movie zap IMDb so
I can go and download that right away
okay next the local Scout so this is
going to figure out where I am and then
show me things that are nearby that it
recommends so right now we got the eat
and drink pain and it shows prices
locations little ratings so we can go to
the card and get some reviews about each
restaurant there's things to see and do
you got movie theaters listed all sorts
of fun stuff to explore you see the map
changes up here one thing that I don't
like you click on a movie theater but
there's it doesn't show show times that
shopping areas again they have reviews
hours there's directions phone number
quick X to the website and here's some
highlights as well as favorites are down
here
so that's some cool new Bing features
some of them work well some of them are
still works in progress it would seem
but some pretty impressive attempts
they're adding new features we'll talk
more about maps later and be sure to
check out pocket now calm for our full
preview of Windows Phone mango that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
