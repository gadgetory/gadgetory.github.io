what Samsung needs to make an all
display galaxy s 8 Andromeda is starting
to shape up to be something else as
google confirms that there is no burning
happen and it seems that IOT was the
theme of the day with Google and
Microsoft I'm hi Mary Vanna and bear
with me as I figure out lighting here in
this place but for now this is parking
out daily the official news today have
to do with a ton of announcements
starting with the fact that we finally
get apples earpods if you haven't lost a
pair of headphones lately this is just
about the greatest time to do so for 159
bucks these are not products were really
recommending and believe it or not even
though we thought that they were going
to sell well they've pretty much sold
out already it takes four weeks for
Apple to ship them to you but you can
also look for them at the store other
very interesting announcements have to
do with Microsoft but we love the fact
that Microsoft just makes these
announcements today and then you can
pretty much not get things until the
summer like in the case of the way
Cortana is going to connect with IOT
Microsoft is avenging something very
different to what we have right now
right now you need your smartphone or a
tablet as a hub but Microsoft wants to
do is for your light switch or your
fridge or your thermostat to be able to
receive Cortana voice commands even
though this is rather cool we hear that
Hardware won't be ready until end of
2017 so let's see what we get and
speaking of the Internet of Things and
announcements android has just announced
android things and the way this is going
to work is a as well interesting because
this is what we heard about project
brillo and weave this is the outcome of
that to a certain degree even though we
believe that these products i get a case
of brillo will remain separate even
though you're still using wave as the
connecting platform the cool thing is
that current android solutions can help
you build services and build ways to
connect with a smart switch for example
so this is something that could start
working now the tools are out there now
it's only a matter of time let's just
see how soon that is and speaking of
google announcements we receive one
today that's rather polarizing we've
heard forever that Andromeda is the
merger between Chrome OS and Android but
according to Android's SVP apparently
that's not going to happen and see if
the Chrome OS has been popular
on its own up to the point where it
outsold the mac last quarter and that
makes a lot of sense given the fact that
all you need is around three Chromebooks
to make up for the price of the cheapest
max oh yeah why is it not going to sell
more but it doesn't mean that Chrome OS
should probably not go for something
more robust as Android I could be wrong
let's see what we end up getting in the
end as a drama de could pretty much be
something else indeed and finally the
very interesting new sedaye have to do
with an announcement by synaptics the
company has just announced its new
fingerprint scanner that is able to live
below a smartphone display and we've
heard that we're getting an all
displayed this longing for the galaxy SI
we've also heard it for the iphone 8 so
hey it's just in time for the
announcement of the galaxy s 8 maybe
that will be the first smartphone and
this could be even cooler than we
thought because obviously there is one
less moving part on the display which is
not exactly sure of you will be able to
unlock your phone from any portion of
the display or just a certain portion of
it but hey it leads me to the question
of the day do you think that this is a
good idea or do you believe that the
fingerprint scanner should just fall
somewhere else right now we've got the
fingerprint scanner on the back of most
smartphones so it would make a lot of
sense to me but we would love to know
what your favorite placement is in the
comments down below friends you know the
way it goes if we want to get the news
