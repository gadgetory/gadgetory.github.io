bestseller but it's given the company
more market share Foxconn looks to begin
its expansion to US soil starting soon
and over the next few weeks prepare for
the galaxy note 7 to not work at all I'm
high metal iveta and yes the winners for
the candidate giveaway are in the link
in the description and also look out for
the tweet on the parking I'll handle
make sure you tweet your addresses for
us to arrange with candid for them to
send the devices to you this is parking
out daily the official news today have
to do with the samsung galaxy note 7 set
your calendars for december 15 as of
that day the phone will charge no more
in the united states this is a software
update that's reaching your devices yes
I know it's hard I know the phones
pretty I know it took me forever to
return it and switch it but go do that
as you'll pretty much end up with a dud
after that date now some very
interesting leaks have begun to the
Paris for what a sous is going to
announce at CES seems that we're getting
the zenfone zoom 3 and this is
interesting it doesn't look like a
camera anymore apparently we're getting
dual cameras on the zenfone zoom so it
seems we're getting a telephoto lens
here or something we will let you know
the spotlight over to Apple a very
interesting change has happened in the
way the company is doing repairs in the
past most of the repairs would have to
go through Apple's authorized apple
store genius bar etc but as of today
you'll notice that if you want repairs
in specific areas you can actually find
authorized repair areas like best buy
for example where they can just repair
your products the only thing is that
we're not exactly sure if you're getting
the same treatment as in the Apple
Genius Bar where if your iPhone has a
problem we'll just swap your phone and
give you another one we'll see and
speaking of Apple let's talk about the
future of iphone manufacturing as
Foxconn has announced that it is
officially looking to build iPhones in
the United States and this is great news
it was a rumor recently but yeah we hear
that the company is willing to invest
and then we have a lot of political talk
we're not going to get into over the
incentives and how
Cook has been talking to the president
elected cetera et cetera what we do know
is that this is great news we just don't
know exactly when but a lot of jobs will
be created that is great news for the
United States and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with market share in the US right now
we've got to analytics that show us that
actually the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus have
allowed Apple to grow in market share a
whopping six points and in the case of
Android it's actually dropped seven
points and it could be attributed to the
whole galaxy note 7 debacle and the fact
that that phone did not sell but clearly
apple continues to grow year over year
for the past two years and even though
Android is still a top with fifty-seven
percent compared to 42 it's only a
matter of time and things continue this
way but it leads me to the question of
the day right now at this moment what is
your daily driver smartphone and why in
my case you know obviously I'm always
carrying a review device but my daily
driver has pretty much become the iphone
7 plus I'm not saying it's the best
phablet it's just the one that I'm
enjoyed using the most this year leave
