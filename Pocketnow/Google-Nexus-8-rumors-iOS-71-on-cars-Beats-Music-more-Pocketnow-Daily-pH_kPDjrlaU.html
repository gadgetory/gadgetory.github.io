iOS on cars would look like Ford's have
been a sous made google nexus 8 surface
again and yeah even beats by dre now has
its own streaming music service I'm high
memory that I at this pace with
everybody getting their own music
service wait for pocketnow music coming
very soon this is pocket out daily let's
which is a off live actually the only
piece of official news today as beats
you know the brand beats by dre has now
launched its own music streaming service
and it's very similar to Spotify in the
fact that you pay ten dollars and you
get 20 million tracks Spotify offers you
more but difference here is you get less
time for travel Lee seven days unless
you're an AT&amp;amp;T customer where you get
additional benefits and well even though
this is probably not the best music
streaming service on a planet it's
currently only available for iOS they do
mention an Android and Google
application variant but when you hit all
the links they're dead so stay tuned for
that is hopefully they'll figure that
one out now let's go through some
additional Sony rumors as this time we
get the first league photographs of the
Sony Xperia z2 being compared to the z1
and you'll notice that well the z2 is a
little bit taller and it's a little bit
slimmer than the c1 even though they do
share the same specifications again
we're just expecting this to be a
carrier variant for somewhere we just
don't know where and aside from that for
those of you which would probably be
around two or three that want that Sony
Xperia Z ultra well the wifi-only
phablet variant is leaked to be part of
their store soon so if you do want to
buy it which I don't know why won't stay
tuned now let's talk about Apple as we
do know that iOS 7.1 beta 4 was now
seeded to developers and interesting one
of these developers just took it upon
himself to take some screenshots of the
new car rui that's expected to come from
Apple the new automobile you I we do
know that 7.1 beta is focusing on this
is one of the new services that they
want to launch with 7.1 and we do get
some leaked screenshots they're kind of
interesting minimalistic but some of us
are kind of skeptical some of us assume
that this could just probably be a
developer's application that's being
leaked that way for news but stay tuned
we'll see now let's talk about Sam
saying is probably one of the biggest
inconsistencies in the industry right
now which wishes the date for the galaxy
s5 to the announcer launched and as it
turns out although artisan just came
Twitter and said that the phone will be
announced at mwc he did confirm it
februari 23rd at mwc but we won't be
seeing the phone on stores until april
so that does make sense with all the
debating rumors that have been out there
we are getting the new magazine you are
we are getting pretty much the same
specifications that we've talked about
and we are getting the same price tag so
yeah this could be a great event for
them WC so stay tuned for that and
finally for the hot news of the day we
get additional leaks of a google nexus 8
made by a sous but wait right there we
have the nexus 7 and then we have that
LG G pad 8.3 google edition so you
wonder where is that nexus 8 gonna fit
and well as it turns out this tablet is
apparently going to be launched in July
or mid-2014 is what they say actually so
this could actually mean that the
successor to the nexus 7 will be the
nexus 8 a larger tablet but anyways that
leaves you to the question of the day
when you actually want a bigger nexus 7
meaning a nexus 8 when you want the
nexus 7 to die for something bigger
because in my particular case i would
have they figured out how to keep it in
the same size meaning make the bezel
smaller because i do like the fact that
the nexus 7 this fit in the back pocket
of my jeans but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is filmer
