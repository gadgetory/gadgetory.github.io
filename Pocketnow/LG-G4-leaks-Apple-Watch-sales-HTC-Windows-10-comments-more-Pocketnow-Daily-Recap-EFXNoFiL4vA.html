normally but then say their names really
Spanish and that sucked me calling you
could I instead of Craig just because
I'm Hispanic I'm in dire hair they look
like snowflakes on your head and what's
wrong with my natural highlights man i
love your Monday jokes your Monday jokes
are how I get through mondays please do
not stop making them and your wish is my
command that's right it's that time of
the week I am high metairie that this is
pocket down in this is the parking out
daily recap for last week Sunday asked
you what do you think about the LG g4
leaks as a microsite it's pretty much
spilled the beans on everything we were
getting back then analogy has pretty
much told us everything we're getting we
have 496 comments out of which when says
LG g4 looks like a camel toe and and you
guys need to behave and Prince Armstrong
says the g4 needs two things good
battery life an amazing camera and well
the g2 and g3 did a very decent job in
those two departments we are expecting
more with that f 1.8 aperture and will
says I'm very happy with my g3 so I
don't personally see much reason based
on those details to 10 g4 but that could
change with hands-on time and I agree
with that I don't like the g3 because of
its display i actually prefer the g2 so
yeah i'm looking forward to the g4 trust
me that on tuesday i ask you if you
would prefer a windows phone from HTC or
an HTC One m9 for windows as a the
rumors are that HTC and Microsoft are
working closely on a device for some
time later this year we have 330
comments out of which larry harris says
after the HTC nexus 9 blender I'll pass
why I actually like the Nexus not
another commoner says if HTC provides a
windows phone with great specs display
and a good camera then we can forgive
them for the one m9 agreed on that one
the jetta Khan says I want a new phone
with Windows 10 I wonder why Microsoft
bought nokia just to destroy our
favorite brand and I agree with you
we're still waiting for a flagship we
are expecting for something great but
Microsoft that's just so slow hopefully
HTC can do something about wednesday
asked you if you think that Google
manipulates search results
as the European Union has this antitrust
allegation with retailers claiming that
Google is providing favoritism for those
companies that pay for ads we have 355
comments out of which GJ says yes
they're manipulating it they are so
greedy now I am a happy Windows Phone
and Bing user good luck with Bing I
would rather put up with manipulating
results on Google and Bing and cosmos it
says no I haven't noticed that my search
results are mostly jumbled sometimes I
can see Amazon at the top sometimes some
other like Flipkart in India and it
depends on each usage can scenario and
I've noticed that it varies
significantly / country / your user
login / your user you know credentials
in the way you handle yourself on Google
search so it's really hard to say yes
they do it but hey the European Union is
not dumb and Brie Costa says it's not as
noticeable on searches because popular
websites or results often coincide with
ad placement searches but you can see it
at many Google services and Android
related stuff it's almost impossible for
a regular user to prove it but I'm
almost sure it's there and yeah you have
the ads at the top I sometimes see these
and yeah those are the results that I
wonder that's pretty much the purpose of
paying for ads and I guess at some point
Google does need to make money they need
to survive somehow and this is their
business model but then again yeah as
long as that does not become annoying
for as long as they don't manipulate you
into paying more just because these
companies pay for ads that's really what
I think should be handled on Thursday we
had analysts predicting that Apple had
sold 3.2 million Apple watch units and
the question was if you believe in those
predictions we have 821 comments out of
which did he says 10,000 for some people
is like 160 dollars for you and me Jaime
LOL you got that right and the point of
that was because I was like my god ten
thousand dollars for watch is just crazy
but I guess people paid for it then
another commoner says I do believe that
apple sold that many apple watches wine
because Apple is Apple enough said not
necessarily because Apple is Apple a
brand could be a brand Sonia Sony and
they don't sell as many smart watches as
Apple does I believe this is the power
of marketing and they're showing it off
but ASD 5515
the Apple watch sales are a perfect
proof of the theory that the icy breed
is very common and you'll notice that I
don't like using comments that mention I
sheep or whatever fanboys or whatever
because that's really not a positive way
to call anybody but you know in your
case yeah we do know that the early
shoppers of the Apple watch have to be
apple fanatics there are people out
there there apple fanatics hcc fanatics
sony fanatics samsung fanatics you name
it the question is how many of the other
regular people bought in because I don't
think there are three point two million
apple fanatics I could be wrong and
finally on Friday I ask you what do you
want from one plus as the company had an
event to happen very soon we have 3 57
comments out of which one of them says I
would like to see a 1 + 2 and I guess
the whole world wants to see it and dark
black 22 says obviously the one plus two
but i will at least be best that they
launched two phones one high end and one
budget friendly and is it just me or was
the 1+1 a budget-friendly flagship it
would be cool if they launched two
phones but it would be great if they
kept them on the same pricing scheme the
mini onyx says a one plus two without an
invitation system and yes you are right
probably the biggest problem of the 1+1
is that my god it was just so difficult
to get one and yeah that actually drives
people crazy over wanting to have
something to drive the desire so there
is a point behind this whole marketing
scheme i don't believe that they just
ran out of supplies I don't think that's
the case i think that the invitation
system was on purpose and it didn't
hinder their sales fine we know what one
plus is now could you please just read
telephone the way you're supposed to
like everybody else does thats it for
our pocket now daily recap thank you
