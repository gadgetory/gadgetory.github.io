pocketnow.com and today we're doing the
unboxing of the new droid 3 from verizon
and motorola so sit back relax and enjoy
the show the droid 3 is a continuation
of the droid series obviously from
verizon and this one actually contains a
dual-core one here its processor and is
cdma and gsm wcdma as well capable so
this is a world device which is really
great to have for those of you who are
traveling or environments that you don't
need to switch back and forth between
the world environment and others let's
go ahead and open up the box here and
see we got so inside is the phone come
back to that in just a second also in
here is the USB cable power adapter and
then just user manuals and guides so one
more moment mold look at the phone
peeling off the stickers here take a
closer look the device there's another
one right in here so it's really sticky
and will make your phone feel like it
doesn't work at all forget to take it
off so capacitive buttons down at the
bottom it still has that Motorola lip
down here it's kind of in a chrome look
it has the verizon tag on it at the top
we've got the typical camera sensor here
and the sea is take a closer look it's
hard to see if there's any other sensor
zero in this particular unit there's a
sensor right there for the light sensor
your piece location and then around
moving around here to the the top is the
headphone jack and the power button on
the back is the 8 megapixel camera with
the flash a little sticker here the back
is textured kind of a soft black plastic
texture speakerphone microphone hole on
the back
on this side is the volume buttons
volume rocker up and down and then over
here on this side are a USB and HDMI out
no cable included for that but there is
a cable included for the USB it's been
pop this battery door off it's very hard
to get off the top initially so
underneath here we can find the sim card
because it is a global phone there is no
microSD card included at least in the
art kit then the materials that were
included says that it can be expanded up
to an additional 32 gigs it does have 16
gigs of onboard memory that said you
let's take a look at this battery it is
a 1500 milliamp hour battery nice and
slim sim card go to phone
and tabs lock into place here and then
it snaps back down keyboard it's that is
really stiff mechanism there's no slide
out here and I can't it's almost like
there's something else stuck still in
there keeping me from being able to
slide it out efficiently it just doesn't
it mean it feels nice and solid but I'm
having to use a lot of pressure to get
that to slide open mashing a lot of keys
in the process we've got a full five row
keyboard numbers at the top here and
then an alt and okay and arrow keys over
here on this side the buttons themselves
I don't we can hear that swishing noise
they make when you press them their
place really close together the number
buttons have a slightly higher lift it
feel most feels like although it just
may be where my fingers are placed then
the others black and gray as far as the
uniformity well we'll do a little more
testing of this keyboard and come back
to you with more information how that
really feels or how it works this
couldn't power this baby up
so the device is running Gingerbread
it's got 512 megs of ram with 16 gigs of
onboard memory as you mentioned 8
megapixel camera on the vga at the
beginning the further another front
facing camera it can do 1080p video
which is fantastic dimensions wise well
that's booting up compared against the
epic 4g there's the epic 4g is just
slightly slightly wider the droid is
slightly longer let's go ahead and
unlock this pretty snappy I'm not
getting any strange lag as I'm going
back and forth between areas let's seems
pretty quick let's sort of pop the
keyboard out an auto rotation and got
the motorola interface here the double
tap for the view I can actually like
that and what's this no Bing at least
not from the first impression I don't
see any big logos on here I don't see
any bing anything makes me happy in my
heart apps will come back to later it
does include Google Maps thankfully
Bray's fries and didn't leave it off
this time
looks pretty good so we'll come back to
the hardware and software reviews later
if you have any questions or comments
would like us to look at a specific
thing I'll leave a message below in the
comment section and we'll get back to
you as soon as possible this ends our
unboxing of the motorola droid 3 from
verizon thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
