addictive games for your mobile device
that's what we sought to find out I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are the top five games for Android
and iOS that you won't be able to put
down frustrating mobile games have been
around for years but the wild success of
flappy bird made us see a lot of our
favorite games in a different light now
that flappy bird is no longer available
for download we figured we'd give you a
nice spread of equally frustrating yet
incredibly addictive mobile games and of
course no particular order a recent
addition to the App Store and even more
recently added to Google Play is threes
it's a puzzle game that will test your
patience and your ability to walk away
the premise is simple you have a four by
four grid of squares filled with cards
with numbers on them you add like
numbered cards together by swiping them
together against what the game calls a
wall to get the sum of their value for
instance if you add 1/3 to another three
you get a six card the only exception to
the rule is with cards numbered 1 or 2
you can only add ones and twos together
to get 3 you cannot add two ones or two
twos together
continue to add cards together to
achieve the highest numbered cards
possible and likewise score the game
ends when you can no longer add any
cards together due to a gridlock this
game is quite literally so addictive
it's dangerous it's incredibly easy to
say just one more time before you know
it it's nearly 5:00 a.m. and you have to
wake up in two hours to work true story
backflip madness is a recent addiction
of mine available only on iOS it's a
parkour or free acrobatics game your
character is positioned in various
locations within a single map and you
must perform back flips and different
moves and land within a cold area well
that sounds pretty simple it requires
great timing and a lot of patience you
use an action button in the lower right
corner to control the character hit the
button too soon or too late and you'll
fall flat on your face you have a set
number of failed attempts before you
fill the level however you can miss the
cold area as many times as you please so
long as you stick the landing to
practice your flips and different moves
you can access a free play mode backflip
madness is $0.99 and will provide hours
of frustratingly good fun
roid rages across between asteroids and
flappybird how is that possible you ask
you control a ship caught in the middle
of a deep space asteroid field you begin
as an unpaid intern with a basic
spaceship you have one mission collect
all the spilled juice worst job ever
sounds simple right think again your
spaceship speed is turning to 11 and the
controls are very touchy
not to mention tons of asteroids they're
everywhere and just when you think
you've gotten the hang of it boom your
spaceship explodes into a million pieces
at certain milestones you can unlock
different ships and pilots road rage is
free to play but ad-supported if you
purchase just one unlock the ads will be
removed forever this is another one of
those one more time games
smash it is extremely simple to play and
understand but the longer you play the
more challenging it becomes you're
moving through abstract environments
obstructed by fragile crystals lob
spears into those crystals and watch
them shatter before your eyes learn more
spheres by destroying designated prisms
and earned power-ups by hitting them
with the spheres as well if you fail to
destroy a crystal and run into it you
lose 10 spheres go as far as you can
before you run out of spheres smash it
is free to play but if you want
additional features such as picking up
from various checkpoints you must buy
the in-app purchase finally super
hexagon available for Android and iOS
for $2.99 the premise and controls could
not be more simple and the game could
not be more difficult essentially you're
guiding a pointer through a series of
walls which are moving towards the
center at an increasingly difficult pace
touch the left after the display to
steer left and touch the right have to
move right dodge the walls as long as
possible
throw in some headphones and the trance
music paired with the hypnotic spinning
graphics and you can easily get lost in
the game
all of these games are so great because
the controls and instructions are
unbelievably simple yet the gameplay is
wildly difficult and they have nearly
infinite replayability this is what
makes them so frustrating while also
extremely addictive
