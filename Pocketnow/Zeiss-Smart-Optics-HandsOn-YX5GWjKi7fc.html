smart glasses has been Google's Google
glass which is not the most attractive
look but what if people didn't know you
were wearing smart glasses more
importantly what if you couldn't tell
you were either
I'm Adam Dowd reporting from CES 2016
and this is our first look at Carl Zeiss
smart glasses
brought to you by D brand the first
thing you'll notice when viewing these
smart glasses is nothing there's very
little indication that the person you
are talking to is wearing smart glasses
at all these look like normal glasses
with a bit of a thicker frame to the
casual observer if you look closely a
faint rectangle is the only evidence
that these glasses are more than meets
the eye from behind the glasses the
wearer can access full-color augmented
reality or app projections in their line
of sight but if the wearer focuses away
from the display it disappears this
technology can be adapted to display
phone screens notifications or anything
else according to manufacturer
specifications these glasses work by
transmitting an image from the prism
through a magnifying glass like area
which directs the light to the display
surface which is called the fernell
structure this area is the part that
displays the image the real trick here
is that this technology has been
developed as a curved lens the only
curved lens smart glasses in the world
this is important because this
technology can be adapted into
prescription lenses imagine the next
time you visit your optician you can
choose from glass plastic or smart
lenses which would you choose I'm pretty
sure I'd know my choice all this is the
vision of the smart optics project which
has been established as a startup by the
Zeiss group but with full access to all
of Zeiss resources and competencies our
viewers might recognize Carl Zeiss as
the maker of the Carl Zeiss optics of
recent Lumia phones the smart optics
group has developed prototype units and
has perfected the manufacturing process
they are ready to scale up to mass
production in one
they find the right partner they are
ready to bring this to the masses once
that happens perhaps we'll be able to
order some spiffy smart spectacles with
that expiring flex account pocket now
