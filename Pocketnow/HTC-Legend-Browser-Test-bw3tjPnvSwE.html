pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about the software and web
browser on the HTC legend we're also
going to do a speed test against the HTC
hd2 and the iphone 3gs so let's get
started let's go through some of these
programs that are included on the device
zoom into the screen we already talked
about a lot of these things and really
the stuff that we haven't talked about
will cover in full in the review but I
just want to give you a preview of what
we're dealing with here so there's an FM
radio application which is quite nice
you plug in headphones you get FM radio
let's take a look at the YouTube
application so a lot of people are very
interested in that and here it is and
let's see we can search by really
anything up here we can go to most
viewed most discussed let's just click
on say the one at the top or yeah let's
go the one the top and Grover Wi-Fi
right now so let's see how it looks by
the way everything on the AMOLED screen
looks so good very clear very very good
audio smooth video posters very well on
the in the YouTube application which is
quite nice to see and let's go back and
of course it flips over into the
landscape orientation when you change
the devices orientation which is nice
let's go back and let's launch the web
browser it's a typical Android Browser
it does support flash which is a nice
and let's go to say engadget com and a
note on the keyboard which by the way
can go into landscape to get a nicer
angle the keyboard is quite nice it has
vibration feedback the trouble with the
keyboard is that it's kind of small on
the screen and that's just because the
screen itself is only 3.2 inches so you
really don't get that much screen real
estate to work with when the desire
comes out it will have a much larger
screen it will have the same experience
with the sense interface that the legend
does but like I said in a bigger package
with a larger screen higher resolution
screen so here it comes in
is loading right now and we'll give it a
second to load let's go into landscape
for a better view
it's not the fastest web browser it
seems to always have some trouble
towards the end here so we can scroll
down it does have multitouch which is a
nice very responsive multi-touch you can
also double tap to zoom into a column
and if you wait a second eventually it
will resize it to fit nicely but
sometimes it just gets stuck the the
legend could absolutely benefit from a
faster processor perhaps more RAM or you
should just get the desire which has
more ram and a faster processor so
scrolling is very smooth we don't really
get the checkerboard pattern even if we
go very fast let's zoom in on a headline
and tap on it to open it so whoops so
you can kind of jumps around this is
another indication that it's not
performing really as it should be so I'm
trying to get to a permalink okay there
we go let's see how long that takes all
right here it comes and again it kind of
gets stuck at the end at times and we
can double tap to zoom in and there it
reflow the column looks pretty good very
capable web browser we can also jump to
other windows we can go to the windows
button here and we can add a new window
for some tabbed browsing so here HTC com
/ us is loading and it's actually going
to load some flash content there it goes
flash on a phone what an idea it's not
super smooth it's a little bit choppy
but it's better than nothing let's go
back to menya we go to Windows we can
quickly flip over to the previous page
and you can keep opening windows until
you run out of memory which I have not
yet done although it gets very slow okay
so let's go back into a portrait here
I'm going to close the other window
we're going to do a speedtest between
the hd2 and the iphone 3gs i'm going to
zoom out at the hd2 here the iphone 3gs
here let's open turn these on so they
will connect to my Wi-Fi network already
done on both and let me stop it here and
I'm gonna go to pocketnow.com on all of
these devices and let's see which will
load the fastest I have to type the
entire address on the legend here
alright so let's see if I can do this at
and
one time okay there we go so this is
going to be challenged we'd have to
position my fingers and so I'm going to
go here here and here one two three the
hd2 was a little bit behind so even
though the hd2 is a little behind you
can still tell that it's taking a little
while to load for some reason and there
it comes and the iphone 3gs actually was
the slowest that's kind of strange so
let's look at the browsing experience
compared to these okay here we can very
well see the difference in screen
contrast the AMOLED screen has a much
wider white darker blacks the iphone 3gs
is kind of washed out and a little bit
gray looking and the hd2 with the large
screen looks quite nice but not as nice
as the AMOLED screen on the on the
legend so let's go into a permalink so
I'm going to find a store here double
tap to zoom in tap once to zoom in all
of these have different controls and
I'll double tap over here and let's get
ready to tap on all of these headlines
together okay pretty good there and
let's see which loads the fastest
okay the hd2 finished and the legend was
next and the 3gs was last surprisingly
let's see how they fare when we turn
them over in into landscape mode so
first we'll test these two devices
together let's flip it ok so the hd2 is
faster hd2 is faster and the legend next
to the 3gs let's do a flip hear about
already went over ok and flip ok so the
the legend has a little bit of a problem
in going into portrait as we can see it
was beat by both the iphone 3gs and by
the hd2 but overall the web browsing on
the legend is pleasant not as good as
some other devices I think that's in
part because of the lack of high-powered
processor and also the slight deficiency
of RAM that we're not going to get on
the desire which comes out next and
really builds on what the legend has
brought to the table so we've got a lot
more coming up in terms of battery life
talking about performance and also call
quality in the full review coming up on
