we've seen in the Google pixel 3 are
actually real
looks like Apple watch is actually the
next product to lose physical buttons
apparently and for those of you that are
looking for that selfie portrait on the
oneplus 6 you are in luck I'm Jaime
Mehta Rivera there is construction
outside part of the noise it could be
that they're mad because it's Monday
this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
as well if you want to get yourself a
huawei mate n pro this is the time as
pretty much every retailer right now has
it for 550 bucks meaning B&amp;amp;H photo
meaning amazon meaning pretty much every
company that's currently selling it has
it at that discounted price I don't know
if it means that we're getting a new
mate in Peru soon mate 20 or whatever
but we'll keep you posted
because yes there are rumors that right
now Huawei made a significant order to
Samsung for OLED displays for a flagship
and we're talking about a six point nine
inch display which I guess would be the
largest one in the market if they pull
it off hopefully they get rid of more
bezels as they've been doing over the
last couple of you know launches
particularly with the made 10 probe not
necessarily with the p20 Pro but yes
they tuned it could be that this is
what's coming now let's talk about the 1
plus 6s for those of you that already
own one you will notice that there is a
software update and yes please to apply
it there are significant improvements to
network to the user interface
apparently there's also a way to
schedule the fact that you want to have
that do not disturb activate itself at
certain times of the day most important
that portrait selfie is coming so yeah
downloaded sadly we filmed the
comparison over the weekend that was
prior to this update so it won't be part
of it but yeah now let's move the
spotlight over to the Apple watch if you
are in the market for series 4 we might
not necessarily get design changes but
we do hear that the way the watch works
might change
apparently the buttons will now be
capacitive and not as we currently see
that's actually good it helps for things
like water resistance but let's hope
they do a better job than what we
currently have with the HTC you 12 Plus
which I've got those buttons are
terrible yeah we do remember the times
when you know the touch ID button
changed into a capacitive button so
probably that will be the case we'll see
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with the Google pixel 3
as we've got some sources claiming that
they've been digging within blogs of
Google and they
found that the prototypes that we've
seen they're actually true there are
some weird logos here but if they come
from a Google Blog then obviously at
least these designs were considered we
see that all glass back that's sanded up
into a certain degree to provide more of
that pixel to excel design and yes the
notch at the front so in today's
question let us know if this were the
final prototype would you be ok with it
would you be fine with this being the
next pixel in my case I know that a lot
of people complain about the notch but I
think that it's just going to be the
reality of this year right now so I like
the designs that sanded glass at the
back for me would be awesome but leave
us a comment down below love to know
