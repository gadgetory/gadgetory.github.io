calm and we have just received the
eighteen t LG thrill 4g so we're going
to unbox it let's check it out first off
let's look at the box a little we got
the orange 18t colors got some text over
here about 4G speeds hspa+ LG thrill 4g
at battery eight gig micro SD card is in
there and tells us what else is in there
you got your proof of purchase dual core
processor glasses-free 3d display dual
five megapixel camera and Android phone
back alright let's open this up see what
we got yeah may look familiar we've
already reviewed the LG optimus 3d which
is very similar to this we have a quick
start guide there you go full color text
about downloading apps navigation that's
pretty nice there and here's the device
with a sim card attached start like that
put that aside don't lose it though
here's the device very like maybe it
doesn't have battery in there there's
two cameras flash in the middle so we'll
check that out some lower papers we had
some 3d games and 3d movies youtube 3d
alright and a Wi-Fi thing alright what
else we got
is your charger and it looks like the
usual just be plug AC adapter here's our
battery that's why it's so light I'm
going to need this how big is it does it
say I can't read that small
1540 there we go so keep that there and
we have eight requires this that looks
like micro USB no this is the hdmi
adapter so this is good as your HDMI so
we can plug into an HDTV that's
excellent and this is the micro USB
cable and that is it there's no
headphones our cases or anything like
that just the essentials although it's
nice to have that good hdmi cable so
let's just take a look the device a
little bit in size compared since here's
the infuse 4g pretty close in size than
that just in terms of dimensions a
little bit thicker though the thrill
there and what is this the galaxy s 4g
on t-mobile okay and I guess we'll do
the hd7 s on 18t it's your size of that
this guy is definitely a little thick
little thicker than the other guys in a
way that's our unboxing we will take a
closer look at this in our Hardware tour
coming up as well as a software tour and
a full review that's it for now
