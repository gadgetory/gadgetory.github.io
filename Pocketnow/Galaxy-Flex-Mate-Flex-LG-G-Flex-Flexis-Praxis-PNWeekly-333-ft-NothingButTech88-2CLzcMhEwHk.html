Casey nice that you know when we when I
saw you at the 1 plus 60 event I was you
saw me I was like should I say hi to
Casey should I said
Casey and you're over there like it was

so after all of the crazy eating I I
know my body yeah a little bit I'm on a
diet so no all right cool oh yeah and
that was the maple X Pro a little bit of
a note from Jules I want to make sure to
give him a shot oh he is in the booth
today so you might be hearing from him
as he chimes in in our chat alright so
we are going to jump into our stories
for today we have quite a bit of them
but we are gonna go through some Black
Friday stuff as well but let's start off
with a phone that is coming up and
apparently the Samsung Galaxy S 10 line
up it's not just gonna be one phone or
two phones I might even be up to three
phones are slated to be announced or at
least presented at CES 2019 which I mean
after all of the stuff we've been
through over the last couple of months
to say that we're looking forward to CES
2019 might be a little bit of a stretch
it's been a crazy few months and it's
only getting worse
talking about a stretch have you any
idea how many weeks you're left know
exactly the overwhelm that we're not
even there yeah okay so with them being
presented at CES 2019 they might even be
available for purchase as early as
February so this isn't even going to be
an MWC type device anymore like they
used to be well the thing is there are
separate rumors one of them is like yes
we're gonna see them at CES but then the
other is like we're gonna see an
other unit an extra unit like let's call
that the Galaxy S 10 ultra yeah I heard
about that yeah
so that's apparently the one that's
slated for MWC which is the one with 5g
and what else was it it had six cameras
that is our that is our new frontier
apparently with Samsung I mean all these
new phones exactly
well okay Jack did you watch the
developer conference Samsung's at all
yeah I watched into it
you watch some of it okay so six cameras
this whole like punt like whole punch
like yeah yeah so what are your thoughts
on this s10 what it might bring to the
table
you know honestly so I've been a fan of
like Samsung Galaxy devices for like the
past couple years I really think they're
doing a great job and the cameras
especially for me like I take photos all
the time my smartphone they're really
good so five or six right it's a lot
right but if they can actually do
something with it and not just use it as
like a marketing line
I'd be like excited to see it someone's
head is exploding I feel like cuz it's
it's it's just gonna be four on the back
we already had the meet 20 Pro which
yeah we call it the stove on the back
and then you have the front-facing
camera but now there's gonna be two
selfie cameras so yeah maybe I'm a huge
fan of the wide-angle though yeah I'll
be down for that if the if it's a
wide-angle on the front with the audio
quality that we've come to expect from
Samsung cameras recording and
stabilization you know so the pixel
doesn't have stabilization on video with
that wide yeah it doesn't that's the
it's like the biggest missed opportunity
but I will say this the pixel is
definitely a camera it's not a camcorder
the main cameras are great for video
don't get me wrong but if you're
vlogging with that front you're not
gonna have a good time
yeah they focus more so on photography
especially because if you look at like
the audio quality on it too definitely
not the focus there yeah it's a jarring
change I just released my review of the
pixel finally asking who is this for and
there's a section where I recorded it
with the front-facing camera the audio
like goes from here to like below the
floor it's like it's a huge change
anyway we're getting we're getting off
topic here
and your thoughts on the new Samsung
Galaxy S 10 potentially every year
there's a rumor that the phone's gonna
come out the Galaxy S then the the
phone's gonna come out earlier and
earlier like January February and year I
think they're actually going to bring it
out early because it's the 10th version
and there are going to be big changes
finally and I think they're going to be
significant don't you think they need to
take more time I mean I don't know I
it's I think that the more they space
the phone the better I mean if they
launch at CES with like I've got enough
phones to review for like MWC next year
yes like I've got so much stuff right
now it's like damn it like I don't want
to do another comparison because I need
just I just need to get done with these
reviews so by the time CES happens like
there is still buzz for products that
we're currently covering yeah yeah do
you have a huge queue still Jacqueline I
don't haven't yeah what your last phone
was I have like 10 videos I have to make
within like the next month oh my
goodness yeah I'm trying to like be like
Zen about all of them be like I'll get
to it when I get to it but then it
obviously you know it doesn't stop like
it'll never stop hitting invitations man
it's like yeah which is awesome like
it's yeah I still get excited for all
the events I don't know it's just I I
love a break like every now and then and
it goes crazy crazy crazy like you do
MWC it's insane but it's probably my
favorite show and then it's done and
then you have like a couple of weeks
like chill like for the next two to
three weeks well right now it's like
they don't want to stop and then they've
got their holiday deals and then every
all PR is like pitching back like how
about your list for the holidays and how
about your list and like yeah keep us in
mind for your holiday guide oh yeah yeah
that whole thing I'm new to that and I'm
yeah I've been getting those demos as
well so Jules is telling me here that
you know speaking of one of Samsung's
competitors just just kind of staying on
the topic of CES we might be seeing
maybe LG come out the woodwork because
apparently they're keynoting the entire
show which I didn't know until now and
I'm like okay that's a bit of a push
yeah would we see the foldable galaxy or
at least the LG foldable at CES like oh
that's so let's remember the LG G flex
it was owned like every CES we had a G
truth that's true you know and so I
think it's it's probably time for it to
come back yeah with like would like a
Snapdragon 835 or something like that
exactly something has to go wrong like
I'm serious like what now LG what are
you gonna miss now mm-hmm
all right well shifting gears a little
bit going from I mean CES is obviously
something that we're gonna talk about
going down the pipe but let's go into
the past a little bit when we talk about
Apple so Apple apparently even though
they're never going to give out the
official numbers apparently based upon a
couple of moves that they're making
perhaps the current phones are not
really selling as well as they were
hoping out in Japan the Wall Street
Journal says that Apple is doing its
best to boost the sales of the phone but
another report is claiming that Apple
has resumed production of the iPhone Tim
yeah
not the 10s but the past model mm-hmm
so I mean during the keynote didn't they
show all of the like last four
generations of phones and said here
here's the lineup that we have like I
thought that they took the 10 off the
list no oh okay well apparently yeah
okay so Jules the same they did pass
models are usually produced when there's
enough demand to justify that and
apparently there might be just enough to
man or well maybe what they're doing is
they want the 10 line to include the 10s
they just want to have sales go up no
matter what way they do yeah it's a lot
of the same materials too because it's
just like an S upgrade they probably
have a lot of inventory left may as well
make it ya know I mean the last time I
think Apple did that was like with the
iPhone 4 they had this like variant in
India that was of lesser specs for the
iPhone 4 yeah so it's at the time of the
iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 already and then
they decided to still produce the four
but it wasn't available in all markets
so that's that's interesting they have a
contract to produce a certain number or
to buy a certain
of screens from their display
manufacturers and so they have to buy
those anyway so they're not going to
build the tennis tennis max10 are
they're going to put that into another
phone that might actually sell a little
better but but another thing that I
heard about that that the news in Japan
was that you know they were like highly
subsidizing the 10r yes that's the one
Apple was highly like offering crazy
incentives for Japan to sell the 10r
yeah honestly I'm kind of surprised like
I really thought that the 10r was gonna
sell well just because like thankfully
the general consumer is there enough
difference to justify in a
thousand-dollar phone I don't think so I
really thought that it was gonna do
pretty well and I'm surprised that it's
not selling that well at least in like
the u.s. like I kind of knew that it
wasn't gonna do well and the reason why
is because budget phones nothing that's
budget like anything that's budget in
this planet cost 700 bucks let alone 800
yeah that's not budget territory like at
all I mean their entry level iPad is 350
bucks there's a five nearly $500 price
difference between that and their phone
yeah it's just no like if that iPhone
would have been priced at 550 or 650
which was the price of every iPhone
before that like like right now I'm
working on the 1 plus 60 review and it's
like it's hilarious that the oneplus 60
right now is still $100 less expensive
that every iPhone that's ever been sold
yeah every like every iPhone was always
priced at 650 but I feel like it's
stupid because like people buy iPhones
for this software in the ecosystem like
I feel like all Apple products are
always more expensive than we all think
they should be but people are still
buying it for like the ecosystem and
stuff like that and you know yeah and
there are companies like Sprint and team
Sprint particularly has this deal where
it's like iPhone forever where you get a
new iPhone every year and you pay like a
monthly thing and then Apple has that
Cuddy call iPhone upgrade plan they have
that iPhone upgrade plan where you can
swap your iPhone every year and you also
get AppleCare so yeah I plan and it
works really yeah cuz I
use an iPhone and an Android phone so
just like made sense like because I'm
like always reviewing the new one it
made sense to just like you that plan
yeah yeah no and I mean you get
AppleCare I mean that alone makes that
deal really good but I didn't think that
10r was gonna sell I'm like the colors
are pretty but I mean Brandon can tell
you I mean Brandon really loves that
phone oh please I've been using I made
four I mean forced me to use it for the
last week and it's just not worth 750
the camera actually quite terrible oh no
I had some hopes for that camera because
it's a it's a quote-unquote cheaper
Apple but oh boy was good yeah I thought
the cam was the same as a 10x
me too but it's not it's just it's worse
especially in low-light you take a
low-light picture and there's a good
amount of light but then you zoom in and
there's just noise and soft detail and
it's just it's not as good as the tennis
I think you're just predisposed you
really hate that phone
no I approach it with an open mind time
I come on as he takes a drink you see
that alright so um well the I don't know
I'm just it this this brings up the
question for me and I think this could
be the final thought on this particular
story like we were saying during our
reviews I did the 10s max review here at
pocket now for for anyone and then the
iPhone 10 review came out very recently
I meant from Jaime and the whole
question was do you upgrade from the
iPhone 10 to the 10s and it was kind of
a hard question to answer but now if
you're look if the iPhone 10 is back in
production like is that the phone you
get other than instead of the 10s I
think Jeff I would not get the 10 yeah I
wouldn't get the 10 either I would like
that camera was bad that camera was
really bad like you get a 10s and like
dude in my comparison I was like okay
the the differences are significant okay
yeah in the camera department alone that
the differences are significant and
everything else no I don't think that
the camera was like terrible on the 10
but I feel like now with the 10s out I
don't think it's worth the short-term
price difference to buy
older phone okay that's fair that but
it's just like the the iPhone sense
camera was bad compared to every Android
phone that launched last year like it
didn't matter what I compared it to and
then we had pixel to excel and then and
then the b20 procane is such good
cameras on phones and then the galaxy s
9 also killed it and I was like oh my
god
poor poor icon I'm sorry oh my god so
even an even the 1 plus 6 in dynamic
range would just it would just
obliterate the iPhone 10 in dynamic
range mmm yeah I do remember that that's
something that I've always that's
something that I haven't enjoyed about
the tennis max is that pictures are
always like they're not flat because
because they they don't lack in color
but they like in contrast so yeah that's
not really the term but that's what they
were going for it they were going for
high shadows and making sure that
everything was exposed right using their
like smart HDR and it just made for
pictures that just it's not the way I
would edit them they just aren't so I
feel like yeah I agree that I do a lot
of camera comparisons on my channel and
like when I was looking at especially
video of the 1 plus 6 and the iPhone 10s
the 1 plus 6 was so saturated that it
was kind of hard to like bring that back
and tone it down whereas a guy phone it
wasn't great to start out but I think
you have a little bit more editing
flexibility than a phone that over
saturates and like over adds contrast
that's that's a good point
all right so we have a few more stories
here um let's let's talk about one of
our old friends moto I did the review of
the z3 and I'm actually I made me happy
to see the picture on the article here
that's that's my hand and that's my
table but oh man it was great it's it's
it's over there somewhere where I'm
never gonna remember it again but it was
just weird to review a Z device without
any mods so it's not necessarily the
fault of anybody it's just a phone did
not come with lots so I wasn't really
able to give the full experience of it
and one thing that kind of made me sad
about the Moto z3 was that this is
supposed to be the last time that the
current moto mods were going to be
supported apparently that's changing
because with the Moto XIV
or apparently the current moto mods will
be supported by it and it's it's still
kind of it's not truly confirmed yet but
obviously moto is trying to create more
devices that will support the eventual
5g moto mod so of course everyone is
really excited about 5g we're gonna hear
a ton about it pretty soon
and apparently this particular device
codenamed Odin is only going to be on
Verizon again it's the only carrier that
has this word that is associated with it
so it's gonna be another Verizon
exclusive it's not gonna be a wide
seller because of that you know I don't
know there's this whole thing that we
have here where we think that moto does
make some pretty cool devices they have
pretty cool concepts but yeah the it
just doesn't seem like they're it seems
like they're kind of shooting themselves
in the foot a little bit when it comes
to some of these choices any thoughts on
a moto z4 are you happy for moto mods to
be continued you know I actually I've
always kind of liked Motorola devices
but I've never actually tried out any of
them would like the mods and stuff I
don't know I think you have more
expertise in this I've never I've only
tried out like the Moto G 5 like they're
more budget option Oh gotcha the G still
managed to be pretty cool devices like
it's alright as far as pricing goes and
yeah but the Z's they're like they're
trying really hard and it just doesn't
seem like they're executing perfectly
but you kind of give them that nada that
pat on the shoulder for being like ok
you're trying some decisions that are
just I'm like what like snapdragon 835
on that you know on that latest Z no you
know like PR not sending any moto mods
I'm like what am I supposed to play with
here cuz the reason I don't have moto
mods because they asked for them back
after the z2 review yeah and so is like
what do you want me to do this with like
that was one thing and then the other
I'm not gonna go buy these things like
are you crazy and and then you know some
of these moto mods weren't really great
like the Hasselblad was really bad now
one was a disappointment for sure yeah
yeah I'm shocked it has Allah was
willing to put their brand on that thing
like I'd like there are
camera like regular smartphone cameras
to take better photos but I guess for me
it's just they made certain decisions
like that shatter shield display on the
previous model not optional like that's
all you get which means like my my
review unit is scratched AF it's really
bad and you know for some people that's
great I don't care about shadow shown so
it's just they keep doing these weird
things really weird things that you know
are not trendy at all
very experimental yeah yeah for sure
speaking of experimental Jules just just
mentioned that the Z form might be using
a non 5g version of a future potential
processor the Snapdragon 855 which to me
is like okay I get it that you want to
to cut the cost and then put those costs
into promoting the 5g moto mod that that
itself is gonna be more money on top of
a device yeah like that's gonna be more
money on top of a device that could
already support 5g out of the box but
then you want to have this extra piece
on the back but if gradable so you know
that's that's an exciting marketing line
well this was the thing that I was
saying earlier on when we were when we
really were getting into 5g talk and I
know everyone's kind of sick of like
some 5g talk and whatnot but this is
this is really where our industry is
gonna be going so two three years from
now when your internet is really fast
you're gonna thank us for really diving
into this kind of topic but what I was
saying before was wouldn't it be a bad
idea to have something like a separate
peripheral for 5g when processors are
already going to be supporting it at the
earliest six months from now
yeah that's exactly what's happening a
moto right now ads like thickness and
cost and like what if you forget it
I don't know I don't think that's like
the best decision to do that neither
neither but you know it could just tell
us something I don't know if you guys
remember every single time that there's
been a deployment of a need G it
requires this like there's this like
growing curve and so if you remember
like when the HTC Thunderbolt came out
probably too many years ago it had her
like the modem was completely separate
from the chipset it wasn't until later
that they were able to integrate the
modem into the chip and
so obviously there was it was very it
was not optimized at all like it was bad
it was really bad so I don't know man I
I have a feeling that 5g might not
necessarily I think that there's gonna
be that we probably will go through a
stage where probably next year's phones
will not necessarily either I don't
think many phones will bring 5g next
year like I feel it they'll be 5d
capable or that it'll probably be
optional and you pay extra for that
variant that includes the 5g and i and
i'm and i'm i don't know i could just
smell it the modem it's gonna be like a
separate chip in the phone if you buy it
or i don't know man something like that
it's also the infrastructure might not
even be fully in place exactly to take
advantage of it so final question for
everybody so are we thinking that it's
better to just sort of upgrade this
upcoming year and set out all of the
first gen 5g phones just kind of sit out
all of the ones that are really pushing
5g super hard and just not worry about
them for now I would say that if you
live in a city that is likely to get 5g
sooner like you know San Francisco New
York then yeah get a 5g phone because
you're gonna have access to that a lot
sooner but if you're in like the middle
of farm country then should probably
wait a long time or significant but see
but see that's the thing so the whole 5g
wave is the fact that getting
connectivity to this farm country is
gonna be easier because of a millimeter
wave I think it's still gonna take
longer for them to bring it out there
true that true that but you know
millimeter wave has that advantage it's
literally HF frequency to a certain
degree I guess and so it's it's easier
to spread it out like you know I don't
think it to get it out there but do you
have to build to make that happen
and also I feel like it like depends on
pricing to like how much more expensive
is it going to be to get five gene is
that really worth it to you well a hot
take from you then is speaking of first
gen devices we're talking first gen 5g
how about first gen foldables would you
be down for that first gen are you gonna
are you gonna be an early adopter or are
you gonna tell people let's chill and
make sure that it's good first you know
I think for the general consumer that
doesn't have a ton of money to spend her
as
gonna get a ton of devices I don't think
that they should do it because I feel
like there's gonna be a lot of
durability issues and it's gonna be
really expensive for me when I'm
constantly reviewing a new phone like
every single month I'm definitely gonna
want to try it and also like years ago I
always wanted a phone that was like
small and then like slide out to be
full-size and this is like a little
different but I feel like it's a similar
idea
so like that gets me excited that we're
moving in a way to get like a small form
factor but a big screen when we want it
definitely gonna want to try it but I
think that the Samsung one is like what
was it like 1300 or something like that
yeah something like that yeah it's
expensive yeah so I just don't I don't
think that's good for the general
consumer especially a first gen product
when second gen is probably gonna be
significantly better okay I agree with
Jacqueline that this this this is not
going to be for the general public but
for us it's like the dream so we've been
waiting for for a very long time its
form reform back there where if you have
an own device like then transform into a
tablet when you need more supriya it's
about I gotta use it you know i think i
think i'm just still favored by the by
the axon I don't know man I I think that
this is a solution in search of a
problem
because you can buy very cheap Amazon
fire tablets right now for like 200
bucks we've been doing we've been doing
it for so long you know it's just the
thing about it is do you really want to
haul a thick phone in your pocket just
because you can turn it into a tablet is
the question - good point
yeah that is the question so back in the
day when we used to use like the slider
smart phones it made sense because all
of us were carrying this dumb holster
and are in our felt and so the phone
will fall in there and it wouldn't go
into our pocket and you know iPhones
changed that work the phone became much
slimmer there was no secondary but you
know portion or surface and so you were
able to put it in your pocket and now
we're ii and so the holsters died like
they would big died and so the question
is are you really will like if you grab
the necks on em and you try to put it in
your pocket that thing does not look
good like at all that's a phone from
like three years ago in like five years
from now these foldable phone
we'll be the same size as regular phones
and they will they will open up I mean
it's there's me no compromises it's
gonna be the same kind of footprint as a
regular phone but it opens up to have a
tablet I don't I don't feel that's gonna
happen Brandon because battery
technology is not there yet battery can
only batteries have only gotten denser
but not significantly so every single
technology in the world has has
miniaturized every single one except
batteries yeah battery technology is
like one of the most like one of the
things that we actually need the most
like long battery life and there's been
so little improvement exactly exactly
and so if you think about it the biggest
problem when you have three displays on
a product is you need more battery
that's true is gonna have like it's
gonna have like two hours of screen on
time we're gonna go ahead and pick up
the pace a little bit for our final
stories on this segment since they are
all pretty lights but I want to give one
quick shout out that last story about
the moto mods and the Moto z4 was made
possible by XT developers who are ported
on many of the details behind that story
so good shout out to you guys XDA all
right so you mentioned HTC a little
while ago I'm a so let's let's talk
about that a little bit
okay so HTC apparently so they haven't
gone away and the U 13 is apparently
going to be a thing but there is going
to be a shift in how the U 13 the
theoretical u 13 will be will be put out
and apparently it's not going to be a
flagship anymore it might become
something else it might become more of a
mid flagship and according to a source
that Phandroid it's going to follow the
you 12 plus but it's going to be not a
full flagship phone is this a move that
now granted hopefully the price will be
a little bit lower but is this is this a
shift that we're okay with with HTC or
is this even more of the nails in the
coffin as as it were I hope that came up
on that stream I love they see I just I
I grab the you 12 plus and I'm like Mike
what are you guys thinking all you
needed to do was to graduate the Utah
what was that no not the you 11
yeah the 46 piece yet grab the you 11
and you know put it on edge to edge
screen over that design that's gonna be
a great phone but no they they came up
with this like these like weird
capacitive buttons that work horribly
and that you could peel off like like
it's funny because of my are calling
here Sam I gave him the phone
initially for him to do the Spanish
review and he's like I'm done here have
a better response it was like I don't
want to use that thing so you know
honestly I still have like a soft spot
for HTC because I love their m8 with
like the boom sound speakers and I feel
like at that point they were still like
kind of a player in the industry as I
struggle with these headphones um those
are pixel buds no there okay so what
happened is I was like oh my way to the
office I was like oh no I forgot
headphones I went out and I bought these
like cheap $15 headphones and you're
actually the worst anyways so I have
like a soft spot for them but the last
couple years I don't know what they've
been up to you honestly yeah definitely
Brendan you've been like like a zit word
you know you return to this particular
stage have you been watching the HTC
let's say growth or D growth if we can
put it that way after the amazing
original HTC one the m7
I tried the eight and all of the
subsequent phones and I just stopped I
gave up because they were all they all
were disappointing so I stopped you know
HTC was on top a long time ago but I
I've stopped caring since the m1 or the
m7 and then so sad because like
xda-developers like the name XDA came
from a sub brand from HTC oh yeah XD so
XDA HQ tech i mate all these were HTC
sub brands here's a fun fact
Oh - which is a carrier in Europe came
out with the XDA phone which was a spin
on the the phrase PDA you know personal
the ex was supposed to imply extreme so
the extreme digital assistant and so
that was the original
XDA device and I don't think a lot of
people know that it's a little one fact
do you do you have one
no but Wikipedia does a few I feel like
we should hunt that down particularly
had a ton of variants like it was on
AT&amp;amp;T it had like four buttons on each
one on each corner in addition to a
d-pad it was just it was weird I but
those really good times and I still have
a ton of HTC products I do I wish them
well it's just like right now even with
this pixel 3xl which is pretty much an
HTC phone if you think about it oh I'm
like my god like I could totally tell
this was not made by LG and I'm sad
there was a time when like like the
pixel to excel was not my favorite
looking phone but it didn't look bad and
it felt really light it felt really good
and then I grabbed this phone and I'm
like my god like there are corners cut
on this design yeah I mean I I I will
concede the design of the pixel 3 is a
little like it there's so much more that
I could have done to streamline the
overall design there are good things
about it's it's it's like I said like I
said in my review it's the most
disappointing phone that I use every
single day
[Laughter]
alright so speaking of Google and I'm
staring right at my pixel 3 sitting on
the the pixel stand right now Google
assistants apparently is now even more
integrated into our iPhones yeah this is
kind of cool actually a cool quick
warning so anybody who's listening right
now and they have their hot words turned
on apparently now you can activate Siri
and then after you activate Siri you can
program a phrase but typically it's of
course okay G okay Google you could say
that and whatever comes after that we'll
go straight to Google assistant as it is
installed on and I found bridging that
gap just sort of in the iPhones like one
thing that I loved about the 10s max
review was that I did
have to feel like I was actually giving
up too much because you can download all
the google applications all the Google
ecosystem can work pretty well on an
iPhone and now this is just another step
towards that yeah do you even use Siri
do you say I use Siri for reminders like
I'm like oh I don't want to I don't want
to trigger it right now but I say hey
that name and then I say can you set a
reminder for like whatever time bring my
headphones which was not successful day
or whatever it is I never use it for
anything else
okay it's like set an alarm for tomorrow
with this or set an appointment for that
or setup set a reminder that's pretty
much all I use Siri for that soon
how about assistance in general like is
Google assistant one of those I used
Google assistant quite a lot to be
honest yeah so I have never used an echo
there's one behind me so I can't say the
a-word right now oh oh but I so i oh my
god so i could literally be out in the
balcony and I could from the balcony
talk to it in like whisper tone from a
distance and it'll like in the far field
communication from that thing is it's
wow like so good really good really
really good do you know what blue light
on the top of the echo if when you
trigger the a word there's a there's a
lighter blue light that goes to where it
thinks you it hears the voice it's a fun
little little fun fact I'm full of them
today think about like the Google Home
Hub versus the echo like the echo one
that has a display - oh yeah oh oh the
show that the small little dot the
bigger one with this it's like a bigger
oh that's great it's like a little bit
bigger than Google Home Hub yeah that's
a screen is a screen battle in this case
yeah let's talk let's throw that let's
throw the portal in there let's throw
the Facebook port number - kidding are
you getting a home hub Declan I think so
you know for Black Friday actually this
is like convenient timing it's $50 off
so it's only 99 versus like 149 it's
good dear
read off your entire affiliate link
Jacqueline Minsky Yeah right
alright cool so we have one last story
one thing really quick and as it turns
out Xiaomi has been making so many moves
lately one thing that was not mentioned
in this story or one one of our topics
was not that Xiaomi bought outs really
popular Chinese company made - and me -
makes these phones that are only
available in Hong Kong China Taiwan that
take incredible selfies because they add
so like their beauty mode I'm not the
mean you mean the ion otha the Ayane
phone exactly and yeah it's it they're
all about their selfies and I was
actually really impressed with what they
did on there even though I'm not a
beauty mode advocate but my girlfriend
Lisa is is definitely that's like her
favorite phone
but anyway show me buying on me to means
that that phone might have more
distribution so kind of excited about
that but on the other hand Xiaomi just
opened 500 stores in India all at once
which broke a world record they are in
the Guinness Book of World Records now
because of how many stores they opened
it's pretty awesome okay so they I did
see I did see that they're going to open
up some use some other stores and other
markets they did just start in the UK
I saw a me store in where were we Paris
when I was there a couple weeks ago
which was kind of cool and apparently
there's gonna be a major US announcement
on December 8th which I only just now
like found out via this story too bad
when I'm not gonna be there but anyway
Jacqueline are you gonna be around for
for that I think I'm actually gonna be
away for that - oh like what I don't
know what they would be doing but like
what a me store in the u.s. excite you
guys sells a lot more than just phones
like exactly yeah they sell scooters
which would be perfect in New York they
sell apparel they sell saris like
they've got a lot of stuff and think
about Xiaomi products is like for
example I have their wireless chargers
and even if even if that wireless
charger does not include a fast power
brick if you use any
quick charge three power brick on it
it'll provide fast charging to whatever
phone you put on it no nice yeah if the
phone is compatible with fast wireless
charging that charger will provide it
and that charger is literally twenty
dollars twenty dollars
yeah they offer really good budget stuff
that like I feel like if they launch the
store in New York people will just go
like not necessarily knowing the brand
and then just get like good tech
products that don't like break the bank
yeah no no they don't break the bank
they don't break like oh my god like
they're mimics it's a ceramic phone for
500 bucks
yeah high-end specs yeah full spec pull
everything it's just the only thing
that's bad with that phone is that
software but then they make money out of
that software so I totally understand
the existence of it mm-hmm
yeah honestly no that's like one of the
brands that is really like exciting to
me this year like I feel like they have
a lot of potential with their devices
this year this company is also somewhat
invasive because there are products that
I didn't even know were developed by
Xiaomi and then I look on the side and
there's a me logo there the oculus go is
a Xiaomi developed product yeah there's
a real animal side that everybody I have
an unboxing mine yeah so when you
unboxing you finally look at the the
invite because I don't know if you
you've probably seen it on social media
right yeah you've I it's via oculus goes
yeah I saw that that is so cool which is
pretty dumb it's still in its box dude
it's like it's we went one time last
year and it was always pretty awesome
Brendan how do you have any Yami
products at all I have to say right
Xiaomi products Xiaomi no but it's super
interesting to see the wide array of
products that they have you know they
have the smart rice cooker for China
their air purifier they even may even
make a smart toothbrush it's I'm serious
if you go to you go to me.com it's just
unbelievable how many products they make
and their stores I mean Josh we were in
Shanghai and
so you if you remember after we did that
tower you know there was the store below
the tower in right in front of it like
the store was packed and it was so well
distributed it had everything it had
from what do you call these like
hoverboards they had hoverboards they
had they had absolutely every like they
had fans they sell fans it's crazy only
random things they sell Isis they're
controlled with Wi-Fi so you can have
the me app and control everything
yes exactly the only problem with that
is though if they were to open up stores
here and start selling their ecosystem
stuff the me app has to work here and I
think that's their biggest hurdle at the
moment because I tried using that thing
and it did not work with the smart bulb
that I that I got and and the other
thing too is up until that point the me
app only really worked on xiaomi phones
which was kind of a weird way a weird
thing that they did in any case one more
thing from Jules over here the while
they have a lot of ecosystem sales
smartphones have been their biggest
breadwinner so thirty three point three
million phones in q3 and it's a lot but
it's almost not surprising considering
how ad costs did they sell these phones
at that's true I feel like if I asked my
friends nine out of 10 people will not
know the brand
oh yeah hundred percent and it's the
hardest thing to pronounce that's the
thing but in China they are they are
huge
it's literally fandom it's like like I
think people in China they are fans of
iPhones first sadly and then second
would be Xiaomi like they go crazy over
that and it's like I'd like their
business model is like the most
interesting the only reason why Xiaomi
is possible is because Google is not in
China that's just the way it is because
they control the App Store and they
literally control that apps will pay to
promote themselves on the App Store and
that's how they make their money and
that for them a phone is just a terminal
where as they make their income out of
out of out of their stores and you know
just like most of their executives are
ex-google most of the challengers like
their high profile executives all came
from Google so you know it's that they
literally it's like if they built the
the next variant of Google in China it's
it's weird
yes actually yeah there's a lot there's
a lot of experience in the Xiaomi upper
upper echelon and it shows you know
they're they're very successful company
despite being only in some markets but
they're there going hard in India and
India loves their Xiaomi products
alright so with that those are all of
our stories for this first segment we're
gonna go ahead and go into our break and
we'll be right back okay
the bacchanal weekly comes to you with
the help of caseta by Lutron and today i
want to talk to you about casada by
Lutron smart lighting control brought to
you by Lutron pioneers in smart home
technology with coz-theta
you can schedule your lights to come on
at dusk so your family always comes back
to a well at home now it's all about now
it's not about changing all the bulbs
you're going to have to replace from
time to time no you're not you're
actually gonna be changing the light
switches it's pretty easy to do you just
need a screwdriver and 15 minutes once
that's done every light bulb becomes a
smart light bulb all you need to do to
control them is flick the switch or tell
your smart home assistant to turn it on
or off
that makes lighting your home fast and
easy how easy well Jules our producer
has been testing the switches out and
it's really helped him out in the
morning even after 6 o'clock is still
pretty dark out where he is so no thanks
to daylight savings time and the coming
of winter but that's why he said his
bedroom lights to turn on with his alarm
so that he can get up get showered pack
his bags and not miss the damn bus to
New York again in any case get smart
lighting and get it the way in any case
get smart lighting and get it the smart
way with caseta by Lutron search for cas
ETA or check out Lutron comm to learn
more caseta by Lutron welcome home it's
a peace of mind alright so we are back
and I actually have an idea for our
Black Friday episode we are going to
talk about some Black Friday deals in a
little bit but this is a this is an idea
that I had for a video that won by the
wayside once I got done eating our like
luncheon feast yesterday because I just
I died yesterday for like four hours
after all the food I'm fine I'll be okay
it's just I clearly can feel like my
body hates me after yesterday but I hope
everyone
great thanks for giving and I said you
know all of us here on the panel can
talk a little bit about what we did on
Thanksgiving and whatnot but you can go
ahead and say a little bit about that
but what I really wanted to ask everyone
is because it's Thanksgiving or it was
what what were you most thankful for in
this year of 2018 when it comes to tech
and I can open it up it doesn't have to
be smartphones per se but you know 2018
what do you think before this year let's
start with Brandon actually I kind of
want to start with with Brandon over
there yeah so mine is kind of weird and
it's it's not necessarily something that
occurred in 2018 rather something I've
rediscovered in 2018 that's fine and
it's going to sound really strange with
hang with me for a sec and what I
rediscovered in 2018 was satellite radio
whoo very strange but about 10 years ago
I got a new car and the new car had
satellite radio with a free like
one-year trial and I'm like oh this is
cool turns out satellite radio 10 years
ago was terrible the audio quality was
probably around 100 kilobits per second
which is under CD quality the reception
was so poor where if you went under a
tree which you do frequently in the
suburbs the signal would crap out and
then the programming was kind of
mediocre I mean you got Howard Stern of
course but besides that the channels
were kind of weird there's like top 40
there was jazz and classical and things
like that this year I gave it another
try
and it has made my life measurably
better first of all the reception issues
are solved I guess maybe the new the new
antennas are much better or the
satellites got stronger or something the
audio quality has improved and most most
importantly the content has gotten so
much better there are radio stations
with fantastic playlists for really
anybody I'll just give you a couple of
examples they have a channel called fly
which is 90s hip-hop like the good stuff
like Tupac notorious b.i.g Bone Thugs
like none of this like black eyed peas
crap that you hear on the radio
so fantastic DJ's great playlist with no
commercials of course I even found a
station for hard rock from the 90s and
2000 so you got like Korn Metallica you
know if you are in the Hard Rock it's
just I was a hard left Breton it's it's
so good and of course there are apps on
all devices so you can listen all your
channels in different places it's five
dollars a month which is kind of
annoying if you're already paying for
Spotify I was about to say Jules was
just throwing shade at you it's an
expensive version of Spotify radio than
huh it's much better than Spotify radio
because human beings are curating these
playlists and they're just fantastic
okay it's so good so that there's also a
lot of spoken word content on satellite
radio isn't there like there's it's
almost like there's podcasts but it's
yeah talk radio right and human beings
have good taste that's the present
company excluded how about you Jacquelyn
what uh what have you been thankful for
in 2018 um alright so I feel like I'm
thankful for one device and not
necessarily like the device but what
they're doing differently so I just made
our viewing the up of fine decks a
couple weeks ago and I'm thankful that a
company is trying to do something about
the knotch and like well I don't
necessarily think that it's like the
best thing for the consumer with
durability issues and an expensive price
I think it's really interesting that a
company is like really actually thinking
about it so much that they like redesign
what we're using a typical smartphone so
I'm thankful for that but I'm also
excited for what that means like the
future of a bezel is this place you and
I are you know right on the same
wavelength Jacqueline because I was
going to say my short answer is my
practical answer is noise cancelling
headphones I finally got my first pair
this year it was at the very beginning
of this year and it's completely changed
my travel like I love noise cancelling
headphones now and in my case I have the
Sony Mark twos I know the more threes
are out now but I love those to death
but I was actually going to say in in in
the video that I was gonna do until I
food coma
the
I'm actually thankful for the notch like
are you really I may not like it I may
not enjoy it but it's because of the
notch that we have the fine X it's
because of the notch we have the slider
phone back and it's because of the notch
that companies are actually trying new
things so yeah and a weird roundabout
way I think we have to give a little bit
of gratitude for this aberration that
appeared ah yes alright I'm Jaime oh my
god
Jules you want to shine man with what
you're thankful for first I have no idea
no I think Jules Amiad but ok so for me
it's wow this it's interesting because I
don't think I'm actually thankful for
anything in particular
I'm just thankful that companies are
back to being excited about making good
stuff we went through a slump over the
last couple of years we're company
companies were not really making money
out of phones and so we solid the mess
of a few companies we saw you know
companies being coming coming up to you
and keynotes being like yeah phones have
gotten weird but we've got here this
really awesome phone which was just as
boring but you know it wasn't really
anything better and I'm just I'm happy
to be part of a ton of events as I've
had and to see this like push and
excitement from these companies just
working hard on on coming up with better
things I feel that we've it's like if
the period of mediocre products in
technology is ending I've noticed that
even less expensive products are really
good like the poco phone IV I feel that
these products are necessary I feel that
so here's the thing I come from a very
different background Latin America most
of my friends will go crazy over one
plus 6 they can't afford one you know
even a one plus six and so for two you
know for them for them to be able to buy
a poco phone for example or stuff like
that I feel like the push that honors
making over bringing like really high
quality products at a less expensive
price point for all the changes in the
design that we've seen I just I feel
that we've got our we've got the
iPhones that cost an insane amount of
money and I'm actually not thankful for
that because I feel that technology
should the democratize itself and become
more accessible to people and not stupid
expensive as it's been in certain
products and so I like the push that
other companies are doing in pushing the
bar and making every making technology
as accessible as possible you know
that's me
a mint that's good yeah I'm a I'm is
thankful for job security and it's
really great that we have like evolution
happening still you know cuz you're
right that's slump we were all feeling
it it was it was pretty rough to be
honest and we were we weren't sure if we
were just gonna end up repeating
ourselves for the next two years yeah I
remember a year ago like everyone was
tweeting like that like Oh bored with
smartphones like what's gonna happen and
now we have so many different ones yeah
if you're watching the live version of
this right now I don't think I'm a is a
is thankful for shoddy internet well in
that case I'm gonna go ahead and say
what Jules is thankful for Jules your
sweetheart thank you for saying this I'm
thankful for the people I've met in my
career in tech blogging people like
Laura Fagan Kyoto huesemann Michael
Fisher rain hey Gore Jacqueline Brandon
Jaime njv and also Stephen shank
shoutouts you Steven we want to get you
on the podcast as well by the way
brother um but yeah I mean that was sort
of the shift that I was going to make
like me remember we're all thankful for
all of you as well you viewers listeners
all of you who come to PocketNow
xda-developers
any of our channels as well thank you so
much for sticking around with us and
yeah so thank you for oh you know what
now that I just said that I just
realized I haven't been looking at the
live chat I'm not listening to our fans
are so sorry I will open that up but
while we get into our Black Friday deals
for today Brendan I know you have maybe
just a few minutes left so we're gonna
go through these deals that have to do
with some high profile devices so would
you pass or play on these deals that are
coming up oh hi make him back and he's
moving I'm thankful for the times when
the power doesn't go out in my country
which is not today
oh no
that's the Internet no no powerful power
outage man and the Kalinka it's bad so
let me walk out into the balcony and say
goodbye to everybody the power comes
back on in a little bit I know just
having to I'll just head to a coffee
shop that's the way all right all right
oh boy all right so we're gonna get into
a couple of these here so the first
thing and we were kind of we were kind
of talking about this a little bit
before the show Apple like if you if you
wait for Black Friday to be the time
where you buy an Apple product and some
sort of low price you've you've probably
been disappointed every single year
because they just don't do very deep
discounts on anything it's just not
gonna happen at the Apple store but this
is what we have this year so gift cards
are going to be given if you buy certain
types of products I have them up here so
you can get a $50 gift card if you get
one of the older iPhones anything from
the iPhone 7 so the eight plus you can
get a $100 gift card if you get any of
the iPads you can get a two hundred
dollar gift card for $200 or rather you
can get a two hundred dollar Apple Gift
Card if you get a Mac that's why I
should invent to say yeah okay you
Jacqueline you said before the the show
that that's kind of cool but isn't it
just kind of disappointing like this
yeah to be honest like I feel like
they're student discounts are so much
better than their then like their
holiday discounts mmm like I don't $200
for math like what does a Mac start at
like what like $1200 I guess that's good
because then you can put that into like
dongles which is kind of inevitable at
this point um which itself is a sad
thing to say like oh I got this gift
card I can put it towards products that
this laptop should have in the first
place but you know I'm not trying to
throw shade I'm sorry Brandon Apple
products with the gift card like there
are two things that I kept thinking
about
this number one the barrier of entry is
very low I mean very high rather it's
not low enough for most people who look
towards things like Black Friday to get
into these products but also even if you
buy one of these products it's an Apple
store gift card you're still locked into
whatever Apple gives so is this
something that you would buy up Brendon
I rather just have a discount on the
product itself because if you have a two
hundred dollar gift card you're probably
gonna roll that into like the purchase
of another Apple device I mean you're
not gonna like put it in your iTunes
account so you can buy 100 $2 apps you
know you're just going to end up having
to buy more Apple products and I just
rather have the discount like the
scanner it's awesome because it's clear
right they'd like here's the product and
here's a little bit of money towards
assessories yes pretty much and I can't
even really think of a I was so close I
said this went after the Apple Keaton or
that happened a little while back I was
so ready to get the MacBook Air if the
specs were going to be good and they
just didn't really live up to what I
wanted them to be but that's really the
only Apple product that I feel like I
would want to get maybe the Mac Pro but
that's three thousand dollars and then
you get only $200 on top of that in a
gift did you see though that B&amp;amp;H is
having a giant sale on it right now on
the Mac bro yeah oh I did not see that I
just know I don't need it so I'm not
gonna get it but yeah I saw it on
Twitter though I think it was like a lot
off like maybe $600 off like an
expensive one mm-hmm oh that's cool yeah
up to up to $500 on forty five hundred
dollars worth of purchases so
interesting that's still a lot of money
anyway anyway Brendan's gonna go in a
little bit so let's get your thoughts
real quick on Metro by t-mobile
I almost had metro pcs it's Metro by
t-mobile so apparently they're going to
be giving a free pair of air pods when
hold on real quick I think are superior
when they decide when when consumers
decide to bring in their own iPhone over
to the carrier or they buy a 32 gigabyte
iPhone 6's success is a little bit
further back in the in the generations
but you get a pair of air pods are you
air pod users you guys yes love when I
read that right now clearly
yes right now he's really making me love
the a proposal ya know I love the
airports I use them every single day
without like a question I fit the sound
quality I love it if that was improved
on the second gen but they're just so
convenient they're so good
so they are they are incredibly
convenient and by the way you have to
have a fifty dollar or more service plan
with this entire deal to even get the
air pods but they are free and they are
a rather expensive piece of kit that go
along with your smartphone so I wouldn't
be surprised if anyone really kind of
scoop this up one quick thought from you
Brandon
before you go since this air the this
this these air pods are being made
available number one on discounts and
number two as a freebie if you take up
this deal over at Metro by t-mobile is
this a sign that a Gen 2 is someone on
the way like our Apple trying to burn
through their stock in order to bring
gen 2 to the market so happy was
speculating yeah so it people thought
that the gent a would come out in q2
quarter four of this year but it didn't
so yeah I mean I personally hope so I
want to see what Gen 2 would be like for
the air pods so if they're trying to
burn through stock right now I mean
let's let's bring on Gen 2 let's do this
yeah yeah for sure well what that guys I
got a roll out all right whew I'll go
Brandon thank you so much for coming on
yes all right our next deal for today
so have you played with the palm at all
Jacqueline so I just got it last Monday
but when I initially got it
it wasn't able to be set up or something
but now they just mean help me that
we're good to go so I've seen it I've
held it but I haven't used yet okay so
it's in your possession yeah I'm excited
though I I want to try it out but it's
it keeps it's almost like an oversized
smartphone a SmartWatch in a way like
isn't that one of the functionality of
it is supposed to be like yeah it's like
the phone to keep you away from your
phone but I also feel like I may be a
little bit partial to it because I think
it's really cute like it's just like
it's so
I'm like I think it's cute like how can
you not so how do you feel about it
having to be tethered to a bigger
smartphone like is you're basically a
two device carrier at that point no
matter what yeah I mean I don't
necessarily think that there's anything
wrong with that just because like on the
Apple watch series like the new one
series four I think it is you have to
buy it like $10 plan a month if you want
to use it also it's just like it's
attached to your phone and also I don't
think that you could ever use the palm
phone as your primary phone anyways so
what it really makes sense to like have
its own line like do you really think
that you could use a three-inch phone
every day I mean okay so it would it
would dramatically change though my
daily habits but I'm looking at this
photo right now and by the way everybody
as far as the Black Friday deal is
concerned
Jaqueline already has her so I guess
I'll answer the question of its
exclusive to Verizon but it's available
today and tomorrow if you're listening
to this on Black Friday for 149 that's
half of the original contract price and
$200 short of the full retail price
that's actually a pretty deep cut so I
don't know I'd be interested in it for
that amount of money but aren't you on
it I'm sorry you know the deal ends
today this this article came out
yesterday my apologies you are locked
into a contract yes and that is the
problem but as far as like the palm goes
in general I mean I'm looking at this
photo and there's there are icons for
everything from Google photos to Google
Drive to the Play Store why couldn't I
use this as a primary phone that's the
part that disappoints me about this you
know like it should have that
functionality okay yeah I can see that
actually yeah I also feel like if it was
like less like let's say the phone was
priced at 150 dollars permanently no
contract I feel like this phone would
sell so well I get arranger dollars yeah
that's a hard sell I wonder if Joe's
Jules is down for this phone he was like
I don't care about any of that I want it
that phone with like a good keyboard
like that's that's what that's what
would really do it for Jules I I don't
know I feel like you know if voice
dictation were better like this would be
the perfect device you could like hit
that icon and just talking to it but
yeah
you know it's I would change my habits
you know and this would probably be like
my my new age when you aged like like
soon like I would love to have a Zune
again to just have like really good
audio coming out of this phone if it had
a good DAC it would be my audio player
no matter what that's a good point
actually yeah like there are certain
media things to this device that I feel
like would actually propel it a little
bit like maybe it's an audible device
maybe it's a podcasting device stuff
like that you can listen to this story
podcast on the Palm Pre for example but
in any case we do have one final thing
to talk about here and it's an
interesting it's an interesting thing
that Samsung did just announced that
they have their foldable device granted
they did turned on the lights
there's we weren't really able to get a
really good look at it it looks chunky
honestly but it looks chunky that's the
that's the biggest problem I have it but
in it may or may not be like some sort
of a game-changer now what we have here
are many different names for the galaxy
f the galaxy flex the samsung flex are
there different names that we can think
of or splice really what we're gonna go
for it because LG kind of started in
with the G flex yeah and the G flex is
kind of a different I don't yeah there's
a lot of phones that use flex I don't
know I think I guess the point across
from what it is hmm but yeah I don't
know do you think that's a good name
like you think it's gonna sell well with
like if like someone said oh like you of
the galaxy flex you think that like that
gets people's interest or like you think
there's a better name for that I don't
like it being part of the general like
casual lexicon because we've already had
that whole phenomenon where people don't
even call them Android phones like is
that a galaxy and then if that were to
happen again some was like is that a
flex and I just don't like it doesn't
sound good to me you know and then LG
what Samsung is tentatively naming it
the Galaxy flex but LG is about to come
out with their foldable device lord
knows they have the G flex so it might
they might actually have a stranglehold
on that patent or rather the trademark
of that name Huawei is starting to get
some trademark names done as well
mate f the mate flex these are my
favorites the made flexi sound and the
mate fold his fold would fold B I did
not like that one duo at all it fold I
don't know
it's like flex sounds cooler flex Jules
is trying to direct you to make me do
some sort of dance routine because of
the Flex II know I don't know where that
that even came up I don't have a dance
called the flexi but in any case the oh
there's a thumbnail now okay so let's
take a look quick look at this we're
getting a little bit meta Jones is
showing us the thumbnail for today's
show but in any case like what would be
I don't know I can't think of any other
names that could I don't think it's a
good idea to just call it f there's just
let's just get that out of the way first
like the Galaxy F there could be way too
many jokes about that we're going flex
is you're right fold may not be great
does that to stay with F yeah could they
do a different letter well what what are
the word like describes what it is I'm
not too sure the galaxy crease yeah well
maybe told you I love that well I mean
this is gonna be one of those conundrums
we're not gonna know and so maybe CES
MWC but it's crazy you know like we we
not only have the upcoming flag ships
that are coming out I mean from LG we're
probably going to see another another G
series another though the v series is
gonna be later on from Huawei they're
gonna see the P series but then
alongside these things are going to be
these concepts phones like these
foldable phones like we were talking
about being inundated by phones before
this is gonna be a crazy season
especially because all the phones are
gonna be like expensive like really
pricey but yeah yeah I agree with
someone said in the group chat that
Samsung already had a phone called the
galaxy f I don't know if that's like
sure or not but I feel like that would
have been the I feel like that would be
when was it the
it's like a mid-range device I feel like
and this was from years ago though like
that's from a long time ago
I remember they had like those lines
kind of like how the LG line has like
the L line I remember they had the L
line God thank God we don't have to
cover those anymore because they would
always be like more than one variation
of each and everyone anyway yeah I mean
to go through all of them but yeah with
that I feel like we would I feel like we
did it so no answers from us over here

foldable devices should be called you
