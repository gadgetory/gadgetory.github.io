reaches the UK for retail microsoft
surface 2 and surface pro 2 are plagued
with overheating issues and the
cyanogenmod have just got pulled from
the google play store because you know
android is open that way I'm hi Mary bed
i am happy thanksgiving everyone and i
couldn't leave you guys without the news
today this is PocketNow daily let's lay
off with some official news as this is
kind of weird i need one of the biggest
complaints that we had about the HTC one
when it launched is the fact that it
doesn't have expandable storage but
there was this Chinese variant of the
phone that had a removable back dual
sims and also removable storage and as
it turns out this phone is now going to
retail in the UK for 549 bucks so for
those of you interested still at an HTC
One with dual sims and expandable
storage you can get it now but then
again you wonder why didn't they do that
in the first place at least the
expandable storage now onto other
official news the US carriers in the
United States just made a big win as
they've just lured other carriers from
abroad to be able to block phones that
were stolen in the United States for you
to not be able to activate them outside
the United States and this is a big deal
i mean smartphones outside the US are
very expensive probably twice the price
so it's a big business for your phone to
get stolen so obviously this is good
news it's gonna take some time there are
some countries that are not on the list
for now but this is a good starting
point hopefully it'll get better in the
next coming months that's something
interesting that just happened is that
after dissecting the YouTube application
for android and iOS that was discovered
that actually there is some sort of
music subscription service that YouTube
is planning to bring where you would pay
YouTube for it and use the application
on your iOS or Android device but what
makes this even more interesting is the
fact that whatever will happen to the
Google Play all access service they
already pay could it be that they're
planning to have dual services because
both companies are from google stay
tuned for the news let's see how that
ends up now a question I have for you is
if any of you are having problems with
overheating on your service to more
surface pro 2 as customers are
complaining that apparently even the
screen is dimming on these devices after
so much overheat
South has already acknowledged that this
is true this is a prominent they're
fixing it with a software update but as
with everything Microsoft we don't have
any specific date sets to win this is
going to happen so please leave us a
comment down below and tell us your
experience with the device and finally
for the very sad and terribly annoying
news of the day it is now confirmed that
a cyanogen mod installer application
that was recently launched the google
play store is now being told because
according to google it invites people to
void their warranty which is kind of odd
since you can install rom manager right
now and do pretty much the same thing
only it's not just focused on
cyanogenmod obviously and we kind of
tried to understand why is it that
Google being this you know free
open-source project with Android is now
blocking certain services it shouldn't
be that way but anyways you can still
side load the service there are links
down below for details on how to do it
but that makes you the question of the
day what do you think about google
blocking services like this i mean isn't
it supposed to be open source leave us a
comment down below because in the night
case it is really annoying i really
don't like it and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was still make
sure you follow us on parking i'll
comment subscribe to youtube channel as
well you'd also follow me on twitter
hein underscore to be beta please give
this video's done some if you like what
you saw I am hey meribella thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
