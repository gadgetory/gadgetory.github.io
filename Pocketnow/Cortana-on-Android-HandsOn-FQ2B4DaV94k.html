comes from the world of Halo great news
she's not confined to Windows Phone
anymore I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is a quick look at
Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant
for Android this is a pre-release
version of Cortana that was leaked
earlier today so while it's been widely
reported on and seems nearly complete
keep in mind that it's technically non
final we're using it on a Galaxy s6
active and we've seen reports of it
running well on the oneplus one and note
4 if you want to try it out we'll drop
the link in the description and download
it at your own risk as you might expect
Cortana on Android is an awful lot like
Cortana on Windows Phone in addition to
the voice prompt you now get a list of
items Cortana thinks you'll find useful
when you fire up the virtual assistant
like local news recommended news
trending stories based on readership and
your interests local weather movies
playing nearby and so on if it sounds an
awful lot like Google now it is except
while Google now often keeps its cards
to a minimum a Cortana
seems to err on the side of abundance
Cortana is also much more granular than
Google's assistant if you never want to
see finance or sports cards for example
you can turn them off which is nice you
can also edit your favorite places or
change how Cortana addresses you it's
all handled through Cortana's notebook
which syncs across devices using your
Microsoft or Outlook account this seems
to be a pretty close to final build
because Cortana works well on the SX
active you can set alarms by voice ask
her to show you what your appointment
calendar looks like ask her questions
about the universe
ask her what to do tonight and yeah ask
her to tell you a joke
what you can't do is some of the deeper
level stuff you can do on Windows Phone
like asking Cortana to remind you of
something the next time you talk to
someone specific in your address book or
asking her what song is playing on a
nearby radio you also can't launch her
via the hey Cortana voice command or by
using the HOME key but if you have a
phone with an assignable Hardware button
like this one you can use that at the
moment there's no support for Samsung's
multi window either but maybe that'll
change in a future release how well
Cortana will integrate into Android in
its final incarnation remains to be seen
again this is just a pre-release version
but considering its added granularity of
options and it's closer integration with
folks who prefer a Microsoft ecosystem
to a Google one well you can bet we'll
be revisiting that question again very
soon for more in-depth discussion of
Cortana on Android check out this week's
episode of the pocket non weekly podcast
and also see our recent Windows Phone
reviews at pocketnow.com till next time
this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow reminding you to take care of
your AI as she might just save you from
the Covenant one day thanks for watching
guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
