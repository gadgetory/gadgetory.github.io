been between big and beefy at the 10
inch size and small and portable down at
7 &amp;amp; 8 inches with the Xperia tablet Z
Sony looks to bridge the gulf with a
thin and light 10 inch tablet that's
also waterproof does it succeed let's
find out I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the sony xperia tablet z when we
first caught sight of the tablet Z at
MWC 2013 we were immediately smitten
sony had pierced our veil of disinterest
in 10-inch android tablets developing a
product that looked and felt beautiful
on the trade floor we wondered though
how much Hardware fit and finish was
required to overcome the 10 inch Android
stigma well we've spent over a week with
our own tablet z figuring that out so
let's dive in it's pretty tough to
properly showcase the Z on film as
viewed from the front it seems kind of
unremarkable a 10.1 inch 1920 by 1200
display dominates the frontside topped
by a 2 point 2 megapixel front-facing
camera and the sony logo some might find
the tablets ample bezel a little
excessive but it's a godsend for
one-handed usability more on that in a
second the back is even more Spartan
offering just the Xperia branding and an
NFC logo at the tap to share area with
the 8.1 megapixel primary camera hanging
out in the upper right corner the tablet
sees real story is found on its sides
the unit measures only 6.9 millimeters
thick that's a full two millimeters
thinner than Google's Nexus 10 yet sony
has still managed to cram a few
necessities along that slim stretch of
reflective material the left side plays
host to most of the action with a
pronounced power standby button sharing
space with a volume rocker headphone
jack and a notification LED nice touch
but speaker and micro USB ports a
microSD slot and an IR transmitter make
their homes on edges elsewhere these are
all covered by protective flaps to
preserve the device's IP 55 and 57 water
and dust resistance rating as long as
those covers are closed the tablet Z
won't mind sitting in fresh
water up to a meter deep for up to 30
minutes or being sprayed with water jets
from most any direction the screen won't
work while submerged but the device
won't be hurt that means users can take
the tablet Z on the boat or to the lake
without much worry and for such a thin
and light tablet that's quite an
accomplishment speaking of light the
tablet C weighs in at just 495 grams
compared to the Nexus 10 iPad 4 and the
surface RT all of which sit north of 600
grams on the scale combined with that
generous bezel the reassuring rigidity
and the comfortable soft touch back the
light weight makes using the tablet Z
one-handed not just possible but a
pleasure it's only calls the aesthetic
vision behind the tablet Z the Omni
balanced design but whatever its name it
succeeds brilliantly at providing the
portability of a 7-inch tablet with the
screen size of a 10-inch one and what
about that screen well the use of TFT
LCD over AMOLED would normally mean we
found colors less saturated on this
panel and blacks less deep
now while the latter is true the former
isn't colors really pop on this
quote-unquote
Reality Display and probably thanks to
Sony's Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 along with
a very colorful selection of pre-loaded
wallpapers nice move Sony visibility
does drop off quite a bit when viewing
the panel from the side especially
considering how glossy and susceptible
to fingerprints the tempered glass is
but it's still plenty watchable
it's just dimmer also in a very nice
touch the screen is unlockable via a
DoubleTap when turned off finally under
the hood powering the experience is a
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro at
1.5 gigahertz backed up by 2 gigs of RAM
and either 16 or 32 gigs of storage
expandable via microSD our unit is a
Wi-Fi only version though an LTE variant
is also available providing the juice to
keep the lights on a non-removable 6,000
milliamp hour battery that takes up most
of the space inside the unit powering
the tablet zeon reveals right away that
this isn't a stock google experience the
lockscreen disappears with a window
blind like effect and were dropped into
sony's special build of Android 4
- it looks similar to stock but with
some definite aesthetic and functional
differences chief among them the
location of the home back and
multitasking key is on the lower left
and the system status settings toggles
and Notification Center on the lower
right
this makes them handy for one thumb
access and it makes a lot more sense
than stock androids top-up screen
positioning there are also two
persistent shortcut keys at the midpoint
of the bottom row one calls up the
remote app so you can use the tablet Z
to control your TV cable box DVR or what
have you the other brings up a list of
utilities Sony calls small apps which
are you guessed at small-scale windowed
apps ranging in complexity from a
calculator all the way up to a
bare-bones browser it's a bit like the
pop up apps on Samsung tablets but on
the tablet Z only one title can be open
at a time that feels a little confining
but not nearly as bad as having no
multitasking option in the first place
if you don't like the existing selection
you can buy more small apps from the
Play Store or you can convert existing
app widgets into small apps the sony has
also included a suite of custom titles
it puts front and center on first power
on the album is fun to scroll through
and it includes the ability to sync with
Facebook Picasa and other photo
repositories movies not only hosts your
local video files but allows you to
throw them to other compatible devices
and it can also fetch details about
downloaded movies from the Internet the
Walkman app has a brand name that still
manages to inspire nostalgia but it's a
modern player for locally stored music
with large easy-to-use controls and
everything from a visualizer to a
shortcut option that lets you search for
lyrics music videos and artist info
across the web there's also social life
an aggregator a bit like a mash-up of
Flipboard and HTC blinkfeed that
displays news stories tweets and status
updates from your social streams it's a
fun novelty for a second but performance
issues plagued social life it's always
bogging down and jumping around and not
in the fun way
that's a problem that can be seen
throughout the tablet C's interface
actually even simple actions like
scrolling between home screens sometimes
results in lag and stutter behavior like
this is something we shouldn't be seeing
on a device of this class and it can get
pretty frustrating when a swipe is
interpreted as a tap or a homepage takes
forever to scroll by now it's entirely
possible Sony's own widgets are the lag
causing issue and removing them does
speed up the tablet
since AOSP is now available for the
tablet Z we can see why people would be
excited to load stock Android on this
thing but we're hesitant to recommend
throwing the baby out with the bathwater
here it's true that you might get more
responsiveness with stock jellybean on
this hardware but Sony's UI layer brings
a lot to the table ranging from fun
aesthetic touches to genuinely useful
additions like the repositioned buttons
small apps and the remote-control
utility the Sony's software also
includes some battery optimizations
which are very handy on a tablet this
thin with the battery only two-thirds
the size of the one on the Nexus 10
there's stamina mode which disables data
background actions and other activities
when the screen is off in the more
conventional low battery mode which
includes options to disable or hobble
certain features once total charge
reaches a certain low-power threshold
with our tablet Z polling to email and
three social media accounts plus a
variety of other services like Google
Voice we found that the unit usually
drained about 10% per 8 hour overnight
period with stamina mode turned on that
power drain fell to less than 5% drain
over night this isn't a tablet that
you'd bring with you into the forest for
a week with no charger but it packs
enough juice to last a few days with
moderate to heavy use and much longer
with more conservative habits the tablet
sees 8 megapixel primary camera defaults
to 5 megapixels out of the box
presumably to maintain a widescreen
aspect ratio and its field of view is
quite narrow forcing you to get far away
from a subject before you can capture it
all in the frame the results are about
what you'd expect for a tablet camera no
matter what lighting situation we come
away with fuzzy edges colors just a bit
off and a general sense of man
ramping up the resolution to 8
megapixels gives us a bit more detail
and toggling HDR on brings out the
mid-tones but it also brings out a gray
pallor video is similarly
middle-of-the-road
it's nice to be able to shoot in 1080p
but there's nothing outstanding here on
the bright side unless you're a fan of
ridicule you're probably going to be
using the tablet ZZZ camera less for
scenic photos and more for document
scanning barcode reading and the like
and at these tasks the camera will do
just fine
there are a bevy of options for
adjusting the optics and the
front-facing camera actually does quite
nicely in good lighting conditions
ensuring your Skype calls will go well
that's assuming you can hear one another
the tablet sees microphone might be a
bit too sensitive and it caused some
echo on the other end of video calls
during our testing the speakers on the Z
are also a little on the small side
despite their multiple corner ports in
media playback they're fine with s force
fronts around 3d producing a cool effect
but in Skype calls they're pretty quiet
you'll want to keep some Bluetooth or
wired headphones handy for communication
purposes unfortunately the tablet Z
plays nice with those to be clear the
Xperia tablet Z is still a 10-inch
Android tablet with all the failings of
that platform in that form-factor
the app situation is still mediocre with
most popular titles built for
smartphones and awkwardly stretched out
on the Z and some even forcing you into
the awkward portrait orientation the
Android tablet app problem is still a
very real handicap but as we've
speculated before it may take truly
beautiful Android tablet hardware to
motivate developers to code great
software to run on it and in that
department the tablet Z more than fits
the bill it's a thin lightweight
beautifully crafted piece of technology
that makes us want to overlook its
failings rather than dwell on them and
don't forget it's waterproof
while we wish its stock software were a
bit more responsive its battery a bit
bigger and its price a bit more
competitive this is still one of the
most
beautiful tablets we've ever handled and
one of the only Android ones we'd
consider buying at the 10 inch form
factor if you run your life on Google
and you're looking for a large but
portable tablet to extend your computing
needs on the go the Xperia tablet Z
deserves a long look we give it a solid
eight out of ten we'll have more in
depth thoughts on the tablet Z in our
written review available at
pocketnow.com starting June 3rd and in
the pocket now a weekly podcast and the
pocket now you review both available
