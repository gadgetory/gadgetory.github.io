year's iPhones along with some rumors of
improvements new renders of the huawei
mate 20 Pro just the verge then this
phone has our full attention and the
infamous Google pixel 3 XL was spotted
in Canada again along with some new
rumored launch dates
I'm hi I'm Eddie betta and I think the
only thing worse than the I don't know
how humid it is right now in New York is
having to shoot outside for another
video we have very soon this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with deals oh my god if you're in the
market for a really good phone but the
not so good camera that cost a lot more
than what they're selling it for Amazon
curly has I think it's the halo gray
exclusive for the essential phone for
223 bucks like this is one of those
things where it's like if I would rather
spend that money out on drinks or the
essential phone I would yeah I'll get
the essential phone I'll get the
essential phone but yeah you can learn
more in the description now for those of
you in the market to buy a chromecast we
are very close to an event from Google
at some point it always happens around
September October and it seems that the
company is already certifying a new one
at the FCC so chromecast's are
definitely probably one of the coolest
tools out there but I wonder exactly
what Google's bringing in next up so I
don't know you can buy now or stay tuned
I'm actually gonna wait it out and the
knotch has just taken over Canada it
seems at least that's what we say when
we talk about the Google pixel 3xl it
just showed up again on a train and you
know I've been scratching my head it's
very difficult for people you know for
regular people to be on a train and just
notice a phone that they don't know so
it just seems like if these leaks are
deliberate somebody just knows or you
know it's like if Google is pushing
these leaks out and yeah this phone
looks horrible but you know what the
problem is that it'll lunch and most of
us will want it that'll include me now
let's talk about wall way we've got some
very interesting leaks that just emerge
that show us two things number one the I
don't know the arrangement of the camera
in the back it could be Photoshop it
probably not
we see an l-shape for the cameras with a
flash at one point it's like four
cameras and one but it's actually I
assume three with a flash there could be
four I could be wrong but that's one
thing the second thing the knotch
at the front apparently is almost going
away there's still one but it's
insignificant and it's just wow so this
design actually looks really cool and
we're close to when Huawei will announce
the mix mate so I'm looking forward to
that and finally the hot new since I
have to do with the iPhone tens and a
couple of features that apparently will
get updated wireless charging on iPhones
is not quick it definitely isn't and
we've got rumors that the company is
going to actually boost from five watts
to seven point five there's even a rumor
that one of them will include some sort
of a mechanism that will allow it to go
even further
I assume that's gonna be the plus
variant but that's probably because it's
gonna take advantage of the fact that
this foam is gonna be a little thicker
those are interesting rumors for others
that have been asking when are we
getting this phone rumors were that the
event was gonna happen between September
11:30 12:00 now we hear from a more
trusted source that September 14th so
that's all fine and dandy it seems
iPhones for September 14th it's not
necessarily bad just remember that the
resale value for your iPhone is
currently at its best according to swap
ah you can definitely get the best
resale and then consider either buying
this new iPhone that's coming out or
barring current deals that are out there
whatever the case may be let me know in
the comments what do you think
September 14th faster wireless charging
are these things that you're interested
on because in my case I am I actually do
use where I was charging now leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
