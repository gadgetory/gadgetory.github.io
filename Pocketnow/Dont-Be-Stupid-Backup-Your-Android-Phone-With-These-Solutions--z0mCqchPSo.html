just in case losing everything is never
fun I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and these are a few solutions for how
you can backup your Android smartphone
earlier this week I went over several
different ways you can backup your
iPhone if you're an Android user you're
also in luck there are plenty of options
for syncing all of your information from
Android the first time you turn on your
device you are prompted to sign into
your Google account from there you are
given the option to sync all sorts of
different content calendars Drive gmail
contacts and even pictures to Google
Plus but on the background Google also
syncs your Wi-Fi passwords and all sorts
of other information and it's a little
ambiguous you can't really tell upfront
exactly what's being synced and you
can't control it you can either turn it
off or on and there's no way to pick and
choose beyond the account syncs all of
your purchased and previously downloaded
applications are in the Play Store
anything you purchase from Google Play
as far as movies music or anything else
are also stored in the cloud your
contacts are also synced through Google
and if you choose you can also export
those contacts directly to your phone
storage and you can import contacts that
have previously been exported Google
social network allows you to instantly
upload your pictures and those pictures
can also be synced to your photo album
but like on iOS you can also sync your
information elsewhere I personally use
Dropbox to upload all of the pictures
taken with my phone's camera the main
idea behind Google's backup options is
that when you buy a new phone the first
time you turn it on all you have to do
is log into your Google account and all
of your information is there contacts
calendars you name it but custom
interfaces and modifications tend to
make Google's backup options go haywire
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
and it hasn't always been exactly
reliable and age-old and probably the
most reliable way to backup your Android
phone is called an Android backup it
requires root access and a custom
recovery something to the effect of
clockworkmod and all you have to do is
reboot your phone into recovery find the
backup and restore option and choose
either backup or backup to an external
sd card hit the power button to select
and wait it may take forever to backup
but the benefit of this is that when you
need it all you have to do is go back
into the recovery and restore the image
in the
also take a lot of time but it restores
the phone exactly to how it was before a
problem with nandroid is that say you
don't need to restore the entire image
all you need is the application data or
something to that effect
that's where titanium comes into play
problem is it also requires root access
if your phone is not rooted you can't
use titanium and you can't use it to
back up your applications so it is
effectively useless to anyone who isn't
rooted however there is actually a new
application that is also from the people
who created ClockworkMod it is called
Carbon not to be mistaken with the
Twitter application and it backs up all
of your applications and your
application data and stores it to drive
a computer or a local storage you can
also schedule backups to happen whenever
you need them this takes a little time
as well especially if you have a lot of
applications but it does the trick
you're not going to lose any of your
applications if you backup using carbon
there is a light version of carbon that
is free or you can buy the premium
version for $4.99 clearly when it comes
to backing up Android devices there's no
shortage of options there are options
for route users people who aren't rooted
and everyone in between Google's
built-in options do pretty well there is
no reason to worry about losing contacts
and your pictures are uploaded directly
to Google Plus so they're safe as well
but if you need more such as application
backup with data or even a system image
there's an option for you if this video
