on location with my galaxy nexus gsm
variety it's running cyanogenmod 10
nightly and of course that means it's
rooted and i can go ahead and do
whatever I want with it in this case
I've been able to pull down the camera /
gallery app from android 4.2 the new
flavor of jelly bean which explains why
i have two camera icons let's go ahead
and fire it up opens up pretty quick you
can see it's a lot cleaner it occupies
the entire screen and if I want to get
into settings I just tap somewhere and
go it's kind of hard to do that because
when you want something your thumbs over
the top of it so you don't know exactly
what you're on until you move off of it
so you I might might be a little bit
confusing or hard to use but we'll see
how that works out taking pictures is
super fast and focus nice little focus
animation but I know what you guys want
to see is the new panorama mode we've
got our camera our video camera the
traditional panorama which is still
there then that new in photosphere let's
go ahead and fire that up this lets you
take fully immersive photos and its
really kind of cool and quick so you can
see I've got an aperture here with a
little target and a blue dot wants me to
align that to start I'm going to do this
kind of quick to show you how fast you
can do it it aligns and then we just
walk around in this circle not touching
the screen not touching anything it does
it all for me and this part can get a
little tedious because obviously it's a
lot of pictures to make this whole
sphere and go up a little bit
and you can go somewhat quickly it's
hard balancing two cameras and doing
this at the same time though once you go
up in the air obviously the number of
pictures to complete the sphere reduces
and when we come back down to the ground
if I can keep this in frame and it does
the same thing there as well once you
know where that track line is you can go
somewhat fast and of course you don't
have to take the entire sphere you can
take just a section of it you know like
a full 360 degree in one dimension
horizontal panorama you could do but
there I've gone ahead and taken
everything I'm going to hit the blue
stop button and it's going to start
rendering that now so if I swipe over
here you can see I've got this little
blank rendering panorama thing here's
that picture that I just took and a
couple of the panoramas that I took
earlier so we can go in and do all kinds
of cool stuff with that I'm going to
give you a link to where you can see
some of these over at pocketnow.com i'm
also going to show you the files that
you need with links and walk you through
the process so you can get this up and
running on your own rooted jellybean 4.1
point something phone if you like what
you saw make sure you give the video a
big thumbs up for pocket now I'm Joe
Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
