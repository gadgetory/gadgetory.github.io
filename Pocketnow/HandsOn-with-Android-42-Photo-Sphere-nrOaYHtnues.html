on location with my galaxy nexus gsm
variety it's running CyanogenMod 10
nightly and of course that means it's
rooted and I can go ahead and do
whatever I want with it in this case
I've been able to pull down the camera
slash gallery app from Android 4.2 the
new flavor of jelly bean which explains
why I have two camera icons let's go
ahead and fire it up it opens up pretty
quick you can see it's a lot cleaner it
occupies the entire screen and if I want
to get into settings I just tap
somewhere and go it's kind of hard to to
do that because when you want something
your thumbs over the top of it so you
don't know exactly what you're on until
you move off of it so you I might might
be a little bit confusing or hard to use
but we'll see how that works out taking
pictures is super fast and focus nice
little focus animation but I know what
you guys want to see is the new panorama
mode we've got our camera our video
camera the traditional panorama which is
still there then that new in photosphere
let's go ahead and fire that up this
lets you take fully immersive photos and
it's really kind of cool and quick so
you can see I've got an aperture here
with a little target and a blue dot
wants me to align that to start I'm
gonna do this kind of quick to show you
how fast you can do it it aligns and
then we just walk around in this circle
not touching the screen not touching
anything it does it all for me and this
part can get a little tedious because
obviously there's a lot of pictures to
make this whole sphere and go up a
little bit
and you can go somewhat quickly it's
hard balancing two cameras and doing
this at the same time though once you go
up in the air obviously the number of
pictures to complete the sphere reduces
and when we come back down to the ground
if I can keep this in frame and it does
the same thing there as well once you
know where that track line is you can go
somewhat fast and of course you don't
have to take the entire sphere you can
take just a section of it you know like
a full 360 degree in one dimension
horizontal panoramas you could do but
there I've gone ahead and taken
everything I'm gonna hit the blue stop
button and it's gonna start rendering
that now so if I swipe over here you can
see I've got this little blank rendering
panorama thing here's that picture that
I just took and a couple of the
panoramas that I took earlier so we can
go in and do all kinds of cool stuff
with that I'm gonna give you a link to
where you can see some of these over at
pocketnow.com I'm also going to show you
the files that you need with links and
walk you through the process so you can
get this up and running on your own
rooted jelly bean 4.1 point something
phone if you liked what you saw make
sure you give the video a big thumbs up
for pocket now I'm Joe Levi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
