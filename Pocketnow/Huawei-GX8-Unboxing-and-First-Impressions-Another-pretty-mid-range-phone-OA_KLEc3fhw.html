to its North American lineup and it's
definitely a looker but before we can
put this golden beauty through its paces
we have to get it out of the box I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
here's our first impressions on the
Huawei gx8 really interesting packaging
folks the phone is cradled sideways in
the Box flanked by the papers we never
read in a pack containing the AC adapter
micro USB cable and a pair of really
cheap earbuds no seriously these just
kind of feel like a waste Apple earpods
style buds which do a terrible job of
blocking out surrounding noise in your
environment if you want to listen to
music on your phone for the sake of your
hearing health I'd highly recommend
picking up a cheap pair of buds or cans
which can do a better job of sealing up
your ear canal back to the phone though
Huawei again impresses with a wonderful
build quality that could easily pass for
a flagship phone the GX 8 is almost
identical to the International version
called the g8 for some reason we
Americans get a super edgy X in the name
but it doesn't signify any significant
difference which we could uncover the
specs are pretty common territory in
this price range
our review unit came packin ache welcome
6-1-6 chipset with two gigabytes of RAM
16 gigabytes of storage and a 3000
milliamp hour battery at the unlocked
price of 299 dollars this is $100 more
than its little brother the honor 5x
which we recently reviewed for that
extra cash we get a nicer aluminium
shell softer corners and edges a
graceful taper to the rear casing and
the seams are terrifically finished in a
way we didn't see on the honor 5x it's
less boxy and fits in the hand a little
easier considering both phones have the
same 5.5 inch sized screen we also see
improvements to the camera adding
Hardware optical image stabilization to
the 13 megapixel sensor we can see this
results in a larger module but it
doesn't push the camera lens cover out
with too awkward of a bulge the top of
the phone has the headphone jack and
secondary microphone and Huawei loves
drilling holes into the bottoms of these
phones though we only get one speaker on
the right-hand side of the device unlike
the honor 5x there's only a single pin
tool tray for SIM cards in the memory
card slot you can use this tray for
either 2 Sims or to have a sim in a
microSD card
but you can't have all three at the same
time and of course the fantastic
fingerprint sensor returns just setting
it up now in training a couple fingers
Huawei still has one of the fastest and
most accurate solutions for biometric
unlocking found on any phone let alone
on a mid-range er the initial first boot
did take a bit longer than expected but
thankfully we have a minimum of setup
software to troll through while logging
into our accounts but then we get into
the software huawei's emui skin is one
of my least favorite ways to use an
Android device this iPhone inspired
organizational style a phone without an
app drawer just feels cluttered mixing
app shortcuts and widgets and we have an
iOS layout for the notification shade
and the quick access menu from the
lockscreen all of this is running on top
of android 5.1 so thankfully you can
install a different launcher but a new
ish phone in this day and age we'd
certainly have appreciated a marshmallow
update Huawei's theme does match the
phone hardware really well though golden
icons for pre-installed apps is a sharp
look when viewed opposite the golden
phone body the skin two icons look
classy but it does kind of fall apart
once you start installing more apps
happily it's another mid-range ER which
doesn't hit you too hard with
pre-installed value-added software COFF
COFF bloatware COFF COFF facebook
twitter Emmas on music Kindle and the up
health tracker are the only apps outside
of Huawei and Google services you might
need to ignore or uninstall but now
begins the testing period as we put this
phone through its paces there's a lot we
can predict with this hardware things
like gaming prowess but will we see much
lifestyle functional difference over
other less expensive phones and how
might this beauty compete against more
expensive fashionable mid-range errs
like the HTC One a9 which sells for $200
more stay tuned folks our full review of
the huawei GX 8 will be on the way soon
