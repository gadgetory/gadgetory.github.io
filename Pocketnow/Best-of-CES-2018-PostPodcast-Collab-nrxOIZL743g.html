tell you who I am first how about that
hi my name is Mira I'm let me throw this
out
really
hey there it's Jules Wong with pocket
now I'm with Honolulu CES 2018 is pretty
much over and I'll be traveling so much
that I will not be able to get you a
pocket out daily today but you know what
we just came out of the mobile tech
podcast and we did it with a couple of
the people that I admire the most in
this industry so we decided to put up
the very first ever collaboration video
that we've ever done in pocket now and
let's talk about the best of CES 2018
I'm high metairie better with pocket now
let's get to it
hey I'm Nicole Scott for mobile geeks
and my favorite thing about CES is
seeing all of my friends and the fact
that if I didn't come I'd have extreme
float FOMO and probably have high
anxiety and died because honestly I get
to see cool things like project Linda
from Razer that probably won't come to
market and if I didn't come here I
wouldn't get to have hands-on and then
it's the time of the year where I can
identify new trends that I need to like
keep an eye out for in six months time
when there's real products so stuff like
digital assistants or drones that will
track me through the crowd or that
really creepy sex doll stand hi my name
is Mira I'm the host of the mobile tech
podcast it's mobile tech podcast.com my
favorite thing of CES was I think so far
at least the FLIR cameras incorporating
various devices at the flare booth they
had smart glasses and they had a tablet
and a bunch of other stuff very very
interesting and you know I've I've yet
to see all of it so stay tuned for more
everybody it's Michael Fisher aka mr.
mobile and formerly a pocket now hi
again my favorite thing about CES is
weird stuff and for me there was nothing
weirder this year than the Gemini from
Planet computers which is a new PDA for
2018 it's from an alternate dimension
where PDAs never died personal digital
assistants it's not a smartphone
replacement but you can use it as a
smartphone it's like a miniature laptop
except it's really miniature and I'm
really excited using it the real world
really I just like to see new form
factors or old form factors resurrected
for modern times and CES is a really fun
place to see people try to do that
the Gemini is shipping now though so I'm
gonna be reviewing it soon come pay me a
visit and try and convince hi mate to
review it as well hi I'm Nick grave the
hi-tech traveler you can find me on
youtube youtube.com slash the hi-tech
traveller CES 2018 probably my favorite
thing was the synaptic fingerprint
sensor that goes below the display it's
not a gadget itself it's just the
component but it's actually gonna change
the way our smartphones look and feel
over the next couple years as more
manufacturers in core
paraded into their devices you won't
have that fingerprint sensor below the
display anymore or on the back so it's
kind of a game changer for me I also
enjoyed you know taking a couple test
drives and electric cars and everything
like that but those have been coming for
a while but yeah definitely the
synaptics fingerprint sensor that goes
below the display game changer for me
2018 hi there this is Theo Schwar
producer at mobile tech podcast hosted
by Miriam Schwar having another great
CES definitely the theme this year was
Google assistant all the things home
automation all the things and party all
the things
hey there it's Jules Wong with Jaime
Rivera at pocket now and this is my
first CES and it's been exciting I think
the most intriguing thing I can't say
it's the best thing because I'm still
looking for that best thing but it's
probably the project Gemini PDA it was a
little unique thing you open up it's a
clamshell PDA the keyboard is a little
iffy but the concept I think is pretty
sound and you know what
hey if it's there and if it's ready to
go and people actually like it maybe
they'll see success so yes it's kind of
a tumbleweed or just you know getting
people onto these things so we'll see so
for my favorite gadget of CES 2018
believe it or not it's going to have to
be project Linda from Razer and the
reason why is because I've actually been
wanting this form factor in this concept
for the longest time the idea of having
a smartphone that extends to become a
laptop or a tablet or whatever you want
it to be and I feel that companies have
tried this over and over have fumbled I
feel that Razer has found the most
elegant way to pull it off it's not
perfect and I hate the fact that it's a
concept but a lot of the things about
CES remain concepts they never really
launched that would be me we would love
to know what you think hi mate are you
going to cut this at all
longest time somebody to grab it is
closed actually awesome friends how
