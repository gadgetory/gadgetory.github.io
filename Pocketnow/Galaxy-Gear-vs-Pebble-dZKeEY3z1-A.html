of the tech sector wearable computing is
a market poised on the brink of
blast-off and that explosion has already
begun with the popularization of the
SmartWatch on Pocket now's comparison
table today are the two principal
reasons for the new categories relative
popularity the Kickstarter facilitated
pebble smartwatch and the new Samsung
Galaxy gear which of these is a better
fit for your wrist let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Samsung Galaxy gear versus
pebble smartwatch
it doesn't take a long look to see that
these are devices built for completely
different purposes and maybe completely
different people the hardware bears this
out with the polycarbonate pebble making
up the minimalist half of this duo it's
backlit ePaper display is black and
white it's got a fairly low resolution
and refresh rate but it's also on all
the time meaning you don't need to press
a button to wake it up despite that it
just barely sips power from the watch's
lipo battery the pebble only needs to be
charged every four to seven days
depending on your usage and it comes
bundled with a proprietary magnetic
connector for that purpose it's also
waterproof and are almost daily usage
over the past six months has shown it to
be a simple but durable device on the
flip side sits Samsung which has
predictably packed every possible
feature into its first modern SmartWatch
the Galaxy gear is nearly twice as heavy
as the pebble but the added bulk works
to its advantage combining with its
steel and sapphire construction to give
it the perception of a higher quality
device it offers a Super AMOLED
touchscreen that's bigger and much more
colorful than the pebbles but that's
just the start
it also comes packin a spec sheet that
wouldn't be out of place on a low-end
smartphone from a year ago in addition
to a 720p camera in the wristband and a
speaker microphone combination for
taking voice calls on your wrist the
Galaxy gears ad campaign is built upon
nostalgia for the futuristic watches of
yesteryear and the gear packs everything
Samsung thinks it needs to achieve that
that means the gears software experience
is much much more elaborate than the
pebbles where the pebble is essentially
a second screen for your smartphone
showing you notifications as they come
in and that's about it the gear is
better characterized as a fully
fleshed-out accessory with the
beginnings of an entire ecosystem of
apps and mini apps of course pebbles got
an SDK of its own and developers have
already created a bevy of custom watch
faces and apps but the gears added
capabilities like voice input mean you
can do more with it
a good example besides the obvious phone
calling is the ability to record voice
memos or to reply to a text message via
voice dictation and the camera can be
used for some really compelling and
useful features like on-the-fly language
transcription just don't plan on using
those added features with anything other
than a Samsung device one of the gears
biggest handicaps is that you need a
Galaxy Note or a galaxy s4 to use it and
even then you need to be running the
latest Android version by contrast the
pebble will work with just about any
Android smartphone or iPhone but
ironically because of samsung's
customized software it doesn't exactly
play nice with Galaxy devices the pebble
comes out on top and areas other than
compatibility while less impressive on
paper the smaller device actually
delivers a better experience in terms of
the core feature any SmartWatch needs to
succeed notifications pebble has no
trouble displaying pretty much any
notification you throw at it from
vanilla options like SMS and email to
Facebook Instagram and hangout alerts
and you can even preview most of those
messages right on the watch not so with
the Galaxy gear sure messages that come
in via either the stock SMS or email
apps can be previewed but alerts coming
from third-party apps and we're talking
major titles like Facebook or Gmail
offer just a disappointing icon and an
invitation to read the message on your
phone considering the whole reason
behind wearing a SmartWatch is to avoid
taking the phone out of your pocket in
the first place that's a pretty major
oversight and it makes using the gear
less enjoyable then
sense than using the pebble that's
compounded by pebble superiority in
little details like better Bluetooth
range reliable backlight illumination
and changeable watch band and in more
major areas like the gears lack of water
resistance where the pebble is a watch
you can knock around and wash dishes and
shower with and generally not worry
about banging up the gear is much more a
fancy watch something you treat with kid
gloves that's a pretty good summation of
the relationship between these products
actually since you'll need to be
charging it in its special cradle nearly
every night you're constantly reminded
that the galaxy gear is more of a
high-maintenance accessory rather than
the rough-and-tumble
pebble watch the gear wins a lot of
points for its elaborate feature set and
its superior build but the pebble for
now it actually fulfills the fundamental
role of a SmartWatch better that plus
it's wider compatibility and the fact
that it retails for half the price of
the gear make the pebble the smarter
watch to buy if you own anything except
a high-end Galaxy smartphone if you'd
