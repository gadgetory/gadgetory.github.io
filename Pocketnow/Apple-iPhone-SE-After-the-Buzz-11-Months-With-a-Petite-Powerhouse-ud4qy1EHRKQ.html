phone comes out we all rush to review it
a bunch of folks will try to say if it's
worth it after a couple days then we all
rush out to review the next new phone
how phone ages is as important as that
out of the box experience so let's do
something about that released in March
of last year Apple attempted a second
try at a mid-range phone and reactions
were mixed nearly a year later how has
this mikeymouse held up it's time for
our iPhone se after the buzz
let's get part of the verdict out of the
way right now the iPhone se is my
personal favorite Apple product of 2016
for all the jokes about the iPhone
snooze edition this is a terrifically
executed gadget expertly targeted at a
specific demographic judged on those
merits it's one of the most successful
smartphones that Apple has ever built
the iPhone 5s was the culmination of
Apple's small form-factor phones
released before creeping up the screen
size on the iPhone 6 a blend of metal
and glass recalling the sharp modern
lines of the iPhone 4 but with a more
durable rear case Apple recycled that
design exactly here and it's held up
well I was happy to find an old 5s case
in a drawer so admittedly the SE has
spent most of its time in this bumper
but screen and cameras are still looking
clean all of the improvements are
internal throwing in the chipset and
camera found in the iPhone 6s like
taking an old popular roadster and
dropping in a modern engine this phone
is a screamer and it's become my
preferred platform for running iOS betas
now on iOS 10.3 we benefit from Apple's
latest features and for a mid-range ur
have not experienced any significant
slowdown as situation often found with
slightly older phones running more
demanding software for phones released
in 2016 we miss precious few of the
omitted features found in the iPhone 7
when looking at on-the-go use I really
can't remember the last time I used
peaking or popping so it's not been much
of an issue on the SE losing that taptic
feedback also means this phone has a
built-in headphone jack a slightly
higher quality headphone jack over the
iPhone 7 dongle for folks on cabled
headphones this is a happy compromise to
make you can use 3.5 millimeter or
lightning and moving over to bluetooth
means you'll experience the exact same
audio quality is any higher priced
iPhone like the iPhone 6s it's the more
complete solution for legacy and future
headphone audio the camera is still
terrifically competitive losing a little
in low-light performance against the
hardware stabilization on the iPhone 7
but delivering apples characteristic
post-processing excellent HDR and
wonderfully smooth UHD video this is all
tied up in software which is just better
designed for smaller screens as iPhones
have gotten larger iOS hasn't really
evolved to address bigger hardware we
might have mocked older iPhone
Hershel your thumb reaches from here to
here but Apple wasn't really wrong top
corner mounted controls sure gestures
can replace most of that interaction but
the visual indicator is in a location
you can't really reach on a plus if you
have normal sized hands Apple screen
shrink helps vertically but provides no
one-handed benefit reaching across the
phone the SE suffers none of this and
offers one of the best one thumb
experiences the smartphone world has
ever seen even the battery life has held
up well for such a small cell a year
later the SE can still largely keep up
with most flagships training about 6
percent and immediate at streaming 30
minutes of video over Wi-Fi at 190 lux
this phone isn't designed to be a
multimedia or gaming champ
though this chipset chews up future
fight better than almost all high-end
Android phones in the hands of its
target demo it's an all-day champ at
keeping people connected and interacting
in short bursts to get work done there
are of course bombers we absolutely
appreciate the stereo speakers on the
newest iPhones and enhanced water
resistance delivers more peace of mind
but the biggest bummer with the SE is
storage a base-model phone with 16
gigabytes was a tight fit in 2015 let
alone now it certainly has a chilling
effect on how often you shoot that
high-quality UHD video now this is
extremely competitive price territory
but a $50 jump for 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage keeps this phone close
to the current crop of premium mid
Ranger's there's still an Apple tax at
play of course but it's not completely
out of step with what the market can
bear here so let's wrap this up 11
months later where does that leave us
with the iPhone se to finish my verdict
from the top of this video Apple is
building a bum reputation for its vision
of progress and how it supports industry
standards the ones cohesive ecosystem is
a little disjointed at the moment
removing headphone jacks on phones but
keeping them on laptops USBC on mac
books but USB a cables included with the
iPhone rumors pointing to a new
accessory port it's easy to see why
there's been a bit of frustration in
Apple and so when I say that this is one
of the most successful phones Apple has
ever produced we obviously don't mean in
terms of overall sales or in terms of
breaking new ground Apple executives saw
the remainder of a market
folks still buying lower-cost smaller
iPhone 5 and built a product
specifically targeted at that
demographic while still being able to
support future software balancing those
improvements against costs the SE
absolutely nails what it sets out to do
satisfy a legacy market it's not a
sustainable market and we probably won't
see a refresh to this exact same form
factor again but for the moment it's a
jewel of a gadget folks who enjoy tech
life on the bleeding edge should
rightfully ignore this phone but we all
know people friends family who hold onto
phones longer or don't need the most
robust multimedia platform or just don't
want to buy new cases or car mounts the
iPhone se is a terrific solution for
them as always thanks so much for
