device is powered by the Android
operating system is the ability to route
them and run custom roms I'm Joe Levi
for Pocket now this is a look at
CyanogenMod 11 for the nexus 5 this is
my Nexus 5 and until I undertook this
project to move over to CyanogenMod I've
been running stock and I've been really
happy with the stock version of Android
that comes with the device it's been
really good to me however I am a custom
ROM err and I love CyanogenMod so I went
ahead and loaded up the milestone 1
release of CyanogenMod 11 and had all
kinds of problems with it
however the December 9th and December
10th Knightley's haven't had any
problems to speak up so far these are
still Knightley's it's unstable you're
gonna run into some issues some bugs and
whatnot app crashes overall not a
problem however the m1 all kinds of
problems at least for me so let's go
ahead and take a look around the first
thing you are going to get when you fire
up your device in the morning is your
launcher and this is the regular Google
Experience launcher as you can see here
we can even say ok Google is it going to
snow today
I've got my sound turned off so it's not
going to speak to us but it would it
works great it does everything that it's
supposed to absolutely love it another
thing that you're going to notice is
when you turn the power on and you have
this lock you now have the ability to
quick unlock into various different
activities or just do a straight unlock
you also have that ability now with the
Google launcher you've kind of had that
in the past with CyanogenMod roms so you
can add shortcuts here to either side
though I haven't set them up yet so
let's go ahead and take a look in the
settings and see what we have first of
all here is our toggles you can see it
quite a bit more information here if we
switch over to the other side you can
see I've also got those quick toggles
across the top here this is an option
that I did turn on we'll walk through
really quickly kind of where to see that
this also mirrors these so you don't
have to maintain them in two different
places really really kind of nice and
kind of does away with the need for your
toggles because you can quick toggle to
them anyway moving into settings let's
start off first and foremost with home
you can select either a launcher which
is what I've selected or launcher three
which we're not going to go into much in
this video next is the lock screen where
you can go in and set your slider
shortcuts if you don't like what comes
prepackaged you can set your own you can
set up your widgets for C lock your
clock and alarm weather panel your
calendar events and whatnot set those up
you can maximize your widgets or go in
and allow multiple widget pages to be
added and selected to your lock screen
so a lot of the stuff that we've seen
before themes now making an entry into
CyanogenMod 11 and KitKat this is stuff
that we've been used to since what back
in CyanogenMod 9 maybe even before with
the the t-mobile theme er that they open
sourced and built into CyanogenMod I
don't have any other themes to show you
here but it works just exactly the same
select which one you want apply and then
you can get all of your different colors
and whatnot your themes it's beautiful
it does what it's supposed to do it's
great moving on into interface we can
change stuff in the status bar I've
chosen up here that I want my battery
style to be a circle with a percent the
default is just circle this looks very
empty I suspect they're going to fill it
up with the other stuff from previous
versions of CyanogenMod we'll see that
as it progresses quick pull down all
this other stuff Auto close just let you
look through here and see what you can
get in the quick settings panel
notification drawers kind of the same
thing Auto close behavior expanded
desktop which I have turned off buttons
and layout so you can change the buttons
down at the bottom or the order of them
if you want and quick launch shortcuts
and this is what I was talking about so
you can add a a quick launch for for
that one we'll just do torch because
it's quick and then we can turn our
flashlight on just that simple okay
let's move on to the next one buttons we
can change the way that the buttons
behave
menu we can make it show the reboot menu
screenshots a whole bunch of other stuff
right there it's very nice of course I
don't have expanded desktop enabled so
it's not going to show us that playback
control with a long press of the volume
button we can essentially just move
through the tracks that are playing so
very nice we don't even have to turn on
the device or turn on the screen
to control music reorient the volume
buttons don't you hate it when you tip
your phone and now the volume slider and
the volume buttons are opposite of one
another well CyanogenMod ah so - and now
you can reorient those that's what I've
done so it more closely matches what it
should be that again is to carry over
from previous versions as well profiles
also from previous versions of
CyanogenMod lets you go in and set up
default rules for default locations so
home work train car whatever you want to
do you can even set up a custom one
Church if you will that will turn on and
off various things you can have it turn
on Bluetooth turn off Bluetooth leave
whatever the status is alone all kinds
of cool stuff that you can do in there
and you can even assign an NFC tag to do
that quick toggle which is something
that we've shown you here at pocket now
in the past you do have a new account
it's a CyanogenMod account this is what
you use to send all of your metrics and
your user statistics over if you've
opted into that stuff you do have to
sign in or sign up for that or skip
through it when you set up your device
the first time which if you're familiar
with CyanogenMod 10.2 some of the later
versions incorporated that changes as
well I've already gone in and tapped on
this to be a developer so I'll show you
the the developer options in the
performance stuff in just a minute this
is Android 4.4.1 even though 4.4.2 was
just released yesterday or today
depending on when you're watching this
video of course it may have been a
little while ago but we should see an
update to 4.4.2 somewhat soon if you
want to get updates
here's that updates panel just like
we've seen before and then here's your
statistics that are tied back into your
CyanogenMod account so let's go into
developer options
most of the stuff here is pretty much
what you'll see with regular versions of
Android
the the performance however is where you
can go in and do all kinds of fun stuff
like change your CPU governor I like to
do on-demand and you can set your
minimum and maximum frequencies though
for some reason doesn't seem to be
restoring those settings on boot or at
least not restoring this interface at
boot so every time I come back in it
goes back to whatever it was before
though I think it still respects that
minimum threshold just a little torque
that we've seen in previous versions of
CyanogenMod that they'll need to work on
as they progress io scheduler and I
leave this alone defaults to see if
queue and memory management which I turn
on there's not all of the other memory
management options in here like previous
versions of CyanogenMod at least not yet
we'll probably see more as the the ROM
progresses but turn that on reboot to
allow purging of assets and then if you
want to to drop down your screen
resolution transparency a bit you can
speed it up at the cost of some graphic
quality by by selecting that as you can
see not all the features that you're
used to in that signage in my ten point
X roms have made it over into the
CyanogenMod 11 ROM that's okay it's
still very very early we just passed
milestone 1 there adding in features and
making them work with the new KitKat
infrastructure if you liked what you saw
here why not throw the video a thumbs up
and of course make sure you subscribed
if you have not done so already doing so
keeps you up to date with all that's new
and happening in the world of mobile
technology while you're at it why don't
you share this video with your friends
on your favorite social media networks
my favorite is Twitter where we are at
Puckett now and I am at Joe Levi thank
you very much for watching we'll catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
