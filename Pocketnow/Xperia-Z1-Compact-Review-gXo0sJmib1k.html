you that's the tagline Sony uses on its
website to promote the Xperia z1 compact
and the message is seductive big power
without the need for a big casing it's
something we've long called for and now
Sony is saying it's here so how does the
Xperia z1 compact deliver let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Sony
Xperia z1 compact as we mentioned in our
comparison video earlier in the week
this device comes to us on loan from our
friends at clove technology and we thank
them for the review unit if this phone
seems like something you'd like to take
home follow our example visit clove code
at UK linked in the description and
order one for yourself now compact might
not be the sexiest brand name we've ever
heard of but if nothing else it's
accurate this incarnation of Sony's
premium smartphone line maintains the
glass sandwich build of its bigger
siblings but Slim's the casing down to
much more palm friendly dimensions the
only thing that suffers as a result is
the screen size which had 4.3 inches is
smaller than most modern flagships but
that's the only real hit against it at
720p it makes for a pixel density of 342
PPI which on a screen like this is more
than enough plus we're happy to see that
Sony has finally fixed its off-axis
visibility problem
this display is vibrant from almost any
angle
beneath that screen is one of the very
best power plants you can find in a
smartphone today Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
it's backed up by the usual suspects in
terms of GPU RAM and storage options and
the whole thing is wrapped up in a
shadow resistant casing that feels much
more solid than its 137 grams would
suggest it's available in several colors
but the classic black with gunmetal trim
is quite striking while the port covers
on the sides are just as cumbersome and
clunky as ever there is small price to
pay for the phones water and dust
resistance a capability that in 2014 is
still more rare than it should be and
though the phone is one of the
easiest to dirty up with skin oil and
pocket-lint it's bare chassis is pretty
enough that you probably won't want to
cover it up with a case looks feel
pocket ability power Sony is in great
form with the z1 compacts hardware the
company is no slouch in software either
at least in terms of aesthetics yes this
is skinned Android which means that yes
we're looking at an older software build
with delayed updates and all the other
sacrifices that come with it but what
you get in exchange isn't some
stuttering mishmash of nonsense it's
pretty it's cohesive and it almost never
bogs down even when the phone is doing a
lot of work in the background that said
we do have some complaints some apps
which run very well on other Android
phones don't do so well on Sony's skin
Google Maps in particular crashes pretty
routinely which is annoying the hardware
camera key is a great shortcut for
launching the camera right from standby
but sometimes it just doesn't work and
Chrome has a strange bug that results in
random zooming unless you're using the
very tip of your finger all the time
these are oddities we also encountered
on the Xperia z1s so it seems pretty
clear that Sony's skin across the whole
line could use an update here's hoping
that update doesn't change the camera
dumb because this thing is a joy to
shoot with from the fun to the practical
the compact has it all bundled up in an
easy-to-use viewfinder and though
there's no oh is the digital
stabilization makes for a very smooth
shooting experience on screen it's all
wonderfully thought-out and executed
Sony's also put a lot of work into
solving its image quality problems of
the past the compacts 20.7 megapixel
camera defaults to an over sampled 8
megapixels out of the box but you can
shoot in full resolution using manual
mode it's a shame that mode doesn't
offer more tweak ability we especially
miss manual focus but you'll probably be
better served by superior auto anyway
this automatic mode does a very nice job
tailoring the camera settings for
different lighting situations
and the digital noise that was
characteristic of Sony smartphones has
really really been toned down here it's
still there if you look hard enough
particularly in low-light shots where
the device is apparently doing a lot of
post-processing so we're still not in
lumia territory here you'll probably
want to switch to manual mode to try
amping up the exposure rather than
resorting to the flash in low-light
situations the so-called flash bleed
problem doesn't show up in every shot
but it's definitely there in some in
camcorder mode the compact is impressive
automatic shooting and good lighting
produces video that's a pleasure to look
at colors are well balanced automatic
adjustments are speedy and sound capture
is a little muddled compared to other
devices but it's clear enough for most
situations
underwater video comes out crisp and
clean with the autofocus still nice and
snappy just like the still shot if
you've watched our camera test of the
Xperia z1s this won't come as a surprise
it's the same hardware and it does just
as good a job here Sony's claim of the
best camera on a waterproof compact
smartphone is awfully narrow but as far
as we can see it's also spot-on for
full-size versions of these photos and
many more shots see our full review at
pocket now linked in the description
below we tested the z1 compact over a 6
day period between Massachusetts and
Maine on t-mobile's 3 and 4G networks we
didn't run into many reception problems
and battery life was reasonably solid
though it varied a little more than
we're used to seeing on its first charge
we used it quite heavily and it endured
for over 10 hours but that kind of
endurance wasn't consistent possibly due
to our office being in a fringe coverage
area voice calls were quite nice on our
end with crisp loud side tone and plenty
of ear piece volume though callers
didn't seem to understand us quite as
well as when we used other phones gaming
as you might expect with a Snapdragon
800 inside is excellent about the only
place the z1 compact is truly
underwhelming is in its speakerphone
even when bone-dry it's a thin sounding
tinny little module that's easy to
accidentally block with the finger
despite that huge grill with a price tag
north of $500 we'd expect nothing less
than premium level performance from the
z1 compact petite package or no
unfortunately we're left with a
smartphone that delivers just that it
loses points for audio performance and a
slightly buggy and already outdated
build of Android but it gains a whole
lot too for delivering on the promise of
a palm-sized smartphone with almost no
compromise our numeric score is
available in our full review at pocket
now so we'll close here by saying if big
phones aren't your bag your hunt for
mid-sized quality should definitely
begin with a very close look at the
Xperia z1 compact
one more time folks if you want more
details about our impressions of the z1
compact we have a lot more that we
couldn't fit in this video but that we
did fit in the full written review check

description below the full review at
pocket now including sample photos you
didn't get a chance to see in this video
and a whole lot more and be sure and
