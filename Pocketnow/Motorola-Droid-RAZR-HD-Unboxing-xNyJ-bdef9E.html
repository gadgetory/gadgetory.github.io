of the latest offerings from Verizon
Wireless and Motorola is the droid razr
HD we have it in the house let's go
unbox it like a lot of the droid razors
before it we're met with the droid
motorola razr eyeball on the front a
little bit different design because this
is a little bit different phone looking
at the top we got nothing over on the
side verizon and motorola branding same
thing on the other side on the back just
some very basic specs what's included in
the package really in the bottom bunch
of our codes will slip that sleeve off
droid razr HD embossed on the front
nothing on the back inside that package
lift straight off we've got the phone in
a nice little lift tab we'll come back
to that in just a moment lifting this up
and moving it to the side see we've got
the traditional wall wart this one has a
nice little side entry we've got a power
cable this a little bit different than
what we've seen from previous motorola
droid razors but still maintaining the
nice rounded edges we've got a little
pusher tool this is to get the battery
off this is an upgrade from previous
ones the droid for for example had a
plastic pusher this one is metal with
that nice plastic thing to hold on to so
upgrade their it seems very innocent but
let me tell you getting the back plate
off without one of these is not easy and
that is not the size of a paperclip so
keep that in mind don't lose this guy
next we've got some documents start here
coming into at key global support
information calling card yada yada yada
all that stuff okay let's look at the
phone the phone first of all it's very
very slim has a nice rounded back on it
feels good in hand a little bit boxy
edges but I kind of like that because it
helps you get a better grip you'll
notice here we've got a diagram on the
front that says here's how you put in
your
4g LTE sim it is pre-installed but to
get at it you need your tool you poke
that in there something like that and
ideally that would eject it and help you
get it out having a hard time with that
right now so we'll come back and look at
that in just a minute keeping up with
the previous raisers we've got not only
your micro USB port but also an HDMI
port which is a little bit unusual we
see some of the competition putting
these two together and then requiring a
dongle to be able to connect into a
laptop or into a TV or any other kind of
monitor here we've got them separated
out that sounds good because hey you
don't need an extra dongle but you do
need this special cable which most
people don't have so it would be nice if
you just had to get one or the other on
the bottom we've got a couple Torx
looking screws over on the side we've
got power and volume up and down looks
very industrial and this feels like it's
really metal I don't know if it is or
not but it feels like it on the back
we've got this nice tacky surface it
looks kind of like the Kevlar back that
we've seen from the previous ones will
have to dig into the details to find out
but it it's got a nice tack to it it's
not slippery it's not greasy I'm not
seeing any fingerprints on it so that's
fabulous appear at the top we've got our
flash with our HD video camera more
details on how that looks and how it
shoots later on speaker phone at the top
motorola Verizon 4G LTE branding and
then some other information way down
here at the bottom saying that it's
assembled in china and all that other
fun stuff at the top we've got our
headphone jack and that's about it for a
facing camera some notification lights
and sensors and whatnot there we go very
good we'll go ahead and since this is an
unboxing if i can get my fingernail
underneath this will go ahead and wow
they don't want that to come off easy go
ahead and take off the screen protector
so there it is stay tuned for our first
boot and more videos including some
comparisons between this the motorola
razr HD and some other devices coming up
in the next couple days again for pocket
now
showing off the latest and greatest from
motorola and verizon I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
