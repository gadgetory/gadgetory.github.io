pakka calm and today i'ma show you a new
game called zenonia and this is an RPG
based game and it actually works pretty
well on a touchscreen so the first thing
i do is go into some of the options
because i don't really like the screen
in this position so i'm going to flip
the screen over and as you can see
change it from vibration on or vibration
off unfortunately there's no controls
for volumes who actually have to
manually control them on your device so
on the today's screen or if you have a
button on the side a rocker bar you can
also change the volume like that so as
you can see I can turn on or off the
volume on this device and will actually
lower the volume so I'm gonna go back
and I might actually start a new game
and you can see some of the graphics its
kind of like I'm a gameboy advance so
I'm going to go into here and just click
empty and we can pick our character so i
can pick the palladin or the warrior or
the assassin imma try the warrior let's
see here click on him okay so it will
continue through this entire story but
I'm just going to skip it and I'm
actually gonna skip all of it so I can
show you the gameplay so I'll be right
back okay so here we are in the game and
as you can see it's actually kind of
cool because it gives an on-screen d-pad
and it works pretty well actually I'm
surprised at how well it works on this
particular device because this device
does not have a d-pad we can use the
on-screen one and it makes sense because
most video game systems actually have
the d-pad on the left hand so I can go
out here and it gives you little tips is
whenever it's a cutscene and we're gonna
skip some of this stuff okay more
talking there's a lot of talking in RPGs
but if you like that sort of touch style
of game and you'll like this game ok so
here we are back on the game and now we
can actually move around and user action
button so we have a sword here we'll go
down here and cut someone stuff up
looks like I found a potion
okay so as you can see will continue
through the game and it works pretty
well so some other cool things I can
actually go into I can go into my map
and see where i am and i'm in the town
of ALS and go back just click here and i
can look inside my backpack and see what
i have i can look at all my stats and i
just use the d-pad to go over and i can
go down i can change some settings and
see all these stuff i have all this
great stuff ok let's see what else and
go up change the skill let's see a
passive active same some messages and we
can also go into our system settings so
you know an option save I'm just going
to save this and we going to help
information and it will actually show
you how to play so if you get stuck on a
specific level it will actually give you
a little bit of information on how to
play so as you can see we can just go
over and get more information on how to
play this game and this is zenonia for
windows mobile devices and it's an RPG
style game and the developer says that
it has about 40 hours of gameplay and
the game cost nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents which is a pretty good
deal if you consider that is actually a
40-hour game and you're going to play it
for you know probably over days at a
time because I'm most of the time you
don't play too many games on your
windows mobile device that are that long
and this is another marketplace pake
where he picks some fun and interesting
games on windows mobile marketplace
