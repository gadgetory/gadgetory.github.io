makes us believe the galaxy F will be
announced it unpacked and you mock-up of
the LG G eight think you has emerged
along with an alleged and reasonable
price tag I guess it looks like we will
have to stick to lightning cables and
find what adapters even for this year's
iPhones I'm Jaime Rivera and it just
started snowing man like it's February
why this is bogging out daily so fellas
will be wondering exactly when we're
getting a 5g smartphone to be available
or to be at least seen in action we saw
that demo unit from Samsung over at
Hawaii but now oneplus is going to have
a full showcase of a 5g phone at MWC
will definitely be covering it it's just
for those of you that think that this is
a one plus seven they say it's not now
let's talk about the Nokia 9p review we
have been really looking forward to the
smartphone and we hope that it's as
great as all the leaks have been think
about it is it just got certified for
business operations which is interesting
but in addition to that we hear more
specifications probably one of the
biggest or most concerning parts for me
are the four gigs of ram being mentioned
I hope that that's not gonna be the case
but we'll see 128 gigs of storage now
let's talk about iPhones for those of
you that are thinking that Apple will
make the jump to USB C and the
everything we've heard about fast
charging no according to Marco Takara
this is not gonna happen for this year's
iPhones Apple really wants to cut down
their costs so still the five watt
adapter still the lightning cable and
mainly because they also don't want to
make the switch to air pods the
connector USB see for obvious reasons of
having those in the competition I don't
know that we'll see how that goes now
let's move the spotlight over to the LG
G 8 as well we've got some leaked
renders of what to expect for the phone
I'm not saying that it looks pretty I
thought that I'd see more cameras but
it's fine it's LG we'll see what we get
from them most interesting are the price
tags we hear that they start at $8.99
and I find it funny when you see leaks
and they're like oh it's reasonable
pricing that's because every other phone
is costing a thousand bucks right now
it's not reasonable alright but yeah
it seems that that's going to be the
case and finally the hottest news that I
have to do with Samsung unpacked 2019
we're gonna be there covering it live
and we were wondering exactly what we
were going to see from the galaxy f now
the company has sent out the full teaser
and we already have a room around the
publish that shows this teaser for those
would be the one watch it and well it
pretty much just tells you yeah the
truth will unfold everything is folding
in the demo we just hope that this is
something that we will be able to hold
and not just see on stage but what is
know in the comments down below I mean
we've seen a ton of leaks even a display
leaked recently I mean what do you think
you guys think that this looks
compelling
I like the recent leaks of the display I
just I don't know that I'm still trying
to wrap my head around the product
unless it's priced so aggressively that
it's like yeah fine let's try it leave
