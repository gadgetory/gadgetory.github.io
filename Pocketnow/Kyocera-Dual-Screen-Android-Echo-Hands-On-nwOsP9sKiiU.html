chart okay so you can have this unique
about this is that you charge the
battery

let's go to view yes you've got video on
this so a few special no it's called

that you can watch a video and then you
can start queuing other videos that are
better buffering so they can go let's go
to sleep let's go right now
play this video with the restaurant and
then we can start have all these others
