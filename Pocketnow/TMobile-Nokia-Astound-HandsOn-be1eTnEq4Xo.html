new to t-mobile as yesterday it was
announced and as you know this is the c7
as it's sold internationally so i think
it was described by an Okie executive as
one of the sexiest devices in their
lineup and that's probably true and we
have a John here from t-mobile to tell
us a little bit more about it so real
right well this is Nokia's down is going
to be retailing for 799 on a two-year
contract from t-mobile just announced
yesterday it will be available on april
six so no keys down is a great
full-featured smartphone for a really
attractive price so we've got an eight
megapixel camera on the back with a
flash a really strong quality build and
the symbian platform preloaded on there
as well so great smartphone features for
people who maybe it's their first mark
phone you know stepping up from a
feature phone or you know people who
just want to have that on-the-go
entertainment and productivity on a
great device sir hunting the city and
platform comes preloaded with ob maps
the OB store with tons of applications
and games to download we've been loaded
a few games on here including
he owes
pretty snappy yeah
so sorry I'm gonna go back here
pre-loaded a few games including a lab
in 3d fruit ninja which is a big popular
game out there right now and of course
the OB store comes with access to angry
birds which is probably the biggest game
out there right now angry very angry
birds as well as slacker radio is
building here as well so great
entertainment product great productivity
smartphone for the mass market okay you
think you could show us the web browser
please sure
yes
go to now this is a 3g device for a 3g
device yes it's a capable of a 10.2
megabit download this is this and we can
try different website let's go to pocket
now
I pocketnow fans here folks
and the mobile version of the site we
can try to get the desktop version
so you can see it's pretty snappy it's
uh you know the benefit of our network
is that every device benefits from the
4G speeds even though computer me if
they're not 4g
now does this have pinch to zoom on it I
believe so
if we got pinch to zoom functionality
there to make it easier to read so it's
not quite as smooth as you might find on
the sidekick we just looked at and maybe
the iphone but it's also you know a more
entry-level phone as you said they go
that's a nokia stone 1799 on april six
can we take one more at 360Â° around the
devices that we can get the profile here
the buttons
see all right thanks a lot and that was
John from t-mo but we appreciate your
help right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
