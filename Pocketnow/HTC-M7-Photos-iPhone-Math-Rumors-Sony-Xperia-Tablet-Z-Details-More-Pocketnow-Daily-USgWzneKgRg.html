time an oddly named iphone math
codenamed touted for a larger iphone and
sony announces the Xperia tablet Z I'm
hi Mary better and I bet you those
larger iphone rumors or do a this is
 out daily
that's right sony takes the cake today
with their experience have let z that
you really think that they only had the
xperia z when they announced it at CES
2013 they were probably not ready for
the tablet but it's now being announced
it has a gorgeous design it's dust proof
it's waterproof and it's got a lot of
really great features that you can find
the links down below but the interesting
point here is that apparently sony
confirmed to the tablets actually
thinner than the ipad mini if that's
even possible so the only problem sadly
is that we don't have pricing or
availability but probably mwc 2013 will
allow us to get a better glimpse at the
tablet so we'll keep you posted now
speaking of sony new rumors from the
company themselves apparently have them
working on a 6-inch phablet which we're
not sure if it's gonna be a tablet or a
phone but likewise whatever they do it's
just interesting to see that everybody's
following the trend that Samsung
initialize with their galaxy note when
they brought the phablet to the market
now we have the Ascend made from Huawei
what sadly did not make with our minds
but hopefully Sony will bring their
Xperia Z design into this new phablet
whichever comes first and we'll probably
see that at mwc 2013 now even though
Google does run a good spot at mwc every
year it's really ought to see that the
company is apparently working on
bringing a refresh to the Nexus 10 we
don't really see announcements of
devices at emily's you or at least not
that I can remember but if Google does
something like this they'll probably
just launched a refresh of the Nexus 10
that includes better storage for a
cheaper price hopefully and hopefully
better availability but that being the
case whatever happens we will keep you
posted we will be at the show for
keeping you up with the news of
everything that's happening at mwc and
if you're keeping up with the apple
rumors you heard recently that the
company will apparently work on a
cheaper our iphone for later this year
but the newer rumors now have the
company working on a bigger iphone just
how big well apparently it'll be a
four-point NH display which is pretty
much the same thing we get on the galaxy
s3 now how true could these rumors be we
know that Apple is a company that does a
lot of prototyping so it could be the
case that they're trying something and
the code name for this device is the
iphone math which sounds odd but if you
think of it if they're adding numbers
into the display then yes this would be
the iphone math wiki
posted and finally for the hottest news
of the day the most anticipated the vice
for mwc 2013 it's the HTC m7 and we
finally have images to show you what to
expect from the device and award of the
price is gorgeous I mean just think
about it we wanted for a windows phone
8x design to come to Android and this is
pretty much what we're getting with the
m7 only with a 1080p display and that
leads me to the question of the day what
device are you waiting for it in WC 2013
in my particular case I do want this m7
really badly I mean since five and the
leaked images looks awesome so leave us
a comment down below which is your pick
and if you want an earlier scope of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on parking now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary that I'm thanks
for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
