gain some sort of a mirror-like finish
TCL has already begun to take action and
fixing the issues of the BlackBerry key
one and it seems that there is a full
vision display coming two more
smartphones from LG I'm high and I
believe it I am I know the t-shirts are
awesome you can get yours in the link in
the comments down below there's also a
10% discount at welcome ripped apparel
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you
haven't noticed that's been Amazon Prime
day for the last couple of days because
problem is that some of these deals are
only available for 24 hours like in the
case of the Casio WS DF 20 it is
currently down for a lot of money and
there are also some deals for Amazon
echo devices you can learn more in the
link in the description
usually when Motorola announces a
z-force variant of its moto Z line if
it's usually either stronger or it
brings a larger battery as it turns out
the company is actually planning
according to some benchmarks to make the
NEX z2 force a more powerful device six
gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage
according to these benchmarks again
nothing confirm we will learn more on
July event from Motorola also about LG
as the company is teasing the tomorrow
we will get another full vision display
smartphone from the company and we know
that full vision is the whole concept of
the 2 by 1 or 18 by 9 aspect ratio the
only problem is that according to some
trusted sources this device is only
bringing a snapdragon 430 processor so
don't get your hopes up on this being as
some sort of flagship now let's talk
about blackberry and the key one one of
the major complaints of the key one is
how easy it is for that display to come
off because there are there is no
adhesive there which is kind of odd and
that the company has just come on record
to confirm that it is working on the
next batch of smartphones to include
some sort of at ease it so don't forget
if you ever have a problem with your
phone you can actually get it replaced
through warranty that is fully covered
and yet the next patch will include an
adhesive to avoid this happening again
and finally the very hot engines they
have to do with the iPhone 8 mainly
because of two things number one
according to some trusted sources this
device is only a couple of weeks away
from Apple
being at that point of no return where
it's either getting to chide Z or it's
not apparently the company continues to
struggle in figuring this out and it's
still not final whether it's going to
make the cut or not now the second thing
is that one of those trusted sources is
also claiming that there is a
mirror-like finish coming to this device
apparently the devices blast will bring
some sort of technology like we see on
the U 11 which is not necessarily good
and that's really the question today I
mean do you think that it's a good idea
for Apple to go for a mirror-like finish
because in my case I do not like how
easy it is to smudge that you 11 I wish
it didn't happen but anyways leave us a
comment down below with a photo your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
