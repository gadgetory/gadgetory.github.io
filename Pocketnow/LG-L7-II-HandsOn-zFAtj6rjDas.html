here at the LG booth at mwc checking out
the optimus l7 to the follow-on to the
l7 of last cycle let's have a look so
this is obviously not one of the higher
end devices in the lineup but it does
carry a lot of the same characteristics
as the other devices we've seen we have
the traditional design where you know
just play centric your piece up top all
that kind of stuff the home button does
carry an LED illuminator which is
present has been president all the
phones we've seen today but I don't
think we've mentioned it yet and it's
one of those nice touches obviously we
have the Android keys down here menu and
back someone's change the illumination
setting those the operand of the back
you can tell right away this isn't meant
to be any kind of a premium device it's
a very kind of micro stippled plastic
back doesn't feel terribly premium it's
almost a little bit slippery really but
the camera does have a flash and this is
a 8 megapixel primary shooter so there's
a couple specs on this thing that are at
odds with one another your headphone
jack obviously volume up volume down +
LG is a shortcut into the this memo
application which just like on the
others lets you bring the memo front and
center if you've written down a phone
number you can then copy it right from
there and then get rid of it and go
about your business the debt software
experience is powered by one gigahertz
processor and the whole shebang is
powered by a 2460 milliamp hour battery
which I do not believe is removable but
just a very quick glance at the LG
optimus l7 to hear the LG booth a whole
lot more coming from LG and others
Michaels pocket now Tony behind the
camera stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
