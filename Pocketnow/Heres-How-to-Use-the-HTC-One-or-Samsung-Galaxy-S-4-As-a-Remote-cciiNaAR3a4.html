infrared ports on them but how can you
put them to good use I'm Taylor Martin
this is pocket now and this is how you
use the HTC One or the galaxy s4 as a
remote for your home entertainment
system infrared as a remote
communication technology is anything but
new it's been used in countless consumer
electronics for over three decades and
infrared was once widely used in
smartphones for file transfers long
before the days of iOS or Android the
infamous beam function of Windows Mobile
for example along came the great
smartphone boom between 2007 and 2010
where I are mysteriously disappeared
from high-end smartphones as newer more
efficient data sharing methods and file
transfer protocols were created in ER
2013 however and ir blasters are making
a comeback why mainly because companies
are looking to offer a great second
screen experience with smartphones and
tablets multimedia is no longer simply
about consuming it's about sharing and
using alternative devices to enhance the
experience two of this year's most
notable smartphones among many others
come with infrared ports along the top
edge the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy
s4 if you own one of these devices you
may be wondering how do i set up my
smartphone as a universal remote for my
home entertainment system fortunately
it's extremely easy provided you have
the right equipment and name brands the
respective applications necessary for
setting up the remote function on the
galaxy s4 and HTC One may be different
the galaxy s4 s application is called
watch on and the ones app is simply
titled TV but both services are powered
by peel and they operate quite similarly
first you open the application on your
phone where you must choose your region
and enter your zip code from this
information the application determines
what cable or satellite providers are
available in your area even if like us
you do not use cable or satellite you
must set up at least one service to
enable the remote control function so we
just picked one and breeze through if
you take the time to set up your actual
service provider there are some added
benefits such as channel guides and
additional information on your favorite
television shows we did however set up
netflix on the watch own application but
without Google TV it serves no real
function
once you get past this you're ready to
set up the actual remote functionality
tap the remote icon in the upper-right
portion of the display and watch on or
the upper middle of the TV app on the
one enter the name of the room and watch
on or the name of the actual remote on
the one next choose your television
brand then you will go through a series
of code tests point the phone towards
your television and press the power
button within the app if the button does
not turn on the TV try the next code if
you've chosen the correct brand and try
to all the codes to no avail it's worth
trying again just in case if it doesn't
work make sure you're pointing the IR
blaster on your phone directly at the
infrared receiver on your television you
may also have to do some trial and error
tests the LG optimus g pro did not have
official support for the dynex
television in my living room so I chose
a few brands at random and discovered
that memorex uses similar ir codes if
however the setup won't without a hitch
your smartphone should now perform most
of the functions your OEM remote does
and you can go through the same process
to set up other devices such as blu-ray
players game consoles set-top boxes and
more it's also worth mentioning that the
remote can be quickly accessed in
various ways by default the remote you
used last appears in the notification
shade on the HTC one with the galaxy s4
you can set up the remote to appear in
the notification shade or have it show
on the lock screen based on location
Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth
