for 3 billion in hires Dre in the
process demos of Android wear show is
what to expect from the LG G watch and
one plus now wants to sell you'll
invites for its own phone I'm hi mera
neta and the more of the story today is
if you're persistent Apple will pay you
three billion dollars this is parking
out daily I one of us continue waiting
for the LG G watch and in the official
news today what we have is well a demo
of the LG G watch but the purpose of the
video was to show us android wear and
half the video is pretty much talking
about just the hardware of the LG G
watch links in description to watch the
full video and there is another link
that shows you exactly what to expect
from notifications which will be kind of
interesting in such a small device and
speaking of wearable Samsung is just
announced in band and no this is not
simbad the actor I'm talking about send
band and this is actually not a product
per se this is really is sort of a
platform sort of a concept of Champions
working on where everything will connect
to this platform and I'm talking about
sensors in order to detect your health
and its really interesting that we get
this information today when we're just
one week away from WWDC 2014 where all
the rumors are that we are getting the
iWatch which will focus on health so
Samsung is announcing their take as to
how they plan to bring health into
wearables really interesting very long
article and speaking of official news
google has just updated almost every
single one of its google apps for
android and probably the coolest update
here is the camera where you're going to
get a ton of features that you did not
get in the past and previously you know
how bad the Google application for the
camera was but make sure you update or
look around as many of these updates are
actually quite compelling now it's are
about 1 plus as the company wants to
sell you its invites or should we say
auction as the company is apparently
going to head on ebay with 15 no not 50
15 15 invites for the oneplus one and
the idea is that whatever money they
make out of these auctions will be given
to charity
the idea and the question is why just 15
and what is going on man I mean you guys
really want to sell that boat or not
because this is really becoming annoying
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day Apple has just confirmed
the Zack position of beats and beats
music and just about everything beats
for 3 billion dollars 2.6 billion in
cash and then the rest goes in stock and
the company is actually hiring Jimmy
Levine and dr. dre these are new
employees to the company funny because
dr. Dre used to be one of my favorite
artists years ago he still is but still
it is really interesting the company is
bringing beats but then it's not
bringing beats as apparently the company
actually plans to continue having beats
as a separate brand and you know Apple
have its own thing that means you see
the question of the day how big a
customer are you of beats do you have
any product that has to do with beats in
my case honestly their headphones look
cool but I hate suction in my ears and
they're kind of overpriced in my opinion
so I know I don't have anything that's
beats i'm more of a bose customer but
leave us a comment down below what's
your preferred music streaming service
which mine is spotify and what the
headset do you use right now is it beats
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video with spilling she follows on vaca
now comment subscribe to channel as well
you'd also follow me on twitter Jaime
underscore any better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hey Natalie better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
