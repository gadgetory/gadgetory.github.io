and there may be a Google edition around
the bend I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and this is how you can make
your HTC One a Google edition when HTC
announced there would be a developer
edition HTC one that comes unlocked with
an unlocked bootloader and compatible
with AT&amp;amp;T LTE many were surprised at
HTC's newfound dedication to developers
then Samsung one up HTC by teaming up
with Google will release a Google
edition galaxy s4 a nexus style s4 on
jun 26 reports have since alleged HTC
would also get in on the google edition
love with the HTC One but the news is
somewhat bittersweet to existing HTC One
owners especially those with a developer
edition fortunately getting the same
effect is quite simple if you currently
own an HTC One there's a quick and easy
way to effectively turn your one into a
Google edition of course there are some
prerequisites you will need to take care
of first you will need to unlock the
bootloader on your one which can be done
at HTC dev com before you do that
however you will want to make sure you
backup your pictures and any other data
that you do not want to lose unlocking
the bootloader will wipe all data from
the phone from your computer navigate to
HTC dev com click the unlock bootloader
button click get started select your
device and click begin unlock bootloader
follow the official instructions from
HTC and your bootloader should be
unlocked within minutes you will have to
first set up atb on your computer for
this to work so if you haven't done that
now is a great time to do so then you
will need to flash a custom recovery to
your one you can find a link to
clockworkmod for the one in the
description below download the custom
recovery to your computer and open a
terminal window change the directory to
the location you have saved the recovery
image disable fastboot in the power
options on the one and boot it into H
boot mode this is done by powering down
and powering back on while holding the
volume down button select fastboot and
plug the one into the computer from
terminal type fastboot flash recovery
and the name of the recovery image this
should only take a few seconds and when
it completes boot the phone into
recovery by rebooting the phone into
hboot again and selecting recovery
linked in the description below is the
latest cyanogen
10.1 nightly for the HTC One and the
latest version of G apps download both
of these files and make sure you
download the correct version for your
phone there is a separate build for the
unlocked one the AT&amp;amp;T version and sprint
model once those files finish
downloading perform a data wipe factory
reset on the phone and wipe the cache
partition you can either move the files
over to the phone which should still be
in recovery mode or simply flash them
using the side load feature to move the
files to the phone type adb push the
name of the file /s d card forward slash
for both files in terminal once the
files are on the phone select Install
zip from sdcard confirm and flash to
sideload select install zip from side
load in clockworkmod and from terminal
type adb side load and the name of the
file do this for both cyanogenmod and
gf's when you reboot your phone you will
be running a mostly stuck version of
Android 422 with slight modifications
for the most part this is how the google
edition HTC One will look run and feel
you just have to keep in mind that this
build is not a stable build it's an
alpha nightly not a release candidate or
a stable build so some things may not
function properly the good thing as
indicated by the name is that developers
are working on these builds around the
clock and fixes are being pushed nightly
or very close to nightly there are also
other stock Android builds for the HTC
One such as teen carbon revolt pack rom
and more that's all for now if you
