1050 in 2000 processor 8 gigs of ram
hopefully five inch screen and sticker
and here's the device this is a kind of
an old-school convertible has the twist
is here let's look out later that's
using kind of thick 20-foot so we do
have a lot of frosting power in there

those in a long time but here we have
you got a real ethernet port SD card
slot USB HDMI out

screen so we see scene it's not as
reflective as part of the plastic right

dispute because it did sound pretty
smooth
he won't see the furnace
just run now between the core
