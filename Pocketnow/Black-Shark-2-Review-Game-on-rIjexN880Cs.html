phone one that is hitting specific
markets but has yet to find widespread
availability outside of places like
China and France there is one thing that
all of these markets have in common
their mobile gaming eSports industries
have become huge commodities that's
simply not the case here in the US where
mobile gaming is still viewed as a
second tier experience compared to PC
and console gaming and I don't blame
anyone for thinking that way as much as
I have advocated for mobile gaming there
are so many reasons why people might
scoff at the idea of our smartphones
being viable gaming machines but what
the black shark too has done more so
than any other so-called gaming phone is
prove how a smartphone with a hyper
focus can actually benefit many
different types of users
this is paka now and I'm Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody let's get some
gaming done here on the black shark 2 in
this review as many of you probably know
by now the black shark 2 is powerful
inside and out the internal
specifications are top notch with the
snapdragon 855 a lot of RAM and plenty
of storage meanwhile the outer Hardware
bolsters the overall experience with
loud dual front-facing speakers and
Hamor LED screen and an antenna array
that ensures the phone always has a good
wireless signal no matter how you are
holding the phone there are some glaring
and while widely publicized omissions
like the 1080p resolution screen it also
doesn't manage a high refresh rate
compared to the growing number of its
well-known competitors and at least
black shark have made sure that the
screen has the lowest latency possible
even lower than that of the iPhones
another missing features the headphone
jack which baffles many users including
myself I can see why this is something
black truck just could not account for
though because of the way the
controller's fit into the phone case
other gaming phones have tackled this
issue in different ways but even black
shrug themselves made it clear that they
will pay attention to this more in the
future for future devices and then
there's the camera often the
afterthought of the gaming phone that's
kind of the case here too
as the dual end set up on the back
doesn't do anything exceptional when
compared to all of the flagships we've
already seen in 2019 pictures come out
looking detailed but they like in
vibrance I need a bit of a punch there's
also a lack of extra modes outside the
things like portrait and pro the
front-facing camera also suffers from a
lack of overall quality despite having a
20 megapixel sensor while I have used
the black shark 2 for some vlogging
content it is more because of the good
pick up from the phones array of
microphones and that brings me to why I
think the Black Shark - at least in my
eyes is an important step forward for
gaming phones in general I just went
through all of the run-of-the-mill
features and specifications that you
would expect the flagship to have some
pros some cons but all in all expected
where a gaming phone excels and one of
the black shark - shines is in turning
some of those features up to 11 and
providing value to more than just the
obvious specific users internet
connectivity using this phone has been
top-notch mainly because of the antenna
array that was in there to make it so
that no matter how you're holding the
phone you can have high speeds via the
wireless connections and then I just
mentioned that the microphone array that
makes this phone pick up audio better
than most other flagships that we see
right now the version that I have of
this phone actually sports a stock
version of Android just to make things a
lot easier to control that way you're
not really bogged down by extra features
or extra software bits on the way to
your actual gaming experience you have
the pill on the bottom you swipe up to
get to the app drawers and honestly it's
a very familiar interface and it's a
little bit refreshing to see this on
what is essentially a Chinese phone
there are a few features inside of the
software that make it a little bit
flashy er like the light settings which
allow you to change up the black shark
logo on the back but also the two LED
bars that are over on the sides these
LED bars can light up during gaming and
can actually be used for notifications
but I think my favorite use of them is
for charging you could see over on the
side just how much more of the battery
needs to be charged while it's plugged
in it's kind of ironic that the user
experience as a flagship device gets
maximized because black shark wanted to
minimize the interface after all they
put a lot of their energy into a
secondary space here on the phone that
you can trigger by hitting this little
slider and that is of course the shark
space you basically hit this trigger
here and it dumps the entirety of the
memory gives you some extra
do-not-disturb features and then just
displays all of your games ready to play
this is what gaming phones have been
needing the ability to morph into a
completely different identity and in
this case you can make it so that even
calls don't disturb you during your
gameplay as if dumping all of the
memories so that you have it all
available for your game is not enough
you can also overclock the system the
ludicrous mode can allow for
overclocking of the CPU and the GPU so
that you can get even
better performance out of any game that
you play and then of course there are
the controllers that slot right into the
case then adds a little bit of bulk to
the phone but that's a small trade-off
for a better tactile experience those
controllers can be mapped to any
on-screen control they're not actually
controllers that are registered to the
Android system the way that an Xbox
controller or a regular game pad are
registered this is the reason why this
is basically the pub G mobile machine if
all of your controls are strong about
the display then you have ways of
mapping those buttons
however the one-to-one experience can be
a little bit hard to recreate if you
don't have a virtual joystick on-screen
then the physical joystick is going to
emulate touches all over the place it
for that reason that I have so many
games on here but it's really only pub G
mobile that I've been able to use those
controllers effectively after all there
are so many games on the Google Play
Store but the majority of them require
touchscreen controls or they don't have
controls on the screen at all it's all
about contextual pressing for any games
out there that makes sense with
controllers you're still better off
pairing this phone to some sort of game
pad like the Razer ride you or the 8-bit
Doe while there are some missteps in the
black start to like the lack of a
headphone jack and also the screen
resolution and lower refresh rate of the
screen it still provides the best gaming
experience because it gives you an
entire space to do that with the touch
screen and also gamepad compatibility
with this phone you can still get a good
gaming experience you just have to have
the tools needed to do so and as long as
the gaming experience has the potential
to improve the overall experience then I
think we should be seeing way more of
these in the future as always thank you
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Black Shark -
I love what this phone does and how it
focuses on gaming it actually puts
everything else away and then it's party
time the thing is I might have gotten a
little bit too bummed out about the fact
that those controllers don't really work
for more games than pub G mobile but
this is still an Android device so that
means you can still pair it to a regular
game pads and then that's when the
gaming experience opens up once again I
do have some examples as to what games
made me realize these things and I go
through those examples in a video over
on my channel youtube.com slash Josh or
Vergara you can head to that channel
subscribe to it if you can please and
then also come
back here for even more from pocket now
and subscribe to this channel if you
haven't already from there I'm gonna go
ahead and call it on this one thank you
again and I will see you in our next
