calm and now we're testing out the front
facing camera of the LG nitro HD right
after we just tested out the front
facing camera so we're still right in
the same spot so what we're actually
going to do is turn around this phone
here and use the front facing camera as
our rear facing camera essentially I
just being done in landscape mode so
let's go ahead and see how how it works
now we're not able to see this because
the phone is turned around right now but
let's see if it's able to pick up at a
distance and maybe adjust the different
levels of sunlight is actually some
people over here playing hockey
hopefully you can see them in the same
thing with the Ducks I don't know if the
camera will be able to pick up the Ducks
down there or what the clarity even
looks like it's a 1.3 megapixel camera
on the front for stills let's go ahead
and see how well the macro does I've
bringing it closer to a bush over here
and we'll see how stable the images as
well
now hopefully it's able to focus in
however being only a front-facing camera
you should only be taking video of
yourself while you're video chatting
with somebody I wouldn't expect too much
from this so that has been our front
facing camera test if you enjoyed these
two videos or just this one video please
give it a thumbs up and be sure to check
pocketnow.com for our continuing
coverage and a final review upcoming of
the LG nitro HD thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
