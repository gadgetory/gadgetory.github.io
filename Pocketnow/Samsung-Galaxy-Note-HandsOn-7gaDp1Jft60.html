come and we are thinking and brand new
samsung galaxy note now you might wonder
is this a smartphone or is this a tablet
the line between smartphones and tablets
is very similar over more than 5 inch
display in diagonal a super amoled it's
not a super amoled plus screen it's a
superb mls of HD screen 1280 pixels up
across this is the biggest resolution
today 1.5 gigahertz processor which is a
samsung I processor huge Ram huge
specifications a huge 20 and 25 so 2,500
will give you enough juice to go through
the day without any problems I think
this is the stylus which comes right
inside here which allows you to input
precisely unimpressive screen let's take
a look at the film itself at the top we
have a speaker grill you can right above
the
some brandy we have your fire symmetry
and Bambi a light sensor and the horse
your front facing video camera then we
have been huge more than 5 inch screen
which is Super AMOLED HD and at the
bottom you will have your typical
buddies for a samsung android the same
as on the galaxy s2 we have a menu
capacitive buttons maybe button in
between we have a physical button for
the menu which is your column on the
left you have your volume rockers for
volume up and volume down nothing on the
bottom side flying over to the other
side we have a dedicated button I for
powering it up add this up we have the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the
bedding we will have your camera with
your LED flash take a look at how big
this device is in my I am it feels very
very very light and it
very grabbable if that's an expression
which you can use this is a lock screen
and Samsung is using the latest version
of Android which is two point three
point two five you can find it here it's
android 2.3 point five it's the latest
one and on top of it we have Samsung's
proprietary user interface and many of
these applications are dedicated
applications in order for you to use the
plan for empty so these are the s
applications so let's look at the
dedicated applications for your plan
let's see the S Memo this application
allows you to use the stylus and create
a memo to put it so let's say
video
for
notes
and of course you can type in text you
can use the rubber to delete the
sensitivity is a little bit off while
using the panel but first time with your
finger but when you are using the
nevertheless we can clear all we can say
before we can cancel let's go to the
Internet application and see how web
pages are displayed on this huge screen
so let's just go to
if you see how it looks
of course the mobile version of the site
that was really goes to the full version
and here's how it looks it's basically a
full representation of your website 800
pixels of russ and 1280 down so it's
insane the resolution of this you can
zoom out forced to navigate to tabs if
you have more tabs
switching its shoes landscapes bring you
a desktop experience of your website for
zoom in use pinch to zoom you will get a
little bit of checkerboard a factor but
a bit sluggish reversed I was just
so this was entering the United
provocative calm taking oath at the
brand new samsung galaxy note which is
neither of tablet pen or a smartphone
