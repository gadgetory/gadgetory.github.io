pocket
or two of the video review for the HP
ipaq 210 in this edition will go a
little bit into software and if you saw
my video reviews on the ipaq 100 series
the air pack 210 is really not much
different if we go to the ipaq wireless
here on the day screen we have a
Bluetooth controller which is very very
different to the Microsoft Bluetooth
stack it's really nice it's really
practical I'm actually connected to the
internet through my other phone and what
I really like is this connection wizard
it really makes it seamless and simple
to connect to different options for
bluetooth one of the things I like is
there is a PC remote control here it has
a lot of neat things and it's really
really simple to pair and connect
wireless LAN is really nice to you can
actually control if its status on it or
off from here it's really practical and
you can control both of them from here
then we have this today ribbon right
here which gives me battery power and
then it takes me to the battery power
section it gives me different options it
has a USB charging section for slower
fast connection a CF power setting which
is really interesting I had never seen
this before but then again there aren't
any other windows mobile 6 devices with
CF support except for this device so I
think so this is pretty much it then the
rest is pretty much standard we get
office mobile 6.1 and what's really
interesting is we get one note mobile
already included in the package really
really neat really practical if you want
to see how Excel looks on this device
well we get is a really really well
zoomed view of Excel with this foreign
screen but then if we zoom out fifty
percent we got a lot of screen to work
on a lot of really need space really
really good I really like this then we
have the BT phone manager which since
I'm connected using it to the internet
it actually gives me data received this
sin theta the amount of time I've been
connected through bluetooth to my other
phone which is good it actually gives me
different options to connect but what's
really nice is that this bluetooth stack
actually gives me an option to connect
the devices without the need of the BT
phone manager but not a problem at all
you have a help of help and support the
option here which is pretty much just
different tours you get then we get a
typical internet explorer we get HP
photosmart which is actually better than
the microsoft included photo editor it's
really practical it brings different
options for printing recording stuff on
it emailing bleeding we have something
for side views and everything it's
really really Park practical and then
obviously four-inch vga screen brings a
lot of neat images really really cute I
really like this if we go to programs we
have this EMA option which are actually
all it does is take you to the Internet
Explorer and connect you to the HP web
page which is really nothing out of the
ordinary I'm not going to cover that
then we have clear view PDF we have the
typical file explorer I pack quick start
tool which I went through on the iPad
100 series and it simply gives you a
tour of basics and it's actually like
task a task option for training and it
keeps training you on different stuff
and then it tells you ok you're trained
on this and you're trained on that then
we get HP ipaq tips which you get every
time you turn on the device every time
you soft reset it you get this to come
out just really need really decent we
have internet sharing which I have no
idea what it's here for but it's here
and then we have HP print smart which is
not included in the 100 series if I
remember correctly and we have different
options to connect to bluetooth printers
or to a typical printer which has a
Bluetooth duggal pretty much after this
we have well Windows Live a search
option test pictures and videos windows
media nothing really really out of the
ordinary it's pretty practical pretty
simple and as I showed you all it does
it take this oma option only takes you
to the HP website really nothing that's
going to bring any sort of benefits
in settings we predict practically have
the typical installation that you would
get in a normal windows mobile device
it's actually one of the things I like
about HP devices the fact that they
focus on giving you the windows mobile
complete package and not really many
editions which will take unnecessary
memory off your device and not all
manufacturers are actually nice enough
to allow you allow you to remove these
so this is pretty pretty welcomed as I
mentioned in my Hardware video
practically what one of the things I
would defer about this device is the
fact that it's retailed as an enterprise
device and that well if I would consider
using this as a laptop replacement I
would consider the fact that probably
Office Mobile is not going to really do
the best job and in comparison to would
office 2007 or office 2003 would do so I
would recommend that HP would consider
bringing in different applications or
offer you at least a trial or probably
discounting softmaker or for better
office office options or probably offer
opera instead of the Internet Explorer
to give you better connectivity options
as opposed to what you get here but
pretty much this is not the option you
will have to invest a little bit of
extra money to actually turn this ipaq
200 series into a real laptop
replacement now the good thing is you do
have the potential the device does has
the capacity so this is pretty much it
for my software edition of the ipaq 200
series will continue on later on here at
