now we are here in london at the samsung
event and we are going to take a look
for the first time at the samsung galaxy
s4 active so here we are with the
samsung galaxy s4 active the ruggedized
version of the samsung galaxy s4 as you
can see a huge part of its design has
been borrowed from the s4 aside from
these buttons right here which are
actual hardware buttons as you can see
the specs it looks rather the same but
there are a couple of changes first of
all we have the same 5 inch full HD
screen but this one is not a super
amoled screen it is a TFT LCD screen
there's also two gigs of ram 16
gigabytes of internal storage of course
expandable to up to 64 gigabytes via
microsd there's an 8 megapixel autofocus
camera on the back coupled with a 2
megapixel front fascia webcam there's a
two thousand million power battery
powering it all and as far as radios our
cursor yes this version
has LTE people Bullitt East aside from
Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and also AC NFC is also in
bluetooth so basically this is the
ruggedized version of the s4 going
flipping through the springs here just
to see how fluid it is it is as you'd
expect let's jump into specs real quick
and we'll see the tab settings page
which samsung is using of course this is
running android 4.2 too with the latest
TouchWiz user interface which is also
present on the Samsung Galaxy s4 so that
is it for now in short look at the
samsung galaxy s4 active young go
anywhere we'll have a comparison with
the s4 coming up right now thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
