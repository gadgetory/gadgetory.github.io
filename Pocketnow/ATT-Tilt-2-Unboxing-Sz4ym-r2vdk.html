now com two years ago AT&amp;amp;T released the
AT&amp;amp;T tilt which was a very popular
device thanks to the tilting screen
which had a lot of utility you could
rest it on your dashboard for gps
navigation you could put it on a
tabletop to watch video or you could
tilt the screen to get an optimal
viewing angle when typing out text
messages or emails obviously this one
has been used a lot a good indication of
how popular and useful that it was a
year later they came out with the HTC
fuze which didn't have the tilting
screen also known as the touch pro and
now we have AT&amp;amp;T version of the touch
pro 2 the tilt to which a lot of people
have been waiting for it this is one of
the most popular smartphones in the
world right now it's seen a release on
every major US carrier it's seen a
release on many carriers in Europe and
it is finally on AT&amp;amp;T so let's take a
look at the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two here's the
unboxing
okay here it is HTC tilt 2 GPS internet
3 megapixel camera email let's see what
else is on the box by now we know
exactly what to expect with this device
we've seen it in many different forms
it's going to be good to finally see it
in the AT&amp;amp;T version so let's take a look
at the device and we'll do some
comparisons in a second instructions on
how to use touchflo 3d this is using the
kind of older or last generation version
of touchflo 3d so it doesn't have the
Twitter client that we're going to see
on future devices like the HTC hd2 quick
start guide which is pleasantly in color
very nice touch here's the device I'm
going to put this to the side for a
second alright let's see what else we
have in the box AT&amp;amp;T Navigator first 30
days free all right parental control
some software let's get this out of the
way we have the charger and a plug stuff
that we're used to and we have the
converter Jack because the tilt two
unfortunately doesn't have a 3.5
millimeter jack like some other variants
of the touch pro two toes in this
country and then we have an extra stylus
in case you lose it so let's take a look
at the device and do some comparisons
you know this version of the touch pro 2
looks very similar to the european
version i actually have that we're going
to take a look at that in comparison in
a minute so let's take off this plastic
beautiful device as expected flush touch
screen the zoom bar on the bottom these
buttons aren't raised like they are the
t-mobile version a very nice spring
action on the keyboard we don't have the
dedicated numeral key at the top but you
do get characters up here which you
probably use more often than you then
you do numbers depending on kind of the
kind of text entry you're doing let's
tilt it see how high it goes now
certainly this tilt
screen doesn't go nearly as high as the
tilt because the screen is so wide and
because there's an extra row of keys so
as you can see this can go all the way
up and that can go about 30 degrees
we're have a full comparison of these
devices later a nice silver metallic on
the back there's the button to meet the
speakerphone this has two microphones
and two speakers to do noise
cancellation for the straight talk
speakerphone so let's take a look at
this device next to some other devices
next to the touch HD this has a three
point six inch screen this is a 3.8 inch
screen you can kind of tell that from
the side by side the touch pro two or
the tilt two is quite thin relative to
the last generation of HTC devices with
slide out keyboards next to the iphone
the tilt two has a larger screen and of
course is thinner and next to the
European touch pro2 we're gonna do for
comparisons later but let's get closer
in on these really quick so again this
version the tilt two of the touch pro
two is most similar to the first version
released with this chrome strip around
the edge these buttons along the bottom
that are flat and on the back we have a
very similar design except that the tilt
two is black back here and this is kind
of silver but they both have that
brushed metal look that's really
gorgeous right in the center so we've
got a lot more coming up on the HTC AT&amp;amp;T
tilt two that's a that's a mouthful
we're going to take a look at the
software they included on here do some
comparisons of the last generation tilts
and also talked about how this compares
to the other versions of the touch pro
two that are out there you sure to
follow us on Twitter for more on the
tilt to twitter.com slash pocket not
sweets that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
