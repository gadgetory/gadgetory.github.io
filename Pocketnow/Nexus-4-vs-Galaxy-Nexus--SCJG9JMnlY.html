pocket now calm you know the galaxy
nexus was and still is a really great
phone but many of you who have the
Galaxy Nexus are probably wondering
should I upgrade to the Nexus 4 in this
video we're going to compare the two and
help you decide let's get to it so can
you tell these two devices apart they do
look very similar because they both have
that very rounded edge design although
here on the Galaxy Nexus it's even more
rounded on the top and the bottom
another way you can tell can tell it's
the Galaxy Nexus is because you get that
bluish glow that's characteristic of
Samsung's Super AMOLED displays the
Nexus 4 has an LCD panel a very good LCD
panel so when it's turned off it's
completely black and it is kind of
handsome because it's got that nice
panel of glass that it's on the entire
front of the device and it wraps around
the edges whereas on the Galaxy Nexus
you also get a curved piece of glass but
it doesn't have that really cool effect
that wraps around the edges there's a
little bit of a taper here but not that
much now another cool thing about Galaxy
Nexus and the Nexus 4 both is that there
are they are buttonless designs so when
they're off they look really cool and
something that's kind of new on the
Nexus 4 is that because this is flat
back here you've got this extra handle
to grip the phone with because there are
no buttons here the buttons take place
right here on the screen so this is a
great way to hold the phone if you're
reading a book or if you're watching a
movie that was possible on the Galaxy
Nexus but it's definitely smaller and
you get this pump back here which kind
of makes it a little bit awkward to hold
but that hump actually helps the Galaxy
Nexus
especially when typing because when
you're typing on the Galaxy Nexus you
can wrap your fingers around the device
and kind of rest them on this huh plus
there's some waiting at the bottom of
the phone so it just feels pretty darn
good on the Nexus 4 you don't get that
humped typing is definitely a little bit
more uncomfortable on the Nexus 4 it's
something to get used to plus the screen
sensitivity is worse on the Nexus 4
we're going to talk about why in a few
minutes so now that we're on the back
let's talk about the differences here
the Galaxy Nexus has this plasticy
textured design which is very functional
it's not the most beautiful thing ever
but it's definitely fun
because it lends to a really great in
hand feel and it also is grippy the next
is for kind of goes the beauty route
because this backing is definitely
beautiful in the way that it catches the
light look at that that is awesome
but of course it's also a liability
because you can get more fingerprints on
the back and of course if you drop the
phone you're twice as likely to crack
something then you were on the Galaxy
Nexus now while we're back here we've
got some speakers here both of which are
firing down if the phone is over on its
back they're going to be muted a little
bit unfortunately but most phones are
like that we've got an 8 megapixel
shooter here on the Nexus 4 and a 5
megapixel shooter on the Galaxy Nexus so
you get a camera upgrade and in terms of
other dimensions looking at thickness
the Nexus 4 is slightly thicker than the
Galaxy Nexus this is actually the
Verizon version so it's at it bit
thicker than the GSM version if we set
them on the table and try to feel a
difference the the Nexus 4 actually in
the in the bottom part here is thinner
and then as you move to the top and get
that tapered design of the Galaxy Nexus
the Galaxy Nexus becomes a little bit
thinner in terms of width the Nexus 4 is
a little bit wider about one millimeter
and in in terms of tallness the Galaxy
Nexus is just a little bit taller there
so let's talk about specifications now
the Galaxy Nexus has a TI OMAP 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor with one
gigabyte of RAM it's got a power VR SGX
540 GPU and over here on the Nexus 4
much more impressive spec sheet
definitely we've got the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro quad core running at
1.5 gigahertz
this is one of the fastest CPUs we've
seen so far ever it's running with the
Adreno 320 GPU and 2 gigabytes of RAM
than one gigabyte of RAM here in terms
of storage options you get 16 gigabytes
no microSD expansion on the Galaxy Nexus
and 8 or 16 gigabytes on the nexus 4
with again no option for expanding
storage and also in terms of expansion
you can remove the battery on the Galaxy
Nexus you cannot remove the battery on
the Nexus 4 but the Nexus 4 is a larger
battery and
has better battery life than the Galaxy
Nexus so hopefully you won't have to
swap batteries like you might have on
the Galaxy Nexus
okay so let's boot these bad boys up and
see what you want turns on first so
we've got power buttons on the sides
here we're going to press them pressing
pressing vibration on both let's see
which gets to the home screen first
Nexus logo
and the next is for won by quite a bit
actually and so while we're waiting for
the Galaxy Nexus to start up let's go
into display settings turn on brightness
to a hundred percent because we're gonna
do some screen comparisons so you can
see the difference between these two
displays and by the way this this
background is called because I know a
lot of you are maybe asking Mike grid
it's a free live wallpaper it is super
sweet and you can really customize it to
do anything anyway we're gonna wait for
the Galaxy Nexus 2 to get to get up into
action here
alright the Galaxy Nexus is on and work
likewise going to turn on screen
brightness to a hundred percent and then
we're going to talk about the Android
version that we're running here so you
know what we're working with so let's go
back into the settings go down to about
the the Nexus 4 really slides around on
the table in fact I've witnessed it thaw
off the table when it was sitting in the
middle of the table and I just had some
speakers playing music this thing slides
around like you wouldn't believe
which is why I think it's great that
Google's selling a bumper as an
accessory let's go to a bath phone we're
actually running 4.1.1 here it's a stack
image right from Google the Galaxy Nexus
is going to get the 4.2 update it's
actually rolling out now but it's not
going to increase performance it's just
going to add features so we really
didn't feel compelled to upgrade it to
4.2 because most people that have a
Galaxy Nexus right now are probably
running it with 4.1.1 anyway so as you
can see on the screens here they look
different right off the bat a color
saturation you get that super color
saturation of the AMOLED panel the blue
strip up here is a bluer then the Nexus
4 over here and also this gradient is a
totally different color we saw this in
the iPhone 5 comparison I'll put a link
up on the video that the Nexus 4 has a
warm screen now something else that the
now something else that the Nexus 4 does
differently is that the touch sensor is
actually laminated to the screen and so
this is going to be really difficult to
show on camera but the depth between the
actual layer of glass and where the
screen starts is bigger meaning on the
Galaxy Nexus the screen looks kind of
sunk in a little bit and see if you can
tell that could look around the edge of
the phone here
and maybe that's a good place to look
over on the Nexus 4 you kind of hear
this a lot about modern screens but it's
definitely true here the screen is right
on the top and if I kind of twist it in
the light here maybe you can see that
too but there's a downside to that and
we see this with the iPhone 5 which has
the same insell display technology the
screen sensitivity is worse on the Nexus
4 to the point where typing can be
frustrating zooming it feels imprecise
it might be a software issue but I think
it's actually a hardware issue so that's
something to keep in mind it's not a
deal-breaker but it definitely means
you're gonna have to slow down a little
bit when typing you're gonna have to get
used to the more numb feeling display
but if you can get past that the display
on the Nexus 4 is incredible so let's
talk about the displays here on the
Galaxy Nexus we have a 1280 by 720
display it was the second 720p
smartphone display the first was the HTC
Rezound
and it's a 4.6 five-inch screen making
for a ppi of 316 and as a result because
the ppi is over 300 you can't see pixels
I mean this is a great screen and
because you have Super AMOLED blacks are
just super black colors are
oversaturated some people like that some
people hate it now over here on the
Nexus 4 we've got higher res display
going up a little bit we've got that
same 1280 down but now seven six eight
across does that matter well we're gonna
open up some websites and try to note
the difference between the two it's a
4.7 inch display making for a PPI
slightly higher really not important
here 320 PPI versus 316 and again
because the PPI is over that 300
threshold you can't see pixels which is
which is nice actually that's one of
settings and see some text in front of
us if the camera will focus that would
be awesome
and as you can see the text is just
super shark and smooth but then again it
was super sharp and smooth on the Galaxy
Nexus okay so let's see which device is
faster we're gonna do a lot of tests
here starting with just app launch speed
so we're going to try to launch Facebook
at the exact same time one two three go
faster on the Nexus 4 definitely
let's try launched Twitter 1 2 3 go
right off the bat definitely faster on
the Nexus 4 by about a half a second or
so let's launch the Play Store 1 2 3
Play Store faster on the Galaxy Nexus
that was really interesting actually
alright camera very important let's see
1 2 3 go faster on the Nexus 4 do that
again just a double check go yep faster
on the Nexus 4 and let's try bad piggies
1 2 3 go faster on the Nexus 4
across-the-board and that's the way it
should be going from generation to
generation now it's only faster in
launching apps by like one second and
does one second matter to you well it
matters to me but maybe it doesn't
matter to you we're really trying to
help you decide if it's worth upgrading
from the Galaxy Nexus to the Nexus 4 in
this video now let's go into the web
browser now on the Nexus 4 unfortunately
Google has included the Chrome browser
as the stock browser and I say
unfortunately because the Chrome browser
is not as fast as the stock built in
Android browser and I don't know why
Google would release a browser as the
default browser on their flagship phone
that isn't as fast as an alternative
it's just not as fast ok let's jump into
the browser here 1 2 3 go
now chrome does have some awesome
features it has awesome tab management
and has browser sync password sync it's
a really great browser it's just not as
fast as this browser although it's
probably going to be faster in this
particular test because we're getting
the power of the s4 pro here so what we
want to do first here is go to
pocketnow.com it went to a search page
so we had to to bring it up separately
here so now take a look at these screens
and you're wondering does a 7 6 8
horizontal resolution matter in terms of
how much stuff displays on the screen
well let's take a look over here on the
Galaxy Nexus we actually see more screen
content oddly this is the bottom story
that's over here and it's just really a
matter of the zoom settings of the
particular browser so let's move around
on the page on
see Nexus very good performance no white
at all or checkerboards scrolling down
here on the Nexus 4 likewise let's
double tap to zoom in
tap top pretty much the same there let's
zoom out got a little white stuff over
here but on on the Nexus 4 it was still
clear let's do a pinch to zoom and look
what look at what just happened cuz I
mentioned that the touch responsiveness
is not as good I'm gonna pinch the exact
same amount and release at the exact
same time you're gonna see that the
touch responsiveness is totally out of
whack here watch this see look at my
fingers it was the same amount of pinch
but it doesn't seem that the screen is
registering a pinch until like a couple
of millimeters after I do the pitch
whereas over here as soon as you put
your fingers on the screen it registers
a pinch and hopefully you can see that
on video anyway it's just a little
bothersome but something you can get
used to so let's move around on the pH
and load something else it's double tap
to zoom in alright let's move in on a
feature over here Nexus 4 versus iPhone
5 you should check that out and let's
see what you gets there first we're
watching the progress bar the progress
bar and both over Wi-Fi of course and
the next thing a liqu see nexus finished
first although it looks like the Nexus 4
is finished loading the page and we can
move down on the page and let's see
which renders this video first gets it
ready to go to watch on the screen one
two three and we're gonna actually stop
this because it seems to be having some
problems one two three play that is loud
faster on the Nexus 4 there okay now
let's go to the verge another
image-heavy website let's see which
loads it first all right and we're
loaded here let's scroll down the page
very smooth on both a little bit of
white space there that's what I'm
talking about on an s4 pro with an s4
pro chip there just should never be any
hesitation in the browser and I think
that's probably because of the chrome
the Chrome browser that we're using here
but so it's a double tap to zoom in
Nexus 4 cleared up a little bit faster
let's get really close
to text and bring it in close to see how
text looks on the screen again
razor-sharp screens on both you can't
see pixels on neither device it's just a
very very high pixel density experience
on both okay so in terms of web browsing
performance it's really a draw and I
think that if Google had included the
stock Android browser on the Nexus 4 it
would have smoked the the Galaxy Nexus
because it's got a faster processor but
chrome slows things down so we're gonna
first run quadrant standard here so
quadrant standard C which loads at first
again the Nexus 4 is ahead on pretty
much everything by about seconds we're
gonna run full benchmark and we'll come
back with the scores and the results are
in and the Nexus 4 are finished quite
ahead of the Galaxy Nexus we're gonna
click yes let's see what we get that is
very interesting so very low scores
actually on both devices maybe because
there's a lot of stuff running who knows
your device 2160 that doesn't seem right
and 45 69 we're gonna have to run this
again that must be an anomaly that is
just super weird alright second round is
done let's see what we get here alright
and this is really the problem with
benchmarks is that they can be
inconsistent you could run it once I can
get a huge score right at the next
second and you know those score they're
fun we've got some better results here
4800 we were seeing the results in the
seven thousands here on the Nexus 4 and
over here we've got just 21 22 on the
Galaxy Nexus let's do another benchmark
we've got Geekbench ready to go here so
let's load that up and then we're gonna
conclude this video with some closing
remarks and the Geekbench 2 results are
in and we get pretty much double the
score here on the Nexus 4 does that mean
that the Nexus 4 is twice as fast as a
Galaxy Nexus no in fact you just saw a
battery of tests that proved that in
most cases the Nexus 4 is about a second
faster maybe maybe a 15 to 20 percent
faster
benchmarks really just calculate they're
all processing power of the CPU so in
conclusion let's sum up why you should
upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus and why
you might not want to upgrade from the
Galaxy Nexus number one the design is
much improved it's a beautiful device
with some handsome
design elements that is unlike anything
else on the market number two the
Qualcomm s4 pro chip is fast like real
fast and developers probably really
haven't taken advantage of it yet
definitely the Chrome web browser does
it take advantage of it yet so hopefully
in the future we will see even further
enhancements to Android and third-party
apps to take advantage of this awesome
CPU next the display it's higher
resolution that gap than the Galaxy
Nexus it's just beautiful it's more
balanced you don't get that extreme
color saturation it has fantastic
viewing angles it just looks darn good
and also there are some niceties like
Android 4.2 right out of the box which
brings some cool features like
photosphere new notification features
and some other stuff like wireless
charging the the Nexus 4 has wireless
charging with the cui wireless charging
standard so you can go out right now and
buy a wireless charging device and set
it on there and have it charge and also
early indications is that the Nexus 4
has much better battery life than the
Galaxy Nexus thanks to its larger
battery and the s4 pro probably has
something to do with it now why wouldn't
you want to upgrade to the Nexus 4 well
it's not that much faster than the
Galaxy Nexus and day-to-day performance
it's about a second faster when
launching apps some that might be
significant to others not so much in the
web browser it's kind of a tie in a lot
of the cases Nexus 4 is just slightly
faster sometimes then the new Galaxy
Nexus it's not night and day also screen
sensitivity is an issue if you get your
Nexus 4 or you go to a Best Buy for
example and test it out you're going to
notice that the screen sensitivity is a
little bit numb because of this in sell
touch display technology again it's not
a deal-breaker it's something to get
used to the Galaxy Nexus had awesome
touch display sensitivity and finally
the Nexus 4 has no removable battery as
did the Galaxy Nexus which was really
nice then it has no removable storage
like the Galaxy Nexus so you're stuck
with either eight gigabytes or 16
gigabytes of storage but of course the
price on it
on the Nexus 4 is so incredibly good at
$2.99 or 349 so overall the Nexus 4 is
not a sure upgrade for Galaxy Nexus
owners there are some trade-offs it's
definitely a better phone overall but
it's not a
huge of mega leap and hopefully this
video was helpful in you deciding for
yourself if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now
