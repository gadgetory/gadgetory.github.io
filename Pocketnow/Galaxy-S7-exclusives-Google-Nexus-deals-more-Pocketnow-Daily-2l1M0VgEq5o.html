owning exclusivity over the Snapdragon
820 for a bit it seems apples upgrade
program became more of it than expected
and Microsoft admits that its surface
tablets aren't perfect I'm high Meadow
iveta and you all better go celebrate
today because it is my birthday this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Google the company has
decided to give you another discount on
its two new nexus smartphones we weren't
able to get that black friday deal you
can get the new Nexus devices for fifty
dollars off starting today and obviously
until the holidays end definitely the
deal when you consider the fact that you
also get free overnight shipping meaning
that if you buy that phone right now you
could probably get it tomorrow that's
really a good deal and speaking of
Google the company is invested on
getting you to use Android pay and
they're willing to pay you to do so if
you use Android pay on your Nexus
devices from here to the end of the year
you'll be getting a twenty dollar gift
card on best buy which you will
obviously get on your phone to use
androidpit best buy again you get the
point this is what the company is trying
to do and I feel that it's worth it why
not other official news come from
Microsoft as the company has now
admitted that even though it's new
surface tablets are great they are not
perfect they're claiming that a small
amount of consumers are experiencing
issues with a display and software and
that they have a full team of engineers
working on fixing this it's great to
know that something is being done it's
just sad to see them downplaying the
whole issue because a comment down below
they're experiencing that problem and
for all of you that felt that the apples
upgrade program for the iphone 6s was
not worth it think again i was on the
list of people that actually liked it
and it seems that a lot of consumers did
as alice were only predicting that apple
would sell fifteen percent of its
iPhones through the upgrade program and
as it turns out only through surveys
they blend that thirty-seven percent of
consumers actually cared about this and
if you think about it you get a free
well you get an upgraded phone every
year sorry about that and you also get
applecare which means you can swap it in
case something goes wrong
the deal is actually good obviously it
depends on the iPhone you pick but it
seems consumers agree and finally the
very interesting rumors today have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy s7 we've got
trusted sources claiming that the
Snapdragon 820 processor will beat and
exclusive to the Galaxy s7 during the
launch and for a certain period of time
and we do know that Samsung is working
with Qualcomm on this processor but we
wonder exactly how this will affect
other OEMs we know that every other OEM
is waiting for the Snapdragon 820
processor and this could mean delays for
just about every other competitor or the
fact that we're just going to have to
carry the older processors on the newer
phones for next year which is definitely
bad news if you think of it it could
also be that this is just an exclusive
version of the Snapdragon 820 which
we've already heard of it before but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that it's a good move for
Qualcomm to make its processor exclusive
to Samsung I don't think it is I feel
that the world is bigger than just
Samsung and particularly now but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion presence always you
