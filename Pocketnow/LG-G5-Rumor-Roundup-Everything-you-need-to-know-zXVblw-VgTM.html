anticipated phones of the year and it is
for a ton of reasons mainly because this
is one of the few companies that still
believes in the power user still
believes in expandability we have a
little rumor roundup do we prepared a
few days ago but obviously it's better
if we do it on video I'm hi I'm editing
that I was pocket now and here's our
room around above the LG g5 one of the
most important changes of the LG g5 is
its design this is the company that
still has a removable backs and
apparently the company is planning to
change everything the plastic design is
apparently going to be no more it seems
that the company is going for metal
which is the major rumor the back
buttons that a lot of people did not
like we're very polarizing in some cases
are apparently now going to the site
even though we do have some renders that
do show the buttons at the fact we
wonder if there will be some variants
that have different options you remember
the LG g2 had different variants in
different designs but probably one of
the most important changes will be how
do you bring expandability to this phone
apparently we are getting some sort of a
magic slot somewhere where you'll be
able to swap the battery and add some
extra storage this is going to be a
rather interesting phone in every way
mainly because again LG continues to
disrupt the design but yes we know that
its power users you care about
specifications a lot and we hear a
couple of things here starting with the
possibility of the Snapdragon 820 which
we're still polarized on mainly because
the Snapdragon 810 was supposed to make
it to the g4 and instead we got the 808
because of the bronze with the G flex 2
but yeah we're also waiting for 4 gigs
of ram in addition two options for
storage up to 128 gigs and expandability
as well which is also rather important
in addition to the bells and whistles
that we expect from every other flagship
though we're still debating on the
display is LG going to continue with the
quantum dot or at some point will they
bring their p OLED displays into
smartphones as well stay tuned for that
one but the most important feature of
the LG g4 and the subsequent b10 was its
camera it takes gorgeous photos and
we're expecting that to be a feature of
the g5 and we've got some conflicting
renders here
we saw them a few days ago it seems that
we're getting dual camera modules just
like we see what the v10 on the selfie
shooter it seems that we're getting back
cameras that are going to compensate up
to 24 megapixels meaning one module will
be 16 the other one will be eight
apparently these will add up but we're
not exactly sure what LG plans to do
with these two modules we wonder if one
is going to be wide angle of the other
one's going to be normal it is so hard
to predict but it is rather smart even
though the design is rather ugly stay
tuned for that one as well that's
probably going to be one of the most
polarizing topics going forward but
finally probably the biggest question we
have left for the g5 is exactly how does
LG plan to differentiate because surely
the magic slot could be unique the dual
cameras could be unique but you have to
remember that the smartphone market is
going through a very odd transition
where devices like the iPhone are no
longer selling that well and this would
be the great moment for LG to completely
stand out we have a couple of wishes
like for example the software to become
more cohesive for other features like
for example the display to take
advantage of the canvas a little more we
wonder if we're still getting g flex
functionality here or not so it does
lead me to the question of this video
what do you think will be that one more
thing that LG will bring to the table
because in my case I do feel that it has
to do with something from p 0 lead but
something from flexing as well but hey I
could be wrong leave us a comment down
below we would love to know your opinion
that's it for this video thank you very
