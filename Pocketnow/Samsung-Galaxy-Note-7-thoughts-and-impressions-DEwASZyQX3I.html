the same time in the same place before
yeah I know I realize that I know thank
you been here for I've been on the
channel for a couple months and like
I've been for a couple of years yes
that's that's never happened so we
should we should we should probably
rectify that we just came back from the
notes of an event we obviously have our
first impressions and I think it's time
to change that it's time to fix it yeah
I'm one Carlo swag now for Pocket now
I'm Jaime Rivera and let's discuss what
we liked the most and didn't like about
the Galaxy Note 7 I think it's only fair
that we begin this video by the things
that we actually like yeah let's start
positive because we were really
skeptical when we walked into this event
we kind of already knew what was going
to happen
you were underwhelmed over the lack of
specifications in theory but then we
actually had the opportunity to hold the
note 7 to see all the features that were
added and I'm gonna be honest with you
if you've ever held a note 5 probably
what I loved the most about the note 7
is the build the design sure it looks
like a galaxy s7 edge in every way but
that's actually a good thing well and
it's it's great watching the evolution
over the s7 edge right that's
symmetrical rounding of the glass on
both sides I thought was a really nice
design touch it shows that Samsung isn't
quite as stagnant as some of our
commenters might feel that they are odds
just don't know so there are these tiny
little attention to those details across
the whole phone actually what I like the
most is I don't I didn't even feel the
metal holding it although it was funny
listening to someone complain about that
too so it's definitely gonna be a
personal preference thing but I thought
that was a really nice way to keep the
design fresh keep feeling them yeah I
feel that probably again Samsung phones
are beautiful lately they've come up
with great designs I don't think there
was really more to be done with this
design I'm actually happy that they
pulled the s7 edge and just added more
features here that's probably what I
like the most well and we definitely
move on from that weird split that we
had last year with the note and the s6
edge+ where they were sort of mirror
images of each other yet out a glass on
one side and flat glass on the other and
the note walks away from that completely
it's it's own unique entry into the
Samsung Galaxy ecosystem samsung galaxy
goes this and that's the perfect segue
for the next one
but of course no phone is perfect and
walking away from even a first
impressions there are definitely some
things that I think will give some of
our viewers some concerns over a device
this expensive you know it's a laptop a
low-end laptop priced mobile device and
and initially it was just the the funny
situation of trying to shoot in a really
packed environment the lighting was
terrible the lighting was terrible we
did our best to not like blind you guys
with reflections all over the place but
it was really that issue they had people
standing at every station just so they
could wipe the phone down oh yeah every
time you touched it and that's not
really how these devices are gonna aged
and so you can watch in our videos like
the progression of fingerprint smudges
and you and I are much central than
normal weird sweaty manly dudes yeah but
I don't know I for me I'm already used
to the glass on glass I actually like it
I'm used to the whole wiping and stuff
what I don't like is the fact that you
know the note was always the vanguard
phone it was the phone which Samsung
used to showcase the latest version of
Android it was the phone that was used
to showcase the latest hardware it
actually allowed you to continue using
that note whenever the next s device
came and you were still proud that you
had a very powerful phone you weren't
worried that the Galaxy s8 or galaxy s7
would overshadow what phone you had and
the sadly the note 7 is again a note 5
it pretty much pulls on everything that
the S lineup comes with only with added
features that's probably what I didn't
like about it absolutely agree that
there's there's a perception of what the
note used to represent especially like
I've reaching the pinnacle at the note 4
and that script got flipped with the
galaxy s6 and the note 5 I'm so happy we
don't have to do the math on s6 note 5
yeah 7 across the board so that will
give them a thumbs-up for the naming
yeah but absolutely agree you do walk
away from this feeling like the note
pedigree has been somewhat diluted and
with you're picking up a note now what's
going to be coming out next year early
next year which is going to leapfrog the
note again and in buying a phone at the
tail end of the year yeah as you're
getting into those back-to-school sales
maybe this is a holiday purchase
something like that knowing that
something else is right around the
corner it does it I'm not saying it
should but it does
give someone a little pause before
dropping that much cash on a premier
flagship device it's pretty much what
happened with the Galaxy s7 edge I mean
I was really happy with my note 5 and
then Sam's like just completely blew the
note 5 off the map with the s7 edge up
it's the point where I just stopped
caring about it so really for me I feel
that Samsung could have tried harder
obviously certain chipsets aren't ready
I mean there isn't any phone with the
Snapdragon 80 to 3 yet or a 21 or a 21
so I think that this was not really
Samsung's fault but as reviewers and
obviously that's the problem we live in
a bubble we live in the bubble where we
know that we're gonna review the next
the next s8 so probably this for us was
a bad thing but not necessarily for the
average consumer this does not mean that
the note 7 was a bad phone in every in
any way I don't know it's just I guess
from our perspective could've been well
and it's also just it becomes an issue
of timing and what your budget and your
needs are yeah there's no doubt in my
mind that the note 7 is going to be one
of the best phones of 2016 that it's
gonna be one of the top sellers of 2016
those really aren't our concerns it's
for those members of our audience
especially the folks out there who are
responsible for making the purchasing
decisions in their family like you're
the resource that people turn to when
they have tech questions because you
watch our videos and drive so within
those kinds of situations that's where
we kind of feel like there needs to be
that little bit of advice and that's I
think it's gonna be a really precious
situation for a lot of people given the
price point on this phone knowing what
else is out there in the ecosystem and
if you don't have need for those
specific features that the note brings
to the table you're perfectly well
served with a Galaxy s7 or an s7 edge
yeah that's pretty much and speaking of
the signature element that makes a note
a note let's talk about the s-pen yeah I
am one of those users that does not care
about it
I just never loved the stylus I never
use it
but I think Samsung has progressed the
s-pen to a lot of really cool things
first of all I love that they made the
tip oh yeah it's a finer point it's a
finer point so if you've ever do you
remember those old markers those marker
pen pens from back in the day from the
90s I loved writing those things and
this s-pen feels just like that yeah
a really good handful it feels like if
you're not like if you grab the Apple
pencil you feel like if you're writing
on glass it feels unnatural I feel that
the s-pen is probably this s-pen
particularly is probably the one that
mimics the feeling of writing with a
marker absolutely and I also love the
fact that yeah Samsung brings a lot of
the old features of the note 5 that I
like like being able to write on the
display with it being off what I like
the most is the finely consolidated apps
like scrapbook that I never use those
like crazy suite of applications and now
it's just one Samsung notes yeah genius
move especially cuz I mean that's
definitely been a Samsung criticism in
our audiences for a while is the Samsung
float and I think for the note the s-pen
application suite was a perfect example
of a number of features that people were
probably not going to use cohesively but
they might like one little piece yeah we
might like this one little application
so it made perfect sense smash them all
into the same little bucket and that way
you don't have a hole you don't have to
have a folder just for your S Pen apps
yeah they already did that for you yeah
yeah I again I feel that Samsung I just
think that they took it to the next
level I'm not saying that it's gonna be
more useful I love that translator
feature yeah you know it's it's a nice
feature it's a nice feature I feel that
again the more that Samsung adds
functionality to them to the s-pen the
better it's gonna be like signing PDFs
on the note 5 was awesome alright this
is coming with this with this new note
and again whatever the company can
continue doing into making the phone
useful because that's when you move
things from being a gimmick to actually
being something that you will use yeah
the entire the entire year for Samsung
has really been focusing on those
details the attention to details and
s-pen was another perfect example of how
they could refine something which was
already pretty functional for a number
of people out there so the translator
feature if your productivity focused
business travelers something like that's
gonna come in handy and you're
definitely gonna be making use of that
that's what the note the pedigree of the
note is designed around is an
uncompromising mobile office solution in
the palm of your hand that fits in your
pocket yeah and it's all the other
little details that go into that too
like they address the pen gate
we actually tested that oh god okay so
we got this email from Tony reddit we're
right at the events and we get this
email from Tony and he's like dude can
you please test that S Pen backwards and
I'm like I am NOT getting kicked out of
the show
so while his back was turned I grab like
alright fine we didn't get kicked out so
but but it was it was a way they
addressed it though it was a beautiful
attention to those little details which
I feel we didn't get last year with the
s6 or with the note 5 because the body
changes were so significant there were a
lot of these little rough edges around
in each of those phones we don't have
that with Samsung this year and that's
where I think we really need to
celebrate them it's less exciting
because we don't have the significant
changes in design and aesthetics but you
end up with a better device you end up
with a more polished device and that I
really want to applaud Samsung for also
the the last point on s-pen for me was
making sure that the pen itself was
water and dust resistant yeah
so that the entire device the entire
little ecosystem of smartphones is
survivable in little bits of water you
know for dusting dress protection things
like that it's by no means rugged yeah
but you're a business traveler you're on
the go you're using this in really harsh
conditions you're you know you need to
rely on this thing so those little
details matter when you're on the go and
you can't have something like that Velen
and I think that's like the perfect
segue for the next segment indeed the
surprise and of course with being the
hip cool savvy gadget guys that we are
it's always nice when a device can
surprise us you know in that first
impression you think you go in knowing
everything that you need to know about
the device but there's always one or two
little things that take you by surprise
in that that's what makes this job so
much fun and for me it was holding the
note 5 and holding the note 7 and
knowing how similar they were in terms
of spec and screen size and seeing that
Samsung still managed to make the note 7
a little bit narrower yeah you know
those wraparound edges really do
contribute to making this not feel like
the behemoth that previous note phones
have felt like in the past and then I
was very surprised at how well the iris
scanner did I was training it on the
floor crazy lighting and it worked I
mean it just worked I mean that's always
a happy situation when you don't know
how looks something like
that's the thing about the iris scanner
I was recording to recap two weeks ago
and you know one of the commenters
immediately came in and said the purpose
of the iris scanner is awesome of year
in the winter you're wearing gloves you
don't you don't have to take your gloves
off wipe your fingers because they're
sweaty and then unlock your phone to be
able to interact with it you can simply
lift it up to your face and unlock it
and I was like oh my god this is the
best comment of the year
this is so true what if this is awesome
but there are other purposes like for
example I know cases of people that have
their smartphones and you know they
authenticate with their fingerprint but
they probably add their kids
fingerprints yeah to certain things just
because you know they lend their phones
to the kids and the iris functionality
and the way Samsung Knox is built is you
can literally only use one pair of
irises on this phone so if there are
even more secret things or private
things that you want to hold in that
Samsung private folder um the cool thing
is you will know that there are certain
things that only you can unlock
absolutely I was really surprised by
that and again just how fast it worked
oh yeah I was like you know knowing
Samsung the Samsung that we knew from
the galaxy s3 galaxy s4 I was gonna be
like oh my god and all we need is the
tap dancers at the end of the event it
is gonna throw everything off but no no
II think we didn't get that dancer you
know in our impressions from Barcelona
in our impressions from this unpacked
this is a very different Samsung yeah
this is a company that's more focused in
making products useful I am really
surprised and I feel that the company
really deserves the popularity that it's
gained this year mainly because it's
dedicated itself to refining what we
have yeah and it's very humble in their
press conference yeah oh yeah we don't
have a Samsung talking about this is the
most amazing things ever we have the
Samsung that's out there we're listening
to you
very humbly compressing your your
concerns we've brought back features
that you said you cared about from from
previous phones and this also really
demonstrates what the note represents
you know like fingerprints that's maybe
not always the best password if you
think about it yeah everything you touch
has your password on it yeah so for a
consumer facing products there are
definitely some applications for an iris
scanner that
be fun but this is really like if you
have corporate concerns business
concerns government concerns that you
need to lock down information that's
where this becomes a lot more impressive
that you have multiple modes of
authentication so that's what pushes it
beyond just being a gimmick yeah you
know it's the best of both worlds
fingerprint iris if you want to encode
you can just go with a pin you can
choose you're not obligated to use it
but these are always things night
they're nice to have and I think that's
that's the best segue for the question
of this video because we would really
love to know what you think about the
note 7 is this really a phone that
appeals to you I know that it's gonna be
a tough buy mainly because this phone is
literally worth $900 $900 it's expensive
yes it's not an inexpensive note and I
know a number of people in our audience
are gonna look at things like screen
resolution the processor Ram camera
prowess and they're they're ready for
that that really claw and tooth
comparison between a Galaxy s7 edge yeah
but we would really love to know would
you be interested in buying the note 7
does it appeal to you or are you gonna
wait for the s8 with all the rumors of
4k and everything please leave us a
comment down below we cannot wait to
respond to your comments and hear what
you think that is it for our first
impression video of the Galaxy Note 7 so
far we were surprised but obviously
