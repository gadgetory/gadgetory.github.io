bring up to five color options or at
least more than we thought we have least
of the Galaxy a7 that just emerged and
triple cameras are in tow and those of
you that are rocking current iPhones and
Apple watches you better hit that
software update button I'm high meta
Rivera and definitely I'm already
planning on the Halloween costume and
Diego says he wants to use the same so
tips in the description this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals yes the essential phone
is still on sale yes you can still get
some great deals fret but amazon halo
gray color essential variant is
currently available for three hundred
and ten dollars and bear in mind i find
it very hard for you to find the phone
that has better quality materials even
if the camera is not that great for
three hundred and ten dollars and yes i
could include any other phone out there
even the ones that are great right now
including the poco phone but don't
really work well in the united states
you can learn more in the description
now let's talk about oneplus as it seems
if a company doesn't want you to settle
and things other than smartphones even
if apparently we're not getting a
headphone jack and the next one it seems
that the company is working on either a
television or television either it's TV
programming or an alternative to TV
programming or they're working on
hardware it's still hard to predict but
apparently it's something that they're
working on for next year and given the
fact that companies like lee eco are no
longer in the market and they just
approaches it really bad i know that
there's a business opportunity I just
wonder for where now other official news
have to do with iPhones iPads and Apple
watches if you currently have one of
your devices I highly recommend you
update to iOS 12 and watch iOS 5 the
case of watch OS 5 my Apple watch is
currently updating but my god iOS 12 has
made my iPhone 10 from last year works
so well so smoothly that I'm already
wondering what I'm gonna do with the
iPhone 10s the operation is just great
and this whole feature of being able to
switch off applications at a certain
time this actually made me go to bed
earlier there are other features that
are great about this operating system we
will go in-depth
then whenever we get our units for
review for the iPhone 10s but so far so
good
now for those of you that didn't believe
the rumors that Samsung was working on
three cameras for a smartphone we've got
some leaked renders in the mid just to
show us that there is a phone that's not
an S it's a galaxy a which falls on the
reports that the company CEO was
committed to phones with a lesser price
tag to also bring the latest and
greatest Hardware of funny part is we
don't have that hardware and the S
lineup for the note lineup just yet but
yeah apparently the a lineup will launch
at some point this year with three
cameras stay tuned for that and finally
the hot news today I have to do with the
Google pixel three we've got two reports
that are coming out the first one when
it comes to color options apparently
it's not just going to launch and you
know black and white there are rumors of
a blue and also a pink edition of the
pixel which is great but more
importantly we've got two images shown
off by trusted sources that pretty much
claim that if case makers are already
working on the next pixels it means that
the design is set in stone so for those
of you that did not like the island of a
notch that thing is pretty much the size
of Long Island and I'm not exaggerating
yeah it seems that we're gonna get that
notch in the next generation pixel so in
the comments down below let us know what
you think number one about colors number
two about the long island knotch I hate
it but anyways leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow was i'm talking now
todd comment subscribe to both of our
channels english and spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
twitter hi me underscore to be better on
instagram at home it'll be better please
