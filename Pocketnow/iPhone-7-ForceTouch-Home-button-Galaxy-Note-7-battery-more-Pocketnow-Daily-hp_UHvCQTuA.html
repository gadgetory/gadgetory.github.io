touch might reach the home button
speculation over the galaxy note 7
doesn't take the battery too well and
Huawei has already begun its preparation
for its show at Aoife I'm hi meri behna
and i love wednesdays you're so close to
friday that it makes you want to
celebrate today too this is pocket now
daily official news today have a very
interesting deal coming from Amazon you
know how special offers come to the
Kindle you can allow special offers and
pay less for the hardware well that's
the same case right now with the Moto G
for in addition to one of the blue
smartphones that just launched a blue
are 1 HD you are paying fifty dollars
less for these products and all you have
to do is accept the fact that you're
getting ads on the lock screen which is
not bad i mean these are good phones and
hey you pay less for them and answer
sometimes useful when you think of it
other official news come from huawei
those of you wondering exactly when we
should expect the company successor to
whatever they made a tour the mate s
apparently it's going to happen on
September first set your calendars as
there will be a pre-event show at Aoife
we will definitely be covering it live
and we can not wait to see what we get
mainly because we'll always been doing
some really great stuff when it comes to
smartphones and write this down HTC vive
corporation that is the new name of the
company that share win just found that
you remember the news yesterday well
we've got confirmation that it's ten
billion dollars in funding from venture
capital and it's a few companies that
are actually forming this new HTC vive
corporation with the whole idea of
taking VR to the next level I really
like the vibe so I cannot wait to see
what comes out of this new company soon
another very trusted source has just
chimed in when it comes to the galaxy
note 7 and everything is almost the same
except for one thing we hear the 5.8
inch display in addition to the fact
that we're getting the problem
Snapdragon 823 six gigs of ram
waterproofing etc but what's different
here is that apparently the battery is
going to be of thirty six hundred
million hours not four thousand like we
heard
that might happen so we're pretty much
getting the same battery as we have on
the Galaxy s7 edge that could be not a
bad thing because obviously this new
processor could be more power efficient
but stay tuned August second is another
thing that was confirmed by this source
let's see and finally the very hot
rumors today have to do with the iphone
7 again this time because even though
we've been hearing that there aren't
many changes coming to the iphone 7 your
this one apparently the home button is
going away to a certain degree because
apparently Apple wants to pull the same
force touch trackpad deal that they did
with a new macbook you know you press it
and it feels like if you're pressing a
button but it's really nothing it's
really just the vibrating motor
apparently there's gonna be a flush
button on the iphone 7 or whatever the
name is going to be and you are going to
be getting vibrating feedback as you
press it and it'll allow you to do
different things and this will be a very
interesting design element from Apple
mainly because the home buttons been
there ever since forever so it leads me
to the question of the day what do you
think about this probability do you
think it's a good idea for a force touch
home button instead of a physical one in
my case I would prefer this actually
mainly because the because probably the
home button is that's the first thing
that goes ballistic whenever the product
ages so leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
you know the way it goes if you want to
get the news earlier before the video
was filmed phobos I'm out I've
