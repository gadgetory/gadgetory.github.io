pacquiao calm and we're outside
microvision about to see the pico p
projector that's a laser-based projector
so in your camera pick up a little bit
of probably our scan line mmm which
unless you can tell this is slightly
different than that you know where you
can sync it to like a CRT monitors it's
just so white cables we're going to make
it thinner cable what I said doesn't
then it's about so let's see here just
going to put it until spring whoops
through that there that's really going
to
so the point being is that if you want
to do an impromptu you know kind of
spontaneous presentation you can use
your netbook or it could be a windows
mobile cell phone the only difference
between this and selflessness has a lock
RGB out so it uses the vga cable which
is always a much thinner video signal
than TV TV our composite so Justin's
Tamara mine it's a plug-and-play device
so as you may have noticed when i plug
it in to the liar alright the vaio looks
like that i plug it in and what it does
is it automatically converts this and
that so they match so we see exactly the
same thing on here the bios you see up
there i think that's very very important
mm-hmm you know a lot of applications
it'll look different on here that
they're trying to figure what's going on
here thinks it shifted around so we made
it so what you see on the the netbook or
the cell phone or whatever it is looks
exactly the same whether they're there
anything that's really important so
again this is intended primarily in this
particular application for the you know
the road warrior the person who who
lives and breathes the elevator pitch
every day you know time is money I got a
few minutes your tie want to show you my
my product presentation selling you or
updated he remember trying to do so so
being able to plug it in and work like
that is great another thing that's
really great about it is that it's
always in focus so you know
the lights on a second there so
projectors don't like like I never use a
projector you turn the lights off
because this is this is black to a
projector gender comm project black so
make a little bit smaller so now I'm in
a very bright environment and I approach
them a little bit closer and you can see
I still have a very acceptable sort of
an 18 inch image that I can use so if
you turn lights all it's very clear okay
so i should come back and make it very
large so that's probably about an 80
inch display now again confirm if i have
the option to do that then I can make
the image extremely big put a little bit
now that your eyes have adjusted that's
actually quite bright so even at
microvision all the captain's I I I work
with if they always turn the lights off
and giving a presentation or dad and so
that gives you the capability to to
really really have a big screen but at
no point have I had to adjust anything
with the projector right it plug it in
I'll have to worry about adjusting some
strange focus button it just works and
that's what the beauty of it the other
nice aspect about it is which you
probably can't see in the dark is very
very thin the whole projectors 12 30
millimeters thick something like that
maybe 14 but the whole idea is that it's
it's basically the same size of the cell
phone so you can slip in your pocket or
purse carrier with you wherever you go
and
just get it out so waiting to visit your
number of these cases businesses case we
can be very strong it's something that a
lot of people asked us about when I use
before then there's the hole mobility
section for consumers and we think about
a two two areas one as you know the
person at how wants to use in the
bedroom to put up a big video pictures
from YouTube whatever is they want to do
and also the person who you know go to
my friend's house or go to Starbucks
River it is i want to share pictures
video and multimedia content with my
with my friends so those are kind of
three areas that we look at for this
type of noise it's a tri-color laser
system correct yeah I can get some some
pieces out if you like okay farmer to
show you a be great but what it is it's
light sources on laser it's a red blue
and green laser and then we have a
little min scanner and what we do is we
literally pay the image if you can come
a little bit closer you're going to see
some of the raster lives kind of like a
CRT mm-hmm and we scanned left right and
right to left we literally paint the
image line by line to build up an image
you come to the bottom go to the top
again we do it all over again so it goes
up and down so it goes left like this
mm-hmm back forward back up for words we
paint Lily think about painting little
asian mm-hmm into the bottle flips back
up again let me do it again oh hey so
start from the top and goes down to the
barn so maybe 60 times a second wow
that's a lot so we get a 60 first
refresh rate and as you can see you
don't see a lot of flicker
you kind of see on the video but that's
just because the camera does the other
things yes exactly it's not exactly 60
Hertz it's close to that so if you don't
match it exactly you'll see that so
we're actually be launching it in in
those two colors initially blue and
graphite rice so you can see that and
there's the buttons on the side and the
window where they compare in size to a
credit card absolutely you might have
something it's like a credit card
without actually showing my numbers I
use your phone you could have in this
bowl here's a gift card there you go so
it's a little bit in comparison to a
credit card it's a little bit wider than
a credit card but only about an inch
taller than a credit card so that's
great so we have a motorola q fo see
it's the same length and I knew
something that I Lando airport the
language or so you not as wide that's
great so it's about the same size as a
cell phone the right yeah and the whole
idea is that yes you can put it down but
also is to be able to hold it in your
hand and how much does so the bits and
pieces oops what's it is Right Watch air
so the heart of it is the men's scanner
wow that's small and if you look right
in the middle there is a little mirror
maybe it's reflecting you see that yeah
there in about there okay mirror is
etched out of a piece of silicon and it
oscillates vertically and horizontally
and if you combine those two motions
very carefully together you can get a
cigs all pattern like a rester raster
pattern and then this is one of the
lasers and basically what you do is you
point the laser beams that we combine
there's a red blue and a green laser we
combine those optically to a single beam
what's the nanometer wavelength um so
green is about 5 30 or so blues around
about 440
red is it about 640 we can get you the
exact numbers if you like okay but if
you shine that tiny very narrow beam at
the mirror you can see it's a mirror
moves the beam will be steered and
that's how it works the entire
projection module it's inside here is is
this it's about five cc's total size and
just seven millimeters thick Wow small
well one of the nice things about it is
that about our technology is that as we
go to higher resolutions and we have a
roadmap to go to higher resolutions
right now we're wvga so as we move to
higher resolutions the size of this
doesn't change much in fact it may
actually get a little bit thinner and
that's really really important if you're
trying to embed it inside say a cell
phone the thinner it is the higher the
better chance of embedding it because it
needs to be one of a number of layers
inside the cell phone so that's really
one of our big strengths is the ability
to make a very very thin the high
resolution projection module one other
thing you may have noticed from from the
image our field of you is very wide so
if you stand you know 60 inches from the
wall the image is 60 mil 60 inches
across so it's a throw ratio of one to
one all that means is that you're closer
to a bigger image so if I am sharing a
presentation with a couple of colleagues
if i was using one of our competitor
devices in the image would be half the
size by area hmm so we're twice as big
it gives a much more immersive
experience
so what we like to tell people this is
as big as we'll ever be oh great it's
going a lot smaller this over time and
that houses all those components inside
those that's right the red blue green
laser the optical combining and the
scanner now external to this is a PCB
and that PCB will get smaller and
smaller as we move to new chips towards
the latter half of this year so the
entire projector if you include the PCBs
it's basically twice the size of that
very approximately very very
approximately and again just seven
millimeters thick we don't use
projection lenses of that this way
there's there's no typical projectors
you know the big round lands and you got
to adjust the focus we just have a
window Wow we're not actually projecting
in the same way we're scanning an image
so there's a battery honestly on the
inside and you can you change the
battery you can solve the battery yes
that's good feature yep so what's up
just a typical battery of puffs in there
and will last depending on what your
you're showing it will last perhaps 90
minutes or more or a little bit less and
the reason before that is we're a little
vague about that and that is we actually
modulate the light source and what that
means is we create every pixel fight if
I need a blue line the blue laser goes
on but the green red are not used
effectively so okay a typical picture or
movie or whatever is about twenty
twenty-five percent on and seventy-five
eighty percent off white versus black if
you think about it hmm right so we take
advantage of that by only using light
sources during that 20 25 percent on
period and the rest of time it's all
foam saving power so if you watch my
life say we watch toy story or in a
cartoon he's probably closer to thirty
percent on versus off if you were to
watch the dark knight or it's probably
closer to less than ten percent on
versus
percent off big amount of dark movie
that means your battery will last longer
if you watch a darker movie oh it's a
great feature because a lot of LCDs they
just use the same amount of power they
just delight is blasting away regardless
before your show and that helps us
because we get great contrast so if we
really might especially like this
picture because it looks great it's also
my dog if you come up closer to the
image to get a bit closer you can see
the level of detail so it is only a WVGA
display so it's pouring any Lions not
like these big business projectors are
thousands in Paris which it's it's much
more specific but even at 480 lines you
still get a very clean ability we have
these exceptional colors as well it's
really the widest color range of pretty
much any display so deep blues greens
and reds for the wavelengths that I i
mentioned to you get these fantastic
colors this is really saturating the
rose yeah they don't have to use those
well that's amazing you can actually
bring those colors into something that's
more equipment with TV right but the
nice thing about having the bright
colors is a kids you makes it look
brighter so I do really good on skin
tones and things like that still I'm
really good on readability 10-point top
irritability and I really excellent
detail so yeah be nice to have high
resolution but for the applications but
you really don't need it wvga is it's
very sufficient actually really like
this picture here because it just it
really shows and wvga is the highest
that Windows Mobile will now support at
this time exactly so all right but
except that you could use it on an f own
words but again the detail you see the
colors Andy Perez so you can really
create almost any color and we have
grayscale to create a level of detail
that you seen and again all the time I
like this image with mr. Bray but all
the time if you can go a nice and close
a really bright image or we go really
big here we're probably inches black a
little bit right lamp on the door there
look pretty amazing so imagine you know
your new bedroom or perhaps you're lying
in your bedroom hotel there's your
ceiling that's a lot better than the TV
they give you that's right this limit
your pocket plug it into your mobile
device it was a pitch darker get a
little bit feel small and it would look
right because your eyes with adapt that
our last be pretty good now
