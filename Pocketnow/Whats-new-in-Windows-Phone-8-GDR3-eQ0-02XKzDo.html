now and I've got gdr3 for windows phone
8 installed on this nokia lumia 925
right here and we're going to take a
look at what's new with this operating
system update before we start if you
want to learn how to install this on
your own windows phone 8 search pocket
now for how to install windows phone 8
gdr3 and you'll see some instructions so
let's check it out first I want to show
you my favorite new feature so let's go
to the settings and right now you can
see that the internet sharing mode is
turned off but over here on my tablet
let's just put the phone right there if
I go to settings we have I've paired
this phone with my surface tablet via
bluetooth soon I have bluetooth right
there so it's got a Bluetooth connection
it's not connected right now but say I
go into these settings and then the
network the wireless networking icon
right there and we see the Lumia 925
shows up so let's connect and it's going
to take a little bit
and you can see over there it has
automatically turned on the internet
sharing on my phone so and now we're
connected to it it's limited right now
but it'll be internet access in a second
so you can imagine maybe the phone is
sitting on the charger somewhere or
maybe it's in your pocket you can start
up a Windows 8.1 tablet and very easily
just access the internet without having
to take the phone out or turning on that
intimate sharing feature next I want to
look at some new ease of access features
so if we go into the signs here we can
turn on mobile accessibility and what
this does you got to download a new app
that enables us and then restart the
phone and it'll have a speech interface
for you know all sorts of other things
that aren't normally part of the
operating system so i'm going to show
you the app this is what launches after
you do the restart morning bubble
accessibility will not be a pound one of
seven so this is a new interface and
it's designed so you can use it without
looking at the screen so we have
gestures contacts two of seven i do
right Chester three of seven it moves to
the next item male 4 of 7 went five of
seven and then you can DoubleTap
anywhere page to activate that item to
open the address bar and it's telling me
all the time what to do page has one
quick menu address bar keyboard open
lower case mode metrical w delete em
entered entered 0 entered see enter k
entered eat injured
and entered and entered w injured w
dylan and deleted now if you're blind
using this keyboard might be difficult
so that the way to do is hold your
finger down you 00 injured and then let
go so we do like this GF w w entered h
com.com entered downloading page so you
can imagine tap to open the address bar
if you can't see the screen page has two
frames two headings 127 elements and 65

1534 906 dash 7 to downloading page
let's get out there now driving mode is
another new feature let's check that out
and what's interesting about this you
know the idea is to make it safer for
driving it's going to ignore calls and
right here you can turn that on ignore
calls or north texts and you can make it
automatically reply with a pre-written
message that you can type right here and
that would be great but you can't turn
this on unless you pair it with a
specific Bluetooth device and what's
interesting is if I have a bluetooth
device I don't need to ignore calls and
text messages with Windows Phone because
it's able to read those messages to me
and i can reply
with the speech recognition software and
it's all very easy to know handle
without taking your eyes off the road so
I can set my motorcycle helmet as a
driving mode enabled device and whenever
I connect that it's going to do the
column of ignoring and text message
reply thing but I won't do that because
I can actually use it when I have
Bluetooth device I kind of wish I could
man we turn this on when I'm in a car
without a Bluetooth device because
that's when I would actually need to use
it anyway we also have some custom
ringtone and sound upgrades you can now
choose customer sound effects for your
text messages and whatnot in addition to
the ringtones but previously was just
the ringtones and if you open a contact
and you go to edit that contact you also
have a new option here text tone so I
can set a specific tone when that person
text messages me so let's choose that
one ringtone was always there so you
guys specify a specific ringtone for
each person there's a new item screen
rotation you can turn it on and off
there's a lock it in whatever position
you are currently in so now it's locked
in landscape mode that doesn't really
work see if I tilt it this way it does
not switch however some parts do not
support landscape mode so you're kind of
its going to switch anyway the phone
storage control panel settings area also
has been updated and we can tap the
phone and now you can see a whole
breakdown of what is using how much
space on your phone and all the way at
the bottom we have temporary files and
you can delete them
it's the delete button there so you can
free up some space by deleting temporary
files finally and lastly the new tasks
switching interface we now have a little
X in the corner of each thing that
you've opened recently and you can close
them like so it's not really necessary
to close these I because you know
Windows Phone manages the memory on
these are very well the only real reason
is it's these are recently used
applications so you just want to get rid
of them I guess there's a few other
features that gdr3 brains but we can't
show you them on this device because
they require new hardware for example it
will bring support for larger screens
with a 1080p resolution and you'll have
another column live tiles there you know
much larger and it'll support some new
quad-core processors as well so that's a
quick look at Windows Phone 8 with gdr3
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
