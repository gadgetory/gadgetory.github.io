packing.com and today issued a pretty
cool game called par-72 golf and if you
have a little bit of spare time you play
this on your own so the first thing I'm
going to do is actually go to a new game
and I can select which course I want to
play so I have a few different courses i
think there's three on this free version
you can just click let's see i'm going
to click desert palms here and as you
can see it changes we pick between a
male and a female player and we can
change our opponent so right now there's
none so let's play against Liz we can
start the game and it's pretty simple
now if I want to see the course all i
have to do is click on this button right
here and it'll actually show me the
whole course I can't even zoom in or
zoom out there's a few buttons you might
not be able to see it too clearly but
there's a couple little buttons on the
side and we can just get unpause that
and we can select our club if we want
right now it's on a 1 w and up here we
can see which hold on one whole one par
4 1 score 0 yards 405 yards to the hole
and which club we're using and the wind
speed in which direction it's going so
to play all i have to do is click on
this little ball down here and the power
meter will go up all the way or i can
select which wit or where i can select
one to stop it and select my own power
i'll show you that in just a second so
now it's my opponent's turn let them
play real quick apparently they're a
little bit better than I am well I guess
not shittin goes far so let let her go
again ok so now it's my turn again so as
you can see I can select which club I
want but it's already predetermined
which club is best for this shot so just
go back click the ball and now i'm going
to stop it right here
not too great of a shot I can also move
it over if I want to I can click these
buttons down at the bottom or I can drag
it as you can see I can drag the screen
over to move it so that looks pretty
good the winds going four miles this way
so I'm going to try this let's see that
looks pretty close my opponent will
shoot one more time okay so my final
shot let's see the wind is blowing five
miles this way not too much oh darn okay
well anyways as you can see that's the
game can also turn the sound off if we
want we can go to help information and
about information can also resume the
game so this is par 72 golf and this is
the lite version which is actually free
to download on windows mobile
marketplace and the full version is six
dollars and ninety-nine cents and this
is another marketplace pick where you
pick some fun and interesting games and
applications on windows mobile
