might be in for lots of storage no he is
now rumored to finally make a comeback
and this time with Android the galaxy
notes have been durability tests don't
make Gorilla Glass 5 look good I'm hi
Mary vera and the part that I hate the
most about not being able to train over
sprained ankle is how easy I gained
weight this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with uncarrier
12 from t-mobile which we could call a
deal to a certain degree reason why is
because the company is planning to kill
the data plan no longer do you have data
buckets or overages if you choose the
company's new tmobile one plan and the
plan here is a you pay seventy dollars
for the first line fifty dollars for the
second one and then twenty dollars for
every other line up to eight lines and
there are a lot more details including
tablets etc and a link in the
description but the point is you have
unlimited everything up until you start
considering that binge on will throttle
your video speeds and pretty much
everything else and speaking of deals
t-mobile just a spurred trend as sprint
followed very closely to and carrier 12
it announced there are new unlimited
plans which are very similar to
t-mobile's except you paid ten dollars
less over the first line compared to
t-mobile so you're paying sixty dollars
which is reasonable it's really good
it's pretty much the price that you end
up paying for prepaid in some carriers
the thing about it is you don't get the
benefits from uncarrier on sprint even
though that doesn't necessarily mean you
get bad service again you can learn more
on the link in the description now as
will the spotlight over to the samsung
galaxy note 7 one of the biggest selling
points of this phone is the fact that
it's Gorilla Glass 5 for those of you
that don't remember when we announced
Gorilla Glass 5 the whole point here is
that you got taller shadow resistance so
for gorilla glass 4 was from the waist
down and then for Gorilla Glass 5 is
from your height probably yours not
necessarily mine and then to the floor
that's great great shadow resistance
with the problem is that we've got some
videos that you can watch in the links
that show us that it's not necessarily
more scratch resistant actually it's far
less scratch resistant than Gorilla
Glass 4 again a lot of drama in the
video but it sure proves that you might
want to get a sweet sector I let's talk
about iphone one of the products that
actually
held up well in that scratch test in
previous videos point now is that we've
got trusted sources claiming storage
options again we have heard this before
but obviously as we get closer we could
say that it's more confirmed apparently
we're starting at 32 gigs instead of 16
we're following the whole pro model 32
gigs starting than 128 gigs up to 256
gigabytes and I had problems filling up
128 gigs up to the point where my
success as a 64 gig because it was just
overkill but would you be able to fill
up 256 gigs and don't say you'd do it
with porn please that's too predictable
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with Nokia the company that used
to be one of our favorite smartphone
makers died with Microsoft then became
nokia again and this is the finland
company that has hired Foxconn to build
tablets and apparently we've got smart
phones coming very soon we're talking q4
up to a possible early next year which
makes a lot of sense given mwc and CES
now it has a very big presence at mwc so
it could just be a we'd have to wait
until then but apparently we have 200
smartphones coming these will be running
Android nougat so obviously it'll depend
a lot on that but hey it leads me to the
question of the day actually two
questions number one would you like an
Okie android smart phone number two what
would you want nokia to bring in my case
I just want those amazing cameras from
Nokia with everything that we've seen
from the company over the years but
