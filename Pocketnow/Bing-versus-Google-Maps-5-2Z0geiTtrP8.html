today both Bing and Google released
updates to their apps for Android I'm a
google side it was their Google Maps app
and on the big side it was the bing app
for Android but what are they what can
they do which one does what better let's
go find out right now alright so
Microsoft has updated their bing app for
android and google has updated their
Maps app for Android now showing you the
differences between both of them in
detail would just make for way too long
a video and I know you don't want to see
that so we're just going to kind of
touch on some top level differences and
then we're going to jump right into Maps
because that's really where the big news
centers around so first and foremost
being installs one icon one app that's
it Google on the other hand Google Maps
installs not only the Maps app but also
latitude navigation and places which are
really just different views inside the
Maps app so you don't have to download
four separate apps it does all of them
so these icons then become more
shortcuts into specific areas of Google
Maps the app now one thing not related
to the Maps app is google search and
this is running android 2.1 so it's not
running the latest version of the google
search widget so that's why it looks a
little bit older but what this does is
obviously it lets you search Google
either using your keyboard or using your
microphone so not part of the maps but
that's the functionality that you get
from bing so let's go ahead and jump
into Bing over here we'll open that up
it animates up shows you the the being
logo and then loads what I like to call
the being wallpaper and just like being
the search engine it has these little
hot spots that tell you information
about the picture so just kind of
interesting tidbits not really useful to
what you're trying to do but
informational about you know just being
in general now when it opens up you see
that it opens what I call the task tray
now this is pretty much the same thing
as Google separate apps over here it
lets you search for other stuff and and
customize things go into
movies go into Maps go into local which
local and places are the same maps and
maps are the same directions and
navigation are pretty much the same
movies Google doesn't have a version for
maps that that covers that and they
don't have images but both of those are
available through the google search
itself so in a different place but still
you're able to do that so let's go right
into maps and show you the difference so
here is bing maps and here is Google
Maps 5 and over here I've got San
Francisco California all queued up so
let's go ahead and do that over here now
we're both on Wi-Fi and I don't know if
you saw that but here if we zoom out you
can see I've got a grid that needs to be
filled in and that's the way things used
to be with Google Maps here you can see
I can zoom out quite a bit and it loads
up the grid quite a bit faster now the
difference between the two grid styles
this is still using bitmap grids meaning
it's actually an image like a JPEG image
or an actual bitmap image and every time
i zoom it kind of scales those but then
it has to pull in new tiles for me
google used to have 256 x 256 grids now
instead of just true bitmaps now they
have what are called vectors and vectors
are a lot faster than bitmaps they also
require quite a bit less download size
to get that information and it's just
really really fast so we can come in
here and zoom in all the way into San
Francisco just really fast and I still
have the vectors that were already
loaded I just get more information and
those vector tiles get a lot more
precise the closer i zoom so if I do the
same thing over here and zoom in and yes
I could be doing a spread to zoom or
using the zoom buttons but we'll just
use the the double tap to zoom here so I
can show you on both devices so here we
are resumed in pretty much to the same
area the Mission District here in San
Francisco and you can see other than a
little bit different style we get
basically the same information but
here's where things get different if I
take two fingers over on Google
five tap and pull down it tips my map
down so that I'm seeing more of a 3d
view if I do that over here in the zooms
it doesn't know what to do because it
doesn't have that 3d capability that
this has now 3d is really where this is
at so let's zoom in a little bit and we
get more details oom it a little bit
more and you can see all the buildings
pop up that we showed you that in a
prior video and it's really really cool
and for some reason on the Samsung
device here I can't rotate it like I
would expect to be able to do on some of
the other devices but we can't even
rotate by the digital compass like you
can with other devices don't know why
that is but still very cool i can see
all these buildings i can zoom in and
get a lot more detail and as i scroll
around it's just very very fast so
really cool over on the Microsoft side I
don't have that but I still do have the
ability to zoom in and out and get the
information that I need you'll notice i
also have traffic information now i get
traffic information on the other side as
well so it's about the same thing it
shows me where traffic is heavy so I can
avoid those and that really comes into
play when we are talking about
navigating so let's jump right into nav
okay so to get into navigation on bing
maps we go to menu and directions it
asks us where we want to start from and
where we want to end so let's come over
here to our endpoint and let's say San
Francisco California if thinks about
what I said recognize it and then we can
hit go to do the same thing over here
we're going to go into menu if we can
remember where the where the menu button
is on the samsung epic 4g and we're
going to go to directions from
directions we're going to go from my
location to the end point for the end
point we're going to choose san
francisco california we could also have
done a voice input there as well now one
thing is right away we can choose we
want to drive if we want to walk if we
want to write a bike or if we want to
take mass transit so we'll do a vehicle
that's one thing that Google does really
well is they've got mass transit and
other options in there so here is how we
drive to it and if you can see there are
a little bit different ways that they
have this presented here on google we
have a turn by
turn while this also has turn by turn
but it kind of shows us an overview I
like the overview a little bit better
than the turn-by-turn but it's it's nice
either way so let's go ahead and hit go
and zooms in to our starting point if I
hit the navigate arrow it launches over
into google maps and navigation which is
the nav side of google maps now
navigations been using vectors for quite
a while and it's something they really
didn't out they didn't advertise but
that's what to let you have a little bit
more precise a little bit faster way to
navigate through on the Google Maps
Navigation side rather than the Bing
side so let's talk about being for the
time being so this gives me here I am
and as I Drive it will update my
position with that little dot and as I
get to a new turn it will tell me what I
need to do next so there's my next step
my next step and on along my route now
earlier versions of the app it would
show you your point on the map but it
would keep the the map tile centered so
that was kind of lame the new version i
don't believe does that it keeps the map
centered around where you are so it's a
little bit more useful but it doesn't
have some of the advantages that Google
Maps Navigation has all right so Google
Maps Navigation is you've all seen this
before so we'll just be really brief the
first thing you've got is kind of this
3d tilted view it helps you see where
you're going and realize kind of a
better view of the roads and the turns
that are that are coming up rather than
the the Bing Maps version now up at the
top you've got this nice little grain
direction arrow it says hey in this
direction in zero feet you're going to
go straight that's because I'm not in my
car otherwise i would say hey quarter
mile turn right or five miles turn left
you know whatever my next direction is
so I know in advance which way I need to
prep to turn it also shows me where I am
now and where I'm heading so really nice
really easy way to to see it also shows
me down here on my route how long it's
going to take and in this case I've got
a green light meaning traffic from now
through
way down the road is green if I needed
to I could tap on that and choose an
alternate route that would get me around
some traffic or some some backlogs and
you can see wherever they have traffic
data it's green I've got a little bit of
a slow down over here in west wind over
a little bit more over there so if i
needed to choose another route I could
do that really easy and quickly so
really nice one thing that I do like is
up here this green that looks just like
the the freeway signs that show you
upcoming exits and whatnot so the the
travel metaphor you know the directional
this is where you want to go is carried
over into the app and it does that
really well in my opinion so if I had to
choose between navigating between Google
Maps Navigation and Bing Maps well I
don't think there's much of a comparison
here now if I were looking for a
full-featured everything in one app
well-beings got it beat especially if
you're looking up movies and whatnot
that's really good over here on the
other side Google is faster because it's
got those vector images it seems to be a
bit faster to load as well a bit faster
to recognize directions so just all
around a quicker experience and we're
talking about phones that are pretty
much the same speed so that's really not
a you know a factor in how fast they are
but it's interesting to look at the two
different and really for running apps as
far as maps and navigation go and see
how well they do at everything they're
both free they're both in the market and
I recommend them both though I do lean a
little bit more towards the Google Maps
Navigation if you like Bing Maps better
I'd like to know why and if you don't
like Google Maps five I would also like
to know why go ahead and leave us
comments down below make sure you
subscribe to our video channel so you
can see more of these side by side
comparisons so showing off google maps
five versus the bing app for android i'm
