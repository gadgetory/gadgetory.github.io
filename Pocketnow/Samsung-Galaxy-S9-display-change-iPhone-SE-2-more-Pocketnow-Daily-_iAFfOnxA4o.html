beat Apple in the screen to body ratio
department we hear the Cupertino is
planning a refresh to its polished
iPhone and the razor phone doesn't seem
to be enjoying much happiness with its
camera performance I'm Jaime Rivera and
happy late Thanksgiving I was traveling
yesterday that's the reason why we
couldn't have a video for you but there
we go today
this is parking out daily I am NOT going
to bore you today with deals because
today is Black Friday and you all are
pretty much making a line trying to get
yourself something a new TV or whatever
but if you want to get yourself
something unique microsoft has just the
partner with samsung for a Galaxy Note 8
that's focused on Microsoft software
meaning Microsoft launcher and all the
suite of Microsoft applications which
they pretty much did with the s8 and si
plus as well now if you think about it
you're gonna pay 930 bucks for this and
right now you can get a ton of buy one
get one free deals for the Galaxy Note 8
and just install the software on your
own so ya next news now let's talk about
the razor phone I have been expecting my
review unit for a bit it should come in
the mail soon but the biggest problem is
that we already hear complaints about
its camera performance up to the point
where the company CEO just came on
record on Facebook to say that they are
working on it now working on it doesn't
necessarily have a date we don't know
exactly how long it'll take but I even
told you in my impressions of the razor
phone hmm
Samsung ISO cell sensor it didn't sound
well but anyways I'll talk about Apple
as the company has pretty much built the
largest AR platform where they are ket
since you can use your iPhone pretty
much for it but it's the company does
want to get itself a headset up to the
point where it just invested thirty
million dollars on a company called VR
vana and the headset is horrible let's
hope this is not going to be even close
to the final design but yeah it seems
that AR is going to get a headset from
Apple as soon as they figure it out and
for those of you that joined juan-carlos
back Nell and has banned them for the
iPhone se being the smallest iPhone and
how easy it is to operate it well there
seems to be a refresh in the works
apparently in the first half of 2018
which should get a new iPhone S II not
exactly sure if we're gonna get a new
but hopefully new guts even though the
current iPhone se is quite the powerful
iPhone you can learn more in the
description and finally the very hot
remembers today have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S and LAN we've got two
interesting sources one that's claiming
that it will be announced at CES
launched in March but I've heard that
for three years so I'm not gonna believe
in that one the second one is that it
plants the challenge the screen to body
ratio of the iPhone 10 currently the
iPhone 10 is 83% this one plans to be 90
percent and that is one that I would
love to confirm it it makes sense there
shouldn't be a notch on this phone and
it should just be display so why not the
thing is that the previous rumours that
we heard said that the display wasn't
going to change with the galaxy s 9 it
was just going to change the back and
bring dual cameras but it leads me to
the question today do you think that
Samson could just relax and keep the
design of last year in the front or do
you think that it wouldn't make sense
for it to challenge screen to body ratio
in my case I would like the s8 s9 to
remain the same but hey let's see what
they come up and we would love to know
what you think in the comments down
below
