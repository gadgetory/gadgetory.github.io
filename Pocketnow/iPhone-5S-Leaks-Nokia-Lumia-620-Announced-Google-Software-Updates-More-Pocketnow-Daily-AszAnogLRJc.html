launches their new Lumia 620 and Google
those crazy with software updates today
I'm hi meri behna wondering why old
Android devices can't get google now and
this is parking out daily that's right
google has gone crazy today with
software upgrades on the iOS I the
YouTube application now supports the
iphone 5 and also the ipad which is then
before and then when it comes to android
first of all Google now is a service now
supports boarding passes their line
services and everything else now it's
got enhancements to google voice that
you didn't see before and finally the
coolest one is the fact that Google
Translate now supports the fact if you
just take a photo with text and then OCR
will translate everything on the go kind
of cool and it's all free so make sure
you upgrade and then on the Windows
Phone side no kids just announced their
Lumia 620 which is a budget-minded
device it doesn't have those
budget-minded specs it brings the
interchangeable colors the replaceable
battery and the replaceable storage that
we see on the Lumia 820 but it's not as
bad as the Lumia 610 that we saw months
ago the device will be available in q1
2013 and yeah I know q1 is comprehended
by three months but hey that's what we
know now the company that clearly hasn't
figured out windows phone 8 yet is
Samsung they're much expected at Eve S
has been delayed for months and now it's
going to be delayed even more because
we're now expecting it to come until
februari 2013 if you were looking for
this device you might as well look
elsewhere now on the positive note
Android is always great when it comes to
Samsung they've just released android
4.1 point2 to the samsung galaxy s3 and
it brings the multi-window support that
we know and love in the galaxy note 2 so
make sure you hit the update at least in
the unlock models for now and let us
know in the comments down below if you
got the upgrade now HTC is an Android
offering for 2013 is already making it
to rumor mill we've got an m7 codename
device that has the same bells and
whistles as we already know on the
verizon droid DNA to send 1080p display
the same processor everything will most
likely see this device being launched at
mwc 2013 but it's just interesting to
see that the future flagship line of HTC
will look exactly like a
that we already know we'll see and
finally for the oh no please stop news
of the day we've got iphone rumors again
yes there are images of a proble iphone
5 casing already in the market and
apparently it's going to have a couple
of minor tweaks here and there and most
probably it will have some enhanced
software but it looks exactly like the
iphone 5 that we already know it'll
probably just be called the iphone 5s
and that leads me to the question of the
day what do you think about apple's new
scheme hopefully it is a new scheme
we're not really sure but they revamp
the ipad just six to seven months after
their third generation ipad so do you
like apple to be revamping their device
so often lee or would you like for apple
to do this every year like they used to
everybody in favor of apple doing this
every year say I with me because I am
but leave us a comment down below and if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet well make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
high memory better thanks for watching
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
