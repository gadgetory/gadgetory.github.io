pocket now calm and we've got a really
exciting unboxing for today it's the
Dell Venue not the venue pro which is
running windows from seven the dell
venue is running on android 2.2 and we
really really like the dell venue pro it
has super high quality in terms of a
build quality it was fast it had
fantastic fit and finish and the Dell
Venue running Android should have these
same exact qualities and it's finally
available let's get to the unboxing
alright the big thanks to our friends at
negri electronics for hooking us up with
the dell venue they actually are one of
the very few places that are selling it
right now so good place to get it now
the dell venue is actually going to work
on tmobile as far as we know sort of
like the dell venue pro so that means it
has the it's the 1700 and 2100 UMTS
bands it doesn't do hspa+ so you're not
going to get those sort of whoa the sort
of 4G speeds here so let's try to see
what we can get inside alright we got
some packaging here so here it is pretty
darn sweet again the dell venue is like
the venue pro except that of course it
has android and it has no slide out
keyboard let's see let's look at the
bands here we've got there we go UMTS
1700 and 2100 the bands needed to do the
the t-mobile 3g speeds here let's look
at the back it says a 4.1 inch AMOLED
screen so this is a really sweet spot
because it's bigger than the galaxy yes
but it's smaller than the hd7 or the evo
so you get a really nice size and it's
really the biggest mo let's screen on
the market 4.1 inch 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor 8 mega mega pixel
camera we've got you know UMTS and gsm
of course and this is the black model
apparently comes in other colors too so
let's try to rip into this really
excited to see if the build quality is
as extremely high as the dell venue pro
and this is 16 gigabytes of internal
storage curious to see if it has
the oh I see it actually it's through a
microSD card okay so let's open this up
and here we go Wow very thin I expected
this to be a lot thicker having used the
dell venue pro which is kind of a thick
device but this is a slender slender
device really cool looking let's put it
aside and again here's the amazing dell
fit and finish we get this textured
backing feel super high quality and it's
got the curved glass display anyhow
let's put the stuff aside see what Dell
is including in the box for their most
recent android phone and of course this
is dell's third android phone the first
was the arrow the second was the streak
although the streak was kind of tablet
with the 5-inch display do we have any
or anything special european plug
interestingly because this has the
t-mobile us bands and it has the
european plug yes uses of course micro s
micro USB instruction guide okay let's
put that stuff sign let's take a look
here at the dough venue so let's peel
off the peel off this piece of plastic
here to reveal the large 4.1 inch screen
beautiful this feels awesome in hand
we've got a dedicated mute switch here
which is always welcome we've got the
three android buttons thankfully they
did not include the search button
finally OEMs are starting to remove the
search button and go with minimal
layouts like we have here let's remember
to the side we've got you know kind of a
chrome strip 8 megapixel camera with
flash see what popping off the backing
is like here we go back here it comes
with a 16 gigabyte microSD card class
for much better than class 2 of course
the slot there for the for the SIM card
let's take a look at this next to some
other android phones really awesome
screen by the way let's take a look at
it next to the Nexus S now the nexus s
also is a curved display but it curves
differently kind of curves inward like
that and the of course the venue has the
curve in this direction which actually
makes it feel more interesting and kind
of high quality this is Gorilla Glass by
the way so you're not going to have a
scratch it too easily let's take a look
at it next to the Samsung Focus so
kind of a galaxy s like phone it's got
the 4 inch super amoled screen over here
we've got the 4.1 inch AMOLED display
it's quite thin actually I'm surprised
although relative to your going to see
next to the captivate for example it's
pretty thick so next to the focus it's
pretty thin and let's bring over the
captivate over here and here we go so
these are sort of similar spec devices
and the captivate is just much thinner
than the venue so first impressions is
that doubt did it again with build
quality we're going to have to take a
look at what dell did to the interface
there's some really interesting things
going on here in terms of what they did
to the home screens got a lot more
coming up on Dells third Android
smartphone this maybe want to get
especially if you're on t-mobile if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
