now Tony behind the camera taking a look
at GT advanced technology as a company
that might very well reshape the glass
on the front of your smartphone let's
take a look this is a true barcelona
piece of indigenous concrete here found
on the parking lot of the
and I'm gonna take my company issued
iPhone 5 it's the only phone I have in
the world and I'm gonna take this thing
and I'm gonna start to
you know scratch away right so I'm
pushing pretty hard on the surface of
that and what you're seeing and we'll
see when I'm done here is a dust trail
of material that actually broke off of
this concrete as I was rubbing it across
the screen in my phone
and when I clear that away you'll see
that there's no damage to the screen it
says no scratching there are some smudge
marks because I haven't cleaned it
perfectly yet but there's no you can't
scratch sapphire I mean the only thing
that's harder than sapphire is diamond
so what I have done here just for
demonstration purposes as I put this
piece of sapphire on my iPhone 5 so that
I could you know do that here at the
show the show showcase some of them
but it's about two and a half times
stronger than last two and a half times
stronger than gorillas that in terms of
in terms of impact resistance you know
gorilla glass it resists scratches very
well but it will still shatter on impact
is that the same case with the sapphire
sapphire will shower brittle material I
had a certain energy or force
shattering but again because of the
yeren streets of the material it's yes
will that shatter point is better than
what you see what's burly boys so it
takes a bit more effort to shatter
sapphire this will know what's
interesting about the comparison between
the products you just saw me you know do
this on my phone right if I take the
same rock and then I'll just use this
piece of glass I know if you can see
some of the scratches on it already but
I'll I'll try to use that upper corner
it's fairly clear so they take the same
rod
and do the same thing thing again with
this
and then I show you sort of wiping it
away you can see the fact that it's
actually scratch the material right this
is - so what happens what happens now is
the weight gorilla glad that's a great
product
you know it's ubiquitous a good product
nothing against glass per se for the
manufacturing process mm-hmm the last
step in the making of Gorilla Glass is
that the sheet is actually dipped into a
bath
and that would happen if that is
material that they substrate into
actually like shrimp rings that's around
the actual substrate putting the
pressure around the material and that's
what adds that extra bit of strength
extensions
you scratch together
50 micron film you actually release the
stress and so you've introduced now is a
flaw or a fault
into the material
it's very likely that at some point when
that phone would drop
to get a crack that's gonna occur along
that fault line if you've ever cut glass
like for a window or fix your frame or
something you know you just score it
we've been in the air and snap it along
that point right same idea so that fail
as the pre-scored have four points over
the points which your keys and scratch
hitters keys common enemy of Gorilla
Glass are keys and coins whatever
exactly
this is was awesome to see thank you a
very very simple demo and it is your
name again I'm sorry Jeff Jeff thank you
