the rivalry between these two lineups
has spun a trend of love and hate that
even we have a hard time controlling in
the comments surely on one side we have
the misunderstood iPhone and on the
other we have the galaxy on its way out
but the small price tag on one and the
deals on the other make this a worthy
comparison nonetheless I'm he meant of
event with pocket now and this is iPhone
8 vs samsung galaxy s a brought to you
by DD brand there was a time when
iPhones and Galaxy phones looked so much
alike that Samsung got sued and lost to
Apple for the similarities who did what
first this still a battle we just don't
really want to discuss but what's
important is that comparisons have gone
great lately mainly because of how much
things have changed I mean look at them
these two phones couldn't look more
different even if they tried and if this
were a beauty contest the galaxy as a
twins this by a longshot
it's actually been winning for the last
three generations the curve borders on
the class the tall aspect ratio and the
rounded corners on the display the
premium feel all have contributed to a
phone that seems like if it were from
the future
by contrast the iPhone 8 is a complete
opposite it follows a design language
that's at least four years old and
surely does have the return of glass
construction that Apple pioneered with
the iPhone 4 but the rest of the package
meaning the large bezels in the camera
humph are all very 2014 now even if
these are the smaller variants of their
respective lineups the dimensions can be
more of a disparity the galaxies new
approach to a taller aspect ratio has
the Galaxy s8 being 10 millimeters
taller one millimeter wider nearly a
millimeter thicker and 7 grams heavier
than the iPhone 8 this also allows a
much taller 5.8 inch display compared to
just 4.7 inches more resolution at quad
HD capabilities versus 750 P the more
modern and saturated colorful AMOLED
technology
is the more accurate IPS LCD and the
infinity display effect on the curved
borders that you just won't get on the
iPhone and the iPhones favor there's the
case where bigger is not necessarily
better for content consumption the
iPhone sports stereo speakers while the
larger galaxy does not for handling
purposes I can use the iPhone 8 with one
hand and reach all four corners of
display where this proves to be a chore
with the galaxy s 8 now there are
options for reach ability on both
devices through software and the final
nail in the ergonomics coffin
I mean reaching the iPhones fingerprint
scanner requires zero effort where on
the galaxy s 8 it's always a challenge
to not hit the camera lens instead now
and the galaxy is the fence this is not
the only way you can unlock the galaxy s
8 we've got iris scanning and facial
recognition as well though each of these
has added limitations that we've
discussed in our respective reviews
powering each device is a very different
set of hardware and I'm not even going
to spend time declaring a winner when it
comes to specs a really tired of the
whole well the iPhone has only got 2
gigs of ram argument because you know
what numbers don't really matter in the
real world so long as each device can
deliver on its advertised promise the
differences that are really important
are that you're actually getting more
for your money when it comes to the
galaxy s 8 there's a micro as the
expansion to save you on having to pay
more for additional storage there's a
headphone jack and better headphones
bundle in the box and Samsung also
includes a fast charger in the box
something that combined will cost you
more than $70 if you want to buy this
for the iPhone you get a wireless
charging on both sure but only the
Galaxy s8 has fast wireless charging and
there's also water resistance on both
but the Galaxy has a higher rating
another debate that's not worth having
as if Android is better than iOS or vice
versa by now it's clear that people
don't switch for operating systems but
really for what the phones can do and
more specifically for which one does it
better in this regard both devices run
their respective operating systems like
champs for the most part BSA blazes
through its experience UX just as fast
and fluid as the iPhone 8 can on iOS
both devices are very robust with their
ecosystems and play graphics intensive
games relatively with ease I pray
Samsung's visual aesthetic more given
the flexibility of the user interface
there's a bevy of options that you can
enable or disable at your heart's
content where I praised iOS is in the
logic of its user interface like
seriously control center should be a
swipe from the bottom where you can
actually reach it easily even if the
iPhone 10 just completely kills this and
then or I don't praise the Galaxy S a it
is that it's currently for software
versions behind on Android yes for where
there's just not that problem on the
iPhone 8 and then where I don't praise
Apple is because this homescreen
seriously needs to die Apple it's more
than ten years old another example where
bigger isn't necessarily better is
battery life the galaxy s 8 has nearly
twice the power pack of the iPhone 8 but
believe it or not the only phone that
lasted through a day of moderate to
heavy uses the iPhone and yes I'm
actually also shocked about that one I'm
not saying that the SI it has terrible
battery life but power saving features
are the only way to get to end of day so
don't let the numbers fool you now when
it comes to photography you're looking
at two of my top picks for best
all-rounder smartphone cameras and yes I
know you're not getting the added
functionality of a secondary lens either
but both devices sport cameras you can
trust just point and shoot at subjects
great color saturation contrast in
detail with the Galaxy winning and
flexibility thanks to manual controls
both also take in my opinion some of the
best selfies in the industry though when
it comes to selfie video I'm glad that
Apple finally woke up to offer a better
field of view compared to the Galaxy you
won't have any complaints when it comes
to the video from the primary shooters
though with stabilization and color
reproduction being strong on both
devices to conclude I think it's fair to
say that each phone pulls its own weight
when it comes to pros and cons the
Galaxy s8 is far more beautiful as a
device more flexible and hardware and
software and with added perks that come
with in the box of accessories factoring
that the Galaxy s8 is also an older
device and you can definitely find
better deals for it than with the case
of Apple's offering the iPhone 8 on the
other hand doesn't have the better looks
they'll cost you more money if you want
more storage and the same goes for
whenever you want more useful
accessories it wins basic things like
economics future-proof hardware no
excuses when it comes to software
updates and battery life really has me
impressed
if it were my money I'd incline more to
the galaxy s 8 just because I feel that
it's a better deal so this is the one
you get if you want to maximize your
dollars now for those of you in search
of the latest and greatest these two
devices might not be what you're looking
for on one hand we have the galaxy s 9
just a few weeks away and you also have
the iPhone 10 already in the market
again these are the better options if
you're looking to save a few dollars for
great hardware and again with the galaxy
s 8 in my opinion being the better deal
now assuming that you did pick any of
these devices the glass back on either
is a fingerprint nightmare the brand
skins will help you eliminate those
fingerprints and add some grip to your
upcoming Galaxy s8 or iPhone 8 for that
matter visit the brand comm slash galaxy
