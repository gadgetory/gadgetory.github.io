bringing some of Apple's course such
charmed iPhone 8 will apparently bring
some new approaches to notifications we
get more details on the specifications
of the nokia 8 M hi never leave it and
with any of you able to get the Super
Nintendo classic and if you got an extra
one do you want my shipping address this
is pocket out daily the official news
today have to do with deals to certain
degree if you're not getting a cheaper
price tag on the U 11 from HTC but one
thing that you will get is three months
of unlimited music from Amazon this just
proves just how close the relationship
is between both companies hopefully that
collaboration will bring more overtime
for those of you that wonder exactly
what we're getting from Nokia at that
event in London the no k-8
specifications just got leaked and it
turns out to be well after 835 four gigs
of RAM apparently there's an option for
six of RAM and we see more sk use
available one thing that's not going to
change is the 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
the crazy bezels as well we will report
more as soon as we learn more and just
like we reported yesterday now digit
times has chimed in on what to expect
for the iphone 8 iphone 7 as an iphone 7
s plus if you're wondering when we're
getting these devices it turns out that
September is the launch date according
to the sources it doesn't seem to be the
case that Apple might have to wait for
the launch of the better newer iPhone
until later since the company is ramping
up something and it could have
everything to do with what the company
is doing to just launch a few products
initially and then leave the rest for
later the year and have people wait
that's just the Apple way let's continue
talking about the iPhone 8 particularly
with more leaks from the home pod
apparently Apple is not just working on
a different placement for notifications
but also notification should be smarter
I love the fact that you don't get
bothered by them whenever you're wearing
an Apple watch but apparently that's
going to also extend through the cases
whenever you're watching a video for
example or playing the full screen game
where apparently you will not be
bothered by notifications at any time
and I wonder exactly how Apple plans to
still notify you of things that are
important obviously this will be
revealed as soon as we learn more about
the phone later this year
finally the very hot rumors they have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
apparently Samsung is planning to bring
something different with forced touch
technology we have context menus when it
comes to iOS in addition to the fact
that the current home button on the
galaxy s 8 to have some sort of that
functionality
apparently Samsung wants to do something
extra not exactly sure what that extra
is I just know that in my particular
case I rarely ever use it it actually
leads me to the question today I mean do
you think that makes sense for Samsung
to invest in this I mean one of the
biggest rumors for the delays of the
iPhone 8 had everything to do with being
able to merge that force touch panel
with AMOLED technology so leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know if
you care about this or not
brands you love the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video is filmed all of us I'm out
comment subscribe to our channel as well
for more videos like this one you can
also follow me on Twitter highly
underscore David I'll run Instagram but
Hina leave it on please give this video
a thumbs up if you like what you saw I
am hi netiquette I thanks so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow 9 p.m.
