b20 I thought that we just get a smaller
watered-down version of the may 10 Pro
is whywe usually does but as it turns
out that's not entirely accurate one of
these phones is pretty much that but
then the other is something else
entirely with an Tandy najin Paris on
high metal together with pocket now and
let's talk about the Huawei p20 and v20
Pro let's start with the obvious both
the new Huawei P 20 and B 20 Pro look
very much alike at first glance we have
the same notch at the top that I'm sure
you're gonna butcher in the comments and
the same fingerprint scanner that serves
as navigation gestures at the bottom you
flip them from the bag and the same
reflective glass finishes here on both
with color options that range from black
midnight blue pink gold and Twilight
which everyone here being briefed to
really light even features like the
Carey 970 processor with MP you are the
same across the board but then the
similarities pretty much end there the
p20 pro has two more gigs of ram and it
supports a larger battery at four
thousand milliamp hours versus 3400 and
is ip67 water and dust resistant versus
IP 53 the pro even has an IR blaster
which the p20 doesn't have the b20 Pro
also has a larger 6.1 inch full HD plus
OLED versus the B 20s LCD even if it's
really hard to tell them apart at least
for the couple of hours that we had to
test them to vac content consumption
Huawei claims wireless audio
improvements with the new hwa protocol
that they have that brings Bluetooth
audio quality to a crazy 990 kilobits in
bandwidth yes emui is also powering both
devices now version 8.1 that's on top of
Android 8.1 same skin that most of you
don't really praise but all the
optimizations that make the experi
Ariane's faster and more fluid than some
of its competitors the company also
claims that their new face unlock works
in just 0.5 seconds which they claim is
twice as fast this Apple's face ID in
the samsung galaxy s 9s intelligence
scan though this is 2d mapping but now
that all the basics are out the way
let's talk about the main selling point
for one of these phones at least which
is the camera to start both devices take
a step forward in the selfie department
with a whopping 24 megapixel sensor
across the board now in the case of the
primary shooters again the b20 is more
like the May 10 Pro with a 12 megapixel
RGB sensor and a 20 megapixel monochrome
though with a sensor size that Huawei
claims a 61 percent larger than the
iPhone 10 and 22 percent larger than the
galaxy as9 the p20 Pro is something else
entirely and here's where the whole pro
naming scheme comes to life to begin
this is like us first triple camera
system second this is the first phone
I've heard of that has a temperature
sensor to detect white balance and it
also complements the laser transmitter
and laser receiver for auto focusing
purposes third the secondary cameras are
of the twenty mega pixel monochrome
sensor at F 1.6 aperture and then eight
megapixel telephoto lens that have 2.4
aperture with oh is this primary RGB
shooter is a 40 megapixels at f/4 1.8
which is pretty much Nokia PureView
territory from back in the day while we
claims that the sensor is 223 percent
larger than the iPhone 10 and 170
percent larger than the galaxy s 9 all
this combo is capable of 3x optical zoom
and 5x hybrid zoom and there's even
super slow-mo features at 960 frames per
second at 720p just like certain
competitors now while we made a big deal
of its new AI capabilities which include
detection of 19 subjects automatically
and there's even a new AIS meaning
artificial intelligence stabilization
which the company claims to be superior
to oh is so much so that the primary
lens doesn't include that so yes all
this that I just mentioned is the Huawei
P 20 pro which is pretty much a device
on a class of its own when it comes to
at least the specifications of its
camera and with the p20 being a more
conservative alternative whether these
devices deliver on all the spec sheet is
something that we'll have to prove once
these devices arrive at the pocket now
laughs for review and that's gonna be
coming very soon while that happens make
