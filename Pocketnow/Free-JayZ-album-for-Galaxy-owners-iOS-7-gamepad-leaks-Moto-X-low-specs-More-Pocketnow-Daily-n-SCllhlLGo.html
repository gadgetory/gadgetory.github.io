get jay-z's next album for free new
leaks into a gamepad coming to iOS 7
devices and what the weight of the Moto
X and leaked specs don't spell a
flagship bone I'm hi Mary vera and yeah
I'll admit that I missed you all too
this is pocket now daily let's start
stay off with some Nokia news for those
of you following the fact that AT&amp;amp;T and
the company are testing this device well
the RM 877 just left the FCC from
testing and apparently this is the no
get eos pureview beautiful whatever
phone that's coming out there and since
we do have an event slated for july
eleventh but we probably could see a new
Tony phone yeah PureView phone coming
very soon so stay tuned now let's move
over to the Moto X huh you know that
shiny unicorn that follows the white
iphone foreign popularity and time it's
taken for it to launch well apparently
this device won't be that much of a
flagship phone I mean in times when the
1080p displays are already a standard
apparently this device will only have a
720p display and at times when the
Snapdragon 600 is the standard
apparently this device will bring the
Snapdragon s4 pro and a question is why
what is motorola planning with this
device could we be getting a new version
of the nexus phone meaning you know what
nexus cheap phone you know with good
hardware but not great hardware stay
tuned for the rumors moving over to iOS
probably one of the biggest news with
the iOS 7 sdk is the fact that now
developers can create hardware to tune
into the device to use it for different
things like for example game pad
controllers as we have some new leaks of
logitech already working on the first
gamepad controller to work with the
Lightning port and yes we do know that
there are some gamepad controls out
there that work through bluetooth but
apparently this will be new unique and
better stay tuned for the leaks as
apparently this thing will be aside from
ugly unique now let's talk about the
galaxy s4 we've got some new reports the
verizon will now get some unique
exclusive variants of the phone that are
actually customizable but it's kind of
interesting because all you're getting
is really a different type of battery
cover since you can pretty much replace
this it's kind of interesting let's just
hope
don't come up with this verizon logo on
the home button like some galaxy no
customers have to deal with but aside
from that the company CEO also came on
record to state that they're gonna be
building the first LTE advanced
smartphone and even though lte-advanced
is clearly only available in Russia you
know the way Samsung is they always want
to try everything even though well I
wouldn't even wait for this phone to
come out in the future because
apparently it'll be the same galaxy s4
on the Qualcomm chip just get the galaxy
s4 if you're out there I mean by the
time lte-advanced gets here it's gonna
be a couple of years and finally for the
I'm gonna quote this as interesting news
of the day those of you that were
wondering what was happening between
Samsung and JC well it turns out that
jay-z is gonna be offering his new album
21 million galaxies customers this album
is gonna be called Magna Carta Holy
Grail and apparently it'll be available
through an application for free for 1
million lucky customers the album will
be out on July fourth but the app will
be available on jun 24 so obviously
those of you lucky that get the album
will get it earlier than the rest of the
people that are gonna be able to buy it
this is gonna be available for the
galaxy s3 galaxy ps4 and the Galaxy Note
2 but that leads into the question of
the day what do you think about these
celebrity endorsements recently I mean I
think it's the thing for 2013 you get
Alicia Keys endorsing blackberry and
then she's uploading photos to Instagram
when there is no app on the blackberry
10 operating system it's just kind of
funny to see all these celebrities doing
these endorsements in 2013 that are not
really as effective as these companies
think they are or are they do you like
celebrity endorsements I personally
don't but leave us a comment down below
what do you think the free elbow is a
free album right and of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone into a little mushy follow us
on elcom subscribe to our YouTube
channel you'd also follow me on Twitter
