smartphone camera of ever it's probably
not an exaggeration but before we check
that out we have to get inside the box
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is the Nokia Lumia 1020 let's see
what's inside the package so another
year another Lumia another bit of
unremarkable AT&amp;amp;T packaging you have to
hand it to AT&amp;amp;T the carrier is just not
terribly interested in making devices
stand out just the device model name and
number on the side there's some barcode
stuff which is covered up there this is
just some information about the
lithium-ion battery and the device color
a little spoiler there showing us that
we are getting the yellow one very
exciting in the absence of cyan and on
the back we've got just the product
image the Nokia Lumia 1020 apparently
black device pictured on all of the
boxes irrespective of color unless that
label on the side is wrong we'll find
out in a second the box is pretty
underwhelming just like most of them out
of ATR though so no advantage or
disadvantage here let's pop it open and
take a first look at this device ooh got
a little spoiled there this is just a
quick start guide so they make you wait
a second to see the device itself we
pull it aside yet another spoiler in
here probably a good bit of information
they learn to take great photos that is
a solid idea we'll read about that maybe
a little later and bam Wow look at that
vibrant yellow color on that
polycarbonate first time taking the
Lumia 1080 out of its box texting and
driving it can wait good advice from
AT&amp;amp;T as always we'll flip it over to see
its distinguishing characteristic and
Wow
there it is alright before we get too
enamored with this let's put it aside
and see what else is in the box here I'm
sure we've got some more promotional
stuff Oh a poster guys we can get a
poster with this that's pretty rad
what's the poster foot what's it what's
supposed to about like is it wait up
wait a postive like you take your own
photo what do you take your own foot oh
yeah oh yeah you can take a photo make
it into a poster hey that's red probably
took me a little longer than it should
have to figure that out but I'm pretty
excited the gentle rattle you hear when
shaking your Lumia 10
20 is the sound of blur-free photos so
they are warning you ahead of time that
the device will make funny sounds when
you shake it because of that optical
image stabilization smart move guys save
yourself a whole lot of customer service
calls here's your product and safety
information here what else is in here we
have a sim removal tool on the inside
here your typical power adapter and USB
cable we can put those inside micro USB
obviously and this is a wrist lanyard
you don't see these included very often
these days so interesting to see that
anything else in the box here besides
the sim removal tool negative just some
toy binoculars if you have an infant
otherwise the box is empty we can get it
out of here take a look at the device so
bringing the device back to front and
center we can do our typical screen
protector removal here to have a gander
at that beautiful display let's do that
why please that goes and I believe
there's another one waiting around back
here another duo actually one of them
protecting the camera module itself
wow that's stuck on there
very nice that camera module I believe
made out of exposed aluminum or coated
aluminum and the back protector coming
off as well beautiful a protector comes
off you can see that this is not a
glossy finish as we know this is the
matte finish on the back here you can
see little glare on the reflective
elements of the camera lens there that
41 megapixel lens with a lens protector
in place the xenon flash next to it a
little spot light down there let's get
it close up here because this is
something special we can actually see
the call-outs for that PureView carl
zeiss lens there what a beautiful
contrast it is between the black and the
yellow there I know I talked unn unn
complementarily about the color choice
on this device but the yellow really
really does look smashing in person so
now that we have our microphone back in
the proper orientation and the device in
hand everything else cleared out we can
tell you how we feel about this actually
let's pull that bit of additional
protector off here there's just some
instructions on on removing the salmon
inserting your own sim and tell you how
this device feels in the hand a little
bit it is um it's certainly once once
all the protector off there I've got
both hands invested in this is certainly
lighter than the 920 it was a little
felt a little heavier coming out of the
box but let's take a little tour around
here you can see the Nokia smile is no
more as we saw on our hands-on video
from New York there's our sim tray
probably noise cancelling mic and a
headphone jack up top these buttons on
the side I believe are aluminum they are
no longer the ceramic that was on the
Lumia 920 but they're also not the
plastic of the 928 so that's very nice
there's the speaker on the bottom some
of the some of the stance there were
probably had a focus there a little bit
sorry there's a speaker on the bottom
USB port some stands there and there's
that wrist lanyard hole if you're into
wrist lanyards and nothing on the left
hand side we already had a look at the
back which is amazingly cool looking and
we're back to the front so before I can
compliment this device too much more
let's go ahead and press power we'll
give it a first boot there's our
confirmation buzz there's our AT&amp;amp;T
splash screen which we expect to see
let's give it a little zoom action there
on this display
you can also see the AT&amp;amp;T branding you
can just make it out next to the Nokia
branding up top just to make sure while
we wait for the boot here that you do
not miss any of our other Nokia Lumia
1020 content because there is quite a
bit of it make sure and follow us on
social media down below their YouTube
Facebook Google+ Twitter there's the
Windows Phone splash screen and you can
follow me at put captain two phones boom
town there is the Windows Phone 8
landing screen and just because I simply
can't wait until we start filming the
next video I'm going to go ahead and
press and hold and activate the camera
there and I expected the lens to pop out
when I activated the camera but instead
we are dumped into a tutorial which is
actually really great because we get to
you have the option to skip it but if
you do not you get to learn how to use
the camera and I suspect I'm going to be
making a video on that pretty shortly so
for now we'll just leave it at that this
was your unboxing of the Nokia Lumia
1020 folks if you're seeing this
unboxing video it means there's other
