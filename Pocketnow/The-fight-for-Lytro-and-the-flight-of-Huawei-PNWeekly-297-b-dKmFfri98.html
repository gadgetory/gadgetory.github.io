problems in the US market but to date no
one's been sharing any evidence of
security threats one plus six rumors are
pointing to a higher price tag then many
fans might be happy with and Verizon
continues to push some buttons this time
for iPhone users we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 297 of the pocket now
weekly recorded March 23rd at noon
pacific this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
I'm fond Carlos back now a contributing
editor at pocketnow.com joined as always
by plucky podcast producer mr. Jules
Wong on the East Coast how's it going
sir hello there it's going just fine for
a Friday I'm feeling just as good about
anything for the weekend and hopefully
you are - yeah we're living for the
weekend anytime the weekends happening
is just it's just fine it's ok the
weather's decent and and we can make the
most of our short lives folks the
weekend is fine by us
we're fine with the weekend I know some
really cool stories coming up this this
podcast all the top news from
pocketnow.com I'm gonna say let's jump
straight into some of the housekeeping
stuff that we need to get to if you'd
like to join the conversation you can of
course tweet at us during the live
broadcast using the hashtag P and weekly
that's the easiest way for us to catch
your comments and add them to the
discussion we love all the people in the
live chat we do check in on the live
chat but often it's hard for us to keep
up with conversations that are happening
there and of course if you're a fan of
the the more traditional methods of
digital online communications you can
also hit us an email if you're listening
to this show after the live broadcast
and you can hit us up at podcast at
pocketnow.com where we collect all of
your questions and we use that as fodder
for mailbag and listener take the wheel
episodes we try and produce at the end
of each month so Jules you've got the
you've got a crazy list for our rundown
this week I do
jump into the top headlines from
pocketnow.com indeed so for the week of
March 1928 scene this is all the mobile
tech news that is fit to podcast they
are conflicting views to how many new
model iPhones Apple will be of the cell
from this September Taiwanese industry
sources say that Apple has ordered at
least 110 million OLED displays and 70
million LCD displays Korean sources say
that only 50 million of OLED displays
will be had and 150 million LCDs gotten
it's believed that two OLED iPhone their
parents will be priced well and above
one LCD model meantime Apple Facebook
and Google are all reported to be
pursuing a buyout of image startup Lytro
best known for its like filled cameras
techCrunch reports that for Google's
part it will pay between 25 and 40
million dollars for an asset acquisition
as opposed to a corporal one the big
reason why it's the favorite course to
win google hardware SVP rick ostilow is
on late roast board of directors we
shall see what happens with this one
corporate presentation slides supposedly
died up from oneplus headquarters as
detailed the one plus six to have top
line specifications including up to 256
gigabytes of storage other specs since
dug up include a 20 megapixel selfie
camera the price for a meeting thing
like this supposedly $749 surpassing the
max spec 1 + 5 t of just a few months
ago by nearly $200 we'll have to see
what we can dig into on that one because
there has been some reporting going on
here more on that a little bit later
Qualcomm's lead man on display tech
sound and Syed spoke with tech radar
about the likelihood of foldable
smartphones coming soon the short answer
is near zero
and the reason display transistors still
can't survive an expected lifetime of
bending and stretching and
that has plenty of manufacturers still
working on the case at least for the
years to come
the my Verizon app has pushed out a
notification urging people to buy the
Galaxy S 9 through the carrier thing is
I found an iPad customers got this
message - and Apple doesn't seem to be
well it just feels it doesn't need to do
anything about this doesn't seem to be
enforcing its own rules against direct
marketing through proche notifications
other apps like Aliexpress have
exploited this lacks attitude and that
has really dug into some developers some
iOS app developers the wrong way
one of instagrams recent improvements to
its feed has been to incorporate more
up-to-date posts at the top of every
refresh there have been plenty of
complaints about non chronological
curation of posts on social media
platforms so this measure may address
some for loan and consumers and it's a
good step hopefully that more of these
platforms will take and finally LG has
open sourced the code for its version of
webOS it's the first time since HP did
it after acquired Paul and well
obviously LG acquired the rights to
webOS in 2014 it has long been relegated
to serving as the user interface for LG
smart televisions but it has filed with
a Korean regulator to explore new uses
for webOS so I'm wondering with this
last story here
what would you believe would be a good
use case for the webOS that we know
right now obviously it's been used for
smartwatches under LG's capacity in past
and of course with tablets and smart a
smart 102 for a palm did a few smart
phones way back in the day I think I
still have my my webOS tablet somewhere
that I got from that fire sale way back
when I'm kind of torn I the whole thing
about having an operating system is
about trying to build maintain and
service an ecosystem and I think L
G has a great argument to expand their
lifestyle products there their kitchen
products their washers and dryers I have
an LG washer and dryer and it's got this
sort of like how hard it sinking with my
phone that can kind of tap your phone on
it and you get the ability to sort of
control things on the washer and dryer
I think that could be LG's direct
directly I think webOS could be LG's
killer killer app if you will
tying together the products that they
already have kind of like the way that
Samsung has Tizen as a way that they can
fall back on in-house development to to
build an ecosystem of products for their
specific customers I think that makes
the most sense I'm not entirely sure
what we could or should hope for from
webOS as an open source initiative I'm
not sure who's who would stand to
benefit from playing in an OS space that
has a lot of potential but products
don't really get sold by potential you
kind of need to to put up or shut up
and there's also just so many good ideas
like I would love to see webOS is like
an in-car unit you know instead of a
proprietary in - unit which has terrible
software like I hate using anything that
has to do with the touchscreen on my
Nissan that that I think could could go
a long ways towards improving some of
the conditions when we're interacting
with technology in the car but I'm not
sure who's really gonna take that ball
and run with it
given all of the different options and
major competition from platforms like
iOS and Android and ultimately it's
going to be LG's with a sandbox that
these developers will end up playing in
now they get to maybe set up standards
documentation and other little bug fixes
and tweaks so that's kind of LG's way of
deferring costs over to people with
passion I guess you could say but we see
little illustrations and drawings and of
course the the floating out there at the
notion that it could
going back to smartwatches or to laptops
or to refrigerator's just like as you
said Kaizen its but why wasn't this done
years ago when our just norm why wasn't
there more thoughtful approach to
weather less when it you know was just
knew was fresher you know these hands
and why hasn't it got on the think you
AI kind of I I get what you're saying
and especially given the success that
Samsung has had in developing their own
operating system or and actually
operating systems the different flavors
and variants of in-house development
that power TVs versus what is a curator
their smart assistant for their washer
and dryers which is different than Bixby
which is different than Tizen I I think
one of the things that held LG back was
the amount of time webOS spent in that
weird holding pattern as HP was finally
drowning it for the last possible time
and so whatever outside developers
support there could have been had to be
completely separated from how server
driven webOS was how many how many
pieces of proprietary code and patented
licensed tech the api's that were
involved in webOS for it to be even the
moderately successful the minorly
successful smartphone operating system
that it was and I think once LG got its
hands on the core guts of this of this
very different animal than when it was
with HP and certainly than when it was
with palm I think it took them time to
sort of unravel what it was they could
do with it and and also I I don't I
don't mean this to sound as snarky as
it's going to but I also don't have the
most faith in LG software developers for
consistently iterating being focused on
tasks on projects having an end goal in
mind in the same way that I think we've
come to expect from an outlet like
Samsung I'm especially once you start
playing
with the newest gear smartwatches Andrew
Wallace sharing photos of his gear watch
because he moved from Android wear over
to Tizen on Twitter he hooked us up on
the PM weekly hashtag we've come to have
different expectations for these
companies and what they can execute LG I
think kind of floundered with this new
property for a while before they kind of
got the guts of it under control and
started iterating for TVs outside of TVs
what else can you do with it and I'm not
sure they have a plan in mind for that
that's why I think we're hearing no ly
no more noise on this open source
initiative I think kind of hoping to
spur on some outside tinkerer or sort of
part-time developer imagination you know
if someone else can come in and do
something disruptive or interesting or
fun with it and it's open source and LG
can borrow from from that experience
then maybe they'll have more potential
for a consumer facing product that they
can make money off of in the next couple
years I don't necessarily want to buy
one but what I do want to get my hands
on is LG watch urbane which was the
first yeah
modern SmartWatch back in 2015 with
fellow PE of all things and it had the
freaking webOS little thing I am the big
it looked a little cute it was like it
was a Mickey attempt at you know that
the still burgeoning kind of a you know
circular SmartWatch thing going on there
as which in but you know I would like to
know if he did you hold it so I actually
not only did I get to play with that I
did a survey where they did this whole
sit-down interview and it took like two
hours going through different UI
elements and different button
configurations and different dial
configurations and LG had some
phenomenal ideas that were really well
ahead of the curve I mean stuff that we
we see executed well on gear s2 and gear
s3 smartwatches LG was arriving at some
very similar conclusions for what a
round-faced smart interface should
resemble if we're gonna pack that thing
with almost as much functionality as a
phone and III really enjoyed that
experience and unfortunately it kind of
came to nothing and and I think they
just got a little gun-shy
they they they went with the easier path
which I think was ultimately the wrong
move for LG but going with Android where
if they had stuck to an end goal even if
they weren't necessarily you know first
to market with it I think they could
have made a better faith argument for
why an LG watch with an LG phone could
have been a great pairing and really
selling the notion of ecosystem and from
there you get to build off of everything
with all of the Smart Home commentary
that's going on right now and energy
control and thermostats and smart
speakers and assistants that plug in to
your home network I just imagine like if
we had kicked that off with a wearable
and then they could have come out with a
speaker and then they could have added a
smart assistant to your laundry to say
hey you know you're about to do laundry
during peak electricity times if you
wait you can you know not only minimize
your impact on the grid but you can save
a little cash off you know different
rates for electricity in your area I
mean those kinds of things could go
really far for selling LG as that
primary competitor for your entire
lifestyle of products opposite Samsung
it's just there's such a big company
there's such a big ship getting those
individual departments to focus on end
goals and collaborating together just
doesn't seem to be something that any
company can can really properly execute
execute over the long run and the right
routes weren't placed at the right time
just because you mentioned the HP palm
kind of the clearing out the servers and
that left some verticals inaccessible LG
at the time and that was also like the
freaking there was more pressure with
the Android with Google but because that
was a battement stagefright and Google
wanted to say okay let's get some more
security updates out there it was just
general kind of inserting more standards
into it because that the that it was at
the time that there were talks about
Samsung inquality going their own with
Tizen
and freakin what's the emu I that's
right so like it was there were
pressures there so ah oh and we still
see flavors just you know whether or not
you're looking at sort of a stock
experience or like a like an outlet like
tick watch you know tick watch having a
very highly customized build of Android
on their first watch just completely
walking away from that kind of
development for the their follow-up less
expensive sport variant so I I just
think LG got got caught during what was
an exciting explosion of new potential
and then never really finalized those
last couple products that could have
made it to market and and that's a shame
but I'm hoping again its potential there
are some really good ideas in webOS that
if they can be brought to some other
kind of product line there there is
something for that software to
accomplish but again we have those same
conversations with every other sort of
alt operating system out there from from
the offshoots of like me go and sailfish
and stuff like that - you know again
kind of custom builds of Linux that
still pop up every now and then a fire
fish is bigger Russia yeah I'm not sure
we're gonna see it a ton of traction on
that you know if webOS could become part
of the backbone of another service to
motivate more wearables like that could
be something really interesting it's
just whether or not that faces you know
like a renewed interest in a Fitbit you
know Fitbit can make a bigger play for
the consumer market immediately does LG
have the fortitude to stick out webOS as
a competitor against something like a
Fitbit and I don't think they do I was
expecting to talk this much about
whether West but frankly this is a
pretty been pretty fruitful so more this
pretty easy thank you
let's get into some potatoes they're a
little bit boring but you know given the
fact that Apple has been kind of the
beacon of the mobile tech industry for
the past 2x years and how it might be
able to lead the way in terms of the
markets for components of blah blah blah
blah blah blah I can
stuff let's talk about this report here
there are these reports and some all
right so I mean any given year we're
talking about 200 million new model
iPhones that are going to be get shipped
and sold and whatnot and basically here
we're talking about the splits between
display technologies and therefore the
price bracketing for these because we're
dealing with three variants this year
two sizes of OLED more expensive iPhones
and one LCD which is supposedly going to
be less but there's been also reporting
that there's that the small OLED version
of the iPhone will cost ultimately less
in parts and labor
then the LCD version which blows your
minds or that you there's so much going
on there but ultimately it's how many of
these things that Apple can ship and the
Koreans they're like the industry
sources that we're talking about here
the Koreans say that OLED will get what
was this a three to one play so if 150
million to 50 million units from OLED to
LC or LCD to OLED basically these guys
are favoring OLED and Taiwan II sources
are saying no I'm gonna give you as
myself here all right hold on LCD will
get 150 and OLED will get 50 and
Taiwanese are saying 132 OLED and 72 LCD
so the Taiwanese are favoring the whole
inside here and now there are some sense
to be made out of that because okay
there you have more models and the
iPhone 10 is a established thing now so
now we're going to see more of these
sales pop up more of that momentum go to
OLED but on the other side they're
saying hey look at how the iPhone 10 did
it did it performed poorly in the market
and apples been cutting back on parts
orders for iPhone tens
and it's not it did so there's a reason
why we can't expect too many of these
Alette iPhones to be sold next year so
I'm wondering where you lay down the
line on this like if you were to put you
know go into Ladbrokes or something
and place a bet on this so so here's my
guess I Phone 10 represents a very
expensive branding exercise from Apple
if the iPhone 10 as $1,000 smartphone
had grossly outperformed the iPhone 8
then I think we would have seen some
continued branding language of an iPhone
X I or an iPhone 11 or an iPhone x2 it
would have become a new branding
platform to discuss iPhones well we have
no idea what these next iPhones I mean
we have three of them first there's like
naming paradigms my guess my guess is
we're going to walk back some but not
all of the extreme design language of
the iPhone 10 probably you know still
keeping face ID and removing the the
touch ID the home button and all screen
iPhone but maybe they do something where
there's just a bit more forehead and
chin bezel or they sort of normalized
the design a little bit more and we
arrive at something which I'm calling
but probably won't be named the iPhone
nines so we take the big little form
factor of the iPhone 9 and of the iPhone
8 so you have a smaller one in a larger
one probably differences on the cameras
like there's gonna be a dual camera on
the larger plus version and a single
camera on the smaller one battery
capacity etc and that's that's gonna be
the iPhone moving forward so so the
naming isn't really that important
anyone who gets their knickers in a
twist about what an iPhone is called
it's just the next iPhone it's the
iPhone 2018 and I'm assuming that we'll
probably see Oh LEDs go into those
devices
again being able to command premium is
the top options
what is officially called the iPhone 10
will be sort of relegated as the one-off
celebration of the 10 year anniversary
of the iPhone and will move forward with
a trio of devices big.little for premium
options and then some kind of follow-up
to the SE which can hopefully start to
better satisfy LTE developing areas and
replace the original iPhone se so my
guess would be ol Ed's for the premium
products commanding you know that
lobster pot higher price tag especially
considering the the sort of cost because
we know the margins on iPhones are
usually pretty solid III don't see ol
Ed's necessarily disrupting the the
amount of profit the profit margin that
Apple can build into them if they can
also bump up the price saying oh we
learned so much from the iPhone 10 which
was a specialty one-off iPhone and now
all iPhones are gonna be built more like
the 10 but we can also now that from
what we've learned we can make them less
expensive than the iPhone 10 but they're
still more expensive than the iPhone 8
it's gonna feel like you're getting a
really good deal even though it's sort
of just the normal progression umm how
phones are made and then the iPhone se
will be the one that carries with some
kind of LCD for the screen just that
they can come in again with the branding
the marketing and call it a lesser or a
less expensive phone so that's my guess
I think we'll see o LEDs for a big
little iPhone 9 and then an LCD for an
iPhone se - okay so just a little bit of
admin here and I'm gonna have to make a
marker in my mind to note this down but
for our live audience I just had to find
out that the our YouTube chat has not
been on and so I had to fix that up for
a quick second so if you were
discouraged or if you want to tell
anyone that's a lot chest back on
centering you know first amendment take
that we didn't mean to so apologies if
you have a we do have a look
oh go ahead okay go in now I just need a
break no I was just gonna say we do have
a couple comments here from Peter hatin
using the PM Weekly hashtag do you think
LCD versus OLED is such a huge deal
given the way Apple does OLED there
isn't a huge viewing difference plus I
find LCD a little more color accurate so
I guess this is more related to
multimedia and usage of the camera but
do you find saturated OLED a little more
troublesome when dealing with specific
tasks like photography alright so with a
LED and you know photography I mean I
don't I don't see because it's you know
yet some photography in media viewing
and you're you're mostly just applying
all these you know software tuning and
you know rec.709 and whatever that you
can put onto a screen and that's kind of
what you can do in terms of Ola and it's
just the fact of the matter is that you
can turn them off and therefore it'll be
deeper blocks period and then oh yeah
there's the you know they can show off
16 million million colors better because
now the programming is more efficient
and you can whatever but in terms of you
know distorting what you see or when you
take a picture or something something
like I'm not sure where you're getting
at here well I mean the there's there's
different philosophies for o LEDs and
there's nothing that prevents an OLED
from being very color accurate
I remember the galaxy s7 when you
switched it out of the adaptive color in
the adaptive brightness modes was
actually one of the most color accurate
displays that we had ever seen on a
mobile device and I don't feel like we
had that same experience with the SI and
no eight generations of phones like I've
I feel every single Samsung phone I've
run into since has had a ready year
display than what we had for the s7 and
so given apples penchant towards this is
a phone for creatives this is a phone
that you come to really trust and expect
apples flavor you know like the iPhone
camera and
assessing on the iPhone camera has not
changed substantially the biggest change
was the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 and
even that was just very minor tweaks to
contrast to brightness into saturation
over the previous generation of Apple
photos and I think in part because that
actually does help an OLED pop a little
bit more so apples not really pushing
the boundaries in the Samsung territory
with the way that they do sharpening in
contrast but they wanted something that
was gonna be a bit more crowd pleasing
than just an OLED which might have felt
felt like you wanted to be able to see
it so if you held an iPhone 8 plus
against an iPhone 10 you want the
consumer to immediately recognize that
there's some kind of difference I think
actually apples been pretty reasonable
about it we know that they're trying to
make a crowd-pleasing move you know it's
marketing and it's and it's an emotional
product positioning but I think they've
gone about it in a very reasonable way I
I don't feel like you you you can't
trust an iPhone camera on an OLED screen
in the way that I very much do not trust
the output from a Samsung camera when
viewed on a Samsung display on that
phone screen when that phone screen is
in its most automatic color shifting
crowd-pleasing
color saturated mode once you once you
disable that I feel you get a much
better representation of what that photo
is gonna look like on another display
but I think Samsung is going out of
their way to make the output from their
camera look as lush as possible on their
screen and that's not always reflective
of what that photo really resembles so I
mean especially opposite things like
like when we saw the pixel some of the
pixel controversies on OLED pio LED and
LCD and people complaining that maybe it
was a bit too plain I think that there
was a better argument to be had that
Google just didn't really focus on
trying to impress at that emotional you
know primate level of what's the
prettiest juiciest lushest colour
representation that we can deliver and
that actually rubbed people the wrong
way
saw those apps and all of those mods to
try and crank the the screens on pixel
twos just shooting in RAW mode all the
time everything's raw or me but I also
mean like displaying that and there's
there's a reason why you know you you
don't you don't show a client a raw
photo you always touch it up because you
you can't expect anyone to have that
little bit of imagination that the final
output will be better than than the
actual raw capture you just need all
that info to do the editing
we've got from da solder on Twitter
we'll the other OEMs get left behind by
the race 200 led by the big guys and
also will LG ever catch up with Samsung
with their OLED quality you know Apple
is like we've been doing the reporting
this week that Apple is like two years
ahead of everyone else in terms of troop
death and the the freaking the vertical
oscillating whatever the heck kind of
lasers lately in the parts that you need
for a camera system such as true death
death analysis and whatever that like
that that's that's a big advantage that
they have in terms of the supply chain
in terms of R&amp;amp;D and just being able to
you know make that happen in a
reasonable space with OLED it's a little
bit it's changing now we're in the early
stages Samsung is still kind of the the
market leader for this but even now
because of the performance of the iPhone
10 and you know they're getting told
that they have to cut orders they have
to cut production there could be a
little bit more room for other volumes
to snatch in take a more stock over and
if a manufacturing lines there's just
yeah yeah yeah they're able to take up
stock and you know just use it on their
phones now at the last minute or
something like that so yeah I mean it's
possible it's possible and as for LG I
mean I I have not suffered using a P
OLED on the LG v 30 and and I know there
have been examples of people that have
had wildly inconsistent backlighting or
some really bad
banding on gradient colors I have not
shared those concerns so when I look at
LG from a manufacturing standpoint I
really don't feel that it's the best
example of an LG P OLED versus the
samsung amoled is really that far behind
I would say the quality of display is
probably just above what we had on the
galaxy s6 so they're about a generation
and a half to two generations behind but
I still find that those displays are
eminently usable and they look fine the
biggest issue I think facing LG is
fulfilling demand while also making sure
their QA is up to the strictest
standards and I think that's a tough
call for any company to iterate at scale
from all the other like you know if
Apple jumps into LG is a P OLED supplier
you know you're gonna have a significant
amount of demand that you have to
fulfill and you can't be dumping a ton
of displays out if they have minor
defects and that's not a good place for
LG to be it's getting those lines up to
a quality and a consistency that
consumers can rely on yeah simulator
guys says on YouTube and I think you man
speak the truth some people just don't
understand what Samsung does and a
couple of people talking about their
picks on excel pixel to excel excuse me
just their screens are okay so
definitely a lot of greens going on and
we'll look to have more of your feedback
as we go on this show let's head over
into one of our big stories this week
which is white Rome speaking of the
freaking face IDE true depth and
whatever that that's just one of the
possibilities that I floated out there
that some other people flowed out there
but we're talking about Google here
which is expanding its own efforts into
phone making but it also has a ton of
other prize that it has its fingers in
so it could be that you know there again
this would be something like a lil novo
and know a Motorola that's right that
was the company that they bought where
there was just a lot of assets showing a
lot of you know taking up stone the IP
here so it sounds like what we're going
for
is that with white row
so I guess talk about what you have in
terms of light your in terms of what
you've been able to suss out with its
products if you've ever interacted with
them at all yes so my experiences with
light show have been very very minimal I
I did get to play with the very original
sort of rectangular light row camera
I've not played with any of their new
work if you could show it back on the
screen right here so I've spent
literally minutes playing around with
one of these and again there was a
really exciting novelty to what they
were trying to accomplish with this
camera I you know focusing after the
fact depth tracking and and being able
to display photography in a digital
space in a way that we'd never seen
before really interesting ideas but also
something that at that time was a was an
idea that numerous other companies were
also playing with so I mean if you
remember we used to have apps on Lumia
cameras that would allow a Lumia camera
to take multiple exposures throughout
the focusing range of the camera so that
then you could refocus I think the
actual name of the app was refocus is
you could refocus your photo after you
took it so you could say you know like I
took this photo and it pulsed through
all of it you just had to hold still for
a second I'm kind of surprised that
Google would be making such a strong
play according to these these these
rumors this insider info for a company
like light rail where I kind of feel
that a pixel camera is already
demonstrating a number of the properties
that would make a light row camera
system successful where the pixel two
cameras is very adept at taking extreme
extreme number of exposures to help
improve low-light clarity to help reduce
noise to make sure that your exposures
are really nice and crisp and contrast
II Google's software approach to
processing all of that information is
already pretty formidable so I'd be
curious to see what assets Google thinks
it might need from a company like light
troe I mean we'll never get the full
scoop on that we'll never get the full
answer but that's absolutely the
fly-on-the-wall conversation that I'd
like to hear because I kind of feel
we're already well into software photo
and video processing tech that could
rival what the hardware on a light row
could do I don't think that's any
extreme hurdle to get over so what is it
that we're lacking for some of these
other fun features or refocusing
features or depth tracking if Google's
answer to dual camera systems was a
single lens on the pixel that software
could determine the depth between your
subject and your background then what do
we have left to figure out I kind of
feel like that pies been baked we've
solved that problem hmm
well what was it one of the like
satellite features of the original
electro cameras the perspective shift
like you could change it a little bit
just by from the data it was able to
acquire from the light vectors that was
capture I don't I don't remember
honestly for when I I mean I got to play
with Elektra when this was brand
spanking new and the big thing we were
all flipping out about was this like one
button press for refocusing and changing
the the focus of your shot after the
fact and so all of these like very
limited website plugins that you could
use to embed a light row photo so that
people could interact with that photo
and from there I didn't really keep up
with what new developments or what new
ideas they were trying to front it just
never really seemed to me to be massima
just sort of fall into that novelty but
not something that I felt had it I
didn't feel it was some burning problem
that consumers were having that they
could solve by buying this piece of
hardware there's there's a part of me
that you know gets a little snarky about
if you're having issues with your photos
not being in focus well get better
taking photos and your photos will be in
focus and they're easier to share than
these sort of digital constructs that
people sort of have to interact with
it's a little like 360 video there
aren't a lot of people who like
interacting with 360
right now uh you know it's like just
point the camera what you want to show
me as opposed to giving the viewer the
freedom to explore the whole frame is
often seen as a burden not a perk and
and I kind of how he's had that same
feeling with Lytro what is it that you
took a picture of why didn't you just
take a picture of that and show me that
picture why do I have to click around in
your photo just for the novelty of
refocusing on different parts of your
frame and I guess that was part of the
consumer detraction to that that made
them or you know naturally directed by
Troy into more of the cinematography
feel the high-resolution theater the
growth of the equipment itself but when
we're talking about the basics of it all
I mean it's just a few components that
may or may not be able to circumvent the
currents parts crunch that we're talking
about for death tracking technologies
such as face ID and why not so it ends
in you know - what precision - watch
what level of like micrometers that were
able to you know be able to pick up on
these things they don't you know there's
lots of potential are lots of high
precision stuff that we may be able to
talk about in terms of depth tracking
and augmented reality so who knows and
even outside of the high precision stuff
you we we can get as tech fans we can
get up our own butts about how much we
care about certain thresholds
professional level thresholds scientific
level thresholds but I look at a pixel
and I I don't think Google is wrong in
having a consumer-grade approach to
solving some of these problems that's
way more reliant on software than on
high precision hardware I'll be very
curious to see what the outcome of an
acquisition especially an asset
acquisition not a team acquisition
they're not even pulling over members
from what it sounds like not even like
what HTC is going through and giving
some of their top talent over to Google
I I'll be very strong as if he has
hardware to the freaking giveaway
well yeah what they've got in the
pipeline hasn't been the most inspiring
from what we've seen so I'll be I'll be
really interested to see because
Google's conversation on the pixel to
was we can do depth of field blurred as
good or maybe even better than phones
with dual camera systems that provide us
some of this better binocular depth
information and what consumer benefit
would we have even from a security
standpoint to utilizing more Hardware on
the front face of your phone to do
something like a face unlock uh uh I'm
not saying that that's wrong I'm just
saying I'll be curious to see does that
really move the needle or change the
conversation I think consumers are
really well served right now and I don't
see where something like that's gonna
spark much imagination other than just
to make people who own the pixel to feel
like they got an inferior product that's
not as secure you know that's a really
delicate conversation to have which I
think Apple has been stumbling with
lately to is every new iPhone that comes
out well your last iPhone is garbage now
like that's that's not a good way to
make your consumers feel good about
investing in your product over time if
you sold us on software processing being
able to hang just as well with hardware
and then the next pixel that comes out
is all about oh look at how much better
this hardware is I I don't feel good
about the pixel Eagles ecosystem
long-term if that's the kind of chat
you're gonna have it's kind of like the
headphone jack oh we have a headphone
jack and now we don't what good was that
text on that advertiser has been huh
Yeah right well I mean we'll get to that
when we do that I guess eventually
things will have to come around but
until then I am quickly trying to edit
in a picture here that I apparently
forgot to add on this post about the one
plus six it's showing the the freakin
leaks freaking slide thing whatever the
hard thing in China yeah right a hot
thing in China is that yo you gotta you
gotta have a slide you have to have a
blurry picture of the slide
eternal corporate presentation we can
well yeah but no I'm telling you to
refresh now because it's there now there
it is so yeah 16 20 megapixel things at
the back quick charging whatever but the
combination of a gigas of RAM and 256
gigs storage with the snapdragon 845 and
it's somewhat of I don't know how to say
if it's reasonable if it's priced at
7:49 now the thing is is that for
context
this is China we're talking about
presumably because the iPhone 10 is
listed here with a $1,500 price tag and
the Galaxy S 9 plus is $1200 but that's
because there are import taxes for and
oneplus is a domestic manufacturer in
China so they'd have to you know and the
fact is is that the 1 + 5 t let's priced
pretty much at parity in both China and
the US so that leads me to believe that
if this slide is holds true that we
should really expect that one plus six
max spec at what $190 above the max spec
1 + 5 t which is the biggest step yet in
terms of modeling yeah this remodeling
of oneplus into you know from a tech
enthusiast budget for value kind of
player into whatever the heck it expires
to be well and I think we do know what
it aspires to be I think the the more
recent changes have been trying to get
out of just being the limited sweetheart
brand for Android enthusiasts and trying
to find some kind of audience mass
market and there are a lot of lessons
that you can learn from other companies
but I think there's been a general trend
where these corporations likely don't
see consumers taking their products here
until we start climbing into price
points that compete with the iPhone in
the galaxy so in China if I mean again
we're because we're talking about
different dollar amounts based on
conversion or exchange rates and they
can make an argument for a oneplus
that's half the price of an iPhone 10
after all of the the import taxes and
fees and subsidies and stuff so I guess
that kind of makes sense our phone is
just as good and it's only half the
price look at what a great comparison we
have against a Galaxy S nine or an
iPhone 10 local argument a fair local
argument if that holds true where they
don't alter the pricing significantly so
again if oneplus arrives costing half of
what an iPhone 10 costs then we're all
gonna be fine you know we're still in
that five to six hundred dollar price
tag if it's if it's significantly more
than that or or if they're only going
after some sort of premium or high-end
variant of the eye of the oneplus X I
think they're gonna have a hard time
with the echo-chamber
of tech enthusiasts but I don't think
they're gonna be wrong for general
consumers just like Google with moving
from the pixel moving from the Nexus to
the pixel I think consumers started
taking the pixel more seriously than the
Nexus because Google got rid of the
branding of other manufacturers and they
would walk into a Verizon store and see
a pixel from Google it's the Google
iPhone and it costs the same as an
iPhone so it must be just as good as an
iPhone and it's Google's iPhone and I
think that psychology goes a long way
toward some of these decisions if a
consumer out there wants something
different and they see the oneplus brand
and they see all of the goodwill that
the oneplus brand is built with
enthusiasts in the space up to this
point and they see it costs the same as
an iPhone and it's it's probably even
better than an iPhone and it offers all
this cool tech I think that's actually
probably the right market position for
oneplus to start making this transition
at even if it's gonna frustrate a lot of
the people who
were earlier adopters of the oneplus
brand and were fans of what oneplus
offered from a bang for buck
conversation so one plus still has a
relatively limited retail footprint
it relies he doesn't even rely on you
know local regional retailers that much
in India does do the Amazon flip cart
thing but if the sells
direct-to-consumer and you know that's
part of building the relationship with
the consumer but it's also more of the
follies of you know you don't have as
much weight to throw around you can't
just go to google and you can't just go
be google and good and verizon and say
okay this is our phone and this is great
and verizon takes a lot you know weight
into that and goes and like goes and
sells your phone for you you oneplus
doesn't you can't do that yet it's and
it doesn't have a few carrier deals
around like ot or telefónica or
something like that it does they're like
a couple of those but it doesn't have
them in the places that really are
matter yet and not even in China I think
with the but C one plus because one plus
I think is is this arm of Oppo that is
more focused on a Western mentality than
an Eastern mentality it's a you know
when we check out the difference between
a 1 + 5 and then Opel our series but
that's good that's only going to get you
as far as Europe if like all crazy about
Chinese cybersecurity isn't all crazy
about Chinese brands the US government's
are crazy about Chinese brands that have
infrastructure deals not Chinese brands
data because the China the American
government did not get pissy with Lenovo
and they didn't get pissy with oneplus
when they went through some very serious
data breaches those products are still
fine but oneplus and Lenovo don't have
designs on the backbone of 5g wireless
connectivity in the United States so
they've got issues
so ZTE let's let's really hammer ZTE
because we all know what a juggernaut
they are in phone sales in the United
States what what I could see is maybe a
two to three year play for oneplus you
start shifting the brand to represent
more of a premium name in the market you
along with that change because you're
charging more for the product if you
find traction with consumers at that
price point at that higher price point
through word-of-mouth advertising you
have a better faith argument for local
advertising in the United States and at
that same time I think when the margins
on the phone are higher you can make
more of a push towards getting a
relationship or a partnership with a
carrier like t-mobile I think that could
be a two or three generation phone plan
from from one plus you find some
traction you start heating up the market
for a premium option we're one plus we
used to totally make this argument about
bang for buck but you know for the same
price we can offer a lot more in your
flagship you know then what you'll get
from a Samsung or what you'll get from
an apple and then you can court some
kind of floor space opposite you know an
LG or an HTC or Motorola that oneplus
will look more exciting in a t-mobile
store for what they have to offer in the
conversation surrounding the brand it
doesn't happen right away definitely
doesn't happen with a $750 one plus six
but by the time we get to a one plus
eight I think you could sow the seeds
for great carrier relationship and a
more premium label for consumers to
interact with I feel bad because one
plus like I concerned that one plus one
it was 2x to be like the freshman years
and then from the 1 plus 3 onwards we
had the unified the freaking design
language of the phone and it just you
know things were getting gone a little
bit better and more and if you consider
that if you take my premise here then
we're already considered to be gen 3 of
this sophomoric one plus going on here
and it's like I'm wondering just
wondering when it when that gets to
evolve into something else and with the
web that actually means something for
them and now like I mean I could finish
that thought but there's also like this
far in my head where it's like yeah
we also have to take the current
political environment where and I hate
to do this but slily president Donald
Trump is calling for a trade worth China
and the the ripple effects of all this
could just run around 1 plus any ways or
anyone else so this is especially a
fractious kind of a time to be taught
about one plus e-naught presence
conversation is unique to one plus I
mean when we see what what oneplus did
with some of the manufacturing acumen of
Oppo you're absolutely right so like the
early days we were a ton of teething
pains and I was not a fan of this
company in the oneplus one in 1 + X era
but that transition from the 3 to the 3
t I think we saw a company that had
realized it had peaked at what it could
offer in the original conversation it
set out to have as being the flagship
killer and shifting their marketing from
flagship killing to never settling and
the 1+5 I think represents the
beginnings of that shift toward
something a bit more mass-market Oppo
also utilizing their frame for the 1 + 5
is a very I phone II clone whereas the 1
plus three I think borrowed more
influence from HTC design classic HTC
design so they're already they were
already shifting what the public
perception of their brand was going to
try and offer and at the same time while
we do see a lot of government pressure
and a lot of influence from like the
Trump administration over business
sectors Broadcom Intel Qualcomm what we
talked about last week and then other
you know issues that we're seeing with
law enforcement initiatives against CTE
in hallway we're still hearing
conversations about companies like Jaime
trying to get into the United States - I
this is my hypothesis this is my guess
III don't feel that there's good
evidence one way or the other when it
comes to this administration as to what
the rational plan might be between what
companies get favored status and what
companies get hammered but because a
company like Xiaomi or accompanying like
Oppo or oneplus isn't trying to make a
play for
sure I don't think they're gonna face
nearly the kind of scrutiny that Huawei
has I think they're gonna slip under the
radar they can probably build up some
kind of better relationship with
retailers maybe 1 + fills up some of the
space that we'll talk about later when
we talk about fall way on store shelves
at Best Buy or Target and then those
companies get to sell products directly
get the benefit of having some kind of
carrier relationship deal because no
one's afraid of oneplus also selling 5g
cell towers and because of that I think
they'll get to sneak in whereas ZTE is
gonna get is gonna get punched in the
face so that that's my guess is I think
we'll actually see Xiaomi and oneplus
over the next three years make more of a
target for American consumers well they
do say in Chinese that the word for
crisis is the same as opportunity so
looking into that from gas otter so is 1
plus aiming to be a premium brand parent
company BBK is pushing brands like vivo
or AAPIs or replacement for Memphis and
I don't necessarily think so because 1
plus is their external thing going on
for the rest of the world whereas Oppo
vivo more of the age of sphere or even
like vaguely into Europe and not that
not played so I mean it says they have
different branches I think they're using
them to the optimal position that they
can put them and David Bautista is
desilva in Europe their chances one
pluses chances will decrease as the
price goes up specially when they've
already been kicked to the curb by Nokia
using a similar strategy they're going
for cut price but high quality Hardware
going on and the software's pre darn
good and it's - David Benji stock might
mean going up scale could be a smarter
play if you can escape Nokia competition
in Europe by making a product that is
supposedly nicer than a majority of the
Nokia phones that will be sold you get
to avoid some of that comparison against
one of the most beloved brand names of
all time
and at the same time you get to pad your
margins better so if the company is
making more money on fewer sapone sold
then that's still a win for a a small
little upstart I mean run out of the
port you know great point here the
quote-unquote we're just a small team
excuse won't cut it any more they've
been talking about how they've built up
their customer support teams and it's
like okay now at some point you have to
admit that's you have a certain amount
of clout you can't beat in at the kids
table but you still can't be at like the
banquets over no infrastructure sort of
criticisms to leather yet a number of
companies - you know when I phones have
problems I think we're willing to
forgive an initial batch of phones that
have issues because we're pretty
confident that Apple's gonna iterate or
improve or at least try to work with
consumers but that's not to say that
iPhones don't have issues I mean almost
every major generational shift of iPhone
has had some kind of major problem which
is then fixed by the S model of the
phone which comes out a year later so if
a oneplus is trying to make the same
play or make the same argument it's not
so much that I can't III can't accept
that their phones won't occasionally
have issues it's that I need to see that
this team can iterate can improve can
support and can replace product very
aggressively and that's something that
they've been hiding I think that one of
the points they've been hiding behind
there we're just a tiny little upstart
team the most is some of the delay in
fixing some of those issues and some of
the messaging that they have when we
have concerns over things like data
privacy Oh was just a goof
you know or oh just a mistake or oh this
wasn't what we intended or just people
didn't understand what this program was
that that's the kind of stuff that I
think could could potentially burn the
brand you know and every time we have
like a story like all oneplus is
engaging in benchmark rigging it chips
away at the image of a company and
images everything when you're trying to
make the emotional plea for why your
phone costs almost eight hundred dollars
that's not really the rational part of
the consumer brain that you're trying to
reach it's the emotional part consumer
brain that you're trying
to reach indeed indeed I think we're
gonna take a break after this next story
here just because there's a hole all
right
and like our sponsor and stuff yeah we
should probably talk about them yeah
virtually at some point you know we've
been talking about some substantial
things but let's get to Qualcomm and
because we had a we had to play a bit of
politics in the back end
talking about their comments to
TechRadar about foldable phones like we
pataga but like Samsung is probably the
highest profile name with its Galaxy X
project we've you know talked about for
a long time but essentially he's like
putting that like Galaxy S x4 you know
SEO purposes and Qualcomm says Oh
conclusion about foldable phones is not
a very hot thing and they're they're
trying not to you know put water on a
fire that everyone wants to see grow so
just give you a few choice highlights
from this interview with some say you do
is product manager at Qualcomm of
display technology and saying I write
down so so manufacturers haven't really
cracked the material science right now
to produce electrodes that can
repeatedly withstand bending and folding
but one quote in regards to the ZTE axon
M with its rigid screens falling on a
hinge trying to fill the void between
now and whenever the first foldable
comes out he says that it looks a little
ugly the use cases are pretty bad the
second display does practically nothing
but I think it's compelling and he kind
of ties that up to the next quote here
if you look at what Samsung and this is
where we get ideas of X I got the X if
you look at what Samsung has done with
the snap targeting 35
as 8x7 with the Dex the desktop
experience stations our chipset can
power 2 3 4 displays at the same time so
yeah we're underutilized right now in
terms of silicon power to display
capabilities we have the GPU horse power
we have everything needed to fully power
all of these extra pixels so big
question here rigid multiple displays if
you can fold them up and you know get
them into a compact form factor that'd
be a bonus but do you think that's the
current that's the that would be a
substitution right now for foldable
displays art form or you know real
estate I really hope it's a place that
we don't live in for very long I really
like some of the imagination and some of
the execution on these experimental
almost prototype style phone designs I
just don't see what problems they
currently solve and also I mean this is
one of the things I'm hoping from
Android P is that Android P is smart
enough to better utilize differing
screen resolutions for me I'm hoping
that Android is better able to utilize
different screen shapes and resolutions
and shift between different screen
resolutions not for foldable or flip-out
screens but to connect other devices to
my phone so the whole quote about you
know we're totally under utilizing the
power of our phones I don't think at any
other time for general consumers have
they been way over buying for their
phones then over the last year I did a
segment on Newegg yesterday talking
about mobile video production and a very
good reason for why you might want a
high-end flagship phone the chipset that
goes into that you're talking about you
know not only shooting 4k video that's
actually not that intensive anymore a
Qualcomm 630 can easily handle a decent
bitrate for capturing 4k video but on
the back end being able to edit very
quickly see a timeline with multiple
tracks of 4k video and some of it from
100 megabyte video files from my
Panasonic and then take that and render
in a reasonable amount of time a new 4k
video file of reasonably high bitrate
quality that's actually starting to tax
the hardware and we still have plenty of
headroom on top of that so for a lot of
consumers out there that just want the
nicest fanciest phone and it's really
expensive and it's really pretty and
it's got a glass back and you know they
kind of check their facebook and they
kind of check their email they have
grossly over purchased in terms of
hardware and capabilities what it is
that they're actually getting out of
that it's like the joke that we used to
make about IMAX being Facebook browsing
machines you know you could get this
beautiful really high-end powerful
all-in-one gorgeous display iMac and
then you're basically just using it for
its web browser is kind of a shame you
you you didn't need to do that but it
felt good it was really emotionally
satisfying and it's really pretty so
that that's great but you didn't need to
spend three grand to have that you know
the actual practical experience from
that hardware so I really hope we're not
gonna spend a lot of time messing with
increasingly more expensive and more
fragile devices that probably have to
make compromises for things like battery
because you know how do you bend or fold
or flip a phone in the same pocketable
space that we currently have and include
larger batteries cuz I think a lot of us
would would like to have better battery
technology attack and at the same time
we could be better utilizing the
chipsets that are in our phones a
Qualcomm 845 connected to an external
display that can not only mirror the
display but extend the Android desktop
would be phenomenal for people who
really are starting to exercise and
utilize the horsepower of that phone or
a phone that could dual boot between
Android and Windows 10 now that Windows
10 has better support for arm chipsets
you know you can make much better
good-faith arguments for leaving laptops
at home and powering the stuff off of
universal connectors USB ports external
GPUs displays that can interact in more
of a laptop style form factor or more of
a touchscreen style form factor and not
be stuck with a proprietary solution
that's only gonna work for one phone
generation so that's what I'm hoping to
see
is if Android P can recognize oh well
your main phone screen is 2880 by 1440
but you just hooked me up to a 4k
display do you want to use this 4k
display as a mirror for your phone
screen or do you want to use this 4k
display as an extra space that you can
put other apps on or you know watch
video on and I'll you know I can make
that choice as a consumer is way more
useful to me than having the back of my
phone also be a screen that sometimes I
can use but most of the time I can
couple more comments here dust or other
we need experimental phones to exist
just so that we can get a variation in
design and stretch your minds of the
hardware or indeed what different
Qualcomm is saying it's a compelling you
you pick up an ax on em and it's really
compelling they're there I think it's
the the the most beautiful design
implementation or execution I should say
the most beautiful design execution for
what I don't think is a very good idea
and I hate to phrase it that way because
I'm a fan of ZTE and I desperately want
to see an axon 7 follow up that to me do
be a good design but you know when
you're basing that off of a bad idea
it's kind of what's the point
Zack and and again an idea that's just
ahead of its time in that Android is not
smart enough to handle extra screen real
estate you have to manually tell the
phone that the the other display exists
and I don't think that's a good place
for a consumer to be and that hasta
means that you had to make other
compromises that hinge the extra display
the the hardware which is beautifully
machined it is a gorgeously piece
together phone it meant that they had to
make compromises on things like chipset
so while we're out here talking about
foldable displays with Qualcomm 835 and
845 s the axon M has to join the
conversation and the end of 2017 with a
Qualcomm 821 you know that's that's
tough cuz you're paying for something so
you're paying for this hinge which is
beautifully engineered but not very well
incorporated into the Android ecosystem
and you then as a consumer have to
sacrifice the horsepower that you would
have hoped to have had from a modern
2017
end of 2017 phone at that price tag so
that that's where I'm not sold on
dual-screen rigid dual screen or
foldable displays I don't think they
solve enough consumer problems to
warrant the extra compromises and the
extra costs associated with making them
durable enough for lifestyle abuse and
one more comment here before we take a
break and you did mention a few times
about the over purchase of the power
smart phones from Clinton Roche another
meeting of over purchase I have spent
about $1,800 on phones this year the si+
noting and the pixel to excel so
congratulations are a big spender Club
today for being able to remove that like
a ribbon that we can send him like the
best participation trophy
congratulations from pocket now and the
part that's that's kind of one of the
things that I was touching on yesterday
for Newegg too is we've got these
insanely powerful pocket computers and I
don't think we I mean we in the tech
journalism industry but then also
definitely more on the manufacturing
side the the companies that actually
make these products have done a very
good job educating general consumers as
to what some of the capabilities of
these devices might be I know I've
mentioned it before on this podcast but
when my when my little sister graduated
college with her PhD we went to the
graduation ceremony we saw her walk and
with at the time I had an LG g6
on lg g6 with a Qualcomm a21 I shot
video recorded a choir singing their
alma mater got decently zoomed in video
footage of her walking across the stage
panning through the audience you know
family members crying in our little row
of seats from her getting her diploma
and before the rest of the graduation
ceremony was done and before we were
able to meet back up with my sister I
had edited and rendered a new 4k video
of the graduation ceremony all shot at
the graduation ceremony all from a phone
you know I I think there are numerous
people out there above and beyond what
like Apple can do with iMovie who would
definitely benefit and appreciate some
of these tools and the fact that they
are substantially powerful mobile
production tools even if they don't get
the full use out of them
I don't think they even realize they can
do half as much as what you actually can
from these phones instead we're just
sort of more impressed by like oh you
know I can open a Facebook app a
fraction of a millisecond faster than I
could last year so that's that's pretty
nifty I don't really think that's moving
the passion on incorporating this tech
into our daily lives as much as it is
just sort of again and there's an
additional distraction for what's the
most expensive phone what's the most
popular phone
what's the prettiest phone cool and then
we just kind of get stuck there for
future phone iterations because that's
what sells what is the true value of a
smart phone these days that's what we
want to ask and keep asking those
questions but we'll take it a few
seconds here to talk about our sponsor
yes and our sponsor this week is the
Google cloud platform are you looking to
move to the cloud do you not know where
to begin check out the Google cloud
platform weekly podcast where Google
developer advocates Melanie Warwick and
Mark Mandel answer questions get in the
weeds and talk to the GCP team's
customers and partners about best
practices from security to machine
learning and more hear from
technologists all across Google about
trends and cool things happening with
our technology you can click to learn
more and subscribe to the podcast at gqo
slash GCP podcast and we thank them for
supporting the PocketNow weekly and we
are back with the more news more views
more interesting things and there's a
there's a conversation brewing over in
our YouTube chat about one of our big
stories for the back half here but I
want to get back on the train here
discuss something that Apple Apple seems
to be always in the state of flux in
software it feels like like it never
seems to be like i also like today or
actually last night I was rewatching the
freaking what was it unlock I had four
features the the girl using the iPhone
tense face ID'd and then it was like
she's walking throughout the school
unlocking lockers staring at it's a cute
spider I mean again I think Apple Apple
makes a I I adore apples marketing for
coming up with fun and novel ways to
showcase one individual feature and it's
nothing from that did nothing for me
it's not for me
you know what I mean like but I totally
so so like I always point to the water
resistance ad for the iPhone 7
you know ac/dc playing thunder as this
bicyclist is about to go out in
torrential downpour but he's okay
because his iPhones now water resistant
that was an ad for me that was a baller
ad but this one the whole face unlock ad
it doesn't do anything for me and also
I'm just not personally that I'm 23
years old it doesn't do anything for me
it's like it's nothing cool it's like oh
that's not just shows flying beakers or
whatnot and not like Facebook posts and
and other things is I think that that ad
is going to emotionally resonate with
someone who will think that that's cool
you know there is someone who's using
maybe like an iPhone 6 and the idea of
just holding up their phone to their
face and watching it unlock is gonna be
a fun feature for them to incorporate in
the way that they use their phone and I
think Apple does a very good job of
tapping into the fields for the person
who's likely to find an ad like that
motivating
consume that Apple ad as opposed to the
what's the computer iPad ad which makes
like because they're not even
Millennials and like we're making fun of
the generation coming after Millennials
now before they even had a chance to
name themselves and and and that is just
the most reductive view of what future
tech integration and communication is
going to make everything about the
concept of the ads and the actual
execution of that themselves we've been
it's the good kind of family but we
eventually we could go on your the point
you were trying to account the
notification bug where it's like it's a
van against something yeah like it shows
the like the message notification text
but you know it's like it's hidden and
then once you unlock it it should expand
to read out the contents by it it's like
it doesn't properly do so like the text
appears outside the bounding box for a
second so that was in the first version
of the ad guess what they had a second
version of the ad all the same things
but that one shot was replaced with
something that had to be either
computer-generated but it was like a
different shot and it was like you
featured the freaking notification box
properly you know fading in the text
without you know how to get appear
outside the box which is kind of enough
apples in its own fantasy world for a
second year because that hasn't been
fixed in the real world just yet but the
one interesting thing I should note is
that the YouTube video like they posted
on YouTube it still has the original
views it still has the original freakin
publication date and whatnot and so yeah
they just got their privilege you know
don't believe that they have a beta
version of iOS that fixes that problem
that they were showing off on on camera
that they fixed coming to all iPhones
next week you don't think that that's
what could have happened it's the magic
of marketing man I don't know what
you're talking about
speaking of marketing Verizon it's doing
its own marketing now I should say is
it's not just about the Galaxy S nine
showing up as an add-on as a push
notification on iPhones it's just the
whole attitude towards oh hey let us
mark direct market you something via
push notification when Apple clearly
states that you should we shouldn't be
direct marketing you anything through
push notifications and we're just gonna
do this anyways and apparently this
behavior has been allowed for so long I
mean at some point the ultimate kind of
irony that ultimate
slap in the face how to happen like
really seriously well but you know it is
I can appreciate where it's definitely
got to be upsetting for iPhone owners
though because these rules seem to be
very inconsistently applied to certain
brands over other brands and iOS the
developers for God's sakes
oh no exactly that's what I mean is like
there are certain guidelines and rules
that you have to participate to to use a
walled garden app ecosystem and apples
are pretty strict unless you're a major
carrier like Verizon and then well will
kind of turn a blind eye to that we
we're gonna have difficulties I think
over over the next couple years as we
sort out you know sort of the impact of
a near monopolistic approach to consumer
information and how companies can
leverage user data what they have access
to and what they can also put in front
of our faces on the products that we
kind of own but don't completely own
even though we bought them and this is
definitely something that I think
deserves some scrutiny or some ire from
people who are tapped into that iOS
ecosystem because Apple also makes a ton
of messaging about how they don't I mean
you're not buying a Google product so
your information isn't being used for
marketing and advertising where Apple
we're better than that and we don't turn
our users into beta testers we don't we
don't turn our user info into marketing
marketing analytic analytics data to be
sold but here's an ad from Verizon right
in your face
hey that's that's that's a tough spot to
have both ideas sort of running
simultaneously through an iOS fan iOS
fans mind and I'm sure that has to cause
some disruption and this tweak from Nick
corn whose isn't participating in our
particular conversation but each waiting
at the time in response to the original
post that's showing off this low low
oddity that he's tweeted Apple and
Verizon about this multiple times they
were
quired notifications to use their data
via widget which is such a BS practice
Apple clearly doesn't care enough to
enforce their rules for certain players
but don't put a calculator in your
widget or rejected well yeah I mean I
think he's more more impassioned more
emotionally making kind of the same
argument that I was you know it's it's
all well and good to have a mysterious
black box of approvals it's a bunch of
the concerns that I've had with Google
on YouTube is a platform Apple with
their App Store as a platform numerous
other cases in instances far too many
for us to go through in any sort of
meaningful fashion by can't see the
hands of the overlord that you're
serving so yeah and and you also don't
know when you've screwed up until
afterwards and then you have to like beg
for forgiveness
there's no after action there's no good
accounting there's no there's no way to
sort of head off some of these concerns
beforehand
unless you're somehow a major force that
Apple doesn't want to fight so really
it's just you have to be too big to fail
once you're too big to fail then Apple
won't enforce any of their policy on you
they'll they'll just spend all of their
time and energy going after smaller
developers and players maybe like for
their ads where they show the carrier's
logo for one second it's just like we're
not going to put your logo everywhere
again under ads I don't know yeah
something like that all right
that's a finish off here with Instagram
one of the constant pet peeves of
everyone that likes to see up-to-date
posts and not host through like five
days ago
they're finally like and this is news
coming off of other stuff happening at
face but how particularly know what's
going on is that I do but I for this the
purposes of this podcast I'll just be
willfully blissfully ignorant of it by
half yeah well it's seen yeah but
Instagram hey look at that it's this
Facebook owned entity that's actually
doing the right thing that people have
been asking for us
about time finally well I mean we should
probably tell people what it is is you
know cultivated yeah that's right going
through algorithms what Facebook started
doing was making it ever more painful to
get to just a chronological view of your
timeline and they started trying to
really manufacture a how long can you
keep viewers eyeballs on the screen so
when you exhaust the most recent updates
from your chronological view people will
leave Facebook so what Facebook started
doing was really manufacturing posts out
of chronological order in a way that
would try and keep people more engaged
with the platform for longer and longer
periods of time it's a really sort of
insidious digital junkie mentality for
for social media so with Instagram under
the Facebook umbrella they started doing
the same thing to the timeline for
Instagram this metaphor doesn't work
very well
cultivating content in a way that
Instagram algorithms thinks is going to
engage more with people because of I
think sort of the Twitter effect for how
Instagram is used if you you post
something to Instagram and it's fairly
timely you want people to interact with
it in a fairly narrow time frame and
also it feels really creeper to go back
through someone's timeline and start
interacting with posts from a week or
more ago so I think this is I think this
is an acknowledgement that this plan
probably did not have the desired effect
at Instagram if people complained about
it but we're using Instagram more
Instagram wouldn't be changing to have
Instagram be used less right no one no
one says like oh hey people are using
our service a ton more and we're seeing
much better interaction with sponsored
posts we're making more money oh but a
few people are loudly complaining about
not having chronology view so let's go
back to that no no corporation would
ever do that I do believe that this user
backlash isn't just a vocal minority who
are loudly complaining I think this had
a negative impact on
the usage of Instagram and now they're
recovering to try and go back to
something that's a bit more timely I
know I'm looking over my own stats on
what apps I use my usage of Instagram
has curtailed significantly since these
changes went into place and there was no
conscious design on that it wasn't that
they did this and I thought to myself
well that does it I'm gonna stop using
Instagram as much I've just naturally
not been interested in what photos my
friends have posted last week and if I
don't have sort of a safe feeling that
I'm interacting in the moment with
people who are sharing content because I
follow a lot of really great
photographers but I want to see what
they're doing right now I don't care
about what they did three or four days
ago
they don't care about what I did three
or four days ago we're just not
interacting with each other we're
talking past each other because of an
algorithm that holds our content for a
week so while it's great that they're
gonna try and make this more timely I
think instagrams best play would be go
back to a chronological view or at least
give us the option buried deep in the
settings to go back to a chronological
view because I think that's gonna be the
best way to maximize the interactions on
Instagram I posted this photo I'm
actually still on the photo you drop me
a comment in the time that I'm still on
my photo we'll have a conversation if
you drop me a comment on a photo that I
posted like a week ago I don't know that
I'm really gonna engage I don't know
what I'm really gonna spend a lot of
time on that conversation well it's it's
a very complex formula of you know
choosing your favorite subjects or
subject matter and then applying the
timeliness factor to it and you know
that's what we prioritize every time you
hit head on the freaking pack you think
you think about how much work goes into
all of that algorithm which is still
gonna be inferior for for true
interactions for a lot of people it's
still gonna be inferior to just what's
of the date and the time okay
order it that way like all of this
timeliness stuff and like manipulating
our feed in any way is inferior to
chronological view and is more difficult
to execute and it's still gonna rub
people the wrong way for how they want
to
interact and communicate with their
favorite Instagram accounts it's a lose
yeah here's this friend that you like
you sorta get in contact with every so
often and they just had a birthday party
but you didn't know about it until three
days after their birthday party
congratulations
Instagram you still feeling that love
well at least they're gonna try and put
in some brie gramming native we grabbing
stuff into their app now so that's great
right I I guess I you know again it's
the Facebook landed to COO with
Instagram in a platform that they could
use to beg borrow and piecemeal out
services that they couldn't acquire you
know like using Instagram is the best
leverage against snapchat for example
was a genius move where it goes from
there I I don't know and especially what
some of the backlash in the ire that
we've seen with Facebook recently I
think they're gonna be putting more
pressure on Instagram to perform because
of the different splits of audiences
that are starting to cool off on using
Facebook as a main platform you can move
them to another service you can kind of
keep them in the Facebook ecosystem to
some degree I I think that's probably
why they're reacting the way they are if
you're nervous about Facebook not having
the same kind of brand engagement and
then you're starting to see that the
algorithm changes you made the Instagram
are starting to chill some of the user
base there I would be terrified after
watching snapchat fall apart if if an
Instagram like service started to fall
apart that would be terrible
yeah I would be backpedaling super fast
to try and get people back into heavy
use on Instagram like I used to be my
Instagram used to be something that was
almost always up on my phone screen just
kind of patting through stuck in a
grocery line store waiting to check out
like it's kind of flipping through a
couple Instagram posts and now I I don't
touch it nearly as often I don't touch
it
nearly like I used yeah and finally lots
of things going on here with this story
and it has definitely sparked a
conversation in brother
with Huawei talking about Best Buy and
or not well it's people talking about
Best Buy
ditching Huawei and far away saying that
it's still friends with Best Buy so so I
mean I'm getting a lot of comments here
about talking about how other countries
are starting to look into their concerns
about kwame or Chinese manufacturers
getting into their grids for 5g like
Canada in the UK a lot of a Europe so
you know that's the again that's the
specter that we're going right here that
China using you know it's commercial
properties being able to influence
what's going on with the telecoms grid
for the countries then it does business
with and that's apparently a big cyber
security threat that's the that's the
backdrop now in the foreground we have
the front end companies like Huawei and
ZTE that do both telecoms equipment and
consumer smart phones and tablets and
computers and whatnot they're not
getting picked up by carriers they've
been working for the past couple of
years to be able to hope to reach
carrier status ZTE did with the axon em
they're getting sold by AT&amp;amp;T and
literally at CES Kwame was like this
close to getting into announcing that
they were going to be also getting salt
meat empro was gonna be sold by AT&amp;amp;T and
also for Eisen at one point but um the
you know they pulled back and there was
a lot of DC like color blue about oats
if this is a charity and we still have
these ongoing investigations about them
breaching sanctions by doing business in
Iran which we don't approve of and you
know that's why we should keep our eyes
on them and there and then the FBI
things like the freakin meaning of the
six intelligence agencies took place
they testified to Congress and said
don't buy ZTE and don't buy huawei
phones
ever so this is this is also I think one
of the things that's facing cuz I'm a
fan I'm a fan of the Huawei brand and
I'm a fan of ZTE these are two companies
that I very much enjoy the products that
they produce and I'm always looking
forward to what they bring to the table
because I think they do some really
interesting things my personal bias out
of the way
the biggest problem I have with this
story is I want to see evidence because
if there are concerns it is partly our
platform and partly our voices that need
to help spread the word to not only our
viewers and our followers of people who
find our videos but then also our family
and friends who we've recommended some
of these products do I have a personal
stake in this knowing that I have a few
family family members on on our phones
because on our phones are pretty badass
especially if you're looking at that
bang for buck ratio I want to be active
in that conversation if there's our
they're there if there's an actual issue
that warrants our attention and and I
find this to be phenomenally frustrating
to hear advisories law enforcement
advisories against these products but
then not have any evidence and still to
this day I don't believe we've seen any
significant evidence from people that
are very good you know like white hat
style people who like to peek under the
hood of gadgets and consumer electronics
also not having found any significant
potential for threat whereas we have
faced significant threat from from bad
actors in the software space on numerous
products in the past I singled imagines
because I remember them hitting hitting
pretty hard but you know lenovo laptops
that had included software before
microsoft got really hardcore about the
Signature Edition Windows Windows
distros oneplus also major data breaches
and major problems with how personally
identifying information from your phone
was being stored on cloud servers in
China where were our security I you know
where were our security bulletins from
law enforcement for those companies so
until I can see some kind so I feel
every country if the United States law
enforcement community is issuing
advisories against these companies I
totally believe every other company
should also be examining the the retail
footprint of a huawei or a ZTE - but if
there are actual security threats and we
don't detail what those threats are to
consumers then I think law enforcement
being negligent in their cybersecurity
duties in properly informing the
populace on how to protect themselves
and if there aren't then this is gonna
read like the United States government
just being overly punitive against the
corporate infrastructure sector of these
businesses as opposed to the consumer
facing electronics side of these
industries just like we don't confuse LG
displays with LG washers and dryers
there are practically two different
companies okay get you off your soapbox
for just a second here but I want to get
into like the specifics of Best Buy
because like the way carriers basically
faraway never had them so they weren't
exactly gaining ground but they weren't
losing it either and with this with the
Best Buy they're losing retail they're
losing a retail partner in this and yeah
all this stuff about oh we're going to
be stock in a few weeks and then we're
not gonna order any more quality
products from mate books to tablets to
phones to whatnot that's a you know
that's still we're still seeing quality
products being sold right now it's gonna
take a few weeks barring a pre-emptive
announcement by Best Buy or hallway like
indicating that this will be true now in
the case of Best Buy and highway in
specificity there could mean just a real
one big reason why this particular
relationship has fallen down and that
was with that make 10 Pro we're going
back to that though because as you may
recall a couple of weeks ago hallway or
actually like one a month ago
hallway initiating a context for
something like they were giving away a
mate temper o to a beta testing group
that was like software testing group or
something like that that it was very
confused that they themselves admitted
admitted that there was a cop lady
Barris that clear test furred leaving
reviews on best one leaving reviews of
the product on Best Buy while the phone
was still in pre-release while the phone
was still in pre-orders so you know
going back on that and evaluating that
as one of the more apparent kind of
factors than the chips against Huawei it
could be just a chart in front of the
Chinese company trying to feel out these
things and justly appreciate where that
might have contributed because because I
think that could go hand in hand with
Best Buy having an expectation that the
may 10 Pro was gonna end up at 18 T so
Best Buy would have a phone that is also
getting some back-end support from 18 T
for branding and marketing and being an
18 t store shelves something that they
don't have to do all the legwork for
putting the mate empro up on its own
in-store display taking up retail floor
space and then they also get this this
problem with Huawei on you know playing
shenanigans with the product ranking
situation at Best Buy now to be fair
Best Buy also had some problems in that
you could rate and review products that
weren't available to be sold so you know
they I feel like they asked to learn
something too and how they're trying to
position themselves as and as a resource
for consumers to educate themselves but
I would I would wonder if in the whole
grand scheme of mobile market and
tablets and laptops and what companies
are delivering what brands if that would
be enough if the if the rating contest
that Huawei put up in and I don't think
they put it up in good faith if that
rating contest would be enough to
completely sever Best Buy from one of
the world's largest phone and laptop
manufacturers and especially on the eve
of the mate book coming the new may book
coming out which I think could be a
really exciting floor model for
consumers to check out looking for an
alternative to to a MacBook I wonder if
that's not all wrapped up together with
maybe
pressure from law enforcement pressure
from government on top of some of those
shenanigans and best by feeling like
they they weren't getting in the may 10
what they thought they were they thought
they were getting a carrier supported
phone then selling the phone in a Best
Buy is way easier than just selling an
unlocked phone in a Best Buy so I think
you're right I think it is multifaceted
and there are a lot of prongs going out
it's not just this law enforcement
advisory but I'd still want to see some
reporting or some better communication
as to what is triggering all of these
reactions to Wall way as a brand and
until I see that I I don't know that I
feel super strongly about avoiding their
products I'm gonna be very upset if
there is a good reason to avoid their
products and they went months without
telling us but then we'll rejoin the
conversation and we'll share what that
when those findings are and why people
should be concerned
I don't feel people should be concerned
now until there's a reason for them to
be concerned in the meantime if you
don't feel any particular loyalty if you
don't have any programs that you know
offer you discounts at Best Buy you do
have your alternatives that Amazon B&amp;amp;H
whatever the fact that you were offered
it so there is that Andrew Wallace that
producer on Twitter he talked to some
Best Buy employees he was actually
formerly Best Buy employee as well a
couple of hours ago and they didn't even
know about the far we just D stocking in
that store until I mentioned it so
there's that it could be that this is a
directive that is being rolled upon
hasn't left corporate yet like again
this is a lot of CNET this is this is
like we don't know where their point of
entry is in terms of talking about this
stuff so yeah it's it's good like this
could not panned out at all so right but
it's differently at the point we're at
it's definitely something that we should
be concerned about either for Huawei or
for I don't know the our consumers so
well and also I mean that that's that's
kind of where I'm taking this from is I
have concerns for consumers we want to
see more competition I think Huawei may
phenomenally competitive products and if
there is a concern for consumers we want
to be a resource for people to
understand what the potential risks of
using a product might be and it kind of
feels like a lot of that information is
being held from us or there isn't really
a fire there's just a lot of smoke so
that's that's why I mean we'll probably
be covering this as it as it continues
to unfold because it's frustrating
speculating like we all want better
information as to who we do business
with yeah so definitely a lot to be
talking about you can see full details

say so myself
and a lot of really interesting news I
mean not not not a heavy week for like
hardware announcements but some some
really good meaty stories to dig into
and and something I'm gonna hopefully be
following up on soon too which I mean we
didn't talk about but hopefully we can
cover when there is more to cover would
be the potential partnership between
IFTTT and IBM Watson so I might finally
get my Watson phone courtesy of reason
to spout Joy's like they're actually
trying to do something with Watson for
consumers I'm very interested in that
conversation too but folks they're you
know just do do my taxes of H&amp;amp;R Block
