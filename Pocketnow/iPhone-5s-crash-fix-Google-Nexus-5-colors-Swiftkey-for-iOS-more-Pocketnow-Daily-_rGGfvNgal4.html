solved with iOS 7.1 says a spokesperson
the google nexus 5 might get additional
color options and SwiftKey may be making
its way to the iphone on sort of i'm
high memory that I and after a server
crash and a lot of issues I haven't had
my first cup of coffee today which is a
record this is pocket now daily the
sources I outputs of official news is
those of you interested in getting the
Sony Xperia z1s on tmobile can now get
an asset today the phone is already
available for 528 parts without a
contract but you could also get the 22
dollar a month for 24 months
installments with no money down which is
great this is pretty much a z1 it's
almost the same phone the only
difference is one obviously it's
optimized for t-mobile and two it's made
out of a plastic frame and not an italic
frame like you have on the z1 and it was
a really compelling phone as we saw at
CES so stay tuned for that now let's
talk about nokia as the company has just
sent us their presentations for their
event to happen at mwc 2014 men
Barcelona this is happening on februari
24th and we will be there covering it
live with Tony now this is really
interesting the question is exactly what
are we getting at this event we're
expecting for the note can normally to
be announced here since we heard that it
was going to be launched on februari 20
spit which is the next day but we're
also expecting the smaller variance of
the Lumia 1520 as well so stay tuned as
the 1520 is a cool phone it's just too
big now let's hope the spotlight over to
Google is we've got this video that's
licking the possibility of there being
color options for the Google Nexus 5 and
this is really interesting currently all
you have is black and white but these
six color options range from red to
purple which is good it's interesting
it's great to have color options we just
don't know when these will be announced
that that is happening or not the reason
why i say not is because the more you
look at this video the boy looks fake
it's kind of fishy so let's see what
happens i mean with the whole moto x
thing i don't know how google plans to
do that well now let's talk about apple
and SwiftKey and yeah these two are
coming together we've got some leaks of
swiftkey coming to the iphone in the
ipad but wait right there it's not
exactly what you expect swiftkey is my
favorite keyboard on
android because i have multiple
languages and it does a great job with
text prediction without having to swap
the languages but interestingly
apparently the iphone thing is not going
to work the same way you know you can't
install third-party keyboards on your
iphone so apparently this will be a
swiftkey notetaking application and we
are trying to understand what is gonna
be great about this thing especially
because swifty is not free on android so
let's see and finally for the i don't
know what's taking them so long type of
news of the day i don't know about you
but I've been having serious troubles
with my iphone 5s resetting itself out
of the blue it happens every time that I
turn on the Wi-Fi and the phone starts
updating applications it'll reset itself
for every app that it installed and well
apparently a lot of people are having
this problem to the point where
spokesperson from Apple just came on
record the state that iOS 7.1 will bring
these updates aside from some
interesting UI changes and definitely
some performance enhancements though
that leads you to the question of the
day after so many months using iOS 7
what has been your impression of the
operating system do you like it don't
like it because in my particular case i
would consider this to be the most
half-baked operating system that Apple
has ever done it is honestly terrible on
the iphone 5s ironic because it works
better on the iphone 5 but leave us a
comment down below what's been your
experience and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
