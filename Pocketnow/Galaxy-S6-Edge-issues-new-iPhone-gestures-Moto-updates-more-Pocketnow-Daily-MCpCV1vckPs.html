complaining about display problems more
rumors claim new touch gestures to come
to the next iPhone an HTC rehashes the
old one m8 with a different flavor for
Europe I'm hi meri behna wishing it was
friday more than I can even express this
is pocket out daily brought to you by
lynda.com we've got a lot of official
news today starting with HTC as the
company has silently launched its new
one m8s we talked about these rumors a
couple of weeks ago and yeah they keep
the same design of the one I made but
not the same internals first of all you
get a snap during 650 instead of the
NATO one you get 16 gigs of storage
expandable instead of 32 and you
actually even get a bigger battery most
likely because of the Snapdragon 615 but
you don't get the ultrapixel camera at
the back it's actually a 13 megapixel
shooter would dual lens which is really
interesting you still get the 5
megapixel shooter at the front but again
the coolest part is that you're paying
half with the one of nine cost if you're
currently in the UK like subscription
for full details and other
specifications other official news today
come from Motorola that could be
disappointing for some if you're rocking
the first generation mode of extra moto
e you're waiting for lollipop you're
probably gonna have to wait more than
you wanted as the company has decided to
ditch their plans for five point 0 point
1 and 5 point 0 point to and they're
going to jump all the way to 5.1 so yeah
it's cool that you're gonna get 5.1 the
problem is you're gonna have to wait for
lollipop oh well how about Microsoft as
the company is planning to give users or
future customers of the surface 3 a demo
that lasts between 15 to 30 minutes of
what you can do with the surface 3 in
Microsoft stores the interesting part is
that you're gonna have to set up in a
plan for this we still don't have in a
specific date for that but we just
wonder exactly how many surface tablets
does Microsoft plan to sell for there to
be a need for an appointment I mean I've
never seen people Flocka microsoft store
ever and nonetheless for surface tablets
the surface 3 is a cool tablet but the
I'm not sure how that's going to work
for the company will see now
get some more rumors that apple will
bring for such technology to the next
iPhone successors apparently this will
make the next generation iphones little
more expensive about fourteen dollars
per unit obviously once you get that on
supply chain and everything that'll drop
the price but apparently that is going
to happen even more interesting is the
fact that you have to remember that this
technology on the Apple watch totally
works on sapphire displays so could it
be that Apple will finally bring
sapphire this place to the next iPhones
and that will probably boost the price
we will see later this year and finally
for the disappointing news of the day it
seems that some customers are already
complaining about this play issues with
the galaxy s6 edge apparently some
people are unboxing the phone and
getting these minor scratches sort of
like the scrub scratches you see on your
car after you wash it other complaining
of dead pixels and some are even
complaining of the display not working
properly we do know that the galaxy s6
edge had some yield issues and we wonder
if that's bringing some manufacturing
problems the Samsung but it does lead me
to the question of the day which galaxy
s6 that you get if any and what is your
experience so far after unboxing it in
my case I'm still waiting for my sixth
edge but I'd love to know in your
