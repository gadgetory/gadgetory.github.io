geun-hye calm and this is the hardware
review of the motorola droid x2 running
on verizon's network so let's get to it
so the dimensions of the droid x2 is 120
7.5 millimeters in height 65.5
millimeters in width and nine point nine
millimeters in thickness the device also
weighs 155 grams some preliminary specs
as we have a 1 gigahertz dual-core Tegra
2 processor along with 512 megabytes of
RAM and 8 gigabytes of internal storage
this device also has an mike microSD
card pre-installed which is an eight
year by car that it comes with which is
expandable up to 32 gigabytes the screen
is a 4.3 inch qHD resolution so that's
540 across x 960 and high pixel
resolution it's also behind a glass
capacitive multi touch digitizer on the
top of the device we have our light
sensor a proximity sensor we also have a
notification LED and our earphone
speaker right here which we can use to
listen in on conversations we have a
motorola emblem on the bottom we have
our verizon emblem we also have our
physical buttons our search our i should
say our menu our home our back and our
search here we have our primary
microphone on the top of the device we
have our power standby button we're
having 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
his secondary microphone on this either
device we have a volume rocker and one
feature that's missing from the droid x2
opposed to the droid x from last year is
we don't have a dedicated camera button
on this side of the device anymore on
the bottom we don't have anything except
for this little tiny lanyard area right
here we have our on this side we have
our micro hdmi cable port which is able
to broadcast up to 1080p resolution to
an HD television or monitor and we also
have our USB our micro USB 2.0 port for
charging and syncing
the back we have our 8.1 megapixel
camera which is capable of recording up
to 720p video resolution and it also has
a dual LED flash over here we have
another microphone which is kind of odd
third microphone for probably really
advanced noise cancellation
conversations we have our speaker here
for our speakerphone or media playback
behind the battery cover which is made
of metal and the entire device is a sort
of a metal and this rubberized grippy
material which feels really good in hand
so let's get out of this and we have our
battery which is a 1500 Milan hour
battery I've made out of lithium-ion in
verizon states that is capable of
delivering 480 minutes of usage time and
220 hours of standby time here we have
our micro SD card slot and this device
does come with an 8 gigabyte microSD
card which I stated before so just pop
the battery cover back on so the radios
of the droid x2 is a cdma 819 hundred
which is able to access verizon's 3g
network unfortunately this device
doesn't have 4g which a verizon has on
their LTE network but that would
probably make the droid x2 much thicker
than it already is we also have an FM
radio along with assisted GPS the other
sensors that are included as an
accelerometer and a digital compass so
this is in the hardware review of the
motorola droid x2 on verizon's network
and if you missed it you can check out
the inbox and i'll post a link right
about here and stay tuned for the
software and final reviews coming up
next thanks for watching
you
