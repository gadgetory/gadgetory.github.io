galaxy s3 is getting more colors and the
iphone 5 apparently won't get an FC I'm
hi Mary vetta and this is poking out
daily LG wasn't kidding when they were
teasing their future smartphone
powerhouse the optimus G was just
announced in Japan and aside from
bringing the quad-core Snapdragon
processor that allows for the LTE chip
to live inside it it also brings a new
IPS plus display that allows for there
to be no gap between the glass and the
LCD it also brings a 13 megapixel camera
but the sad note about this device is
one it was announced in Japan so it'll
take a couple of months for it to get
here and to that it brings Ice Cream
Sandwich one jellybean is what they were
supposed to be releasing Samsung's plan
for world domination is in full effect
aside from Marvel white and pebble blue
the galaxy s3 was now launched in for
more colors you already knew garnet red
from AT&amp;amp;T and now they have amber brown
titanium grey and also sapphire black as
if the device wasn't already sexy enough
but we have a pole at pocketnow.com make
sure you hit the link in the description
to tell us which one do you think is
most sexy now there's some possible
nokia windows phone leaks that we're
still debating of whether they're good
or not i personally think they're fake
if you look at the images closely you
have the FCC mat on the table but then
the device looks clearly as an image
render so i think the artists tried too
hard but that doesn't mean i wish i was
wrong the device looks kind of good so
make sure you leave us a comment down
below and tell us do you think it's a
fake or not on a sad note it was
recently discovered that the Ice Cream
Sandwich upgrades that are coming to
motorola smartphones we're all tracking
if your device is rooted or not not only
that but xda-developers was able to
uncover that the device is now tracking
if you've ever rooted the phone before
how many times you've rooted the phone
in the past show buyers beware does seem
like a motorola doesn't want to be
paying any warranties now the internet
is full of leaks of the iphone 5 billion
of seein they've even found portions of
where the NFC chip is going to be within
the phone but experts are now arguing
that the spot is too small for an NFC
antenna to fit like of Apple wasn't
already notorious for shrinking parts
with every the
they release now the biggest question is
even though NFC is something nice to
have it's something that hasn't really
taken off so this leads me to the
question of the day do you use NFC
because I know I particularly don't use
it that much and I know that a lot of my
colleagues don't so make sure you leave
us a comment down below what do you use
NFC for now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm be sure
to give this video a thumbs up if you
like what you saw I'm hi mera neta
