nail calm here at CES 2013 taking a look
at the Galaxy Note 10.1 on verizon and
look at this huge e branding is about
the size of my hand let's take a look
and see if there are any changes between
this and the other version we've
reviewed so we've got the same 1.4
gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor but
there are some software changes here
most notably it has jelly bean which
makes a big difference when we do this
duel beer check this out so the galaxy
note and the Galaxy Note 10.1 galaxy
note 2 a lot of galaxy devices have the
split screen view the problem was that
there's a responsiveness issue where
when you are manipulating one the other
would basically take a second to respond
but as you can see that is no longer the
case it's basically one to one
performance which is just fantastic and
samsung says that they've added more
apps here and we really don't see that
here but this is pre production software
we've got you know the file browser and
the alarm and the gallery and the
calculator and stuff like that that you
would want to use another new thing here
is called cascade view which is a really
awesome way to stack apps on top of one
another we saw this in as to a certain
degree and the Galaxy Note 2 where you
could see if I can move that around
looks like it is frozen free production
software in
house not working but anyway as you
could imagine what you could have here
is a calculator floating on top of your
email app or you could have your
calendar on top of the web browser while
you're working it's a really cool
feature great way to take advantage of
the screen space to be honest we're
actually excited for the next version of
this when we see a higher res display
because it displays is ok it's just ok
and of course we've got the full
functionality of the s-pen that we've
come to expect and everything's just a
little bit faster here now with jelly
bean but everything's will pretty much
is is the same but we're glad to see
that the dual view has been fixed one of
the best promises you will hear of the
galaxy note 10.1 again pre-production
software it is not responding mytouch
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
