the opportunity to check out the Zen
book Pro 15 and 14 at the Seuss booth
here in the ephah in Berlin this is TK
and this is PocketNow on XDA the Zen
book Pro 15 and 14 are both really good
looking laptops we're talking about
minimal bezels we're talking about
configurations in the i9 i7 and i-5
chipset a lot of good RAM functional
space but the really unique look that
we're getting with both of these laptops
is that we actually have a 1080p panel
instead of where we normally have a
mousepad and that panel is so functional
that it actually augments the experience
on this laptop on top of being a really
good mousepad having a display where
your normal mousepad is is really
reminiscent to what we saw earlier this
year with razer as far as part of Lynda
the implementation here though is it
very different the actual display is not
a smartphone it truly is a 1080p panel
that's augmenting the 4k display that
you have on the laptop it really works
as a second display you can drag things
to it you can run separate applications
or even media controls at the bottom as
you're doing something else on the main
display and that's really the main
benefit here it's too intended to be
almost like having a second screen on
your laptop with you whenever you go
without having the extra bulk or space
that an additional display will take
with you and you're out there if you're
using it as a second display if using is
an app launch or or if you're using it
as a control tab to be able to control
your main display all of these
functionalities will great or you can
even turn them off and use it as a
regular mousepad as it does have that
functionality built in the Zen Book Pro
15 is definitely the star of the show
we're talking about a 15 inch 4k 100%
RGB gamut display that is going to be
just stunning and it's a beauty to watch
very minimal bezels and of course
augmented by the 1080p panel that we
have as a secondary display with all
those functions that are built in you
get three different configurations of as
far as the actual chipset we have an i-9
and i7 and an i-5 as far as graphics and
hard drive and RAM we're looking at the
GTX 1050 Ti video card from Nvidia
as far as dedicated graphics for this
device as well as the fact that we have
they believe going to DVR for 2400 of
the 16 gigabytes of RAM for this laptop
and as far as storage with depending on
the combination you're able to go as far
as maximum capacity of one terabyte SSD
of Drive in different configurations as
far as buddha' and secondary drives as
well let me know in the comments below
what do you guys think of the approach
that we have here with the new laptops
now we are getting a very good-looking
laptop with a lot of horsepower but the
addition of that secondary display where
your mouse pad is it's definitely very
unique and you can actually pick it up
it's not just unique as being demoed
it's something that's available for you
now I can subscribe as usual let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below thank you very much for the
support and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
