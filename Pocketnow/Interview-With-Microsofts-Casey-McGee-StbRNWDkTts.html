pocket now calm and we are here in
Barcelona Spain at the Mobile World
Congress were last year Steve Ballmer
and the keynote house windows phone 7
and one year later joining us today is
mr. Casey McGee with Microsoft he can
see you Mike marketing manager right and
we have some questions we might ask
hopefully we will get some answers and
most of the questions are in the light
of recent events which happen but let me
just start with the first question once
windows phone a successful platform
launched wise was it a successful launch
worn out it absolutely was as your
reference last year we introduced
windows phone 7 for the first time and
we really focused on it having a
different sort of value to people it's a
it's a different design it's an
integrated experiences and we spent a
lot of time last year trying to do see
if people would respond to and how they
appreciate the idea of things like live
tiles of hubs and the way we bring
information together and surface it in a
way that's immediate really really
valuable we started launching bones in
the fall and certainly in the November
timeframe so it's been about three
months we've had phones and market and
what we've seen is a satisfaction is
very very high you know over ninety
percent by most measures and that tells
us that people who experience the phone
really really love the phone they tell
their friends they love the phone and
that's the most important first step
we're starting a new product getting
that feedback and knowing it if you got
it you love it if you've got a product
that people love bidden to build on that
and that's really what this mobile world
congress is about is feeling good about
what we've done in the first year and
talking about what we're going to do
next to build on that success so that's
Friday Steve Ballmer and steaming up
Microsoft and no
kia announced a strategic alliance and
yeah they both emphasize that this
strategic alliance will be good for both
Nokia both microsoft also the users
developers and operators but really for
whom is this the latest deal it's
genuinely about improving an ecosystem
for both companies we succeed when
there's a healthy ecosystem feeding at
both companies in the markets that we
serve so certainly nokia has a
tremendous experience with hardware
innovations with services and bringing
great foams to a number of markets
around the world microsoft obviously
it's been focus on software and you feel
very good about what we've put forth
with smartphone software in windows
phone 7 and doing something a little bit
different that resonates with the
end-users you put those two concepts
together and you create a brand new
opportunity for developers for other
partners retail anybody involved in the
in the phone chain and to have a
different kind of phone and a new
opportunity to create apps and games and
services to really localized content to
take advantage of search and location to
create brand new opportunities within
your local market in your town there's
just a number of ways that we think the
ecosystem can rally around this
partnership and do something completely
different from what's an end bluff for
today so it really is a win win win win
win situation everybody absolutely
that's the goal getting back to
yesterday's keynote Steve Ballmer
announced that there will be some
features
to win this on this year and also
reference that there will be an update
the first update for windows phone 7 at
the beginning of March now I know
Microsoft never emphasized and never
sinned publicly when exactly that
updatable hit everybody expected it to
hit summer in january or februari
because we heard about early two
thousand why was the copy paste update
we call it the copy paste update deal
aids to march it's not so much a delay
it's as we talked about we wanted to
introduce windows phone 7 make sure we
had great experiences and job one was
making sure anybody can picked up and
use the phone had that great experience
and we did that by ensuring that what we
ship worked great in that meant there
are some things that would have to come
a little later and copy and paste was
one of those and as we started testing
the product and getting feedback from
customers we realized that it has to be
one of the next features we add is copy
and paste so as we were shipping the
product we were getting ready to add
copy paste some improved performance for
applications and building that update
the process of creating and shipping an
update is obviously building the code
and then working with our partners to
make sure this is distributed in a way
that that works for the customer works
for the network and works across all
devices and so that's really what we've
been doing for the past few weeks it's
just making sure that everything is
staged and ready to be pushed out okay
one question related to your personal
experience within this 17 I curious
about that my favorite feature is people
what's your favorite feature what are
you most proud of and with this one so
you know it changes I go back and forth
between the music and video experience
and pictures but as a new father it has
to be pictures i love the fact that you
know the pocket the picture feature
where i can pull out my camera and take
a picture my daughter in a matter of
seconds i take advantage that all the
time i love that my pictures all come
together in the hub has my wife post
pictures
comes into the pictures hub we can
manage everything from from one place I
can post up to facebook so i think the
the older my daughter gets in the work
she does and where I use the picture of
and what do you think could use that
most improvement and this one I think
probably it is the People Hub because
people enjoy that experience and because
it is so critical to the phone I think
for example the fact that we are
bringing Twitter integration is a great
example of how we can continue to expand
you know windows phone is a platform
we're going to continue to improve on
all of these experiences over time and
we hope that's what people take away
from mobile Congress as pertaining to
the people up the Twitter integration
great example we're going to look for
every opportunity to continue to add
value and make sure that our design and
great experiences are surfacing the
things that people care about in a
meaningful way as we do that there's a
platform can we also expect some
integration from other services now we
have facebook we have yahoo we have
google we will have twitter can we
expect also linked in my space certainly
nothing to announce at this time i would
say in general you look at the hubs and
the fact that we do want to bring
services and experiences together we're
always looking at what are the right
services and experiences to bring
together in all of the hubs you know
similarly office we brought more office
documents to the office hub by taking
advantage of SkyDrive music and video
will continue to look at how we can
improve that when you look at the gaming
experience we started to show some
scenarios where we can improve the
gaming experience and bring things for
the game hub and certainly the People
Hub will continue to be a hub that we've
invested in print Griffith Instagram
well getting a little bit bets you of
the windows launch which is
approximately plus four months ago we
have started with nine devices from
which let's say there are approximately
only seven on the market because the
HTC 7 bro destined for spring as cdma
device started hidden europe and the gsm
version and the lil venue bro has not
reached the european market yet so let's
say we have seven devices what do you
think we can expect the second wave of
devices when we will other devices be
added to the portfolio from a
manufacturing point that's really a more
partners you know we certainly continue
to advance the platform you see the
updates we work very very closely with
all of our partners to ensure they have
what they need that are compelling new
designs out there and I'm certain that
they're evaluating what their minor
certain look like in the foreseeable
future but you know again really nothing
to announce today about what additional
devices you may see when can we hear
about chassis to specifications
approximately or if we are going to hear
in the near future there's really
nothing new to say about specifications
you know certainly you know we'll
continue to evolve the platform create
those opportunities the next milestone
will be talking subsequently about the
platform I will be in the next time
frame so people who are looking at the
announcements made at Mobile World
Congress and wondering what it means to
developers to other partners
understanding more about any change of
specification around Internet Explorer
certainly multitasking and creating
third-party applications makes will be a
great event to learn a lot more about
how you can get ready for the year ahead
and they're talking about hardware well
there's a feature i'm not using at the
moment and then not found that using its
scope video going and with those stone
setting does not support it at the
moment do you think and many of our
readers as this question will windows
phone seven support vehicle
will we see hardware with front facing
cameras I think we don't have hardware
at the moment because there is no
software support or vice versa that's
exactly right it's the conversation that
we have with our partners we work
together to understand what the customer
wants where there's demand and then
understand what devices to build and
what software to create to take
advantage of that so certainly nothing
to announce today about a timeline
except to say that that is certainly a
feature that we're watching it's
certainly something that we talked about
because our bombers it's you know it's
something that certainly could be done
if it's prioritized and if we and our
partners jointly decide that something
that needs to be built but if that's
going to happen or when I really can't
say today okay there's a there's been an
announcement this week it was involving
sony ericsson xperia play running
another platform and our readers s
that's test the slide-out gaming
controls will we ever get the chance to
see a xbox Windows Phone ever is a long
time you know again there's nothing to
announce today but certainly safe to say
that when you look at the variety of
experiences that we've created with
Windows Phone 7 there are opportunities
to do a number of things but as it
stands today we stayed very strict with
the guidelines the chassis special we
have for windows phone 7 so you know the
opportunities there and there was market
and there was demand to do something
like that I'm sure we'd be in
conversation we had with our partners
but as it is today we're we're building
on those experiences that we've been
successful with thus far and we'll stick
with those you know those specifications
a quick question this one is for me
I'm living in Romania and well you can
buy windows phone 7 harbor in Romania
there's definitely no support for
Windows Live services I mean we don't
have that there which is a huge drawback
from the market share from the sales
point of view do you think we can ever
expect or if yes when an expansion of
the life services marketplace zoom so on
so that I think that will really boost
the sales and the market share 4-1 yeah
we're slowly but surely expanding the
reach of our services our availability
our language support even and you know
every periodically we've had some
updates we talked about some you know
some some better visualization for the
phone there's nothing new in terms of
the specific regions that we're going to
be expanded to nothing we can talk about
for a roadmap perspective except to say
that you're right we certainly
understand this coming well I can't say
to which countries it's coming in what
order of excess fat but I would agree
that the services are our large
component of you know what people love
about Windows Phone and we certainly
understand that we want to make that as
strong an experience as we can for as
many customers as possible and there are
estimates that effect there's a lot of
buzz lately regarding near-field
communication NFC and it's available I
mean the other platform has its support
built-in will we ever get the chance to
see support for NFC or other mobile
payments support any windows phone
setting again I think there's there's a
number of really interesting
technologies and topics that there is
potential to incorporate it into Windows
Phone and things that we evaluate with
our partners understand where there's
demand what the long-term trajectory is
a support for those sorts of things and
then we determine whether or not that's
something that we want
I archives and so I would say that's in
the same category and you know it'll be
evaluated and sort of stats ranked and
we'll figure out what to prioritize your
future business getting back a little
bit in the enzyme to do windows phone 7
launch could you give us a few examples
of windows phone seven large successes
but also figures well certainly from a
success standpoint we felt very very
good about the number of devices the
partnerships that we had and our ability
to have a wide range compelling
applications and games available at
launch there's nothing that we're
looking at as a failure but certainly if
we had more time if we you know if
titles if it resources were infinite you
know we would have liked to have some of
the additional features like
incorporating Twitter we would have
liked to have coffee and page earlier we
would have liked to have been in warm
regions we would like to have broader
service support we certainly understand
there are things we can do to improve
upon the experiences for customers
around the globe but there's nothing
that we felt bad about you know we
wouldn't have shifted product if we
didn't feel like we were putting
something out there that people would
genuinely enjoy and and generate the
sort of satisfaction rates that we've
seen I have a question here from one of
my colleagues he says what are some of
the strengths of Android and iOS that
windows from selling would do well and
emulating we don't feel like it's so
much a matter emulating I think broadly
and you know you look at competing
platforms and they have definitely
showed that there is demand and much
broader demand for smartphones that
customer behaviors have change that
they're using handheld technology very
differently and that it's more broadly
applicable and that's one of the reasons
that we did started with Windows Phone 7
we wanted to create something that had
broader appeal that was a little more
user friendly it would really surface
the things that people care about and in
fact you saw a way to do a little bit
better I think some of the competition
managed to create a little bit more
excitement
more opportunity by servicing surfacing
a lot of individual applications and
showing just how many functions you can
get on to a phone what we learn from
that is you need to take the next step
it's not just for functions on the phone
it's how you organize them and you make
them friendly and you or I shouldn't
have to go find the functions and things
we care about it should come to us it
should be surfaced it should be
glanceable so certainly we saw the
competition doing a good job of consumer
eyes and local technology creating a
broader know kind of a keel and we want
to build on that and do a little better
job going to take it to the next level
so even more people are using mobile
technology okay at last question is
related to the feature Steve Ballmer
announced and the also nokia my
croissant deal thinking these both into
consideration when do you think we might
see a climb in market share for windows
phone 7 when do you expect it will
actually have the chance of climbing
back to where Windows Mobile was a
couple of years back yeah you know it's
tough to project growth rates just
because it is such a dynamic market and
oftentimes it's relative to unknown
movement from the competition but you
know if you look at what we've done we
do feel like we are on course to grub
you know slowly but surely some of the
the addition of CDMA will give us more
handsets in market these features will
make the phones more appealing to more
customers and certainly the partnership
with Nokia when it hits full steam in
2012 we'll bring our phones to a lot
more markets and a lot more compelling
ways and we certainly feel like in
aggregate those things will have a
demonstrable effect well thank you very
much for at a time thank your
opportunity this was ends of the eye
