of color to make a SmartWatch a little
more appealing to a certain demographic
for PocketNow I'm high auto human and
this is a quick look at the new Samsung
gear s2 platinum and rose gold additions
brought to you by D brand we've seen
smartwatches get the revised paint job
treatment before LG did it with your
Bane while we did it with its watch and
now Samsung is jumping aboard it's
important to point out that these are
revisions of the classic the more petite
version of the gear s2 and Samsung has
made no effort to deny that the 18 karat
gold edition is targeted towards the
ladies with its soft leather band and
like color scheme on the other hand the
platinum finish and its black leather
strap are more on the gender-neutral
side though both watches are tiny in
comparison to nearly any other
SmartWatch around so large reset buyers
beware we've already seen all that the
gear s2 can do and in fact we've already
given it the review treatment but it may
be due for a revisit soon as Samsung has
told us that it'll be adding iOS and
Samsung pay support to the gear s2 later
this year we weren't given an official
price tag but the platinum and rose gold
gear s2 models will be available for
purchase as soon as February for more
