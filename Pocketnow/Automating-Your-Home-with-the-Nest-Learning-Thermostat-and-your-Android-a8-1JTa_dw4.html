all know that smartphones and tablets
have helped quite a bit to organize our
personal lives they hold all of our
contacts they hold our emails they hold
our calendar it's great it's all right
there and it's all with us all the time
but what can we do to help automate some
other parts of our lives well that's
where the Nest Learning Thermostat comes
into play using your android-powered
device or some other smart phones you
can control the heat or the air
conditioning in your house let's unbox
this and then see how it works this is
the Nest Learning Thermostat this is
just the surround that goes around a
very nice very elegant this is the
thermostat itself now the thermostat
looks like one of those old-fashioned
kinds except if you see here we've got a
nice little LCD that's actually a square
LCD that's just made to look around for
those of you who have asked you've got a
ring here that turns that way and that
way on the back you've got a little
mounting shoe this essentially plugs
into the mounting bracket the mounting
bracket is where you plug all your wires
in my thermostat has four wires they're
clearly labeled i plugged them in and
everything was fine little mini USB port
right there not micro but mini very neat
the only you I or only buttons really on
this are of course your twist right and
left and then push to select other than
that that's it the interface is very
very smooth very slick once you have
those wires put in place and you can see
here it's complaining that I don't have
this installed on its base so I can't
use the thermostat but once I've done
that at that point then I have a very
nice display that has the temperature
not only what the current temperature is
but what I've set it to be whether
that's higher or lower and if it's
actively heating the display will be
kind of a bright reddish orange and if
it's cooling it'll be a nice cool blue
so you know when it's actually doing
something when your equipment is on
because you may not know if you're Peter
air conditioner
very quiet you just might not know now
inside this we have three different
thermometers essentially you know this
is a thermostat it's supposed to be very
accurate and if one of your thermometers
is off because it's got a breeze going
across it while you're heating your
cooling is going to be off and your
comfort level as well so this has three
separate independent thermometers in it
it's got a proximity sensor which isn't
working right now because it's not on
the base but it will light up when you
approach it if you want it to you can
tell it not to you can tell it that you
want it to turn on when you click down
on it like you just saw me do and then
of course it's got a net by the way that
proximity sensor works in about a
hundred and fifty degree angle so it can
sense quite a bit with that it knows
when you're home if there's no one
walking around this then it figures
after a while that well you're not there
and it will start shutting things into
what's called in a way mode temperatures
will get lower in the winter but not so
low that your pie it'll freeze it'll get
hotter in the summer but not so hot but
your pets and plants will die but it's
not going to try and conditioned space
for us when we're not there so really
kind of cool it also has a humidity
sensor in there which is very very neat
so that's cool just in and of itself
being able to utilize this but hey this
is pocketnow.com what does this have to
do with smartphones well not only is
there a website that you can talk to
this through Wi-Fi actually through a
website this connects to the internet
through Wi-Fi you talk to their website
but you can also do it from your iOS
device or your android-powered
smartphone so let's go take a look at
that so we've unboxed and we've
installed the Nest Learning Thermostat
we went through the process to hook it
up to the Wi-Fi and now you can see here
we are early in the morning quarter
seven and it's dark outside my lights
are on and it's 68 degrees now if I have
multiple thermostats I'd see multiple
thermostats across there I've only got
the one so let's take a look at it open
it right up you can see that my heat is
set to 68 degrees this is neither blue
nor orange so it's not heating or air
conditioning it's just kind of sitting
there if I want to raise the temperature
a couple degrees I can do that until
eventually
you know it picks on the the heater
which it takes about 30 seconds to do I
don't want that to go up so we're just
going to bump it back to 68 which is
where I like it there you go it kicked
the heater on to go ahead and heat the
house up now that's great this morning i
have this thing cranked all the way down
to 50 degrees it remembered that when i
get up in the morning I like it set to
68 so it bumped that up and I actually
have the house all nice and toasty by
about six o'clock this morning I didn't
have to set the temperature I didn't
have to wait for Twp it just learned it
knew what I wanted and it had the house
already warm for me when I woke up so
this is one view I would like to see a
multi-touch twist knob there's just
something about that they developed and
designed the actual thermostat with a
twist knob would be nice if they had
multi-touch to be able to adjust the
temperature rather than just up and down
but that's you I that might come it
might not and it's really not that much
of a big deal let's go back to the first
view if we rotate this on the side at
this point now we can get two more
thermostats like we had before we can
also get to settings and this is how I
set this up I hit settings down here and
i can i'll add a thermostat that's what
I had when when I didn't have a
thermostat set up here so now that I do
I can set my fan to auto or on okay go
back to settings I can rename it I named
it nest that was one of them that they
named if you've got a thermostat in your
hallway can name hallway upstairs you
can name it upstairs garage whatever you
want so it's really easy to tell them
apart and they talk to one another so
they work together temperature scale i
can set to fahrenheit or centigrade and
then technical information that's got
some mac addresses and whatnot that you
don't need to see on there so we're done
with that down here we've got heating
versus cooling and of course this is
January so we've got it set to heating
very very cool very nice does not have a
widget so you can't see just what the
temperature of your home is at a glance
you actually have to launch the app
which does take a little bit of time to
load and to communicate with our service
to get that information but overall very
cool now this is going to be the next
big thing not nest per se but automation
of your home automation of your
environment we've already kind of
automated our PIM our personal
information management like we talked
about in the intro this is the next big
thing there are going to be a lot of
companies trying to jump on this trying
to figure out how to do it nest is one
of those that's done it right next we
have electrical monitoring that still
doesn't have a really good solution
there's not good hardware and good
software their stuff out there it's just
not as elegant as nest is and then of
course eventually we're going to have
lighting control and whatnot that's all
nice and elegant now a lot of you are
saying hey that already exists there's
some security systems that do that yes
there are there are even some some
do-it-yourself stuff yes there are
they're just not elegant they're not
really consumer friendly with this net
nest thing can't even talk today Nest
Learning Thermostat I was able to unbox
it and get it installed I don't know 15
minutes at the absolute tops so very
easy very quick the solution is elegant
my four-year-old son knows how to use
this thing it's that intuitive and
that's really what it's all about so
keep an eye out for stuff like that if
you see it really elegant home
automation solutions that you'd like us
to cover or you'd like your other pocket
now readers to know about please leave
those down in the comments below of
course if you like seeing this kind of
control over your life give the video a
big thumbs up for pocket now i'm joe
