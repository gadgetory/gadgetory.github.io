pocketnow.com and this is a look at the
settings on the HTC Desire Android is a
great operating system for people that
like to tweak and change and customize
and the desire is no exception so let's
take a look at all the things that you
can change through the settings menu
so to unlock the screen I'm gonna zoom
in a little bit here ok let's go right
into settings we get these nice colored
icons which is new to the newer versions
of Android so let's go right into
personalize and from here we can change
the scenes for the HTC Sense home
screens with the different layout
configurations then we can go to a home
wallpaper and we get a variety of really
fantastic HTC wallpapers and I know the
cameras having trouble focusing there we
go and these these all look very very
good with the AMOLED screen the colors
are super vivid and the blacks are very
black very good contrast so they give
you a really fantastic selection and you
also get the live wallpapers which we
saw for the first time on the Google
Nexus One
so galaxy grass magic smoke these all
come from the Nexus One which also to
Android 2.1 but we get two new ones we
get HTC Sense which is kind of this
morphing of colors that you just saw and
also this one's pretty cool maps maps
live wallpapers so it'll show you
actually a satellite view or a map view
of your current location
I assume that this uses a lot of battery
so you probably don't want to use this
on a regular basis but it's pretty cool
so what I have enabled right now is the
Sense wallpaper you can see these kind
of colorful bubbles moving in the
background I think it's a nice touch
let's go back in wireless and networks
so from here we can change our our Wi-Fi
settings turn on bluetooth manage that
VPN kind of boring stuff there calls
also pretty boring we can manage voice
mail call barring and forwarding then if
we go into sound of display we see some
more interesting things we can change
the sound profile we can change the
media volume the ringer volume the phone
ringtone so
I'm going to move around there have some
fun okay
notification sound we can have the phone
vibrate for incoming calls we have a
cool feature here called quiet ring on
pickup this is actually on the HTC hd2
so if the phone is ringing and you pick
up your phone it will reduce the volume
when you do that because basically you
don't need the phone to keep ringing as
loudly as it is if you are already if
you already know that the phone is
ringing so we can scroll down audible
touch tones haptic feedback SD card
notifications we can tell the device if
we want it to change orientation in
certain screens with the accelerometer
let's look at brightness now with an
AMOLED screen you don't really need the
backlight in indoor situation so if we
slide it all the way down you can see
that you can still see things on the
screen if you did this with a
traditional LCD display that would not
be the case or you can maximize it if
it's really really bright outside and
you need the help of a backlight I leave
it on automatic you can also determine
screen animation so right now I have it
set on some animate some animations
obviously the more animations you have
the bigger the toll on battery life XI
sensor calibration you can also
determine when the LED flashes there's a
green LED that flashes when you have a
new call or a missed SMS or something
like that and things like that and you
can check off which ones you want them
to go on for very handy okay let's go
back accounts in sync this is where you
go to determine all the sync options so
right now I've got five different things
or six synchronizing exchange activesync
Facebook and so on and so forth and from
here you can determine when these things
sync and how often which is good to have
in one screen location you can check off
if you want it to use GPS satellites or
just use the wireless networks obviously
if you use GPS satellites you'll get a
little bit more precise in a map
application but it will use a lot more
battery life than the latter going down
we have search so we can change some
settings in the Google search search
history and web suggestions going down
some more we have some privacy options
use my location as
Duff this is cool automatically the
desire and the legend actually backup
your data to the SD card so if I were to
factory reset this device when I turn it
on it'll ask me do you want to restore
all of your information from the micro
SD card it will restore all of my
settings so I don't have to enter my
Wi-Fi passwords again any sort of HTC
Sense widget configurations very handy
feature ok go to applications we can
manage applications kind of comment for
for most Android devices SD in phone
storage so we can see how much space we
have available it comes with a four
gigabyte microSD card which is quite
handy date and time you can change the
format language and keyboard you can
change the language to five different
languages or technically four touch
input settings so you can determine if
you get the haptic feedback you can do a
tutorial ad to the user dictionaries so
in those names and things like that
accessibility I'm not going to go into
that text-to-speech is an application
you have to download and only certain
other applications can take advantage of
this like navigation programs it'll take
text and turn it into speech you can
hear a sample so not too bad sounds like
a robot but what do you expect and
finally at the bottom we have about
phone from here you can you know see
your network status see what is using
the battery which I love to see this is
a really fantastic addition to Android
so I know that Wi-Fi is using a lot of
my battery life and so is just the cell
standby pinning it being on I don't know
why they include that and from here you
can tap on these to action on certain
things you can turn on Wi-Fi turn it off
phone idle display it'll take you to the
brightness settings and you get the
point so that's a look at the settings
on the HTC Desire there's a lot you can
change about this phone they really give
you a lot of customized ability which is
great if you liked the video give it a
thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
