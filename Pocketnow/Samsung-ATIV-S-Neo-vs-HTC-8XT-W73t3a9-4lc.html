you're a Windows Phone fan on Sprint
chances are you're asking yourself the
question Samsung ativ s neo or HTC 8x t
that's the question of today's
comparison video so let's dive in and
find out which of these phones is the
right choice for you a Windows Phone as
a platform mandates a lot of
similarities across devices folks so
it's actually interesting to see how
different these two phones truly are not
just on the spec sheet but in fit and
feel and day to day usage we've already
reviewed the 8 X T and a review of the
ax T best neo is forthcoming so let's
take what we know so far and dive right
in right off the bat we're getting
totally different messages from the
hardware on each of these units the 8 xt
with it's rubberized paint job and
narrow edges it comes off as the faster
of the two designs it manages to be at
once slim soft and slightly sexy but
also somewhat toy-like in appearance
thanks to its lone color option of
California blue on the flip side the
achieve as neo is straight-up Samsung
glossy polycarbonate and chrome accents
with a very subtle pattern beneath the
battery covers hyper glaze coating but
otherwise precious little to set it
apart visually from other phones in
terms of dimensions HTC's phone is
lighter than Samsung's and while the
Samsung devices is actually almost a
millimeter thinner it feels thicker
thanks to the 8x T's tapered edges all
this works together to make the achieve
s neo feel like the beefier some might
say clunkier device a good thing Samsung
stuck with its guns and kept the power
standby button on the side but that
added bulk
comes with some advantages the Samsung
display gives the HTC screen the
business in a pretty serious way it's a
half an inch bigger at 4.8 inches but
the main advantage of the atif screen is
it's much higher resolution
it's 720p to the 8x ts WVGA so while
they're both LCD panels the achieves
added pixel density will make for a
sharper viewing experience to those of
you who get personal with your phone
screens for reading or Netflix hang or
youtubing or what have you
under the hood the ative s Neos
supremacy continues further solidifying
its place as the higher end of these two
units while these funds are fueled by
very similar variations of the same
processor the Samsung phone offers 16
gigs of on-board storage to the HTC
devices 8 gigs each one runs on a single
gig of ram and each one offers microSD
storage expansion but only the Samsung
device allows a user to swap the onboard
battery but which is also slightly
larger at 2,000 versus 1,800 milliamp
hours all this adds up to a pair of
Windows phones that should do the job
pretty well should we've talked before
about the 8 X T's stumbles in the
software Department lag and stutter
aren't normally seen in great abundance
on windows phones but even after asking
HTC to replace our demo unit our
software stumbles remained the 8 X T
just isn't a terribly responsive device
which is a shame the thing is neither is
the achieve s neo it doesn't have that
audio bug of the 8 X T that makes
streaming music sound like a scratchy
record but it's still more prone to
software hiccups than most other windows
phones we've handled sometimes the lock
screen won't recognize a swipe up and
other times it takes several seconds for
the phone to come out of sleep when the
lock button is pressed now is this like
a showstopper nope not for everyone but
this is the second Sprint Windows Phone
that's exhibited lower than average
responsiveness so we're wondering if
something within the carrier's bloatware
load is causing the problem speaking of
added software there's plenty of
customization on each of these phones
we've seen Sprint's load of additions
and the nice-looking HTC tile on the 8
XT that we really love that HTC app
which presents news weather stocks and
so forth in a very pretty fashion all
covered up with a tile that drives very
well with the Windows Phone design
language on the homescreen unfortunately
that's the only exciting thing about the
8 X t's custom software offering until
we get to the camera anyway because the
special HTC area of the Windows Store
only offers 6 titles 6 folks now on the
achieve s neo there's the familiar now
tile which like the HTC tile is quite
handy for news stocks and weather and
other tools once you're inside at
but it's a shame the company hasn't yet
cleaned up that live tile for news which
is still low res and just to get really
ugly
fortunately the company makes up for it
with a hugely expanded Samsung zone in
the Windows Store something we weren't
necessarily expecting and which we'll
get into in the full review but we've
got a lot of useful stuff here from the
long-sought app folder that lets you
categorize apps on your homescreen two
ports of popular Android titles like
paper artist and a tea beam along with a
really out of the blue avalanche of
camera add-ons Samsung deserves kudos
here for finally fleshing out its custom
app offerings for Windows Phone its no
nokia collection but staying within the
lines of the comparison Samsung
definitely has HTC beat here both of
these phones pack eight megapixel
shooters on their backside the new
standard for mid to high-end phones and
the results are fairly comparable the
8xt defaults to wide crops while Samsung
likes to stick with square but aside
from that there's a lot of similarity
here on the whole the neo delivers more
vibrant colors than the 8xt and the
Samsung phone also seems less prone to
distortion from handshake or a stumble
that advantage reverses a bit in the
video realm though where the Samsung
phones quality lags seriously behind HTC
s especially in sound performance
each device offers many in-camera
customizations atop the normal Windows
Phone experienced add-ons that slow the
software down somewhat but which also
lend needed flavor to Windows Phones to
Spartan viewfinder UI testing both
phones on Sprint's networks in the
Greater Boston area these phones
continued to shine in different areas
caller said they preferred our voice
quality on the ateva CEO finding us
sharper and clearer than on the 8x T and
that held true on our end as well
talking on the Samsung phone is more
enjoyable as you might imagine the story
completely flipped around though when it
came to the speakerphone performance
HTC's boomsound might be the most apt
brand name in history because the dual
front firing speakers on the 8x t
destroyed the achieve s Neos tiny rear
mounted unit in every category really
it's not even a contest the 8 xt also
offers a slight edge in terms of
reception at least in our area it's been
able to consistently hold on to both 3G
and 4G signals longer and reacquire them
faster after being out of service than
the Samsung device as far as endurance
goes will have more battery information
in our full review of the atif earlier
this year Sprint promised its users
fresh new windows phones then
technically we guess it's delivered but
it's definitely more accurate to say
that these devices are rehashes of
phones we've seen before now would we
spring for the extra 50 bucks for a
healthier app store better call quality
and display and a removable battery we'd
hate to lose boomsound but yeah we'd
probably go for the Samsung the real
shame here though is that either way we
went we wouldn't necessarily be all that
excited we congratulate Sprint on
finally rejoining the Microsoft party
but if you're looking for a truly
premium Windows Phone experience your
ideal phones still lie on other networks
that's gonna do it for this comparison
video folks but we're gonna steal a
trick from Jaime Rivera over at the
pocket now daily and ask you a question
to close out this video which of these
devices would you choose doesn't matter
what your reasoning is doesn't matter
your answer is even if it is neither of
them just leave it down below so we can
get the discussion going for all those
sprint customers looking for a Windows
Phone 8 device it has been a long enough
wait so let's give them something to
talk about especially if you're one of
them but before you go anywhere please
drop us a like if you enjoyed the video
follow us on social media so you don't
miss future content from pocket now with
the ax T s neo review up shortly please
stay tuned for that but thank you for
watching in the mean time and until next
time this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
