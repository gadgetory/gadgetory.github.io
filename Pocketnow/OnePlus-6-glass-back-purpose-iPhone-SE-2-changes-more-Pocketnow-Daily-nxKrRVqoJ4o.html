and it will have a glass back your risk
point to the iPhone se - getting slimmer
killing important features and adding
others and for those of you in the
United States that want to be 20 there
is still hope
I'm Jaime Rivera and definitely back in
the New York studio missing Rome but I'm
actually happy I'm not getting on a
plane for weeks this is part out daily
the official news today began again with
deals if you're in the market for a
smartphone the essential phone continues
to be the most beautifully built and
least expensive flagship out there with
a not so great camera of the gift that
keeps on giving
three hundred and fifty bucks at certain
reads elders right now and four hundred
bucks if you're looking for some of the
new color variants on Amazon you can
learn more about the deals in the
description now let's talk about Samsung
the company has been one of the pioneers
of VR in mobile definitely VR hasn't
necessarily taken off as many companies
one or two but I won't have to give
props to Samsung for continuing to bring
more content more cameras more gear VR
and as it turns out the company has just
launched their new pilot episode
campaign which brings pretty much
original series content in episodes that
you can consume on the gear VR I've
given it a try so far I will report back
soon on it as the experience is actually
really cool they did on the Tribeca Film
Festival now let's move the spotlight
over to Apple and the iPhone se 2 for
those of you wondering what to expect
from this phone well we've heard that
the headphone jack is going to die but
apparently the trade-off includes some
benefits first of all apparently the
phone will get slimmer the slice will be
the same but we are getting water
resistance so this might be a good
trade-off it's just sad whenever I'm
carrying headphones around and I forgot
a dongle it's God now let's talk about
Huawei and it's P 20 and P 20 Pro there
are a ton of things this phone can do
and I've posted a ton of what that
camera is capable of in my Instagram but
the problem is you can't buy it in North
America or at least not yet
may 17th will be the possible launch for
this phone in Canada still no dates for
the United States but hey we'll keep you
posted
and finally the hottest news today is
the oneplus 6 again don't blame me this
is going to be a hot phone this year
Peter Lau has now teased that we are
expecting a glass back with this phone
apparently the company is investing
heavily in it though even though it you
know oneplus doesn't really sell an
expensive phone it's going to invest in
five coats of nano coat
paint whereas usually the industry only
invests in three how is that going to
make the experience better or worse I
don't really know I mean in today's
question let us know do you think that
it's a good idea for the next one plus
six to brand glass back I mean the
biggest problem with glass backs is
they're gorgeous they feel great but
they don't last and for a phone that's
claims never settle
I performed aluminum but that was just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
