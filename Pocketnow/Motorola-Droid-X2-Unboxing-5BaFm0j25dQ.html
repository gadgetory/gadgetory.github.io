packing.com and a little less than a
year ago
Verizon released the Motorola Droid X
which was one of the largest display is
on any Android device available at the
time and today we have the Motorola
Droid X 2 which features a 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor and this is also the
first device to have a qHD display on
the Verizon network so let's get to the
unboxing
okay so we'll just rip up with this huge
FedEx box it's quite large for such a
small device and see here and then we've
got some papers and them of course
okay there's lots of papers in there
okay so here we have it inside the
bubble wrap so let's open up this bubble
wrap and get to the actual box of the
Droid X - wow that's a tiny little box
for such a you know a large devices
device does have a 4.3 inch screen so
let's see what we have on the box we
have CT I have certified Adobe Flash
let's see what else
includes the Droid X - a lithium-ion
battery wall USB charger Park safety and
warranty brochure and that's about it so
let's open up this box and Wow
so apparently the device takes up the
entire height of the box so we'll just
pull that out and it looks like the
exact same form factor of the Droid X
from last year so I will just set that
aside for just a second and we'll open
up the rest of this packaging so we have
a wall USB charger here so I would set
that over here we have our micro and USB
charging sync cable and the very little
documentation
Vennela says that it should come with an
8 gigabyte microSD card pre-installed
and the device does have 8 gigabytes of
internal memory already so we can expand
it up to 40 gigabytes let's zoom in a
tiny little bit they're too much okay
there we go so we'll just peel off this
plastic and here we have the device so
let's compare this to a couple of other
devices first off and we'll see how they
compare in size here we have a HD - I
have android running on this device so
same screen size a little bit higher in
in height than the HD - but about the
same width so a little actually a little
bit thinner than HD - we'll look at an
iPhone for real quick and you see here I
can maneuver it around okay so here we
have an H or an iPhone 4 and we can see
that it's about the much higher and with
in height than the iPhone 4 and a little
bit thicker than the iPhone 4 of course
this does have the 4.3 inch display so
from here we can also see that it's
about the same width without the 8
megapixel camera up at the top so let's
power on this device and we'll take a
look at the screen and stuff ok so I
guess it should be mentioned that we
have to remove the battery cover first
which is made out of metal and the
entire device feels like it's made out
of metal similar to the Droid X of
yesteryear so we have a battery release
right here which I'll turn on the
batteries to keep it from connecting
with the contacts wall into transport so
when we see what size battery this is
let's see oh so apparently that's not
something that you remove that's just to
get the battery out which is kind of
weird announcing that before so I guess
the contacts do touch while in transport
and we have a fifteen hundred and forty
milliamp hour battery so 1500 / 1540
milliamp hour battery and we have our
eight gigabyte microSD card right here
and it is a class four so that's a
pretty good micro SD card not the best
but it is expandable up to 40 gigabytes
so let's just pop this back in and put
the battery cover back on and we'll turn
on the device okay so here we are on the
first screen of the Droid X - and the
device the screen is really clear Wow
it it is comparable to the iPhone fours
Retina display so it's a very clear
display it will be interesting to see
how this works with video and the drawer
next to is running Android 2.2 and
hopefully it is upgraded to Android 2.3
Gingerbread in the near future
so stay tuned for the hardware and
software core is coming up next and if
you like our videos make sure you tips
of thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below and thanks for
watching
