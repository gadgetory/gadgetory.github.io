different script in mind for this
unboxing something which had to do with
engines and cars but then again instead
of this we got this never was I still
unprepared for an unboxing and never was
a box so hard to open than it is today
and of course we never got a phone for
review in a crate let's crack this open
literally disclaimer we started this
unboxing by daylight and we wrapped it
up under warm incandescent sand
moonlight but there's an important
lesson to be learned here for a reviewer
thanks LG for teaching us that no matter
what device you were expecting you have
to have a hammer screwdriver lever
wrench or maybe even a hammer drill
handy if not a few bars of dynamite
well after ruining all the tools we were
willing to sacrifice for this unboxing
one too many in particular we've decided
that maybe it's a better idea to take it
to the handyman maybe another disclaimer
we have never never left the office for
an unboxing box inside a box and we
finally get to the box we were expecting
to see in the first place
no you won't go through the entire
process once you purchase this device
and since this unit is the South Korean
/ international unit chances are that
your US carrier device will come in a
different packaging if the network
operator has any say in it and it
usually does but the box contents should
more or less be the same if the LG g4
the V tens flagship predecessor was all
about the looks on the outside the v10
focuses on more durability with a
stainless steel frame and a damage
resistant silicone back it's not an
upgrade but a different approach the
upgrades are on the inside where
processor memory main camera and battery
aside the v10 takes everything to a new
level the box is different from the
g-force box as well opens up like a book
to reveal the phone on the right with
some literature underneath which you
will probably not read but you should
and on the left in a completely
different compartment the USB cable wall
charger and the LG quad beat three
headphones with a specific call out that
claims these were tuned by AKG the
battery is included as well and it is
one of 2900 milliamp hours but depending
on your model it could be a 3000
milliamp hour unit as well
but let's look at the phone sitting next
to the LG G flex 2 on the left and the
LG g4 on the right you can easily spot
the v10
it's the biggest among goal and it's the
only one without a curved screen it is
however surprisingly thin and light for
its dimensions underneath the battery
cover you'll find the nano SIM card slot
and microSD expansion should you want to
augment the 64 gigs of internal storage
with an extra up to 2 terabytes and the
place for the battery which we pop into
fire the phone up not before peeling off
the screen protector the display is a
huge 5.7 inch IPS LCD unit that's bigger
than the iPhone 6s plus and on par with
the note 5 protected by Gorilla Glass 4
it's a quad HD unit with a 1440 by 2560
resolution and 513 PPI with a secondary
display which is part of the main
display making it a 5.9 inch unit at the
top next to the two cameras with a
resolution of 160 by 1040 at 2.4 inches
more on that later as well as in our
full review since we mentioned the front
cameras for the first time we're seeing
not one but two units for wide-angle
shots both units being 5 megapixel
systems while the main shooter on the
back is the excellent 16 megapixel
system with optical image stabilization
aperture F 1.8 and laser out of focus
from the LG g4 and since we're on the
back we find the usual button placement
for volume control and power key which
on the v10 doubles as a fingerprint
scanner and a rather accurate one we
might add the specs rundown goes like
this 6 core Snapdragon 808 processor 4
gigs of ram 64 gigs of expandable
storage dual 5 megapixel front facing
cameras
the megapixel optical image stabilized
laser autofocus main camera twenty nine
hundred million power battery or maybe
in your case three thousand milliamp
hour battery android 5.1.1 lollipop with
a marshmallow update coming late 2015 or
early next year and the usual suspect
special cutouts for the hi-fi DAC
capability for audio files and infrared
for remote control capabilities while we
boot up we'll mention that this film
does indeed feel as durable in hand as
it reads on paper with the stainless
steel case on the sides and rubbery anti
slip and shock absorbent back we'll have
to test it out maybe even accidentally
drop it as far as that secondary display
is concerned there's a lot of potential
but placing it at the top sure feels
awkward in the beginning
we'll see how we'll get used to using it
will always stay on to display time date
weather notifications and when the phone
is in use you can customize your
shortcuts or other actions we'll take a
closer look at that fancy display
performance and other aspects of the
phone so far it looks like the v10 is a
full flagship from LG that might be on
your holiday shopping shortlist to find
out for sure keep your eyes on pocket
now for the full review coming soon
we've a lot more going on with the Nexus
6p 5x and Xperia z5 compact reviews HTC
One a9 coverage and more make sure to
follow PocketNow social media and follow
me on Facebook Twitter or Google Plus
this has been anton denied thanks for
watching and we'll see you soon
and since we're unboxing the v10 car
jokes are inevitable I prefer the flat
six well here for yourself
there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
