year old compete with Nokia's most
recent flagship I'm Taylor Martin this
is pocket now and this is the Lumia icon
versus a samsung galaxy s4 Samsung's
flagship sfrom the last few years have
all been well rounded and appeal to a
broad spectrum of users nokia is
renowned for the quality of its handsets
solid design build quality and great
image sensors Samsung is the
front-runner in the Android space and
Nokia is keeping Windows Phone afloat
almost single-handed so taking one of
the best android phones of 2013 and
comparing it to the latest top-tier
phone from the leading windows phone
maker how do the two phones compare
let's take a look in this Lumia icon and
galaxy s4 comparison to get it out of
the way from the very beginning the
Lumia icon has a clear yet very slight
advantage and hardware the galaxy s4
unit we're dealing with is a CDMA model
on verizon so it ships with the
snapdragon 600 chipset made of a 1.9
gigahertz quad-core krait 300 cpu and
adreno 320 GPU but it also comes in an
Exynos 5 octa version overseas and a
snapdragon 800 model and select regions
it has a 13-megapixel camera ships with
16 gigabytes of thick storage and a 2600
milliamp hour battery the Lumia icon
ships with a snapdragon 800 composed of
a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core krait 400 CPU
in Adreno 330 GPU it has doubled the
inbuilt storage at 32 gigabytes but no
microsd card slot a 20 megapixel camera
and a 24 20 milliamp hour battery both
phones have two gigabytes of ram Wi-Fi
AC NFC and wireless charging if you
count an official aftermarket back cover
from Samsung both also have 5-inch 1080p
AMOLED displays both panels offer the
same side visibility very inky blacks
high contrast and high saturation one is
just as sharp as the other though the
Lumia icons display does appear to be a
tad warmer than the s4's frankly however
we'd rate them equally and about those
casings there stark contrasts from one
another in almost every way Samsung's go
with the galaxy s4 was extreme
portability and thus the s4 is ultra
lightweight and has this little wasted
space as physically possible it measures
just 136 point 7 millimeters tall 69.6
millimeters wide
and seven point nine millimeters thick
the icon certainly isn't much larger but
it sure feels like it it's only 0.3
millimeters taller and 0.4 millimeters
wider but it is one point nine
millimeter sticker and the galaxy s4
weighs just 130 point 1 grams the lumia
icon is a full thirty six point nine
grams heftier and there's no forgetting
it's in your pocket whereas the s4 is
barely there but there are appearances
especially or where the biggest
difference is reside the galaxy s4 is
curvy with wide radius corners and
flowing lines this adds to the illusion
that the s4 is much smaller when it
actually isn't it's also made out of
slimy super slick materials mostly
classic with faux metal trim around the
edges any fake texture too hyper glazed
finish round back the Lumia icon on the
other hand isn't made of any facade
materials the trim is metal and the
matte finished polycarbonate around back
feels far more high-end and it also
helps with grip the design is industrial
and boxy while some may call that boring
uninspired or understated we feel it's a
much more beautiful device that feels
far more substantial and sturdy in the
hand based on appearances and touch
alone it feels more worth premium
pricing than it's all plastic fo
the software situation is a different
story it's much more back and forth the
galaxy s4 and Verizon is currently
running Android version 4 3 it received
its most recent update back in December
2013 but the KitKat update began rolling
out to the US cellular model yesterday
and it will likely soon follow for other
US carrier models other versions of the
galaxy s4 received cake at long ago such
as the google play edition though it
doesn't feature TouchWiz and instead
comes with a bone stock version of
Android the icon ships were the most
recent version of Windows Phone 8 out of
the box update 3 with the Nokia Lumia
black update which brings a host of
features on its own like raw image
capture support Samsung's and Nokia's
ideas of value adding features are
largely different however TouchWiz comes
packed to the brim with dozens of
features many of which few will ever use
smart stay smart scroll smart rotate air
gesture and many many more it comes with
tons of pre-loaded apps and very useful
multitasking software in the form of
multi window none of this can be removed
by default it's baked in an
uninstallation is disabled the Lumia
icon comes with all of Nokia's
applications built in nokia camera care
cinemagraph creative studio mix radio
storyteller here an app folder if at any
time you don't want any of this it can
be removed quite easily the other
difference here is outside the OEMs
control ecosystem the Android ecosystem
is infinitely vast with hundreds of
thousands more titles games and other
helpful apps the Windows Phone store is
improving as we've seen more major
third-party developers jump on board but
it's still quite visibly in its infancy
Android by nature is also much more
accessible if you don't like the stock
browser download another switching on
Wi-Fi and toggling various settings is
quicker and more simple on Android it's
simply a more developed immature
operating system in that same vein
Windows Phone has the tendency to
operate more smoothly than Android on
various levels especially if we're
comparing Windows Phone 8 to jellybean
KitKat brings a far more pleasing
Android experience and our galaxy s4
does not officially support the latest
version of Android just yet being filled
to the top of the features we rarely
ever need or want doesn't help matters
either the snapdragon 800 paired with
Windows Phone provides one of the
smoothest mobile OS experiences we've
ever encountered
it is the epitome of polish meanwhile
the galaxy s4 isn't the worst experience
ever it manages to hold its own in many
situations but it's not immune to
stutters and lag our time with the
Google Play edition galaxy s4 was far
more memorable at least in terms of
performance but this current model with
this version of software is a far cry
from Android at its finest and
benchmarks like the SunSpider JavaScript
test you'll see the Lumia icon finish
about twice as fast you'll see more
checker boarding in the browser on busy
web pages and you simply won't see the
icon slow down no matter what you throw
at it the s4 will sometimes begin to get
sluggish through some heavier usage we
still haven't quite used the icon long
enough to have a great estimate of its
stamina but the galaxy s4 has been
extensively tested through and through
on great days it should have no problem
lasting an entire day on a single charge
though you'll likely need to plug it in
later in the evening the Lumia icon has
a slightly smaller battery capacity
faster and more powerful chipset but for
all intents and purposes the same
display so far we haven't had to plug it
in to last through an entire day even
through heavy testing data speeds and
network performance have been much more
impressive on the icon side by side the
icon consistently pulls faster data
speeds and appears to have a stronger
connection its average downlink and
uplink respectively were 13.4 megabits
per second and 10.6 megabits per second
the s4 on the other hand averaged 3.6
megabits per second down and 6.1
megabits per second up in the same areas
on the same servers the galaxy s4 camera
is no match for the icons image sensing
capabilities the 13 megapixel shooter on
the back of the s4 isn't bad though in
fact it's a pretty decent shooter in its
own right it can take pictures with a
fair amount of detail but unlike the
icons 20 megapixel camera it's not
optically stabilized Samsung tries to
boost its low light performance with
software stabilization and it simply
doesn't compare the icons low-light
performance on the other hand is
stunning or phone but it's even more
balanced in great shooting conditions
and while most of the pictures you take
and share with the icon will only be
five megapixels they will be clearer and
more sharp than the s4 s default 9
megapixel images for one reason the 16
megapixel pictures taken with the icon
or oversampled down into five megapixel
images the 9 megapixel images from the
s4 aren't oversampled and
all and instead they're cropped from 13
megapixels this is immediately
noticeable and viewfinder by the much
more narrow field of view hands down if
you're after superior image sensing the
icon is your best bet out of these two
so has Samsung smartphone held up
against the test of time or is it no
match for the Lumia icon if you want a
super camera experience the Lumia icon
is the clear choice OAS and higher res
sensor paired with the nokia camera app
make the icon a very tough image sensing
competitor and its build quality and
design are certainly more alluring than
the cheap plastic ridden s4 but if
you're after a more complete experience
with a lot more flexibility and the
ability to do with your phone as you
please the galaxy s4 makes a compelling
argument for it so overall it's a more
well-rounded experience with a lot more
content and over ten times the
application offering if you can deal
with the growing pains of Windows Phone
we recommend giving the icon a try as
it's one of the most impressive displays
of Windows Phone we've seen to date
otherwise the galaxy s4 is a nice
obligatory recommendation oh that's
