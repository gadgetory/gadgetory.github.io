right in the home button how does it
work I have no idea hey guys it's
Brandon minimun from Pocket now in this
video we're going to go through touch ID
for the very first time and show you how
it works on the iPhone 5s let's get to
it
now I am NOT one to use a password on my
phone but I know that a lot of you do
and it can really slow you down when
you're trying to access your phone it's
great for security but terrible for
convenience so having a fingerprint
sensor right in the home button really
can save you a lot of time also it's
maddening to constantly have to type
your itunes password when you're
downloading apps because itunes requires
you to have a pretty complex password
with some numbers and a capital letter
so that can slow you down too with touch
ID hopefully that will be a thing of the
past so the way it works is as follows
we're going to go over into general in
the settings and then we're going to go
down to passcode and fingerprint and I'm
kind of going through this for this for
the first time with you so I'm going to
turn passcode on so you need a standard
passcode in order for the fingerprint
mechanism to work now that that works
I'm going to go down to fingerprints add
a fingerprint so your wife your beers
your brother or whatever anyone else
that you want to have access to phone
you can add multiple fingerprints set up
fingerprints scan the finger or thumb
you normally use on the home button
alright what do you mean by scan place
your finger lift and rest your finger on
the home button repeatedly that's fun
really fun actually
it's probably the most fun thing ever
adjust your grip keep going to capture
the edges of your print okay I hope this
isn't my actual fingerprint because that
would be pretty bad for you no security
no I think this is just a standard image
success touch ID is ready that was
pretty easy you can your print can be
used for unlocking your phone all right
prove it continue okay so here is
passcode unlock turned on for the home
screen and iTunes an app store and
there's that annoying thing again you
got to put in your password now let's
see how it works the phone is off I was
hoping you could just take your thumb
and
press it up against the touch sensor and
have it work but you actually have to
press it in first and then tap and hold
and then you're in works very very
quickly that is really impressive now do
that again I really didn't have to
position my finger in any kind of
orientation so if I tap it again tap and
hold boom we're in that's really really
fast and really nice so hopefully they
make this available to third-party
developers so that all passwords
throughout your system are linked to
your fingerprint so you don't have to
type passwords again that would be super
awesome so that was a quick look at
touch ID if you have any questions about
how it works
drop us a comment and let us know and
that's it for this video thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
