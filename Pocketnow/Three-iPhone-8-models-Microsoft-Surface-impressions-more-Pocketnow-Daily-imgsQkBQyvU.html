expect more than two devices Microsoft
just took the stage the surprises with a
new approach to hardware and google says
that it's working on fixing the halo
effect on its pixels I'm high metal
iveta and could it be that this is the
first time that I'm actually crazy about
a desktop that I probably will not be
able to just buy this is parking out
daily the official news today have to do
with the shell me me mix I hate the name
so we've got to love the phone a lot of
people are saying that Xiaomi is
innovating with a design that's rumored
for the iphone 8 I think we're too far
to even assume that that's going to be
the design but wow this phone is
gorgeous it's everything we want an
android phone that's simply not going to
be launched in the united states and for
those of you that are wondering if it
ever will according to sources from
xiaomi in a recent interview on reddit
it won't because apparently it's not
convenient or apparently there's no
market that was a weird argument but
anyways that's the thing and for those
of you that are wondering who the king
of the SmartWatch market is apple
continues to be that company with
forty-three percent of the market but
the second place in the SmartWatch realm
is not for Android we're not for Samsung
Tizen watches no believe it or not it's
garmin and garmin only makes one smart
watch that i actually like the rest of
them are I don't know but anyways it
seems that that is the case right now
smart watch makers really need to step
up their game I'll talk about Google two
things about the pixel number one the
company acknowledges that it was in
planning so much overwhelming demand of
the pixel we've heard this before by the
way with Nexus devices but anyway there
is so much overwhelming demand that the
company's having delays but the second
is that for those of you that are having
lens flare issues with your photos yeah
google is saying that it's working on it
hopefully that doesn't involve some sort
of a recall as will the spotlight over
to Apple for those of you that are
wondering what the iphone 8 will look
like and we talked about it
beginning well the design is really not
the thing but apparently we are getting
three iphones this year according to
some very trusted sources and it makes
all the sense of the world if you think
of it the iphone SE at some point we'll
need a refresh and it would just be
awesome if Apple would launch an iphone
SE like design meaning sighs that's
comparable to whatever iphone 8 is going
to look like and just make a full revamp
across the line up but we'll see if
that's ends up happening I am and
finally the very hot news is they have
to do with Microsoft I just arrived back
from their event there is a lot of cool
being shown here yeah we saw a new
surface book at least some updates to
the i7 we're not getting a new surface
pro 4 we saw more about what to expect
for Windows 10 creative addition we saw
paint 3d etc but the coolest thing here
were two things believe it or not yes
the surface to do is awesome it's
gorgeous but to be honest with you what
I'm most excited about from this event
is that surface dial that simple concept
that you have something that's not a
mouse it's not a pennant but it's not a
trackpad it's just something completely
unique to help you take more advantage
of what you can do with a touchscreen I
found that to be the most awesome thing
announced today and specially for its
price tag but it leads me to the
question of the day are you excited for
anything those announced today from
Microsoft or are you waiting to see what
apple announces tomorrow yeah I'm
waiting to see what apple announces
tomorrow but I don't think they're gonna
come up with a dial leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
