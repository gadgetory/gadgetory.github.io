and 950 XL for those wishing powerful
specs the company shows us who will get
hollow lens early next year and boy has
microsoft shocked everyone with the new
surface announcements I'm Hyneman Rivera
and let's try to condense Microsoft's
event in just a few minutes this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Microsoft's hollow lens
those of you that were stoked about this
product and augmented reality well the
company is already preparing developer
kits that will be available in q1 2016
we got a full demo with the event and
the price tag is going to be three
thousand dollars but bear in mind that's
for the deck kits we're not really sure
consumer kids are going to be either
more expensive or less and for those of
you that joined us in claiming that the
Microsoft band was the most horrible
wearable last year well the company got
the memo they just announced the new
Microsoft band that looks completely
different they don't want to call it a
SmartWatch but it pretty much is it
brings GPS functionality for example
something that only the Sony SmartWatch
3 includes and then no Android wear or
Apple watch includes this and you
obviously have the typical other sensors
for you to be able to track your fitness
activity in addition to use this as a
notification straight so it's a cool
concept that costs 250 dollars and could
be for some people out there will
definitely want to give it a try now
some of the hottest news today I have to
do with the new Lumias there's a Lumia
550 for 139 bucks that's okay but the
Lumia 950 950 XL our hottest tickets
these are extremely powerful smartphones
with a liquid cooling systems hey we've
got a Snapdragon 808 Snapdragon 810
processor here in addition to three gigs
of RAM we've got all the bells and
whistles of quad HD displays we've got
everything you could think of form a
powerful black ship smartphone which is
great news from Microsoft and the price
tags are rather compelling as well the
Lumia 950 XL for example retails for 650
bucks so let's just wait till we get
them which apparently will happen in
November now if you're wondering exactly
why these Lumias are so powerful it has
to do with Microsoft continuum be
does Microsoft's Windows 10 applications
can now work between the pc and the
phone that actually doesn't necessarily
mean that you're just getting the same
application on both it actually means
that if you can connect your smartphone
to a desktop monitor and the keyboard
you can actually turn it into a computer
you get a full fledged version of office
or whatever other Microsoft extended
applications are out there this is a
really cool feature that we finally got
a demo up today and we can't wait to
test that whatever it becomes official
and finally the hottest news of the day
believe it or not were the new surface
tablets yes there is a surface pro 4 and
a surface book and even though the
surface book was initially shown off as
a laptop you can actually detach it and
make it a full tablet and you can do
obviously the same with the surface pro
4 these are extremely powerful computers
they have all the nine yards and they
were show not being compared to the
surface pro 3 which was already powerful
it was thirty percent faster then they
were compared with a macbook pro and
macbook air they were fifty percent
faster than these products obviously we
will have to test these products for
review and there is a full list of
specifications in the lakes of the
description but it does need me to the
question of the day what was the hottest
announcement for you today which
products got you most excited in my case
I'll be honest with you it was that
surface book I don't know if I could
ever move away from OS 10 because I'm
already used to it but that's product
the low is just so cool i really want to
give it a try but leave us a comment
