generation of its hero mid-range lineup
a device that shows a lot of the global
strategy Nokia's planning which we're
glad now includes the United States even
more reporting from New York City I'm
Jaime metal-y went on with pocket now
and let's go hands-on you know I just
can't deny how impressed I am with a new
Nokia now under the helm of HMD this is
barely the second year the company has
changed its strategy and it's already
reached the global top 10 and is top 5
and a crazy 25 markets the company has
three key pillars to define its product
strategy focused mainly on design
performance and the best of google the
nokia 7.1 which you could also call the
new nokia 7 is a clear example of all of
this this is actually designed to be a
compact phone that's easy to handle
we've got a beautiful glass in the front
and the back with 2.5 D curved edges for
better feel it's matched by one piece of
aluminum with a diecast metal core
internally to enhance durability the CNC
machine champers provide two colors that
serve the purpose of making it seem like
jewelry and which varied depending on
the gloss midnight blue or gloss steel
option that you pick there's a five
point eight four inch full HD plus LCD
at nineteen by nine aspect ratio that
looks pretty sharp nokia dubs at its
pure display which is not just capable
of HDR 10 but can actually convert
anything into HDR meaning even games can
take benefit of this sucked inside we
have the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 6-3 6
processor options for 3 or 4 gigs of ram
depending on the choice of either 32 or
64 gigs of storage respectively and with
support for micro is the expansion up to
400 gigs
there's a 30 60 million Bauer battery
with quick charge through USB C and the
company uses special tuning on the
display to adapt to your environment in
a way that takes the interns further
aside from all the power efficiency that
the 636 already provides
to match the looks we have pure Android
one running the show this means stock
Android experiences all around with a
very fluid operation regardless of the
task the device will ship with Android
or EO out of the box but upgrades for
Android pi are slated already for the
end of next month now one of the coolest
things about this phone is the camera
package mainly because it's really hard
to find all this combo in one premium
mid range er we start with the fact that
we have Zeiss optics one sensor being of
12 megapixels @f 1.8 aperture and 1.2 8
microns with a secondary camera of 5
megapixels providing depth information
the selfie cameras have 8 megapixels
that have 2 aperture as well and then
there are some neat tricks that are rare
to find the mid-range errs like for
example the fact that we've got dual
phase autofocus HDR photography a
feature called life bokeh which has a
slider to tone the amount of blur while
taking a shot and there's even selfie
bokeh through AI there are even manual
photo controls tucked inside the
settings which again are hard to find at
a mid-range err and probably one of the
coolest things was the dual sight
feature which pretty much means a both e
mode meaning you can share a story from
both cameras at the same time and the
phone even offers an option for you to
frame one angle larger than the other
instead of the standard 50/50 if there's
one thing that you want to highlight
more than the other so yes this is the
new Nokia 7.13 orders begin on October
5th on Amazon Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H at a
starting price of just 349 bucks and I'm
talking about the 4 gig 64 gig variant
with dual-sim capabilities as well and
then it reaches stores on Best Buy on
November 4th I have to admit that I
really like the package for the price
and mainly with this gloss steel variant
which I find very unique so far let us
