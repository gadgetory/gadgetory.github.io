pocket now Tony behind the camera here
at mwc checking out the Nokia Lumia 520
just announced today a new lower end
phone on the Lumia lineup let's have a
look and so on the hardware side here
you can notice that the 520 has a rather
distinct pillowy shape it looks like
they've almost brought the Nokia smile
aesthetic just to the side they made it
a kind of longitudinal almost way of
course you can see it in the in the
classic view there as well this one
happens to be black but these are
removable covers and they do come into
various colors we've become accustomed
to their cameras a 5 megapixel shooter
with no flash there is memory expansion
available the onboard storage i believe
is eight gigs of onboard but it's
expandable up to 64 gigs via microsd
this display is a 4 inch panel as
opposed to the 4.3 inch panel on the 720
we just have had a look at and of course
we're running Windows Phone 8 underneath
all that but obviously intended for the
for the low to mid tier but Nokia is
calling the the 520 their most
affordable Lumia device ever i think is
going to launch for around and 139 is
your own throats in a new role without
subsidies and prices 139 euro without
subsidies and taxes and this is rolling
out through q1 q2 starting in q1 okay
and it'll be it'll come to many
countries around the world so just a
quick look the Nokia Lumia 520 I'm
Michael Fisher with pocket now stay
tuned for a whole lot more
