pocket now calm and this is a hardware
tour of the palm pre plus on AT&amp;amp;T let's
take a look so the more I used the palm
pre plus is my daily driver the more I
dislike it and I'm actually surprised
hear myself say that because I've been
looking forward to this device for a
very long time but there are just a lot
of problems with the phone that are
really starting to bug me but first
let's talk about the hardware on the
device this is the palm pre plus on ATT
this is the palm pre plus on verizon
they are completely the same there is no
difference until you take off the back
battery cover so let's do that and the
only difference of course is that the
AT&amp;amp;T version has a sim card slot whereas
the CD cdma verizon version does not
they both have the touchstone backing
and of course the AT&amp;amp;T version comes
with a touchstone charger for free but
that's pretty much it everything else is
exactly the same so put these back on so
before I get specific about the hardware
on the palm pre plus I have to say that
the phone feels and looks dated even
though it's only a year old the original
pre came out on sprint about June of
2009 it just it feels very thick in hand
when compared to say the iphone or the
hd2 or the google nexus one it's just a
very thick device even though it has a
slideout keyboard it's just very large
in hand and it's kind of large in the
pocket as well so let's take a tour
around the device ok here at the top we
have the speaker and the hole in front
entire front of the device is completely
flat they got rid of that button that
they did have on the original palm pre
which means that this is a capacitive
button and there's also an indicator
light over here that shines when you
have a new email although you can turn
that off while this flush pneus is kind
of cool looking it just it makes the
device feel numb like there's no tactile
sensation in fact you slide open the
keyboard I've always found this very
difficult because there's nowhere to
hold on to so you have to put your
finger on the screen I'm always afraid
I'm going to do a Miss press or I'm
going to put my finger on this button
here afraid that I'm going to hit the
home
but there's just no easy way nothing to
grab on to to slide out the keyboard
okay so let's continue around the device
on the left side here we have the volume
up and down rocker and on the bottom
there is nothing except the button to
press to pop out the the back battery
cover here on this side we have this
really flimsy door for the charger and
on the verizon version this door is
permanently damaged it just never closes
and I can see that the AT&amp;amp;T version is
starting to exhibit that and it's only
been a couple of days so palm hasn't
figured this out yet how to fix that
here in the upper right corner kind of a
weird and awkward place is the standby
button there's the silent button here
and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack now
let's talk about this keyboard I cannot
get used to this keyboard I like the
keyboard very very much on the palm pixi
I think it's one of the best keyboards I
really really like the keyboard on the
HTC touch pro2 it's also one of the best
keyboards even going back to an old
device like the samsung propel pro it
gives you enough space there's enough
clearance to be able to type on all of
the buttons and you don't feel like you
have to use your fingernails when typing
on the keyboard that is not the case
with the palm pre and maybe pre owners
that have had the device for a very long
time will disagree with me but in my
first couple days of using this I just
can't get used to this keyboard my
fingers are relatively small and I'm
having a very tough time being able to
type quickly because it feels like these
keys are way too small they do have a
little bit of depth to them but it just
feels not so good down here is the
microphone and that's pretty much it in
terms of hardware on the back we have a
3 megapixel camera with a flash pretty
good camera on this I must say and here
is the speaker which distorts that kind
of high volume but it performs better
than say the nexus one or even the
iphone it's a little bit louder which is
nice to see and then we get this palm
logo on the back and here it says AT&amp;amp;T
on the verizon version guess what says
verizon so that was a look at the
hardware on the palm pre plus on ATT
we're going to talk a lot more about the
software experience on this device
