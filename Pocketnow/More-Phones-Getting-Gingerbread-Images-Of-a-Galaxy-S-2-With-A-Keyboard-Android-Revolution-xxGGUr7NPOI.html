finally getting gingerbread love this
week images of a samsung galaxy s2 with
a slide-out keyboard on AT&amp;amp;T draw
excitement and what android smartphones
will disappoint with the leis and being
released all the sim more coming up
right now
hell over when I'm high memory that I
with parking now calm and welcome to our
first-ever Android revolution the show
we tell you what's hot and what's not
inside the world of Google's Android
project as always let's start this week
off with what's hot Android is all about
smartphone releases so it's only fair
that we cover as many as we can here as
of this week the sprint motorola photon
4g is available online just before it's
sold in stores for the typical price
with a two-year contract and if you're
interested in a droid 3 from verizon but
wanted with some GSM flavor to work on
your AT&amp;amp;T network and don't mind sparing
the 600 bucks to get it unlocked negri
electronics has it on sale so head on
over if you're interested so which
phones are finally getting gingerbread
as of this week well the aging sony
ericsson xperia x10 is finally getting
it motorola droids x 2 t mobile's g2 and
the d2x with some fixes on resetting
issues as expected that also includes
some love for the UK version of the HTC
Desire Z which is pretty much the same
phone even the old HTC Desire is
included on the list but it seems that
HTC recommends that it only experts do
the update and we're still not sure why
on the side of updates and fixes
Sprint's nexus s 4g just got an update
which fixes issues with 4g and the
built-in NFC transceiver so you might
want to have a look at it and well tell
us about the updates if everything went
well out of the phones that we're
currently reviewing and you should look
out for we have Adam lands videos on
t-mobile mytouch 4g slide which offers
average build quality and doesn't seem
to be that good on video recording then
Webster is also doing us the honors of
reviewing the HTC EVO 3d which so far is
doing a great job by our standards but
sadly stay tuned for what's not hot
section to learn of some issues that the
evil 3d is currently having the web
version of the android market just got a
need update that will let you know how
many times an app has been installed it
works on all apps that have been
downloaded more than a thousand times
and it gives you a good idea of whether
people are compelled to buy an
application hopefully this will help
many of us make up our minds on buying
or not buying you might also want to hit
up on the update of the Amazon App Store
which is currently on version 1.1 5
which also includes improved search
initiation better app compatibility
check and also improve customer feed
back all good updates on applications
that you might want to download as of
now and well ever since Google decided
to ditch Yelp information on their map
services they just released version 5.8
of their Google Maps application
allowing you to upload photos of places
you visit within the application if you
check in on any location and find that
it's missing information on the app it
will create information for you and
allow you to feed it with information
and imagery call this crowd sourcing on
steroids so get your update and help
Google out I mean it seems they need
help on the rumors side call these more
confirmed rumors than rumors verizon
seems to be the first carrier to bring
the galaxy s2 according to Samsung it
will be released as early as August
twelfth and we imagine the price tag and
specs will be the usual suspects other
rumors have it that Sprint is bringing a
galaxy s2 variant with built-in wimax
and even the option of getting it in
white what's really got many of us
cooking is seeing galaxy s2 images of a
varian with a TNT branding porting a
slide-out keyboard no word or details
just yet but what's great is that we'll
probably get it and you know that we
also probably will get a normal version
of the galaxy s2 that's also being
rumored oh and by the way that option
for getting that galaxy s2 and white is
pretty much confirmed for the UK as of
mid August and also if you're interested
in Sprint's future roadmap leaks have
the LG optimus black and the sampson and
99 m 9 30 sorry being released on
october second so those are pretty late
probably you'd want to get some galaxy s
tues instead of waiting for those ok so
that does it for what's hot let's start
with what's not so some of us were
waiting for the LG thrill 4g to make it
to ATT soon but reports have it that
it'll be delayed and we still don't know
why no explanations and no possible
release dates aside from that well those
of us who've been waiting for the Droid
Bionic to make some verizon appearance
this fourth of august might be
disappointed because some motorola XX
are saying that no it won't be released
until early September with no particular
reasons
more specific release dates so sadly
that's it for the delays and nothing we
can do about them just yet speaking of
the evo 3d vodafone UK has just such
plans on releasing the phone because of
apparent delays on its release or
manufacturing not sure how this could
ever happen to champ HTC or why it is
but sadly those of you who were waiting
for it to make it to vodafone in the UK
or to get it somewhere else well sadly
you're just going to have to wait or get
it somewhere else sad news and while
virgin mobile just barely got their
hands on androids motorola triumph
rocking last year's Froyo and customers
are already complaining about having
issues with blinking pixels on the
screen the phone is freezing at times
and even auto focus options are not
working properly sure will you get what
you paid for for 300 bucks free off a
contract because you're getting a
prepaid but still you should at least
get what you're paying for and well not
really sure what Motorola is going to do
about it because virgin mobile hasn't
really said anything about it just yet
sad news that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high Meadow we better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
