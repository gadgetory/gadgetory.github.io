solve the lack of dual camera complaints
we see more proof that the next iPhone
might not get touch ID on the display
and more details emerge on Andy Rubens
essential project I'm Jaime Rivera and
I'm recording this video in one country
and I'm probably going to have to edit
on a plane there with me I don't know
when it's going live but this is
PocketNow daily unlimited freedom seems
to have been taken seriously with Sprint
I wish I had a sprint phone right now
because I'm about to head over to Europe
and the company has just announced 165
locations are getting unlimited roaming
on sprint LTE roaming and by the way
this is 20 more locations than t-mobile
is currently offering which is awesome
this is the way technology should be now
when we talk about Andy Rubens essential
project we first thought it was a smart
phone we still think it is but the
problem is we've got some benchmarks
obviously these are kind of shady but
they show us that this product has an 18
inch display so we're not exactly sure
what it is or if this is just one
product of the many but the reason why
we're kind of dissing it is mainly
because of the storage options you can
see more in the link in the description
and for those of you that we're
expecting Apple to make Samsung look bad
with its embedded fingerprint scanner on
display apparently it is not going to
happen we've got some leaks kinetics
that show us that the touch ID module is
being drilled at the back of the phone
actually in a spot where you're going to
be able to reach it so at least that
thing Apple is going to get right but
yeah it could be also that this is just
the prototype only time will tell
now some people that are not having a
good time right now with the galaxy s 8
are early adopters apparently most
customers in Korea
meaning mostly customers in Korea not
most but it seems that some people are
complaining about a reddish tint on the
display I'm pretty much an early adopter
and my display doesn't really have any
issues on either of the units that I've
been testing neither has one but
apparently Samsung has confirmed that
this is just some sort of a problem
internally that can actually be fixed
with software that you can actually fix
it in settings anyways we've got so much
coverage from the Galaxy s8 coming over
the next few days particularly from one
who will have his full review coming up
very soon
in addition to his real camera review
you can bet my comparisons will be
coming very soon as well and finally the
very hot news that they have to do with
the dual camera Samsung Galaxy
smartphone apparently it is going to
happen but it will have to wait until
default until the Galaxy Note 8 it seems
that this is the main selling point of
this next generation Galaxy Note the
fact that Samsung apparently finally
wants to go back to making this the
Vanguard product that has everything
that consumers want or at least powers
users want mainly one of the things that
I've been looking for I mean the camera
on the galaxy s 8 is great but with so
many flex shifts these days doing dual
cameras we really wonder why Samsung
decided to take a step back we already
heard the rumors of why but it leads me
to the question of the day do you think
that this is a good idea for Sam's like
to start differentiating the note lineup
again in my case I think it's crucial I
think it's essential leave us a comment

opinion friends you know the way it goes
