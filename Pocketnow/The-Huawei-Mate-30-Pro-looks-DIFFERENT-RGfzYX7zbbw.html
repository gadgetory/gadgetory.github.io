make 30 pro could look like and it's
different I guess it looks like Samsung
might also be taking a hit from the
Huawei band after all and Apple is
finally ready to ditch the butterfly
keyboards for something that seems to be
much better I'm Jaime Rivera happy
fourth of July everybody
you didn't expect the video today but
here we are and it's mainly because we
have a huge giveaway 7 4k TCL TVs in our
Instagram you've got 24 hours to
participate follow the link in the
description this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
because it's 4th of July and there are
sales everywhere so obviously if you're
an Amazon B&amp;amp;H you'll find deals
everywhere probably the coolest one is
those of you in the market for a pixel
3a right now and Best Buy
you're gonna be able to get it for $200
and I'm talking about $200 when you have
to activate it on Sprint obviously
there's a catch but still $200 for that
phone is insane you can learn more about
everything in the description so now
let's talk about iOS 13 and what we can
expect for the feature of iPhones are
probably just something that Apple
didn't discuss during the keynote as
well the current beta just showed us the
fact that there's this icon for you to
be able to connect one iPhone with the
other which allegedly is there for you
to be able to restore your phone in a
faster way as of surely iCloud restores
are really good but they're not
necessarily the fastest the interesting
part is when you think about the fact
that there is a what
there's no dongle in the box for you to
be able to turn your lightning cable
between one and the other so we've
already got people speculating could
this be the hint that we might be
getting a USBC iPhone because of that
there are sources to claim not but what
else or we're gonna get another dongle
in the Box we'll see now about Samsung
and the fact that the company is getting
some heat by the Australian consumer
court over its advertisement for Galaxy
devices apparently they're up to 300 ads
and be show examples of you being able
to take photos underwater under sea
water with your Galaxy phone which is
something you technically can't do
think about it as seawater can destroy
the gaskets that you know provide the
water resistance that you currently have
and the the biggest problem is that you
know that water damage is not protected
by the warranty and so obviously the
adds to a certain degree mislead
consumers to being able to do things
that they really can't do with the phone
so yeah apparently the company is
getting sued for this we'll see how this
ends up evolving but true it is true
that you can't submerge any of these
phones under saltwater that's one of the
cases but there are many others you can
learn more about those in the
description as well and how about if we
talk about the controversial MacBook Pro
butterfly keyboards definitely not a fan
favorite I mean my son Diego already had
his replace because he had issues with
his and as it turns out apparently
according to make sheet quo we are
getting a new design for the keyboards
of the 2019 MacBooks which is rather
interesting as we've already seen pretty
much two refreshes apparently there's
another one coming it will launch with
the 2019 MacBook Air which is pretty
much a refresh to the existing one which
makes us wonder exactly how this is
gonna happen because apparently this is
gonna follow the scissor design that
actually has more key travel and since
these computers are like packed really
tight we wonder how Apple is going to
manage to do that without you know
affecting production and absolutely
everything obviously things that are not
your problem
what you care about is the fact that the
keyboard works and that's exactly what
apparently Apple is trying to fix with
all the issues that they've had it seems
that there will be steel-reinforced but
still a scissor mechanism is that a
butterfly so stay tuned we should see
something in the fall and let's move
back to the topic of Samsung and Huawei
particularly because obviously the
Huawei ban has affected Huawei
particularly in not being able to sell
phones but think about it as suppliers
are also being affected it seems that
Samsung is taking a major hit in their
chip business because their biggest
customer for DRAM chips and everything
was Huawei and according to quarter
results even though we don't necessarily
have specifics we've got analysts
already predicting that Samsung is
taking a 60% hit in sales in this
quarter alone and obviously we have to
see what the results are over the next
quarter but apparel
this has been the lowest quarter for
Samsung in three years and that's a
major deal s this is probably one of the
most I don't know lucrative businesses
that Samsung has so we'll see about that
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the huawei mate 30 Pro
and the fact that it's still in the
works
we saw some rumors and some leaks that
showed a transparent glass back with a
circular design at the back we were
already thinking wow this looks a lot
like the Nokia Lumia 1020 thing about it
is we've got some leaked renders now and
a lot of people are already calling them
fake we're not exactly sure what to
expect but apparently the circular
design is going to house up to four
cameras in addition to the flash and we
see a very interesting design for it we
see a major camera in the center but we
don't know exactly what it will provide
according to the sources we tried to
zoom into the Texas heart to read but
apparently it says 5x optical zoom which
makes sense this will be currently have
with the p30 Pro but whatever the case
may be let us know what the question
today 1 do you think they're real or not
and number two what do you think do you
like this design or not in my case I
liked it I really liked the stove design
that we had in the past and this phone
in particular because it was centered I
think that it's going to look even more
interesting now circular leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
