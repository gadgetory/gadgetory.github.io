edit it out yeah exactly I could just
edit it out there's b-roll I can always
survive so if I show them if I show
embargo devices it's no prob
it at just don't do that yeah I know
that's why like you know when I did I
don't don't ask me what's in my pocket
now because everything's embargoed
I was about to say yesterday when I did
this test podcast using this format I I
mentioned because I know bong and David
Emmel were on that test podcast and I
was like I feel like everything we can't
talk about is just outside of frame like
everyone be careful yeah hello everybody
and welcome to the weekly brought to you
by Paco now and next day developers
recorded on this day it is Friday May
3rd now this particular episode may or
may not come out on the exact same day
that I just said or maybe the day after
because we're trying something different
with this episode of the weekly we have
our usual group available for today's
podcast but we're recording it in a
different way you'll notice there's no
live however this might be a YouTube
premiere so of course you have a live
chat still so you can still give us your
thoughts in the live chat via the
YouTube premiere and hopefully I'll be
in there as well so we can all have a
chat in any case let me go in and change
our scene over here we have with us
Brandon and Jaime I'll go ahead and let
everybody just sort of check in a little
bit Brandon we haven't seen you in a
minute how are you doing brother hey
guys hey would you happen to have any
embargo devices on you talking about
this it's - the landmines that we have
the minefield we have for the next like
two months is is crazy right now the
question is not do we the question is
how many exactly it's it's it it's fun
but it's also harrowing which is why I
mentioned right before we did this
podcast I we have like an email thread
leading up to the actual podcast
recording in this case no longer live
streaming I was like let's leave our
devices somewhere else
thank you just for safe because Brandon
and I right before we started recording
we mentioned that or I mentioned
I want to have these particular devices
away from me because I just I feel
tempted I'm not gonna actually talk
about it I have that professionality but
I don't want to be tempted whatsoever I
just don't want it to happen when I have
enough things to think about now that
we're recording this podcast using a
combination of Skype I mean you can see
these let me see if I can do that look
like you see these I'm failing at the
pointing these Skype low and low goes
right here so we've finally moved away
from Hangouts on there we're using Skype
and I'm recording it using OBS so if
anyone wants to see that peek behind the
curtain that's what we're doing but in
any case a Brandon any updates from you
over the last couple of weeks cause I
feel like we haven't seen you in a
little bit and we're gonna ask you
what's in your pocket now later and them
in the mid break of the show
yeah I'm just super excited for the next
round of phones I'm going to New York to
see you guys oh yeah for the upcoming
oneplus launch super excited for that
phone yeah so I mean we'll be hanging
out yeah you were mention we're gonna
talk about that also that's gonna be a
heavy speculation week after all there
are so many devices that are meant to be
coming out over the next month or so
that all of these rumors and leaks are
happening best by doesn't know how to
stock their shelves properly apparently
but in any case before we get into all
of that I want to check in with hi Mei
how's it going hi me oh the last time I
saw you we were in Spain so we saw each
other
three days ago feels like longer oh my
god
like it's been it's been jet lag II I
you know I just sent out my itinerary
for the honor trip mm-hmm for the honor
event and I I'm dreading it I want to go
because I'm really excited for that
honor 20 particularly because of the
rumors but the problem is it's a
three-day trip and this is exactly what
we did for Spain and that trip killed me
like it was too brutal like it you don't
have enough time to sleep on the way in
and then you're gonna be snoozing all
through the event and then you have to
come back the next day when you were
just starting to get accustomed to the
time zone so it totally breaks you on
the way back yeah but that's it and just
just a disclaimer guys I know that all
of you are already speculating over what
devices are on the table and Barco
devices aren't given to us
more than like a week I would say so for
those of you that are thinking that it's
the obvious it's actually not there are
more devices coming up exactly
there are plenty plenty more we're
hoping to get our hands on a couple of
them but why don't we just go out some
some of them some up like two of them I
had no idea like no there were there are
no rumors no speculations and out of the
blue that company reaches out which is a
very reputable company and they're like
we've got something cool and then they
invited us yesterday and I was like whoa
okay but I was just totally not
expecting it just totally not expecting
it and so yeah so a lot of stuff is not
even in rumor mill so why don't we just
go ahead and get into it then I wanted
to revisit like what the first thing
that we're going to talk about as far as
speculation is concerned has to deal
with the the new category of smartphone
that I feel everybody is talking about
obviously because one of them broke
recently um but apparently there are
renders of the Motorola RAZR finally
coming out and Jaime you were there
obviously last week when we were talking
with ISA my girlfriend and she made it a
very important point about foldables she
cares more about foldables
that becomes smaller when you fold them
rather than bigger and that looks like
well that's what the Motorola RAZR might
be we don't know much else other than
that other than the renders are rather
that box shot that kind of came up but I
wanted to get some thoughts from you
guys about this version of a foldable
compared to the rest go for a branded I
think I think this is the best possible
version of a foldable I'll give you
three reasons why the first one is that
I know people don't make phone calls
anymore
but the flip phone is the most perfect
shape to go against your face not only
that but the waiting can be such that
it's kind of towards the bottom because
usually that's where the battery is in
the screens in the top so it's nice and
secure in the hand so the waiting and
the the ergonomics and the the other
reason is the the size you know it's
it's so small when you fold it down you
can have a truly larger device in your
pocket versus you know the galaxy fold
and the qua we made X which condensed
and folded over are still quite big and
then with this company
folding form-factor you still get all of
the advantages of two screens you get a
smaller glance and go screen that you
can use to just look at actionable
information and hopefully it's a
touchscreen on the outside so you can
you know send a little text with your
thumb and then when you're ready to sit
down and go deeper into an experience
you can open it up so I think the razor
is the best possible folding form factor
in my opinion is it almost surprised and
after is it almost surprising to you
guys that motorola like after what we've
seen with the z series and i mean i
think the g series is still a pretty
beloved like range line is that motorola
could actually do something that is this
exciting for the it's been a while right
I listen I I hope so I wish and if not
moto somebody please pull it off because
like I always looked looking at the
renders it doesn't look like the
original razor it looks like the second
razor that not even this the there was a
b3 in the v3 I and then came another
razor version which I don't remember the
number right now but it was a taller
phone and was like sleeker it was a
beautiful device I'm trying to remember
what what mote model was that the
crazier the K razor no because that was
that was a smaller version actually I
actually had that create that Cruiser or
whatever whatever all right all right
that was the k1 the Motorola k1 I had
that one it was probably one of my
favorite phones of all time and it was
like that phone only bigger and I loved
that it was gorgeous and so um I really
want that form factor because I like for
me it's a dude it was just so cool to
get a phone call I do make phone calls
Brandon sorry and you know I I'm old
enough to make phone calls and so I
would love just pulling my phone out and
swap immediately that like effect it was
so cool it provided that cool factor to
phones back and then came and then we
hear when you're done the COFF you slam
that son of a gun cause like you're done
your business yeah it's a mic drop
that's the reason why the me mix three
is my office phone whenever I'm using
like something to either do a
teleprompter or to control my cameras I
use a mimic story because snap snap
snaps then
hey okay and so here's the thing the
good thing about this form factor is
that it's
in technology for those of you concerned
that the bees were platted that this is
a plastic screen well actually the
screens back then were plastic screens
that's all phones had back then and so
it's already proven that you can put
enough a plastic screen and that nothing
will happen to it it'll actually protect
it even more I just I have one major
concern I think it was on XDA that it
was leaked the specifications for this
phone and it the specifications looked
like those of a SmartWatch guys like it
didn't look like something crazy it
didn't look like something amazing and
so that's my concern right now like are
we going to truly pay $1500 which is the
rumored price which nobody's gonna pay
but all right a hefty price tag for
under up for an under spec device only
because you're getting that foldable
form factor I do think that I mean if
the specifications are decidedly
mid-range 1500 is way too much to ask
it's almost putting too much emphasis on
the form factor just because it's
different than the performance itself so
that is a bummer to hear that the rumor
is $1500 I don't know Brandon like would
you okay so would you pay that much for
a flagship phone like the Galaxy fold
that has this form factor or would you
pay 1500 for like a foldable that
doesn't have super high specs well you
know the galaxy phone needs to have such
good specifications because it's built
around you know 3-way 4-way eight way
multitasking whereas the the Motorola
RAZR like maybe inside it's just a
regular Android phone and don't forget
modern Android runs so well with
specifications that aren't the latest in
the greatest like you can get like a
Snapdragon 600 series three gigs of ram
and light software and it it hums it's
really good at this point it hums it
hums but then you have to remember the
limitations of going to that because the
ISP is determined by the processor so
unless you have a Snapdragon 680 which
was the new one that was announced in
sixty well we were in 660 the new one it
was either that no it wasn't the 660
it's a 680 something and the seven
and or was it the the other league the
gaming one eyford the 7:30 yeah unless
you got Lisa gave me yeah yeah unless
you have these processors that have a
better ISP because the ISP is that you
can have the best Sony sensor you've got
but if you've got a snapdragon 430 guys
sorry the camera won't perform
regardless of the of the optics that you
have and so that is that that is my
concern that you're gonna pay so much
money for a trashy camera and for an
experience that obviously nobody's gonna
be gaming on that phone so I do find
myself to be the niche for the phone cuz
I really don't care about that
so I I'm really enthusiastic about it so
long as they give me something if they
give me like the Snapdragon 710 on that
thing I'm down okay I'm in because that
also has the better ISP yeah well
hopefully that is the case unless
somehow Motorola is gonna try to like
cut costs on because it can't it can't
be cheap to create this form factor in
the first place no and and the battery
size is probably the biggest concern
think about how big the battery is gonna
have to be yeah that's true it might be
a bit thicker than what we're seeing
because that render didn't really show
too much in terms of like thee know the
the thickness of this phone all it
really showed is that like that screen
will come down and even then it might
not be a flush fold it might have that
little isn't that what the Galaxy fold
had words just like that little bit of
give where it wasn't fully flat onto
itself yeah could be so yeah I mean it's
it's it's exciting to see that foldables
can have different form factors within
its own category though like I think
that's great we have of course the made
X which folds outward to itself same
thing with the xiaomi fold whatever that
might end up being called and then of
course a galaxy fault so now Motorola is
gonna try to get in on it can you
imagine though if like unfolded you
could also put a moto mod on the back oh
well
dude hey so the if you remember know you
probably don't you were too young Josh
but the star tech the oh the start that
was my family's first phone
I remember case ooh okay so the starts
act 7760 I do remember that number
because I owned one had pins at the back
and you can snap like a sort of a PDA
module to it hmm yeah
I mean why not yeah definitely all right
so let's see what are some other ones
that we were that we had em I am I am I
the only one that feels that the best
approach for a foldable is the modular
option that the v50 is bringing with
that secondary screen that you can snap
on to it whenever you need it and just
take it off whenever you don't well
what's funny of you is that that's not
technically a foldable phone it's a
foldable case that has a screen on it
right yeah right so whenever you need a
larger display it's a case you you snap
on to it it becomes a modular yeah you
don't have to deal with the with the
hassle all the time and you and it's
optional you'd have to pay top money for
you pay it only if you want it mmm
that's true Brendon did you see that one
I mean I did a video for a pocket now
obviously so you probably saw that video
but like the the case is a second screen
and then it just folds onto itself it's
a thick piece of like kit for sure but
how do you feel about that version of a
foldable phone Brendon I think it's
interesting if you have the accessory at
the right time when you need it well for
for people who might have it it might be
all the time so you're just gonna have
this huge bulge in your in your jeans
yeah yeah it's just ads I think
unnecessary thickness unless you're okay
with the remember those curves because
when we have our foldable phones that we
end up reviewing wherever we might be
reviewing them those two terms bulge in
your pants
unnecessary thickness I like that one
unnecessary we do have a number of other
devices to talk about again rumor
speculation it's a spec week as well
we're caught speculation week you
mentioned a little bit earlier Jaime
about the honor 20 and there were there
was a render that was starting to make
some circulation out there yeah the
phone itself I mean okay the the
relationship between honor and huawei is
very storied there are different there
are different perspectives on it even
from haul off even from honnor
themselves but when you take a look at
this particular render this phone looks
a lot like the p30 pro don't you think
it looks it looks a lot like the p30 pro
and that's actually a good thing because
if you if you've noticed I mean what is
the price difference between
a huawei phone an honor phone what's the
difference between what you get you had
the experience of the view 20 I mean you
were impressed by that phone and so I
think that the coolest selling point
about honor is the price tag I mean you
are getting a huawei top level
experience without having to pay for it
there are some compromises like water
resistance like you know the fact that
there's no wireless charging etc etc I
haven't really seen the specs of the
honor 20 completely all I've heard is
about the cameras but I am looking
forward to a device with you know with
all all those specifications and
everything and the price that'll make it
more accessible because the technology
is really cool I really love my p30 Pro
I posted about it on Instagram yesterday
I really enjoyed using it for for some
things there's there a couple of little
things I don't like but I don't know I
feel that that would be a great approach
if they would just continue that you
know it's been a trend actually I think
that the honor time look like the p20 if
you remember mmhmm yeah that is true
I think not that not like the p20 Pro so
if you saw the renders it looks like
this Pete went bid like this honor 20
looks like the p30 Pro not to be thirty
but even if it did if you think about it
the sleeper hit for Huawei is the p30
not the p30 Pro because you get
literally a p20 Pro in another packaging
and you get the ryy B sub pixel array
and everything and I'll tell you this
much I honestly I don't really like the
5x optical zoom much I feel it's too
much it's 100 and it's 120 millimeters
it's crazy like for street photography
I prefer 3x or I would really like if
there were like steps in the middle so
even if that honor 20 is a piece 30 it
would still be a great phone yeah how
far how far is too much for you as far
as oome is concerned like when does it
go like when does it go from though it
likes being too little to being a
creeper camera no it's it's it's not
that it's too much it's just I you know
in my feedback I was like there needs to
be steps like I don't want it to jump
directly to five oh I see I don't want
it to jump directly to five or jump to
ten I want it to go one two three four
like two halves
to these because for me I used 2 X
optical zoom all the time like if I'm at
a tree like if I'm at an event 2 X is
like the ideal for me if I'm street
photography 3 X is the ideal for me I
rarely use 5 X but you but it's cool to
have it you know I just I rarely do mmm
it's cool to have and especially under
ideal circumstances because I still find
that like even if your hand is steady
and it's a really brightly lit shot it
still comes out soft just I think the
limitation of really yeah you're like
dude look at my Instagram pic from like
a week ago of the Eiffel Tower it looks
like a postcard it looks like a postcard
I was like even whe when you and this is
the beauty about a telephoto people are
always like yeah the zoom you don't
really care about it
street photography the crop is ideal for
street photography and every time that I
use the the optical crop from Huawei
phones like the thing is you don't see
it immediately when you're taking the
photo Bo and you see the results you're
like damn that was my response I was
like whoa okay Brendan did you get burnt
weren't you supposed to be getting a P
30 or a p3 Pro from the pool like a
little while back um I didn't from the
pool but TK let me borrow his so I use I
use it for like a week and a half what I
was going to say about honor is that the
reason I like honor is because you get
the best of Huawei six to twelve months
later and for 20 the 50% less and I
think I think that's awesome and it's um
you know with the with the honor 20 it
looks like we're getting that same kind
of effect where we're getting a device
like the P 30 pro just you know it's
been a while what like 10 months and
something like that and yeah and so
you're getting it later and it's going
to be you know significantly less
expensive so you get that great camera
technology it's not as good when you
when you look at the pictures later but
you know honor does a great job at
taking the the quality and technology of
Huawei and putting it to a less
expensive package yeah I mean you may
say I'm excited nah now tell me
something Josh did you ever use it with
and
auto wit your p30 Pro no not yet and if
I'm honest I haven't used a p30 Pro
enough yet because I'm going through the
queue right now and obviously I've been
on sort of a a kick of like gaming
phones recently so I'm finishing the
black shark to review for both PocketNow
and my own channel so that's what I've
been using the most recently but once
I'm done this weekend with the Q that I
have in front of me the p3 Pro is gonna
be like my focus so so here's the thing
here's the thing I mean the problem with
with always approach to - you know I
forget there emui which is the magic UI
for honor is just how aggressive it is
about killing apps Michael Fisher
mentioned that in his review it is so
aggressive that if you're using Android
auto and you're using navigation and
you're you you're playing music on
Spotify if I tell the Google assistant
which would be a third application to
make a phone call it won't make it like
it will literally tell you yes calling
this number mobile and boom it starts
making the call and then it can't and
then it just kills the call it kills the
call and that goes back to navigation
it's so weird huh it is so weird
it's that aggressive about killing
absence Oh multitasking on a huawei
phone like don't get me wrong the
battery life is like I think I use my P
30 Pro yesterday all day I end of the
day at like 78 percent 75% it was like
the only phone that I was using it's
crazy good but I would like a little
more granularity and be like you know
what let me keep at least 5 apps running
man come on yeah this Ram so like why
would it be so aggressive about yelling
things right well it's it's it's not
just about the RAM it's each of these
applications running in the background
kills battery you know that's fair I
guess it does lead to some pretty
awesome battery life but you're right it
is it can it can mess with the usage
upon the daily and because I make phone
calls phone calls you know especially in
an auto yeah I can't use my phone for
anything else yeah indeed okay so before
we get into the one that I'm going that
the device that I want to like actually
talk a little bit more at length about
because we're gonna get a little bit
existential we're gonna revisit an
earlier phone because apparently we're
going
a new version of it coming up soon I do
want to talk a little bit like the
oneplus event is so close that we'd I
don't think we need to talk at length
about the specs and the rumors and one
app because it's gonna happen very soon
so I do know though that Brandon you are
super excited for this upcoming one I
mean we all love oneplus we all love
like the attendants of one plus oxygen
OS simplicity minimalism whatever but I
just wanted to give Brandon the the
floor a little bit because you had
expressed that you're so excited for
this upcoming one plus seven or whatever
the case may be I'm so excited for the
next one plus phone if the rumors are to
be believed you know I've been waiting
since the razor phone one for another
company to do a higher refresh screen
and it sounds like the one plus seven
will have a higher refresh screen I just
I'm so excited for this phone guys I use
my one plus sixty every time I go back
to it I'm like this phone is so fast
it's crazy
everything is instantaneous scrolling is
fast the hardware's fantastic and they
they figured out the camera like every
generation the cameras got significantly
better it started subpar with back in
like you know the the the predecessor to
the five what was that the out the three
T and the three cameras weren't that
good really high-quality metal build and
then we started to see some real
improvements in the five the five T the
six the sixty so for me one plus phones
are the ultimate the cameras still not
there yet a hundred percent but I think
they're getting there and the rumors
about this year being nearly bezel this
high refresh screen and they're finally
moving beyond it sounds like the the
kind of fhd to a higher resolution
display it's just gonna be bananas I
can't wait I'm so excited yeah do you
have like a wish like oh well you were
you already going through your wish list
here but like as far as rumored features
or concerns like we're seeing a lot of
sliding / motorized type cameras and
whatnot does that mean there's that is
that a feature that matters to you so
much Brandon for me I don't take that
many selfies so to kind of tuck that
away I think is awesome wish list two
things wireless charging
and dual stereo speakers I can't imagine
that's that did wire wireless charging
and dual stereo speakers hmm all right I
actually don't use while you're charging
as often as people like make it out to
be I know it's kind of a hot topic these
days especially when it depends on how
it depends on how many wireless chargers
you have and how often you need it I
I like wireless charging on devices like
the p30 Pro because you rarely need to
charge it so I literally just place it
on the pad at night okay fair and for me
that's crazy convenient you know if the
device has good battery life and I could
just place it on the pad when I go to
sleep and I have to be worrying about
that then for me wireless charging is
valuable but every other way it's like
me yeah the one the only thing that I
really need to wireless charge is this
thing here is this amber mug because I
wanted to buy one of those things man I
was like 80 bucks for a mug never mind
yeah it is it's a level of convenience
that is pricey and it's it's definitely
a luxury so I'm bougie today this is my
air pots let's put it that way you guys
say something Brendon yeah I was gonna
say
wireless charging has gotten more
important to me for in the last like two
years from one reason and that's I phone
now that the newer iPhones wirelessly
charge
my dad has a wireless charger he never
did before when I go to his house my mom
has one my wife uses one on her iPhone 8
and just like now that the iPhone does
wireless charging I want my phone have
wireless charging because now people
have wireless charging pads I'm over
their house I need a quick top-up they
have one out on the counter but now
we're charging wirelessly I love it is
it seem it seems like you're doing the
Lord's work because you're actually your
tech background in lifestyles actually
like proliferating in your family which
is it's not easy to do for me wireless
charging is valuable when you do things
like the pixel stand where you place it
on the pad it charges your product
faster and then it becomes a Google home
many pretty much yeah that for me I wish
every phone did it I don't know why
Apple doesn't do it with Siri I don't
know
every like by now the a word which I
sadly have an echo right in front of me
so I can't say it but right now with
with the a integration on a lot of
mobile products I I would like jump on
that quickly you know use your wireless
charging stand and turn your phone into
another because in the end for them the
business is not really to sell the
speakers this the businesses for them to
drive the content consumption okay yeah
that's very I think just as far as the
the speculation is concerned on the one
plus seven or whatever the case for me I
I do agree with you Brandon that high
refresh rate screens are still somewhat
underrated and I think that it's
something we should start seeing in more
and more phones so I would be excited
for that if that is indeed the case but
the question but the question is what
other device
I mean oneplus has been using all EDS
and what other device has an OLED with
high refresh rate it's only been done in
LCDs unless did the ROG phone bring it
oh that's a good question I can't
remember off the top of my head I mean
yeah you can look at it I think I think
the ROG phone is probably the only other
phone that assuming that it does come
with that otherwise does if the rumors
are true and we're getting high refresh
rate does it mean that we're getting an
LCD on this phone is a question that is
that's one of my concerns yeah I agree
okay well while you while you look at of
Jaime and also I'm gonna ask Brandon
this question first so that you can
navigate the minefield a little bit
easier
Brandon our recurring segment on this on
this podcast you can say whatever it is
it doesn't actually have to be in your
pocket but what is in your pocket now
Brandon in my pocket now is the galaxy s
10 plus but I've been switching phones
like once a week lately tonight when I
get home I am gonna spend the weekend
with the iPhone 10s because it's just
been a while since I used an iPhone and
like I feel like I feel like it's kind
of my obligation to use different
products and I don't feel at home on the
iPhone anymore the notification system
just sucks so bad it just it's just pair
Wise's me but really yeah it's just bad
it's so bad just it still has this
problem well whatever all right so I'm
gonna switch the ice how many what are
you talking about at least notifications
on the iPhone or chronological that will
that's one of the things that pisses me
off about Android it's like I'm like why
are you putting text messages at the top
nobody texts now we use whatsapp like we
use other things and then I have to be
like pulling the drop down to the bottom
I just I want to know my phone just
vibrated I want to know why it vibrated
right now which is it should be at the
top why do I have to put up with that
sort of priority or if anything allow me
to choose in what priority my
notifications are shown so for me
actually iPhones are like if my phone
ever bright brights and I have four
phones on the table the phone that I'll
pick up is the iPhone you know that's
the phone I'll pick up you know what I
have to I have to kind of agree because
like being in a long-distance
relationship legislate that way I know
that when a messenger icon shows up in
the notification area that it's most
likely my girlfriend
but then when I bring down the
notification drop-down I got a scroll
past all the other I have never thought
about that you just broke some glass I
mean listen and and so if somebody asked
me wait a second so you're a
notification hoarder no it's not that I
live under a system that's called it
used to be called fat I don't remember
what but it's literally if I'm not ready
to act on something because I'm busy or
anything I will leave it there because
it'll still remind me later it's the
whole point of a notification center the
fact that you don't have to act on
things immediately until you can and so
what I at least want is to know in what
order things came in and so I know that
the first things that came in are the
things at the bottom and the ones that
just arrived that are the things at the
top and so it's that stupid basic thing
I can't wait for I just want the option
just give me the option just like
alphabetical order in your in your in
your app tray oh yeah just give me an
order of arrival and I'll be a happy man
that's it oh and I just checked our og
phone here by the way it is 90 Hertz
you know
obviously it's got insane bezels which
the rumors of the sixth of the 60 of the
seven are that it doesn't have many
bezels you know it's literally is it
just me or does it look like the like
the got the Oppo what do you have it
here no not well I haven't seen the Reno
I mean the find X oh yeah yeah
I mean that would make sense the Reno
and the find X are quite similar by the
way so but I mean isn't that sort of the
running joke though is that whenever
Oppo comes out with something you can
expect oneplus to follow suit well but
that's the thing it's like the case of
Huawei and honor I I like that I was in
the in I was in a press meeting with
Oppo 4 m WC and their head of
engineering you know I I just I find
that funny when the when the press asked
questions that are just like this that
are probably so obvious and so their
response is well we're also an OD em we
make certain designs we have customers
like oneplus like vivo they will pick
the designs they want and we will build
their phone ODMs it exists like you've
seen certain and the guy was like to a
certain degree I think he was annoyed
he's like you've seen you've seen
headphones that have a specific design
and you find like five brands come up
with that their branding on those
headphones that look like this
specifically ODMs we are a business
we've been in this business for two
decades yeah we don't you know so one
plus is a customer vivo is a customer
real me now as a customer as well get
used to it yeah
oh that ROG phone and that find X I you
just popped out is that your what is in
your pocket now no no my pocket now is
Garmin Phoenix five plus now that I've
found a metallic now that I found a
metallic band for it but that that is
about to change that is about to change
I just I don't know if I want to this is
not under embargo by the way I just
haven't had a time to get to it what is
that
Nubia Alpha oh I didn't recognize the
logo so so I'm gonna make an ID TV video
on this
de unboxing it nights I haven't not had
the time to play with this but and I'm
not even sure if I'm willing to use it
but I'll give it a try they told me they
would reach out to me to tell me how to
connect it because if you remember the
idea of this product is for it to be a
phone yes really a wearable yeah so
that's gonna be weird okay fair enough
you know it's funny you you you just
brought out a Nubia product I should be
using it right now I have used it a
little bit but Nubia actually reached
out to me as well and they send me the
red magic Mars so oh they reached out to
me too but they haven't sent it oh well
I went ahead and got it because I'm on
like I said I'm on a kick of gaming
phones recently so I wanted to try it
out
much like the ROG phone it has the
triggers on the on the corners when
you're holding in Lance case but yeah as
far as why it's in my pocket now it's
actually what's on my finger at the
moment I did get another product that
again like the Q is getting so large
these days but just a quick question
this is not a spoiler but I just wanted
to reference did you guys watch endgame
already not yet not yet
okay this is a line from that yet and
and and Diego is asking me to not watch
it until he comes since Diego's landing
here on Tuesday but I'm not back from IO
until like Saturday so I can't watch
endgame until next week oh no how about
you Brandon III feel like silently not
telling him that I already watched and
acting stupid when I go well that's
documented proof right there's hopefully
Diego's not watching this is uh this is
a line from endgame it's not a spoiler
but it's a line from endgame I just want
to say I am inevitable so it looks like
I'm trying to make the tech gauntlet
right here because I have the order in
but this is an old an old buddy right
here the or the Ori you guys know the
Ori I mean they're already a couple of
originals out it's what I would never be
caught dead wearing that I'll tell you
that so what we have here is it's
basically a bone conduction it's like
little ring right so what the whole idea
is that it actually reverberates the
bone conduction technology through your
finger and if you go like this you can
actually hear what's coming from the
phone via bluetooth audio so you got you
take calls litter
like this if you wanted to but it's
meant to be more of a short form audio
product so if you want it to like press
this button over on the side and then
talk to a Google assistant it can do
that you can also read back your
messages and whatnot and I saw these
guys when they were in there like
crowdfunding phase or rather their
pre-order phase maybe as a better way to
put it
two years ago at Computex so they're
finally out and there are a couple of
reviews out there
mr. Mobil himself has done a review on
it and man that lucky that lucky full
man like he not only got a review unit
straight from Orry it had his name on
the bottom portion of it they laser exes
mr. Mobil on the bottom of the order
that is so Michael fish been doing
reviews on robots that wouldn't I get
those pitches and I'm like man and then
out of the blue boob of Michael Fisher
oh my god this is so Fischer this is so
Michael III kind of like back in my
family all my my mom was using a shot
glass to like make some drinks for the
family and I looked at the shot glass in
her hand and it was the mr. Mobil shot
glass I was like you put that down right
now because I brought it back from CES
okay
so let's go ahead and get into the final
device as far as our speculation week is
concerned I'm gonna start this off like
okay here's here's how I want to start
this off because I feel like it's a very
printing question with all the leaks and
the rumors and specs speculation that's
coming out do we need honest question do
we need another pixel that's my question
right why don't we start with okay so
Jaime just said no but Brandon I haven't
heard from you in a minute
like how much have you used the pixel 3
and how would you feel about a new
version of the pixel 3 coming out that
is yes more affordable but it in general
the question is do we need another pixel
I've I have the pixel 3 and the pixel 3
XL and every time I need my best camera
unless I'm taking a lot of video it's
always the pixel 3 and
or pixel 3xl and I think there's a
hundred it's a hundred percent unanimous
across the entire tech community that
the best camera phone ever to exist is
the pixel three so if somebody wants to
have the best possible photo taking
experience but they don't want to pay
these ridiculous pixel three pixel 3xl
prices I think there's a spot in the
market for a less expensive pixel 3 a
pixel 3 XL that offer that same
incredible camera at a much more
affordable price well here's here's my
follow a question then like if the pixel
3 has been out for a number of months by
now and if you actually wanted to have
that camera by now wouldn't you already
have a pixel 3 you know what I mean like
or a pixel 2 XL fair yeah I have or a
pixel 2 I just listen I my opinion with
the pixel is like listen the solution
for when you're not doing well is not to
do more of the same thing that is not
the solution so doing a less expensive
version of a phone that didn't do well
is not a good idea so there there's one
reason why this phone is important
the main one being the cot that the
topic that we were discussing about the
ISP and the processor you need a
powerful powerful processor for the isp
to be a specific way in order to be able
to take that photos so I do trust in
Google and coming up with a new
computational trick that will make even
cheap processors and cheap ISPs get a
better job done so I think it'd do it in
the cloud and you know yeah yeah so I
think that this phone matters I do I'm
not saying it doesn't it would be great
to get better photography in the mid to
low range my problem is when you know
the design of the pixel wasn't great it
my god the screen like I remember when I
did that review I'm like I really want
to love this phone and then there were
cases where the phone took better photos
than the iPhone and then everything else
but because the screen was so bad it
wasn't until I pulled them into the
computer that I noticed that other than
that I ended up posting the photo from
the other phone just because it looked
better and it wasn't because of the that
it took better quality was just a screen
on the iPhone was significantly better
or the screen on the Galaxy was
significantly better
not even so much yet no wait don't even
get me started about that people are
people are like we want 18 by 9 video
I'm like have you ever used the pixel
mmm
have you ever used the pixel 3 Excel and
tried to watch 18 by 9 video on that and
notice that you can't zoom in and out of
that can you imagine what it's like for
us to put all the effort into composing
a shot for you to have that covered by
literally half of Long Island City and
the size of that knob it's just like
like that and then you know other things
like the battery life on the pixel 3
Excel wasn't great it takes forever for
the camera to launch like I love that
Marquez did a video about that
specifically when he was where he was
like you know come on guys your Google
like everything that's made a pixel what
made the original pixel possible the
ugliest film that could ever be launched
but a great camera and a snappy UI a
insane battery like the small the
original small pixel had insane battery
life it was great and so why can't we
remain in the basics why can't we get
the basics right the camera is the most
important thing the battery is the most
important thing if you're gonna tell me
that the software experience is great
but you're still gonna give me an ugly
phone that's fine we can work towards
that so long as the experience like if
you grab any one less phone I dare you
to grab a 1+5 not even the the 60 grab
the five and play with with oxygen OS
and compared that to the pixel URI on
the pixel 3 Excel and you'll notice that
the oneplus 5 performs better hmm I just
noticed what I just noticed there's a
bit of a tangent but I made sure it is
very is very appropriate for this rant
he just went on happen sci-fi for
construction but you know it's true
though like so to get you kind of take
on that Brendan like do you agree with a
lot of what I am is saying because if
the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 Excel are
already sort of subpar in the flagship
game what we're about to get in what is
basically going to be called the pixel 3
a and the 3 Axl are lower specs that
might make those problems worse
worse yeah definitely the worst part of
pixel devices besides they're kind of
boring design is that they get
significantly slower over time I don't
want to say as bad as a Samsung phone
you know older generation but like it's
pretty sad if you pick up like a pixel
three pixel three XL that's like you
know what was launched in November or
something so it's really not that old
and it just it lags the camera takes
forever to launch and that's another
reason oneplus phones are awesome estate
that doesn't happen at all even like an
old phone like the five yeah yeah and
since I feel the value proposition of
the original pixel has been lost it just
it has been completely lost and so
unless Google is willing to go back to
its roots just give me I don't care like
I listen all I could think of is the
experience we have with the pixel slate
where these are good ideas I'm not
saying they're bad ideas and the pixel 3
Excel from its back is gorgeous I love
the phone and white though the white
barring that they gave me I love looking
at that phone from its back I despise
looking at it from the front I'm like
where are your engineers dammit like
you're telling me that it like and don't
get me wrong I love that dual camera
that wide-angle selfie camera for me
like the pixel 3 excel is the selfie
phone for me yeah I dropped like 30
pounds every time I take a photo with
that thing so it's a crowd-pleaser for
girls definitely but it's just it's just
one of those things where it's like god
man like I I get that these things are
good and I get that I get free photos
it's just it's not any better there was
a time when it was uglier than anything
else and it was better now it's not now
when you've got you know I get it it's
it's a good camera man but when you use
the you use the p30 Pro or then even the
mate 20 Pro it's like you know there are
cases where you do get better dynamic
range from the pixel sure Derek history
even get better dynamic range from the
iPhone but everything else man video
recording is trash like the quality is
good but the audio is terrible yes and
so it's like what so what is the what is
like that phone that I always carry I
have to carry it because it's my
microphone but for for war
but if I had to make like a video like
when I was in them in the mate X when I
did that made X hands-on I was right
there at night run the mill I need to
get a video done and I was not carrying
a camera I had a mate 20 Pro in one
pocket an iPhone 10 s in the other I
pulled out the iPhone mmm fair do you
guys do you guys think it's possible
this is kind of weird but back when we
found out that Google was making its own
hardware we were like that's strange why
would Google do that - they might
potentially harm all of their partners
do you think it's possible in any world
that Google makes their pixel phones to
have poor video recording weird designs
weird screens and not-so-good audio in
order to make a slightly subpar product
so that people criticize it and Samsung
still can sell lots of phones and while
we consider is that possible or is that
crazy
not when they invested 2 billion dollars
at HTC that was what I was about to say
like back when back when hardware was
becoming a focus for Google and the
Nexus line and all that stuff I would
agree with you Renan if they did not
partner up with said companies that you
know HTC in the same case with
smartwatches they did the same with
hardware with with fossil I mean right
now it's clear which is the most
successful company from an economical
standpoint it's Apple what this app will
do that's special they own the whole
banana and so Google gives out om Sando
DMS the Liberty to do with Android
whatever they want but it's like the the
purpose of the Nexus in its time and the
pixel later was you know what OMS do
whatever you want dear consumers if you
want Android the way we envision that
here it is and so it's like the true
Android with no nothing else or do you
want the variants I mean you can pick
it's a free market in the markets big
enough for everybody and so I feel that
I know I feel that Google wants to
compete but I just my god like they
really they really need to try harder
and you know part of the rumors are that
they have three design teams working on
the next on the next pixel you know I
don't care if you keep the back guys
just fix the damn front
just think about it it says this is its
this is one of those things where it's
like it's like editing video if you know
I think that Apple with their MacBook
Pro lineup does it best or Apple with
their iPad pro lineup does it best if
the gateway to this software is the
screen you better give me a kick-ass
screen that that's just the way it is
the screen is everything everything
should be secondary but the experience
of what you're doing when you're using a
product day in day out you're gonna be
looking at the photos during the yeah
you're gonna take a couple of photos
during the day that's fine I don't care
I want an awesome display it has to be
awesome it can't be subpar and so that's
my other question 'epic sylth r EA r we
can I'd like if they're flagships don't
have a good screen what are what what
what are we gonna get in those like mid
Rangers and I'm already I'm already like
dreading it like it's just gonna be a
sticker they're just gonna give up from
a sticker it's gonna be a Gameboy screen
I don't know man I so you know does the
price not do anything for you though the
fact that you can have it's 399 go buy
yourself a poco phone you'll be better
with whoo that's not a bad do you know
what you're right that is true I did not
think about that in the moment and it's
stock Android man I mean and so that's
the thing it's too little too late it
would have been great if they would have
launched it initially and and so
yesterday I covered in the daily I was
like oh my God if they priced this thing
at $2.99 that'd be good $2.99 you know
for for a Snapdragon 600 processor and
then there are all their bells and
whistles I mean Google really if Google
needs ticket wants to compete they need
to go back to their Nexus time when they
were like our business is to sell
software we don't make money out of the
hardware and so for them selling the the
Nexus devices were just selling a
terminal which Amazon does is with their
speakers so that's the that's the market
and they do it with their tablets they
need to stop worrying about how much
money they make Amazon does it as well
if you think about it Google is the
company that is in the position to do
this that other companies don't Samsung
doesn't control the App Store they don't
make a cut they don't make an economical
cut out
the AppStore none of these companies do
the only company that makes money out of
the App Store is Google from the
percentage that they get from developers
so if there's one company that should be
shell selling as a cheap meaning an
inexpensive high-quality device it's
Google they want Google to go by way of
Xiaomi then yes yes Apple well Apple
doesn't do it but Xiaomi does it Amazon
does it these are the companies that are
succeeding right now the companies that
are forgetting about the hardware come
on cable companies have done it forever
they give you the router like they give
you everything all I have to do is pay
for the bill okay that's fair
Brendan any thoughts on that I think
Jaime just did a mic drop so I think it
did a great job I think these are all
very valid points and Ike just from the
consumer like a user end standpoint I
think the one thing that I would love to
see from like whatever the next pixel is
not that we're going through the
wishlist of what the pixel four would be
but I mean honestly like maybe we can
look that far ahead because the
processing that Google has introduced
what the pixel is top notch it is great
- Brandon to your point like it is the
camera that you can reach for and you
can expect results that will actually
come out of that phone I just wish that
there was more to the camera experience
I mean one of the reasons why we still
reach for the LG's and the Samsung's and
the other phones of the world is because
there's a wide angle there's a zoom
there's all this there's all that on
pixels right now there's only that one
lens and I think the the killer app in
this case would be a mixture of the
software processing and hardware options
and I think that's what's missing the
most I remember I remember when when by
the grace of God I was able to go to the
the pixel events under like the Joshua
Vergara name like he didn't even say any
other brand and I still look back very
fondly on that on that event and I
remember becoming so excited on the show
floor or rather on the experience center
floor where I saw that there was there
was that wide angle on the front and I
was super excited then I realized it's
not a vloggers phone because the audio
sucks there would have been great if
there was a wide angle on the back - and
that's your right that's the that's
where the fundamental sort of fall apart
and barren wine like I have to like
disclaimer Google is firing me right now
- Google
so this is the funny part when when
readers are like yeah you're being paid
by these brands no man you know one of
the things that I love about working
with Google is they actually love
feedback oneplus loves feedback you know
these companies they are willing to hear
what you have to say whether they do it
or not you know it's it's another thing
it's just don't get me wrong I'm not
saying I'm not trying to trash the pixel
I'm saying that it's a terrible phone
it's not it's just very hard for me to
sit here and pick that phone over every
other at a time when phones have gotten
so good yeah yeah and I think Joshua
used the word fundamentals I think
that's like that's such an operative
term here like in a lot of cases pixels
missed the fundamentals and that's just
like the little things when you're using
it that you miss mmm so you don't think
that okay so Brendon your endorsement of
the camera and whatnot
and like you said if if this makes it
more available to more people because
it's more affordable than that's great
would you actually recommend a three a a
three Axl to somebody who wants a good
camera but an affordable phone
underneath it all there is a lot of
competition at that price point still
like the pro phone and the shou motorola
the Moto Z the Z it sorry sorry the Z
the the the G G the G limey the G and
then you have the Xiaomi me9 and some
honor phones I'm not sure it depends if
they get those fundamentals right if the
fundamentals are right and the cameras
still you know killer then yeah I would
recommend that phone although I gotta
say most of the time when people ask me
what phone to get I say just get in - oh
I mean especially when it's like an
older person or someone that doesn't
care about technology and despair about
it's just like you'll be happy with the
iPhone just get an iPhone that's very
yeah and you know what I will admit that
with the with the detective Pikachu
movie coming out like very soon it's got
me looking at that iPhone 10 or yellow
right now I'm kind of intuitive I'm kind
of into it at the moment and also there
was a case manufacturer that's making
like Pokemon cases I kind of looked at
them I'm not gonna lie
but yeah I kind of see where you're
coming from with that because like the
the iPhone line is sort of like that
de-facto for somebody that wants
something that is easy to use but
they're not affordable I think that's
the reason why I wanted to ask like that
question because 400 I like that price
point personally like I think it's a
good price I could buy a pixel with
those capabilities hopefully at $400
true true you know it's it's it's it's a
matter of taste man I I can't wait to
see I just I'm not I'm I don't feel that
the hardware of the pixel 3xl warrants
its price so I hope that I don't have
that same feeling about the three a yeah
that's fair and also like we didn't
really go through any of the supposed
specifications of the three and the
three Axl but you know it's you can you
can find all of that in stories over on
Pocket now and I'm sure you're seeing a
lot of speculation on it already anyway
across YouTube but I think for yeah I
think that for the most part should do
it I mean we just got done recording our
