pocket now calm and this is the software
review of the LG fathom on verizon
wireless let's get to it ok so again
this is a windows mobile 6.5 point 3
device there haven't been that many
devices released with that point 3
edition of the operating system it means
that you have better support for finger
friendliness it also has capacitive
touchscreen support but of course the LG
fathom does not have a capacitive touch
screen it is resistive so it has a
stylus which isn't the worst thing in
the world it means that the screen is
not as sensitive as you would get on
some of the newer phones out there so
I'm going to turn this on and point out
some cool features on the unlock screen
so what we have here and you saw it's
going to come back is a gesture pad and
what you can do with this is draw a
letter that corresponds to a program so
I've linked the letter T to my Twitter
client so I type T kind of sloppily and
it will load TWiki knee very very cool
and you can assign a whole lot of
letters to different programs so I've
also done e4e ml so let me turn it back
on here so if I do an e just with my
finger it's going to all gmail awesome
awesome feature a very smart way to add
an enhancement to the lock screen so you
you don't even have to unlock your lock
screen to get to the application you
just draw the letter with your finger I
like that a lot and there's also another
enhancement down here on the bottom you
get to see your calendar but if you
swipe you get play controls for your
multimedia so you don't even have to
unlock your device if you want to go to
the next track or stop or pause nice
little enhancement made by LG something
that doesn't come standard on windows
mobile 6.5 so we're just going to unlock
here and be dumped into the the very
vanilla windows mobile default today
screen and it's it's a nice today screen
it lets you slide along and do various
things we can flick through our pictures
we can go to music to our multimedia
player phone see if we have any missed
calls it'll integrate with favorite
contacts dialing voicemail don't want to
do that show you the time clock
emails you can scroll through them
calendar what's going on Internet
Explorer and you get the point from
their very basic very plain but if you
like it clean and light then you will
appreciate this home screen of course we
can go into landscape screen rotation
speeds are a little bit on the slow side
compared to some newer devices that are
out there but you can do that now
something else that is new to windows
mobile 6.5 point 3 and that's a mouthful
to size that you can tap and hold on the
notification bar up here and you can
scroll through the notifications before
they were really tiny and tough to press
but in an effort to make things more
finger friendly Microsoft has magnified
them and speaking of magnet
magnification if you press on this
magnifying glass you get this
interesting screen zoom which I really
don't understand I don't know why you
would ever use this but it's nice and it
actually scales things quite nicely it's
not like zooming in with a digital zoom
where everything gets pix elated it's
actually scaled quite nicely so if you
have vision problems perhaps or you're
trying to see something on the screen
that is very small this will help you
with that so let's go through some of
the included programs here we can access
the start menu obviously with the button
on the bottom now or through this button
here the hardware button it's always
nice to have so here we have messages
which is a kind of spur stop text
messaging application that is a little
bit nicer than what you get in the
standard windows mobile we have visual
voicemail on here we have mobile IM so
you can use aim windows live messenger
and yahoo going down the list we have
city ID which is cool little program
that lets you look up a phone number and
find out the city and zip code so if i
start typing it knows its pennsylvania
by the area code i do the first three
digits and it knows its media PA so
that's a nice little handy application
to have going down a list further we'll
go into settings in a minute internet
explorer comes on here but opera mobile
doesn't come on here oddly i downloaded
it immediately because i think it's a
better browser for windows mobile of
course skyfire is another good choice we
have the bing search application which
lets you
check traffic and gas prices it's a free
download for any windows mobile device
and it's a really fantastic application
it's kind of like Google Maps mobile
which is also a free application for
windows phone it's multitasking quite a
bit right now as you can see with the
one gigahertz Snapdragon processor it's
pretty fast it only has 256 megabytes of
RAM and as you're going to see it's only
about 2 111 megabytes that is usable but
still it's snappy it's definitely a
quick device scrolling down we have
Office Mobile here we have standard
stuff voice calculator a voice command
program you can you could say a command
you can assign that to a hardware button
so say you press this button over here
and says please say a command so you can
have that within easy reach and again
I'm using my finger here not the stylist
the screen is sensitive enough and
definitely everything all of the UI
elements are big enough so that I don't
need to take out the stylus we have
adobe reader le we have the very basic
games here just solitaire we have some
widgets very standard stuff that you get
on Windows Mobile let's talk about web
browsing using opera mobile so you can
get a sense for the performance so let's
launch it up here and I'm going to slide
out the keyboard and we'll go to
pocketnow.com
and let's I what you go it's on opera
turbo right now so it should be a little
bit faster it's using some server side
rendering that appeared very fast
although it's not quite finished with
all the graphics yet well really stopped
loading most of the graphics we can tap
tap once to zoom in maybe if it works
today there goes and we can tap on a
headline let's see how fast that loads
okay and again it's not loading all the
images I think that's because it is on
opera turbo let's go to engadget com
and here's the mobile version we're
going to go to the the full version here
you can actually use the d-pad to select
if you're having trouble with the
touchscreen this may be a good time to
use the stylus actually to be more
precise on the screen okay so here we
are we can use the d-pad to scroll and
move around on the screen or we can use
our finger see what happens when we go
fast get a little bit of checkerboards
there it's not keeping up as capably as
some of the newer devices out there I
think that maybe because it's running
out of RAM a little bit and this is you
know loading a lot of images but overall
if you if you're not a huge rush the
rendering fidelity is quite good opera
mobile is a great browser and you can
also try skyfire there are many choices
if you are using windows mobile and you
want a good browser so let's get out of
that okay let's jump into settings now
so we're going to go up to lock here and
we're going to talk about that the
gesture panel on how you add different
things to it here we have the on-screen
keyboard I want to talk about that in a
second if you don't feel like using the
hardware keyboard here you can use the
on-screen keyboard let's go over to
gesture and here's the list of gestures
I've got set up and what you can quite
simply do is you can remove one of these
you can only have two four six seven at
a time so if i delete calendar i have
the opportunity to add another quite
simply you select from the drop-down
list of programs if you want to open
excel mobile you can assign a letter to
it let's say e click done and then if
you go back to the gesture pad and do
this you will be able to if you prep if
you do an e you'll be able to launch its
own mobile okay so let's check out the
other settings here we can go to items
on the today's screening you'll see
there are no items we can add beyond the
really standard stuff there is no custom
interface here the LG has added you get
the simple windows default today screen
of course we can change some colors here
we can change the theme to rock and
republic
black here which should give you a
different home screen look the bottom
bar changes in color a little bit so
nice a little way to spruce things up
and go into system let's take a look at
how much memory we have as I said
there's 211 megabytes of RAM in use I've
got a lot I've only had I only have
forty two megabytes of free ram here so
if I open up a few more programs going
to start slowing down a little bit
storage card there is no storage card
installed of course we can change the
backlight settings we can have it be on
automatic screen brightness typical
windows mobile stuff there really isn't
that many things in here that are
special here are the settings for the
sensors accelerometer is on all the time
so in any screen it will go into
landscape swipe over to the right the
luminosity sensor which the light sensor
is turned on in the proximity sensor
which determines if your head is near
the phone while you're on a call is also
turned on so very basic settings here
nothing really interesting to speak of
we go into connections likewise standard
wireless manager skin that you get in
Windows Mobile okay let me show you the
on-screen keyboard before concluding the
software review here and a lot of
programs open here some of them don't
close so go into office mobile word make
a new document and say this is not the
best experience this is a test of the
keyboard because the screen isn't isn't
that sensitive it's very tough to type
on this on-screen keyboard which makes
me grateful that it has this keyboard
over here so that
a little bit easier with the hardware
keys so overall it looks like LG really
didn't put much effort into customizing
the LG fathom it's a very vanilla
installation of windows mobile 6.5 point
3 practically out of the box without any
really enhancements or customizations
that may be a good thing for you if you
like things like and clean but it may
not be a good thing for you if you like
to have a kind of better experience with
some eye candy and some nice usability
enhancements I really enjoy the
lockscreen function with the gesture pad
I think that's extremely helpful in
being able to quickly launch programs
without having to unlock your device so
points for that but I still say if
you're on Verizon and you want a device
with a slide-out keyboard that's running
windows and mobile the touch pro 2 is
definitely the way to go in fact it's
half the price of the LG fathom there's
really no reason not to go with that
we'll have the full review coming up
soon on pocketnow.com with battery tests
and performance remarks and things like
that be sure to follow us on Twitter for
