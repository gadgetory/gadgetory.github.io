pocket now calm and in this video I want
to show you the evolution of the HTC
keyboard starting back with the touch
pro and going to the future HTC keyboard
coming out on touchflo 3d 2.5 and this
is a test rom so we're going to go
through that in a minute so if you
remember the first on-screen keyboards
that came out from HTC they were a huge
improvement of what there was before if
you remember before the HTC keyboards
they had this the standard keyboard
which was kind of like the stylus
keyboard that was really difficult to
use it wasn't optimized for finger
friendly operation and then they came
out with the much-improved three
different keyboard the phone keypad
which was actually like 89 style keypad
and then we have the compact qwerty
which was really great it was a
blackberry sure type like style keyboard
so you could not have to press each
button individually was good for people
with bigger thumbs then we have the full
qwerty keyboard which was really
terrific in tapping out messages you can
turn on and off t nine so they can do
text prediction and of course you have
to get used to each and every keyboard
and I haven't been practicing on this
keyboard and this was pretty good but
HTC improved that a lot with the
keyboard on the touch pro 2 and the taja
diamond 2 and here we have the new
keyboard which had a new arrangement of
keys so the kids were more centered they
were a little bit larger because they
took away some things on the screen they
made an additional row down here because
the touch diamond2 on the touch pro to
do not have D pad so that you could use
these buttons here to kind of move the
cursor around on the screen they also
made a little bit easier to switch
between xt9 and ABC and they also added
haptic feedback so that when you type
you get a little bit of a vibration and
it feels much better so let's take a
look at the newest keyboard that's
coming out on future devices this will
likely launch on future HTC devices like
the Firestone and the white stone but it
may be coming on the diamond to and the
touch pro 2 when they get their windows
mobile 6.5 updates and if we take a look
at the new HTC keyboard you see a me
that they removed the directional pad
buttons which actually gives you more
room on the screen makes sense to hide
these away I think they found that users
weren't using these buttons too much so
now they are relocated to this button
here if you tap on this button and you
actually tap it again or actually I
think it's at a pinhole there it's a tap
and hold you get an extra row of icons
that will let you use the d-pad buttons
now off also that what is different is
that if you start typing the autosuggest
takes on a different form it's actually
a lot more elegant that then you get on
the the odor keyboard so if I start
typing I get this strip here which again
takes up room on the screen this one
goes up a little bit higher and you can
tap on the word that makes sense to you
and so overall a lot of little small
changes that overall makes the
experience much better the on-screen
keyboards on some devices like the HTC
touch HD and the touch diamond2 are
extremely important because they don't
have a slide out keyboard like the touch
pro or the touch pro 2 so that's a quick
look at the new keyboard coming out on
HTC touch flo 3d 2.5 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
