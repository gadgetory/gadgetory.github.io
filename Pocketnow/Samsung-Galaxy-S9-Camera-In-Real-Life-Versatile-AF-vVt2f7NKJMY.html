reimagine to describe the best attribute
of your new smartphone it means that it
provides an awesome unique way to bring
consumers with better photography that
is a bold statement and I am in the
boldest City to prove that I'm high
memory better with pocket now and let's
see what the Galaxy S 9 and Galaxy S
line plus can do from the beautiful city
of New York
so keep in mind our final review of the
galaxy s 9 plus is already live with our
verdict on photography and a ton of
things but we had so many questions over
the differences with the galaxy s 9 that
the awesome folks at B&amp;amp;H hooked us up
with a unit and this video is mostly
going to focus on the differences which
aren't really significant so what makes
this camera special is that I would
consider it to be the most versatile in
the market usually every smartphone in
its primary camera has a fixed aperture
a galaxy s 9 has a very neat party trick
where the camera aperture varies
depending on the situation of you're in
auto mode it goes to F 2.4 aperture if
you're in bright sunlight and then if
you're in the dark scenario it goes all
the way up to F 1.5 which is the
brightest aperture in a smartphone
available to date and then if you go for
the galaxy s 9 plus you have the
advantage of a secondary 12 megapixel
camera that will provide you with both
portrait photography and also a zoom
lens a 2 X optical zoom and then there's
the advantage of all the software
Samsung is one of my favorites when it
comes to all the modes that are included
not a lot of gimmicks it is mostly
focused on providing you with added
advantages to get your job done Pro Mode
being one of my favorites again because
of its versatility so now we've covered
the basics let's talk about the photos I
think that they are awesome they're
gorgeous I think it's no secret that
Samsung has been killing it with
photography since the Galaxy Note 4 the
company has really invested in providing
vibrant photos there's one of those
smartphones that I recommend heavily for
regular auto photography during the day
just point and shoot and let the phone
do all the magic in the background great
color saturation and detail and since
you've stopped that f2 point for
aperture during the day in auto mode you
can also get really close the subjects
and get some more detail as bokeh was
extremely aggressive and past variance
in my opinion
now switching to the Galaxy S line plus
you have the advantage of the telephoto
lens which pretty much mimics a good 50
millimeter for street photography if
that's your thing also you have the 2 X
optical zoom
I'm not really a fan of the digital zoom
at 10x it's really blurry not really
usable but one thing that I do like is
the portrait photography I'm not saying
that it's the best but the advantage of
live photos is that after you take the
shot if you don't like the result you
could just go back to the previous photo
without it or you can even dial down the
effect or dial it up depending on your
needs and then in the case of night
photography I have to say this phone is
great for the most part if you notice in
our review of the galaxy s 9 plus we
notice great vibrance color in detail
but then it had some problems with
moving subjects and well after a couple
of software updates we haven't really
noticed much of a change the fellas are
really synchronized well and well that's
when manual controls are available for
those of you that want to use that you
can fix the shutter speed if you want to
but again that's in Pro Mode and then
video recording the galaxy s 9 is
actually one of the phones that I
recommend the most for this I mean all
the street photography in this video was
actually filmed on the galaxy as line
and s9 plus great stabilization and well
all the specification is that you get 4k
at 60 frames per second 240 frames per
second slow-mo at 1080p and then 960
frames per second at 720p if that's your
thing and well even if I'm not really a
fan of the field of view of the selfie
video it is really great again because
of the stabilization provided now those
of you that know me know I'm not a fan
of selfie photos but I will say that
this is pretty much my favorite phone
for the task but I think it has a lot to
do with the specifications F 1.7
aperture and 8 megapixels is really good
in most cases particularly in low-light
I feel this phone provides the widest
and the best amount of detail in the
shot again this is my particular
preference no selfie expert here
overall I think it's clear why I
recommend this as probably one of the
best bones of 2018 it's got the most
versatile camera the one that I would
trust in most point-and-shoot scenarios
obviously it's not perfect it's got
things that could be improved but let us
know in the comments what are your
thoughts about the galaxy as 9 and
galaxy as 9 plus friends that's it for
another episode of smart phone cameras

about this concept in the comments down
