are already a hit we go hands on Apple's
new phone and tell you all about it and
serious side from being revolutionary
also works on old hardware all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi Nevada and welcome to the pocket
nail I review the show we go through all
this week school and then not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off of what's cool
apple's iphone 4s pre-orders went live
on scheduled on october 7th and to the
surprise of many of us in the tech world
Apple broke another record for every 11
million iphones were sold on just the
first day alone and the new guys in town
sprint well they couldn't be happier
with record sales store sales also
surprised on october fourteenth as many
of us thought they weren't going to be
that crazy but phone lines were there
and boy were we wrong the good news is
that it seems that Apple did make enough
iPhones to satisfy the needs of
everybody so at least everybody went
home happy with enough iPhones that
Sally doesn't include me because well
the iphone 4s unlocked version is not
available online yet until november but
hey apparently some people have already
been to Apple stores and they've been
able to get unlocked iPhones carrier
unlocked iPhones on the Apple stores if
they request for it so don't take my
word for it go to a store and let's see
if you can get one iOS 5 was also
released to the public and on schedule
on October twelfth my personal surprise
even though I was rocking the latest old
gold master candidate in the beta
program was the fact that once I updated
to the official version of iOS 5 my
iphone 4 was faster than it was in the
past with the gold master candidate
makes you wonder if the iphone 4s is
really worth it for some people being
that the iphone 4 is actually performing
quite well with the current iOS 5 update
our cloud was also released for the mac
and just about everybody else and yeah
we still have to wait for iTunes Match
by the end of this month so so far
releases are up to date and things are
working quite well so far at least for
almost everybody and you bet our own
branded minuman has already begun his
round
reviews for the iphone 4s and so far
he's impressed with the camera quality
which is apparently superb Siri was also
surprisingly useful even though the
speed of the device wasn't that really
mind-blowing on launching Syrian just
about everything have you compared to
the iphone for now the data download
speeds were really quite well on AT&amp;amp;T we
were able to test it on Washington State
and also in Pennsylvania and things seem
to be working really well stay tuned for
more review videos from Brandon and
later has also comparisons to the top
notch Android and Windows Phone
offerings in the ER in the area so let's
see who wins and with all the software
releases developers have already crowded
our app stores with their updates to be
able to support iOS 5 absolute basic got
a complete revamp and are actually even
more useful and faster with the new iOS
5 now find my friends and cards the new
apple applications are out there already
and Apple already released an airport
utility application that allows you to
control airport base stations like the
time capsule with your iOS device iTunes
movie trailers are now also live
bringing new things to Apple iOS devices
now if Apple were ever able to consider
us and allow us to use that airport
utility application TV to be able to
back up our OS devices wirelessly for
those of us that owned a time capsule
now that would be hot and what would an
iOS 5 release be without our need to
jailbreak it I mean Siri was also
recently pointed to the iphone 4 so give
them a couple of days to figure that out
because it seems it's not really working
that well and actually makes your iPhone
sluggish but give them a couple of weeks
and well you can also now be able to
jailbreak your iOS 5 device through
redsnow with a recent update that the
dev team provided now sadly it would not
allow you to jailbreak your iphone 4s or
an ipad 2 and currently it only works
tethered so give these guys a couple of
weeks remember the iphone 4s has just
been released and will it took him a
while to figure out how to jailbreak the
ipad 2 so time will tell
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool with so many
iphones being launched so many people
leaving happy from the stores and so
many people being impressed with siri
you know wonder what could go wrong but
while we all remember the late Steve
Jobs mocking how the mobileme launch was
a disappointment because well now you
might ask why should I believe them
they're the ones that brought me mobile
me it wasn't our finest hour let me just
say that but we learned a lot we could
say that app will learn their lesson but
sadly it seems that I cloud is not that
perfect so far Apple servers were on
their knees with the launch of the
pre-orders for the iphone they were also
on their knees when people were
beginning to update their iOS 5 devices
to iOS 5 obviously some people were not
even able to finish the update and ended
up with temporary bricks and while other
people are already complaining about the
fact that well it seems that Apple's not
really preparing themselves because I
cloud is also failing at times not
really sure what to expect from Apple
iTunes Match has not even been released
people are not even i'm not even
updating or uploading their songs to
itunes and so far things don't seem to
work i mean hopefully Apple will figure
it out eventually probably for the
iphone 6 though come on Apple the iphone
5 new version are iCloud and figure it
out you've invested so much on the cloud
and it's still not working anyways
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm primarily
leto remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
