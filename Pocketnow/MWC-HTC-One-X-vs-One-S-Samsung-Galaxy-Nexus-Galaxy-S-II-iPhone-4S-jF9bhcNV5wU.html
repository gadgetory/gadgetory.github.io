pocketnow.com and we're going to make a
comparison between flagship smartphones
obviously we now have the HTC One X and
we're going to compare it to the 1s this
is the flagship phone this is sort of
the mid-tier phone but still I mean this
one's got the aluminum this is
polycarbonate it's kind of weird to know
which one's better aside from the fact
that the specs ear are much better than
here first of all there's a little bit
of a bigger than mice you wider
definitely we've got a 720p display here
and we've got a qHD display here we've
got a 1.3 megapixel camera front VGA
here obviously thinner I mean they are
just as thin this the 1s is actually a
little thinner than the One X but it's
because of this design aspect that it
has at the bottom then we've got both 8
megapixel cameras with single LED
flashes we've got the docking station
holes here for the One X that we don't
have on the one is kind of weird I don't
think this device can be docked as you
can with the 1x sadly we don't nobody
has a 1 B 2 key barriers we're sorry
about that but so far this is definitely
a larger device if we if you would ask
me about construction quality I tell you
I mean this is a machine polycarbonate
body looks really good you can't remove
the battery it looks well fish but
obviously this aluminum feels high
quality both feel good but this one is a
little bit lighter feels a little bit on
the cheap side but still both a really
good phone so aside from that well now
that we've got the 1x in hand let's
compare it to other flagship sparknotes
smartphones
got the galaxy nexus here definitely
well hey there just a stall interesting
we've got 720p this place here obviously
the ACC displays a little bit this way
to the time it's almost the same size as
playing here and then we'll notice those
back together okay they're just this
wide I mean definitely the Galaxy Nexus
is just a tad with McDermott we can
barely notice it they're both just just
all week you can probably see that HTC's
designers probably weapon solid galaxy
mex is owned and said hey let's make a
phone that looks just as solid just
about everything but it's pretty much
the same phone there
really nice obviously the display the
720p display HTC Sense is actually
displayed better on the HTC One X then
on the Galaxy Nexus so move that aside
galaxy s2 is definitely a little bit got
one x is definitely taller it's I don't
know this one's a little bit thinner but
it's only because of the slimness here
but then we've got the hump here that
actually kills it and then this one is
obviously a little bit taller let's look
at the displays this one's a beautiful
display this one's obviously a little
bit of dims but still wvga 720p so
obviously resolution here's a lot better
and let's look at the iphone for us now
obviously this is a dwarf compared to
the one exit the One X is definitely a
taller device let's see
obviously a lot taller obviously a lot
lighter how about if we do a pocketable
test let's see what the 1x is light
I can take it definitely listen right in
the market it doesn't look that big in
the pokey to run the 1x looks actually
get in the pocket let's try the 1s this
door I'm going to run with okay the
other ones okay look good in the parkin
we can try to compare that with the one
with the iphone 4
you can still notice the phones either
phone so obviously it depends on your
taste the One X and the 1s are both
great devices so far I'm every veteran
Tony on camera Lucien getting coffee
here at parking i'll comment you see HTC
thank you very much to the demo come on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
