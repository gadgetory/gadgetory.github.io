separate devices this is one device
iPhone today Apple is going to reinvent
the phone 11 years of iPhone has sure
come a long way some of you may
criticize iPhones all you want but it's
really hard to deny how much one product
has impacted the world as we know it
we've evolved from people reading
newspapers on the subway to lots of time
spent on our phones and not just for
communication it's fun new companies
it's driven the death of those who were
late to change it's created new
industries and boy has it gained
competitors so 11 years later and now
crowned us one of the most expensive
phones money can buy what's it like to
use a $1,000 phone as your daily driver
I'm Heidi that I'm with pocket now and
this is our full review of the iPhone
10s brought to you by the geniuses over
a Twix
my phones are loved for a few key
essentials that Apple has nailed ever
since the days of the Mac they have
great taste in design their products are
easy to use and even if they don't do
everything that other competitors do
what they do they do right at least for
the most part when it comes to the
iPhone 10 s i partially give it praise
for its design I really love the form
factor concept of a large display on a
phone I can handle with one hand I'm a
huge fan of its stainless steel finish
meant by glass on each side the new gold
color has really grown on me I've
noticed that does a better job at
looking clean when compared to last year
Space Gray the only problem is just how
sad it is for this elegant designed to
be marred by the protruding camera hump
that loves to wobble on a table and how
the notch interrupts the otherwise
border-to-border display I even find
that funny how Apple's new line of
wallpapers focuses on hiding their own
creation just to prove that they're not
really proud of it
everything else about this super Retina
display is fantastic it's being praised
as one of the best displays of the year
and I agree it's really hard to balance
an OLED the way Apple does and in ways
where colors pop without being
overbearing and these speakers just make
the content consumption experience more
immersive my phones have never been
famous for topping the spec sheet but
this one is an exception I mean Apple's
812 Bionic is currently the most
advanced mobile processor thanks to it 7
an ohmmeter architecture and it's
complemented by 4 gigs of RAM options
that range from 64 to 512 gigs of
storage we have a 20-6 58 milliamp hour
battery Qi wireless charging and I'd be
68 water and dust resistance yes it is
fast charging capable but you won't get
it out of the box so that's an extra 75
dollars combined along with another 10
dollars for the headphone dongle since
it also wasn't included in the box
as for ease of use Apple wins all the
points in my book complain all you want
about iOS but it continues to be the
most practical paradigm on how to
control a phone I'm not saying that I'm
a fan of the grid of icons on the home
screen but let's face it even computers
remain focused on this approach and it's
been more than three decades now and
consumers seem to prefer its simplicity
iOS 12 is a very refreshing and needed
update to how the phone should work it's
made even older iPhones faster so
obviously the iPhone 10's flies through
any tasks with ease
there wasn't really any update to be
wowed about and yes that means I
honestly don't care about things like
the moji what I do enjoy our features
like screen time and all the new
enhancements and the Do Not Disturb
feature I didn't really mention the
analogy of newspapers to phone in a
positive way at the beginning of this
video
people really need time off their phones
and I love that you can now set ways for
your phone to help you out with that I
still find these to be the most
practical gestures for navigation and I
love that closing applications is now
simplified lockscreen notifications
being stacked up is also something that
took Apple forever to figure out but I'm
glad it's finally here about the only
thing left that I consider kind of
ridiculous is how control center is on
one side of the screen and then
notifications is on the other now when
it comes to doing less but doing it
right the iPhone 10s as a daily driver
is sadly not my favorite phone
connectivity is seriously a problem that
Apple needs to improve either by
ditching Intel modems or demanding that
they get better
obviously for users that don't ever use
anything other than an iPhone it's
really all you know but my experience
has been that whenever I'm far away from
a Wi-Fi router Android phones with
Qualcomm modems will have no trouble
remaining connected while this $1,000
iPhone 10s jumps back to LTE and forth
back to Wi-Fi and it's just really bad
and even in the case of data speeds
we've tested this device on 57th and 7th
in New York City but the t-mobile
network where speech should be stellar
and the iPhone 10s just gets ridiculed
by devices like the one
see like seriously so much for claiming
gigabit LTE if only Android phones with
Qualcomm modems are able to deliver and
the same goes for battery life I mean
the iPhone 10s has a slightly smaller
power pack than its predecessor which
makes sense given the new processors
architecture sadly even if Apple claimed
slight improvements I don't really see
them I actually find myself connecting
to a battery pack more often than I did
before about the only thing left of
praises performance on our iPhone 10
comparison it was clear that this ship
launches games faster though gameplay is
pretty much the same now another thing
that I will have to praise is the camera
I was not a fan of the iPhone 10 but
Apple has really done some improvements
of the hardware now with a 12 megapixel
primary shooter at F 1.8 aperture 1.4
microns and a 26 millimeter equivalent
plus a 12 megapixel telephoto camera at
F 2.4 aperture and 52 millimeter
equivalent both with oh is and face
detection autofocus we also have
computational photography being
introduced with a smarter version of HDR
sort of like what we have on the pixel
the results are great I'm not saying
they're significantly better when
compared to Android flagships but I do
consider Apple to have finally caught up
great saturation and detail on photos
though I do have to say the iPhone sent
us photos are actually warmer that makes
them more pleasing to the eye but
certain lighting can bring challenges to
the results low-light has definitely
improved with far less noise and really
good results when it comes to moving
subjects now portrait mode may be out of
beta and paper but like in the case of
all competitors this is hit or miss I
still find iPhones to struggle with hair
but at least you now have the option to
reduce or even remove the background
blur after the shot is taken which can
actually save a bad shot when needed I
still consider the selfie camera to be
just too cropped in and even more for
portrait shots Beauty gate was
definitely an issue before iOS 12.1 but
that clearly got fixed recently so sad
for me that was actually making me look
younger
when it comes to video this is my camera
of choice ask even a B camera for
reviews great civilization without any
sort of warping fantastic dynamic range
speeded focusing and versatile 4k video
at 60 frames per second making this
camera just ideal in addition to stereo
audio finally I wish I could say the
same about the selfie camera with its
horrible crop for video but I do
appreciate the stabilization even if I
feel it needs to take a bump from 1080p
while we reach our conclusion let me
interrupt this video for just 30 seconds
to tell you about our sponsor Wix if
you're interested in creating a
professional website blog or online
store without any coding knowledge Wix
offers an insane portfolio of tools for
you to design something that's right for
you and it's all drag-and-drop which is
so practical or you can choose any of
the hundreds of templates they offer
learn more about Wix in the link in the
description below to conclude let me
just say that there are many reasons why
the iPhone 10s will continue to be in my
pocket for a bit I still consider it to
be the adequate size for a phone without
compromising on the ideal of providing
users with a large display yes it's not
entirely perfect but it does a good job
and most of the things that matter to me
and then there's the ecosystem paradigm
or Apple Excel s'en like for example I
prefer Final Cut Pro for editing my
videos which only works on a Mac I
record the pocket now with daily on a
microphone that requires a lightning
connector and then features like iCloud
airdrop and others truly make it
valuable to own an iPhone and for it to
talk to these other products that plus
the fact that the Apple watch series 4
is one of my favorite smartwatches of
the year and which only works on an
iPhone as well and you know where my
argument is going for a guy like me the
iPhone 10s is convenient even if I know
that it's not the best smartphone of
2018 for those of you who are not locked
into this ecosystem it's hard for me to
recommend this phone for its price $1000
for a phone that isn't the best in
connectivity and battery life is just a
hard sell Apple simply has no excuse in
providing mediocre performance in the
most essential features even cheap
phone should do right and then tax hi
with the price for those of you who
don't have a specific reason to want an
iPhone honestly I would say that there
are some better options out there to
consider and for the rest of you the
iPhone 10s is just the better iPhone let
