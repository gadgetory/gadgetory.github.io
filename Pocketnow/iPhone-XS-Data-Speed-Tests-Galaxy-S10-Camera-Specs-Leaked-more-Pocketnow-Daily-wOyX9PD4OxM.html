out and it can sure hang out with the
best but not really beat them some
renders of the oneplus 60 have just
emerged and really there are no secrets
left here and for those of you that want
to pre-order the BlackBerry key to Ellie
it is finally up I'm Jaime Rivera and
waking up early in the morning filming
this video because I have a crazy day of
things I have to see is awesome this is
PocketNow daily sponsored by swap up the
official news today begin with deals to
a certain degree for those of you that
are looking to buy yourself a blackberry
but struggle to buy the key to because
it's too expensive the key to Ellie is
now available for pre-order is on Amazon
for $450 definitely a watered down
version of the key to and we're still
waiting on our unit to tell you if we
recommend it or not but you can learn
more about it in the description now
let's talk about rumors of the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 as we get more information
on the camera specifications from I
don't know we could call them trusted
sources or not but it turns out that the
primary camera might be the same one
that we currently have variable aperture
and 12 megapixels and then we've got two
more a 16 megapixel F 1.9 aperture wide
angle and a 13 megapixel F 2.4 telephoto
what are the plans for the cameras and
the array and the design is hard to tell
or if all phones are getting it all so
but hey sounds cool so far now let's
talk about Google as there are some
leaks of a new Smart TV feature if we
can call it a feature because it's
literally just the Google home Mini and
the chromecast that are going to be
bundled as part of some sort of a deal
or a project that the company is working
on that we might be getting soon the
rumors claims this is going to be
launched in Walmart exclusively so I
don't have my hopes into this being
anything awesome but still we're close
to the Google event so we'll see what we
get now let's talk about the oneplus 60
oh my god I don't know how many more
renders we can take about this phone
definitely the second most leaked photo
of the year we see the teardrop design
and final renders and it looks legit it
looks literally like the oneplus 6 in
the back without a fingerprint scanner
which could just be a Photoshop job as
well you know
but then the front obviously looks like
the Oppo f9 with the teardrop design and
everything looks really cool definitely
we're close to a possible event we're
still waiting on those states I'll keep
you posted
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with iPhones the iPhone 10s
doesn't seem to be as great when it
comes to gigabit LTE speeds and the
funny part is I'm saying this right now
and I've actually already tested it I'm
currently working on a video to show it
to you it was asked it's actually not
that sort of a video more of a
comparison where yes we'd take an iPhone
10 an iPhone 10s and a samsung galaxy
note 9 and yes the iPhone 10's beats the
iPhone 10 but then the Galaxy Note 9
just annihilates everything just
destroys it very badly up to the point
where it makes me wonder I mean like
seriously Apple our Intel modems making
you look good or not I'd say they're
making you look really bad there's no
the comments down below what do you
think I mean do you think that it's
worth to pay 1000 plus dollars for a
phone that won't give you the best data
speeds cuz in my opinion no leave us a
comment down below with a pen of yours
and folks we would like to thank our
sponsor swap ax for making this video

has discontinued some of our favorite
