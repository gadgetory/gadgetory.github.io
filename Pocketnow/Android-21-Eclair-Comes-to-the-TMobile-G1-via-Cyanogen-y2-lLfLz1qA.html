with a special first look at what
everybody's been wanting for an awfully
long time its Android 2.1 Eclair running
on the t-mobile g1 yes it's finally been
done and I'm going to show you how to do
it so the first thing I've got this is
my wife's t-mobile g1 I've already gone
ahead and unlocked it and rood it did
that long ago and I have just now using
the rod dream the 1.6.2
recovery ROM I've gone in and done an
Android backup so just in case something
goes terribly terribly wrong I can get
her back up to where she was before I
started all this without any problem at
all so what I've done is of course
booted up into recovery mode to do that
on the g1 the way you do that is you
shut down the phone power it up using
the power button then hold down the home
button until you're brought up into your
recovery menu so you can see here I've
just completed the back up I am going to
come down to flash zip from sdcard and I
have placed that on the SD card it's
called update CM five point zero point
seven DS test one important thing to
note this is an experimental ROM it is
not a final release ROM as of the time
of this video it's not available via the
CM updater that may change but for now
you have to download it directly from
dub dub dub cyanogen mod dot-com and
I'll have links to that in the article
that accompanies this video
so from here we've got that selected and
I'm going to press the scroll button and
it asks if I want to do that remember
this is a g1 so I have to press the home
button to confirm and it says that it's
installing from the SD card finding the
update opening the update verifying the
update and it's going on and doing its
thing this is probably going to take a
few
minutes so I'll let it complete and
we'll be right back okay
install from sd card is complete that
process took right around three minutes
so not too bad if you haven't done
anything out of the ordinary you're
probably good to reboot at this point if
you've done an awful lot of
customizations and whatnot or
specifically if you're not coming from
CyanogenMod four point two point fifteen
point something you may want to go ahead
and wipe it the article the cyanogen
posted said that you don't need to wipe
if you're coming from four point to
point fifteen point one so I'm not going
to we're going to see how that works
instead we're just going to select menu
option one which is reboot system now go
ahead and do that and let's see what she
does first thing is we've got our
t-mobile g1 boot screen this is where
you start biting your fingernails and
waiting to see how everything's going
this screen can last for several minutes
it might just be there for 30 seconds
and go away but don't be terribly
concerned if it sticks around for quite
awhile that's perfectly normal when
you're going from one room to another
ROM it's got to do a lot of housekeeping
and I could get into a lot of technical
details about everything that it does
but suffice it to say
cyanogen and the rest of the people who
contribute to this ROM are geniuses in
what they do to go through and optimize
the way the packages are loaded to place
things into various different folders
whether it's system app system data
system cache how they've got the the
dalvik caching set up the the tweaks
that they have to the kernel the kernel
that's being used in fact cyanogen says
that the kernel being used here which I
believe is 0.33 adds significantly to
the speed of the device and his first
impression was that running this ROM is
faster than running the 4.2 point 15 ROM
which is impressive
that was a pretty quick rom especially
for this phone which now the g1 is it's
old as far as technology goes we've had
an awful lot of updates to hardware to
to processors the amount of RAM just a
lot of progress has happened since the
g1 came out and to know that we've gone
from Android 1.5 when the t1 excuse me
that t-mobile g1 first came out and
other of the HTC dream series all the
way through 1.6 and now jumping up to
2.1 and still being able to run most of
the things that are built in to 2.1
we'll see here what's what's been left
out but that's just impressive that
speaks a lot not only a hardware that's
in these phones but also in all hard
work that the developers the in the
independent community are putting into
developing the Android OS the Android
platform you know this isn't something
that t-mobile is saying hey let's put
this all together and let's pay these
guys you know they're not on the payroll
of Google or t-mobile or any other
carrier most of these guys are doing it
in their spare time which really speaks
a lot to their character so if you find
value in this I'm going to put in a plug
to visit their websites and click on any
ads that you feel are relevant to what
you might be looking for or if they've
got a donate button go ahead and donate
five ten bucks to them for their efforts
just in appreciation for what they do
the more you donate to them the more
that you voice your appreciation the
more likely they are to continue their
development processes and to keep
delivering good stuff that you and I use
so back to the process here you see
we've got the Android animated logo this
is the cyanogen logo I really like it
it's got a little cyanogen Android guy
on a skateboard waving at you and you've
got this reflection animation going
across the Android word if that doesn't
show up in the video that lets you know
that it's still thinking it's still
doing its thing and like I
before this process usually takes
several minutes so to spare you that
time we're going to use the magic of
video and skip all that and I'll be back
when I've got something fun to show you
okay so about another two three minutes
has passed since the last time I left
you and no problems at all and we're met
with the Android 2.1 lockscreen that
lets you easily mute or unmute and
unlock your phone
this is behaving just a little bit
sluggish but with an older processor I'd
expect that I also haven't waited too
long at that loading screen so it's
probably still running through some
processes in the background if we look
we've got the cyanogen style drawer
which we can grab a pull up you'll
notice this is not the advanced drawer
like I come stock with 2.1 the Star Wars
style drawer is just the traditional one
which I think is most likely for speed
this obviously doesn't have your 3d
hardware acceleration built in just has
the regular 2d stuff so for speed it's
probably not doing that you can still
see here even with home screens that are
pretty loaded up with widgets and apps
it's not too bad the responsiveness is
pretty good and see what else we have go
ahead and open up the browser here
and it's firing up Google not too bad
now what I like to show you here is the
buzz icon in the stock browser you don't
have access to this at least not the
last time I checked because it doesn't
support html5 all that well the browser
that comes with the Nexus One does show
the widget or the the panel if you will
in the web browser this is showing it
just fine so it looks like the web
browser is all up to speed with the the
latest and greatest stuff so that is
really cool let's go in and look at the
gallery that's one of the things that
everybody likes so we'll come in and
look at it and you'll notice here this
sure looks like it's the 3d gallery that
comes with the Nexus it's got your tip
and your tilt it's got the tiles that
fly in so that's really cool it's still
got your camera icon in the corner real
time test here let's see how camera
works picture works just well that was
kind of interesting a little bit of a
video anomaly there but the picture did
take successfully you can see there's
the tabletop that I just took so we're
good to go
go in and open up the settings and
everything looks good there
flip over to camcorder look at the
settings there well so far so good let's
go back out home and let's take a look
now at our settings to see exactly what
this phone is doing now you'll notice
here this is also got the the 2.1 style
settings i'm going to go into a bow
phone just to see it is an HTC dream
firmware version is to point
one update one it is running colonel two
point six point three three point three
CyanogenMod and the mod version is
CyanogenMod five point zero point seven
- DS - test one so there you go folks
you can now run Android 2.1 with all of
the android 2.1 widgets that you want
all the apps that didn't run on your old
Android running one point six you can
now do that on your t-mobile g1 so I'll
first look at the test one beta release
experimental release of CyanogenMod rom
5.0 point seven for the t-mobile g1 this
