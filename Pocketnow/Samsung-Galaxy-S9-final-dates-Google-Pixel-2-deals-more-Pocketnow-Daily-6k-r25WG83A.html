we get closer to a possible event eight
the vivo fingerprint scanner phone
finally gears up to becoming official
and oneplus seems to be having trouble
getting payments lately I'm Jaime Rivera
and I'm still in New Orleans because the
weather has become so crazy that haven't
been able to fly out this is PocketNow
daily the official news today finally
finally begin with deals if you're in
the market for the Google pixel tour
pixel to excel probably some of our
favorite phones of 2017
currently the pixel to is $200 off on
Best Buy and then $250 off for the pixel
to excel as well
if you're asking what the catch is well
these are the Verizon variants and you
have to get them on installments you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about one plus for those of you
that have been having trouble trying to
buy your one plus 5t which is a another
product that we recommend you buy seems
the company has been dealing with some
issues with fraudulent charges up to the
point where the company has decided to
better yet stall what's going on and
allow users to only be able to buy
phones on PayPal so this is a cool
precaution the company's taken just stay
tuned as we will cover more information
as soon as everything gets fixed
as we move the spotlight over to Sony we
have been waiting for a Sony Xperia
flagship the company didn't really
deliver in the last couple of years and
now that we've seen what they can do as
of CES 2018 we hear that there is an X Z
pro smartphone and whoever comes up with
these names but still the most important
part is that apparently this flagship
phone will bring a 4k display that's
OLED and apparently some other really
good specifications to the camera stay
tuned now for those of you that have a
pencil and paper write this down
vivo X 20 plus UD apparently that phone
that we saw at CES with the fingerprint
scanner from synaptics and the display
that is going to be the final name which
I already forgot I'm gonna have to
practice it again but yeah apparently
that's gonna be the final name the phone
is already in certification attina
so it's only a matter of time before the
phone launches the only problem is we
hear that it's only going to launch and
so hopefully this technology makes it to
other phones made by other companies
that work in the same Factory Oppo
oneplus yes thank you and finally the
very hot news today have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 and galaxy s 9 plus
we've been dealing with specs and other
important information but for those of
you that are wondering the dates get
this 26 of February for the possible
event date which is pretty much the
first day of MWC and busted own that
makes sense
then three orders apparently will begin
on March 1st and you can get your phone
as soon as March 16 now bear in mind
lunch time frames for Samsung galaxys
have usually been around April I think
this is probably like the earliest that
galaxy has ever been launched which is
great but at least we to the question
today I mean are you going to gear up
and wait for that Galaxy as Niner are
you looking to any other phones that
have currently been launched in my case
I can't wait to see what the Galaxy S 9
plus is going to be like with those dual
cameras but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

news early or follow us I'm talking
