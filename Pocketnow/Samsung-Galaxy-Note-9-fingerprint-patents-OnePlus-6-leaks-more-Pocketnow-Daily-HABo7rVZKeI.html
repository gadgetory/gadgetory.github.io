display fingerprint sensor that might
come to the Galaxy Note 9 the LG G 7
might not reach all US carriers as what
we get is a teaser for another phone and
Apple might let you get fast charging
out of the box at least next year I'm
Jaime Rivera and may the 4th be with you
and if you don't understand what that
means where have you been the last 30
years this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for the razor phone
even with all the problems of that phone
had with its camera a lot of software
updates have fixed it we have a review
unit I know I owe you a review we'll get
it to you soon but most important it's
no longer an exclusive to the Microsoft
Store you can now get it at Best Buy and
it's $100 off if you get it at Best Buy
you can learn more about it in the
description there are ton of things that
are great about this phone now let's
talk about Apple as one of the ironies
of the iPhone 10 an iPhone 8 is that
they're fast charging capable but they
don't include
anything in the box and if you want to
go fast charging with Apple products
you'll pretty much have to cough like 75
bucks
but according to some rumors that we're
not gonna call from trusted sources this
time there will be an 18 watt adapter
being included in the box that's USBC
and then it's USB c2 lightning to the
phone apparently this will bring fast
charging bear in mind I've had to bring
10 watts and then I believe that
anything above that is 25 so great if it
happens but again the source not
necessarily something that we trust now
let's talk about the LG G 7 thank you
for those of you that are wondering
exactly when this phone is gonna reach
AT&amp;amp;T the company has just said that
they're not going to be retailing the g7
which is so weird cuz I always prefer
the AT&amp;amp;T variant of this phone
apparently AT&amp;amp;T has pretty much teased
that they're working on another phone
that will be launched soon yes
apparently it could happen with in June
or something and we're assuming that
that's going to be the V 30s or V 35
yeah it would be the v35 pretty much
let's see what the differences are now
let's talk about oneplus as we are
expecting the one plus six we can't wait
to hear what we get but we also know
that there will be an event
infinity war edition variant and there
are some leaks the problem is the
leagues are not of the phone necessarily
they are of the box of the Avengers
infinity war edition phone so yeah
the box is there I wonder exactly what
perks you're getting when you buy this
phone
hopefully it's a special color variant
or anything we'll keep you posted as
soon as we learn more and finally the
most interesting news today have to do
with Samsung and the Galaxy Note 9 as
there are now patents that pretty much
backed the technology that will enable
the on display fingerprint scanner that
will power the Galaxy Note 9 if you look
at the patterns they pretty much looked
like the vivo phone that we saw at CES
we're even hearing that the provider
might be synaptics as well so that's all
great it seems that both companies
finally figured out this whole combo but
I guess in today's question the most
important thing that I asked myself is
if you had to pick as a consumer either
or would you prefer Samsung to focus on
facial recognition or to focus their
guns more on the on display fingerprint
scanner because in my case to be fully
honest with you I would prefer that
Samson work on their facial recognition
there are cases like whenever it's
snowing where you want that thing to
work and it doesn't really work that
well at least not all the time or in all
scenarios and I would rather keep the
fingerprint scanner in the back as an
alternative but that would be me I mean
hey if well the company could figure
both out that'd be awesome
