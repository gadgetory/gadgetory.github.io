reviews Windows Phone Cortana and camera
questions and mulling the morality of
smartphone leaks that's just a sample of
the features that graced the dot-com
side of the house this week so let's
review them in five minutes or less I'm
Michael Fisher and this is pocket now
round up our first tablet reviews of
2014 are in the both reviews of
samsung's galaxy tabpro devices but
that's where the similarity ends find
out why Taylor Martin is impressed with
the performance of the Tab pro 8.4 while
I find quite a bit lacking in that of
the larger Tab pro 10.1 both reviews
along with every feature mentioned in
this video are linked in the description
below as is a shortcut to thursday's
pocket now weekly podcast which offers
around 20 minutes of samsung tablet
impressions and if you want more insight
into some of the larger problems with
google powered tablets that I think the
tab pro 10 dot one lays bare be sure to
catch my editorial on why large android
slates still aren't quite ready for
prime time shifting focus to attention
monger of the month HTC we have a
straggler editorial from last week that
was published too late to make the last
pocket now roundup deadlines in it
Taylor Martin pleads with HTC not to cut
corners on the mini version of the new
HTC One is it so infamously did for the
2013 installment Taylor it makes a
strong case that HTC has the opportunity
here to create something special a
pocketable high-end smartphone with a
price tag that doesn't make your heart
stop and speaking of the all new HTC One
it's easily the most leaked smartphone
of the year so far and maybe one of the
most leaked ever but is leaking it
morally wrong we touched a bit on this
matter in our interview with ewa leagues
on last week's podcast and this week
adam doubt shares his thoughts on the
murky mists of morality that the world
of leaked info represents speaking of
not that I'm currently playing halo 4 on
the xbox 360 and while it's not my
favorite game ever it has allowed me to
get better acquainted with the character
Cortana she's the basis for Microsoft's
new voice assistant for Windows Phone in
version 8.1 and if you don't pay close
enough attention to the rumors
surrounding her she might sound like
just another Siri or Google now knock
off well I wrote a piece on Monday
referencing earlier pieces from Adam
Lane and Adam doubt laying out the ways
Cortana could really bring something
compelling to the voice command space
and speaking of Windows Phone the
prolific Adam Dowd also wrote on the
matter of our beloved Hardware camera
button even though revised Microsoft
minimum requirements don't mandate it
Adams still fighting the good fight on
behalf of all those who love the old
dual-stage camera key and bringing us
home for the week Joe Levi the Android
guy he calls the launcher that ships
with the nokia X a hideous half Windows
monstrosity if you agree he provides a
quick primer on just how to change it
something that should come in handy for
all you folks planning on purchasing one
of Nokia's first Android phones and in a
separate piece of early speculation
surrounding the Nexus 6 Joe makes the
case for and against using a curved
screen for the next pure Google
smartphone and he's currently moderating
a fun debate over the merits of the
curve down in the comments go join in
while it's still civil many more
features comparisons and news pieces are
available at pocketnow.com folks but for
now we're at a time check the
