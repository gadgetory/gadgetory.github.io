several weeks and it's fine even though
I want to call it the XR that's not
technically correct so 10 R it is this
video is brought to you by the geniuses
at Wix the first thing I noticed about
the 10r was its thickness and weight
it's 17 grams heavier than the 10s and
point six millimeters thicker but it
feels much more bulky probably because
there is more weight towards the bottom
of the phone where's the tennis which is
symmetrically weighted the bezels on the
10r
are offensively large and remind me of a
phone from five years ago I will say
though that after using the phone for a
while you forget about the bezels but
when you put the 10 R next to the 10 s
the bezel size on the 10 R looks
ridiculous I was going to say that you
get what you pay for for the less
expensive iPhone but at 750 bucks you
can get a 1 + 60 or a Galaxy S 9 for
$200 less and have very slim bezels and
a much more modern design the 10 R comes
in several different colors I have the
most boring color white which has silver
sides while white probably does the best
job to deter fingerprints if you're
going to get the 10 are you might as
well pick a color other than white
because that's a lot more interesting I
personally think that the blue looks
very nice really all the colors look
great with their bright glass backs and
matte anodized aluminum science the
upshot to a heavier and thicker phone is
a bigger battery the 10 R has a 29:42
milliamp hour battery versus 26:58 on
the 10s and that's a difference of 11%
this extra capacity helps to compensate
for the bigger less efficient LCD on the
10 are rendering both phones with
similar battery life all else being
equal I was able to get through a day
with moderate use on both with about 20%
left after a 14-hour day while we're on
the topic of battery you've heard it
before the new iPhones are capable of
fast charging but include a slow charger
in the box so I'm not going to belabor
that it's very annoying but at least you
get wireless charging the 6.1 inch
display on the 10r is nice it's an LCD
screen and it is great color accuracy
and viewing angles and even the contrast
is really good even if not AMOLED good
but overall it's a terrific display it's
a little too big to be usable with one
hand but it's not as unwieldy as the
huge tennis max
although the footprint of the 10r is
about the same as the iPhone 8 plus yet
the screen is more than half an inch
bigger on the 10 are you get true tone
which I always turn off because it makes
the screen too warm in my opinion while
the display on the 10r doesn't get as
bright as a tennis it's still plenty
visible and bright outdoor light some
have lamented the display resolution on
the 10r which is 828 by 1792 versus 1125
by 2436 on the tennis but you know what
the pixel density is 326 on the 10 off
and as we know about phone screens
anything above 300 PPI is great and you
can't see pixels I have very good vision
and the 10r doesn't let you see pixels
even if you try really hard it's fine
face ID on the 10r is just as fast as it
is on the 10s thanks to the same sensor
system house within a notch
speaking of the knotch if you look
closely the notch on the 10r is actually
a tiny bit wider and taller than on the
10s but you're not going to notice that
unless you put the phone side-by-side
although the 10s and 10 are have largely
the same primary camera sensor the 10r
is worse in some situations especially
when it comes to low-light where the 10r
produce is soft sometimes noisy images
when you zoom in for detail of course
with no optical zoom on the 10r
you can't get closer to a subject
optically otherwise the photo quality is
about the same when lighting is ample
and for video the 10r can do 4k at 60 I
was also surprised at how good portrait
photos came out with a 10-hour single
camera system it kind of reminds me of a
pixel it just does a really good job
separating the background from the
foreground in terms of performance the
10r has the new 812 Bionic 7 nanometre
chip and it flies the only difference
between the 10r
and 10s in regards to performance is
that the 10s has 4 gigs of RAM whereas
the 10r has 3 but you won't notice this
in day-to-day use the 10r is IP rated
but at ip67 instead of 68 like the
tennis that means you can't submerge the
phone in water for as long as you can
the tennis which doesn't matter to most
people a few other test notes before we
wrap this up I found that the stereo
speakers on the 10 are to be some of the
best i've heard on any phone i'm pretty
certain that the audio is louder clearer
and wider than the tennis maybe because
it's a bigger phone and there's more
room for the sound to resonate with in
call quality and data speed on AT&amp;amp;T in
the philadelphia area or both terrific
something that really bugs me is that
the 10r lacks 3d touch and
you got used to it on previous model its
replacement haptic touch sucks it
doesn't work in the same places as 3d
touch and it's difficult to trigger
rendering it pretty much useless I just
haven't gotten a hang of it and it
doesn't work very well
overall the 10r is a really great phone
but it's not that exciting before we
conclude this video let me tell you more
about our sponsor Wix if you want to
make an online store blog or other
website with no coding knowledge Wix
offers an amazing portfolio of tools
that let you design something that is
right for you and it's all drag-and-drop
or pick from one of their many templates
you can learn more in the description
below the 10r checks all the boxes plus
it saves you 250 bucks vs. the tennis
but honestly if we were to recommend an
iPhone that is not the tennis and not
the 10r
it would actually be the iPhone 8 plus
that phone has such a good combination
of speed camera performance and battery
life plus you can get it for about $500
on swap so we think it's the iPhone to
get right now if you don't feel like
dropping a grant on the tennis or 750
dollars on the 10r
but all-in-all the iPhone 10 R is fine
