reduce the heat that the media was
throwing at their MacBook Pros pun
intended
Sony keeps making headlines with an ink
benchmark for the Xperia XZ three
sporting their new sensor and sadly you
will have to wait for that LCD iPhone
but it seems that you will be getting
better colors
I'm hi Mary betta and definitely thank
you so much for all your support in the
Spanish Channel just a reminder to
subscribe we have more videos coming up
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you want
to get yourself an LG G seventh in queue
which is actually one of the great
smartphones of this year it's currently
on sale at B&amp;amp;H six hundred and thirty
dollars retail the sell is oddly limited
to certain states like new New York and
New Jersey I believe if you want to get
it on Amazon for example you'd get it
for 650 and it ships worldwide you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the honor of you 10 we hear
that we might be getting this phone for
ether or probably earlier and probably
the most interesting part is that even
though the company launched the honour'd
10 with a notch apparently this one is
going to have a six point nine six inch
display of no notch interruptions and
that's cool parently it's gonna be an
OLED then the battery is apparently also
going to be 4900 milliamp hours and
before I say apparently again yeah let's
see what we get now let's talk about the
iPhone with the LCD display let's just
of it the iPhone 9 we've got trusted
sources including min cheek quote
claiming that we might see this phone in
October now it doesn't seem that we're
gonna have to wait until November which
was the previous rumor it seems that the
company is dealing with some issues but
the brightness of the display which is
expected I don't think that this delay
is anything but intentional I could be
wrong
interesting enough we also hear of two
new color options being yellow and taupe
I hope I pronounced that right taupe
like I actually had to google the word
but yeah it's like a fancier way to say
khaki we'll see what we get now let's
move the spotlight over to Sony the
company made headlines with their 48
megapixel camera sensor but the company
is not famous for launching the best of
their technology and their flagship
smartphones there are some benchmarks of
the Xperia Eggs
three which might either launched at
Aoife or next year at CES I'm thinking
more CES next year and we hear that the
major headline is that it will only have
one camera it'll be a 47 megapixel wide
angle which is weird because the sensor
they launched is 48 megapixels we'll see
what we get in the end CES is just
around the corner and finally the hot
news today pun intended have to do with
the new core i9 MacBook Pros we saw so
many videos showing how the company was
throttling the computers now we've got a
software update for those of you that
have the new computers you can download
it now where it seems the company
figured out what was causing the
throttling they've sent the software
update and they are also apologizing and
for those of you that are skeptical over
the update there are already videos out
there that have test the video update
and it seems that there is no more
throttling that's all great and today's
question let us know what do you think
do you think that it's understandable
for Apple to sell computer so expensive
and make mistakes like this because you
know for me it's like oh my god yeah the
computer for so long you tested it for
how long and then notice the issues but
that's just me leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
