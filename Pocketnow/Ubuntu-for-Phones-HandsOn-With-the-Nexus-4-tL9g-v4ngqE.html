Ubuntu touch Developer Preview I
installed it on my Nexus 4 so let's take
a look if you have used Ubuntu on a
desktop or laptop in the past year so
you're not gonna feel very out of place
and Ubuntu touch it was designed that
way the graphics in the interface are
very similar and icons are the same but
even if you haven't used Ubuntu in
several years you're not gonna feel very
out of place the Ubuntu touch experience
takes some cues from other popular
platforms and implements them quite well
the notification shade for instance is a
very similar implementation of the
notification shade on Android it has
some differences it adds some things on
top of the experience that you would get
from Android but it's the same promise
you pull down the notification shade to
access your notifications your missed
calls emails and other information and
some have compared the interface to what
you find on the Kindle Fire it's very
similar to how the Kindle Fire os looks
and works but there are differences in
how things are laid out and interacted
with so you may be asking yourself why
should care about Ubuntu for phones or
Ubuntu for tablets the answer to that is
convergence and how this will change
your workflow in the future canonical
has designed Ubuntu to work in different
environments when you plug up your phone
to peripherals such as a monitor or
keyboard or mouse the interface changes
to a full desktop version of Ubuntu so
basically you have a full computer
running in your pocket so long as you
have the peripherals to power it
canonical calls this a super phone that
is also a full PC when installing Ubuntu
for tablets or phones keep in mind that
this is a Developer Preview
not everything is gonna work and there
are lots of bugs this is mainly meant to
show off exactly how the operating
system will work and what it's capable
of to developers and people who like us
are very interested in how this thing
will work I've been playing around with
it for several hours now and it's really
nice I like the way the interface works
I like the way you can quickly switch
between applications and different
things and I really like the way
canonical implemented the notification
shape the way you can swipe down from
the top of the screen and switch between
different things all in a single swipe
the thing that immediately stands out
about Ubuntu for phones is how quickly
you can change between all your
applications and multitask a quick swipe
from the left side of the display will
show all of your favorite applications
if you swipe all the way across from the
left side you will go back to the home
screen
but if you
swipe from the right side of the display
it will bring you to the last
application you had opened swiping up
from within several applications will
show you a settings menu for a back
option or different things and swiping
down from the top of course shows your
notification shade everything is just a
swipe away and the idea from canonical
here is that there is more content
always on the display not navigational
buttons when backing out of an
application and going back to the home
screen you get a list of all of your
running applications below that list is
a list of frequently used apps and all
the ones that are installed and at the
bottom of that page you have some that
are available for download swiping to
the right of this page takes you to
videos and any kind of video content you
may have swiping to the left side is
your actual home page where you will
find your frequent apps favorite people
and other sorts of content swiping to
pages to the left takes you to the
people page where you can see all of
your activity with all of your friends
and people that you communicate with
regularly and the far left page is for
music navigating between all of these is
very intuitive and fluid although I
found myself stumbling between all the
scrolling content and you can't really
customize anything at least not right
now switching between these pages is
fluid although the animations may make
it feel a little more sluggish than it
actually is this operating system will
struggle in two areas the application
support and it's learning curve of
course there aren't going to be a ton of
applications to begin with this is a
developer preview and you have to keep
that in mind but that's not what I'm
talking about I'm not talking about the
fact that there aren't a lot of
applications on this device I'm talking
about the fact that most of these
applications are gonna be html5 so
you're not gonna have native
applications you're gonna have web apps
the Gmail application it is a web app
Twitter it's a web app Facebook it's a
web app of course Ubuntu supports qml so
you're gonna see plenty of applications
go native eventually but getting the
developers to go all-in on Ubuntu is
gonna be a major hurdle and it could be
some time before you see any major
players on the platform and then there's
a learning curve with gesture support
not many major platforms have just your
input right now especially for the
primary source of navigation and even
myself who loves in gesture navigation
and has tinkered around with other
platforms I struggled with navigating
the Ubuntu interface because I kept
sliding my finger off the screen and it
would activate something else or I would
swipe to go back home and I would open
an application using the favorite apps
or
from the home screen trying to switch to
the far-right panel I would switch to
the last application all in all to be a
Developer Preview this operating system
shows great promise I really love the
way the interface works and the way
navigation works and I love just your
input but there are some major concerns
with development support and the
learning curve and it's worth mentioning
that Ubuntu has been around for a long
time yet it's really never broken into
the mainstream there's a duopoly in the
PC market between Apple and Microsoft
and canonical or any other major Linux
distro hasn't really broken into the
mainstream so it's safe to assume that
Ubuntu for phones or tablets may face
the same fate that said I've really
enjoyed using the preview although it's
probably not safe for a daily driver I
don't have Google voice support and
there are applications that I really
need to get by so this has been a first
look at Ubuntu touch for phones on the
Nexus 4 be sure to give the video a
thumbs up if you liked it subscribe to

networks of choice I'm Taylor Martin and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
