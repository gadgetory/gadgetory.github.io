smartphones in the works iphone 6s and
6s plus will reportedly be more
efficient in some ways at least and
microsoft shows us how aggressive it can
be with Cortana going cross-platform I'm
hi meri behna and if you're having a
rough Tuesday try adding some jet lag to
that this is pocket out daily the
official lucid I have to do with one
plus as the company has just teased
something to be announced on june first
and even though we're not being
confirmed that this is an invent or
anything like that the company is saying
that it's time to change everything
we've got a one plus one in the teaser
so it does seem that we are getting the
one plus two and hopefully that's going
to be the case up next let's talk about
Microsoft is the company showed us just
how bold it can be with making its core
services cross-platform and well as it
turns out the company has just announced
that Cortana is going to reach iOS and
Android and the only problem is that
this is the typical microsoft way to do
things meaning they'll announce
something today but you won't be getting
Cortana on Android until later next
month and then you won't be getting it
on iOS until later this year so yeah
it's coming and won't control your
phone's services like for example you
won't be able to toggle Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi with it but it will provide you
big results now we do have some
information on the iphone 6s and 6s plus
trusted sources are talking about the
camera it seems that the Sony thing that
we talked about yesterday is happening
but another interesting point is that
apparently we are getting LED backlights
for the iphone success that are in
lesser intensity than the ones we have
on the iphone 6 it seems that we're
going for point 14 modules instead of
point 60 if I wish I knew what this
meant but the point being is that it
seems that this will either be more
efficient or Apple will need to add more
to the next iPhones or it could be that
we're getting better display technology
this is some good news we'll see what we
get I've got some trusted sources
talking about Android M and two things
first of all the fact that there will be
a Developer Preview when it gets
announced in Google i/o which is great
we're not sure the same day but yeah it
will apparently be just like Android L
now other
things claim that even though Android M
might look a lot like L or lollipop it
seems that it will focus on fixing all
the RAM problems we currently have
lollipop in addition to giving us better
battery life a more efficient operating
system let's just see if it applies to
anything else that's not a nexus and
finally for the very hot news of the day
it seems that launching two phones is
the way to go as a reports claim that we
are getting to Nexus devices being
announced that not necessarily google
i/o but yeah we're getting to Nexus
phones and one is being built by LG
apparently cold named ball head as we do
know that google loves to use fish names
for its prototypes and that we've got
huawei working on a codename angler the
huawei device will be the phablet the LG
device will be the smaller regular sized
device even though these are both above
5 inches in display size and rumors
claim that apparently it could be that
we will get them announced at i/o but we
won't get these phones until August and
that's probably in line with the rumors
that Android M won't be ready until
August now again we're just catching
flies here we're not really sure if
that's going to be the case but it does
lead me into the question of the day if
you had to pick specific features for
these Nexus products what would they be
in my case better camera quality that's
why I'm looking forward to the LG unit
but leave us a comment down below what's
your case and friends as always you know
