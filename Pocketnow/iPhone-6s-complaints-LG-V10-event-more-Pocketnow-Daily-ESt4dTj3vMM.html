complaining about the iphone 6s and 6s
plus LG prepares for tomorrow's event by
showing a success for the g4 and tech
warrior kind of slips with the price tag
of its Android we're offering I'm high
Meadow rivera and wednesdays are meant
to be praised because they stand in
between everything this is parking out
daily official news today begin with hcc
as the company made some headlines
yesterday because they announced devices
on google nexus day but these devices
are for asia which is the butterfly 3
which will hopefully eventually come to
the united states and also the one of
nine plus super camera edition but the
hottest news are actually the fact that
the company has already begun teasing an
event to happen on october 20th person
bites were sent out and we can't wait to
see what be brilliant means as the tag
of the pressing bite and another sort of
official news let's talk about that tag
heuer android wear smart watch for those
of you that have been saving up some
money for it it seems that you're gonna
have to save some more but not for too
long apparently the product will be
announced on november nine which is
great the problem is that apparently
it'll cost you eighteen hundred bucks
not fifteen hundred as it was rumored so
let's just see how good this product is
hopefully they know something we don't
because if not eighteen hundred bucks
for an Android wear SmartWatch that will
be obsolete a few months from now is
kind of terrible even though we don't
know exactly when Microsoft is going to
announced its new Lumia 950 950 XL if
you want to see it there are press
renders of the devices the company's UK
is store kind of leak them though we
don't know if this is actually a
controlled leak because the Nexus
devices were announced yesterday but
yeah these products were fully leak we
pretty much already know the
specification they look really nice
let's just wait some more for them those
who the spotlight over to LG many of us
are anticipating tomorrow's event
because we want to see that possible g4
pro or at least whatever that be 10 is
but analysts are already claiming that
LG has been up to a great year when it
comes to the g4 selling more than the g3
and apparently reaching a goal of 12
million units by the time that phone
kicks the bucket later or should I say
next year
whenever the g5 gets an ounce which is
good for LG it's great because this
product is actually far superior than
last year's let's just see what we got
in the end for the g4 pro and finally
for the expected news of the day what is
an iphone launch without a new gate
first it was antenna gate than it was
last gate than it was eventually
whatever been gate now it seems that
users are complaining about the iphone
6s and 6s plus some are claiming the
touch ID becomes hot after use others
are claiming if the speakers aren't
necessarily working well a lot of
distortion some are claiming the phone
just powers off and some are even
claiming the 3d touch does it
necessarily always work and we are even
talking about people that we know in the
industry but hey it leads me to the
question of the day have you been
experiencing any issues with the iphone
success or success plus if so leave us a
comment down below and let us know
because in our case we haven't really
had the problem but hey what is an
iphone launch without it right friends

to get the news earlier before this
