pre-orders break records and HP wants to
get back into mobile I'm hi Mary venom
waiting for that galaxy nexus 2 and this
is parking out daily now even though LG
and HTC both have events scheduled for
later this week the one that really has
is waiting as the launch of the new
Galaxy Nexus which will probably be
called galaxy nexus two recent code
league show I 9260 Samsung device which
would be the successor to the i9250
Galaxy Nexus though we're still not sure
if it'll be called the galaxy nexus two
though other leaks also called the
galaxy premier so we'll say apple and
AT&amp;amp;T have both come on records confirm
the iphone 5s pre orders have been their
most successful pre-order in history
just give you an idea the iphone 5 sold
two million units in just 24 hours
compared to 1 million units of the
iphone 4s sold last year now Apple has
also confirmed they'll be serving more
pre-order customers on September 21st
then the ones that got the confirmation
so cross your fingers windows phone 8
keeps coming closer and recent leaks
have Microsoft bringing more tricks up
their sleeve and the ones that we've
seen the keynote like for example the
fact that will be getting lock screen
notifications for facebook and twitter
which only makes sense because microsoft
is actually building these apps now
there's no confirmation if we'll be
getting these features on the original
build of windows phone 8 but let's just
hope that we'll get it on Windows Phone
8 and also on Windows Phone 7.8 rumors
of an HTC phablet coming to verizon are
strong and this time because we've got
the HTC 6435 being dubbed the HTC di X
which would stand for droid incredible X
which would be the successor to the
droid x that we saw years ago now this
device would bring a 1080p display but
we're still not sure if it'll be a 4.7
inch display like we've got on the 1x or
a 5 point something display that would
pretty much match the Galaxy Note 2 now
anyways whatever HCC does this display
would bring pixels per inch to a whole
new level so let's see what they bring
and finally for the infuriating news
we've got HPC
Oh Meg Whitman doing everything to for
her company out of irrelevance this time
she came on record to state that they
need to build a smartphone because they
pretty much abandoned the market and I'm
like abandon the market they kill the
compaq ipaq that spun the Pocket PC
revolution and then they killed palm so
I'm like a band in the market you pretty
much destroyed it so that leads me to
the question of the day do you care
about HP coming back to mobile will you
trust the company I for one was an HP
fan for years and to be honest with you
I don't really care about them coming
back so leave us a comment down below
now if you want an early or scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please

what you saw I'm hi I'm every better
