have to do this every single time that
Windows is not doing its stupid crap
windows life yeah right the thirst is
real for the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 XL
but part of the reason why we are so
anticipating this phone is not just
because it's the next pixel but it's
because we start to see that people
actually have them already someone
explain to us what's going on here I
mean it seems like the phone is already
on sale but before we get into the pixel
3xl we're going to talk a little bit
about wall ways a little bit of a flip
up in terms of their future phones and
how they take their selfie photos after
all an ad came out and there's a little
bit of controversy around it also on
this show we're going to talk about what
the iPhones might be able to do this
year considering that the iPhone 10
seems to be becoming popular again and
there's a Nokia phone the best one you
can get out there these are all
questions that may or may not be
answered but there is one thing that we
can't answer for you it's how we feel so
far about the poco phone el Poco Loco as
it worked hello everybody and welcome to
episode three one nine of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers on this today the 23rd of
august 2018 from smartphones to tablets
to wearables and so much more these are
all the things that you dreamed of
having since you were a kid so let's go
ahead and get talking I am your host for
the weekly it's Joshua for Gardo what's
going on everybody and joining us today
is as it says here in my jewels written
script mr. positivity himself Brandon
minimun how's it going Brandon
hi why am i mr. positivity you kind of
are to be honest mr. power of positivity
over there I've never seen you without a
smile on your face personal awesome I
appreciate that and I try not to be
missing
exactly on this episode as well we have
also a pretty special guest who is
celebrating his 10th anniversary at
pocket now this very week and Tandy
naggy how's it going Anton it is awesome
thank you very much for having me good
morning
- no not good evening everybody it's
been a little while since we've seen
each other huh it's been like three or
four months we started to talk about
that before we went on here whenever we
were in in Korea for the g7 launch yeah
exactly that was a really fun time - it
was and finally we have our producer
back in the booth we missed you last
week and I got that just as much as you
do and like I said this is my Jules
written script here so it says here the
poco pushing podcast producer Jules well
yeah all right so we're gonna we're
gonna check in with our panel more in
the midpoint of our show so we're gonna
get straight into the news right now
there's actually quite a lot to talk
about and as usual with every week in
the world of smartphones there's quite a
bit of speculation but what is
interesting about this first story is
that we're actually getting some
examples of what we are speculating on
and that either pisses us off or it
makes us more excited the pixel 3xl just
keeps appearing in the flesh and people
are taking pictures of it on subways and
then this new piece of information came
out from Russia Russian site Rosetta
I really think I've said that wrong
apparently obtained a fully furnished
pixel three XL package and of course it
was from an anonymous source but we're
gonna just say Google probably and they
claim that Google lost track of an
entire shipment of finished devices but
this is the one that they've gone ahead
and unboxed we get a really good look at
everything that is in the box with the
pixel 3 Excel as well as the phone
itself now we'll talk about the design
of the phone in a little bit but I want
to get some quick reactions or rather
just some reactions from all of you
about just this phone in general why you
think these leaks are happening so much
and if you're excited about not just the
phone but also the content contents of
the box because I have a couple things I
want to say about that let's start off
with Amazon since it's your first show
back in a bit thank you and the being my
tenth anniversary can I allow can I be
allowed to be off script just for a
couple of seconds Jules oh yeah could
you do me a favor and and lock the
camera on you for a second on me on you
yes
this is what I'd see when I'm looking at
Jules
now can you lock the camera on me please
you're getting one of these it's not
necessarily for your hair my friend yeah
we're going to shave we're gonna have
this what's the brand on the hashtag
shape that my shave that dead cat on my
freakin camera here now it's huge I get
it's lovely but I had like I'm talking
right over it and I have to put those
clothes out there and without this dead
cat then they'd be just flying all over
the place and your ears would be boggled
so it's here for a necessities sake but
I totally get it
I would love to have that Gillette blade
come over and just I don't know if the
reports are true and there's any
indication that there might be true
apparently Google has lost an entire
shipment of pixel three folks finished
phones I'm not sure how one can misplace
or lose an entire shipment that's that's
the rumor out there if it's true we
might see these of course pop up on eBay
or on other sites which are selling
phones and we might see even reviews of
a phone which has not yet been announced
at all or it will be announced in a
couple of months as of whether I'm
excited or not about the pixel three XL
or the pixel three at this point in time
I think it's too late for me to become
anything similar or close too excited
because we feel or at least I personally
feel that I already know this phone so
well I've seen it I've seen it I know
what's what's inside it and no I don't
like that huge notch but I can live with
it that's not the problem
I have that feeling which I usually have
after using the phone for a couple of
weeks or months that this brings no more
joy and excitement to my life because
that particular period of no honeymoon
phase is over and it's funny because it
was a honeymoon without actually being a
honey
yeah it's like that phantom feeling of
knowing a phone without I mean you've
seen all the leaks as we all know the
rumours benchmarks and whatnot but it's
just you don't have in your hand and you
know but we know enough from past
experience because of course Ra'zac kid
decided to take a whole bunch of photos
and publish a sample online it looks
pretty similar to what the pixel two was
able to put out and from what we've been
able to say about it that's been very
nice camera on the back yeah yeah so you
can't run the back but we mentioned the
notch a little bit and what I kind of
wanted to ask in terms of just the
design that we've seen through these
leaks and through these spotted in the
wild photos that we've had so you have
the pixel too and then you have the
pixel 2xl it seems that the excel is
though if we correct me if I'm wrong but
of course we don't know if I'm wrong
because the phone's not even out yet but
the pixel pixel 3xl potentially is the
one with the notch while the smaller
ones just gonna retain the same design
more or less yeah how is that why not
put the notch on the smaller one in
order to get a little bit more screen
real estate that's something that kind
of perplexes me I think they're trying
to I'm not sure who is manufacturing the
pixels this year whether it's LG HTC or
somebody else but they're definitely
manufacturing them by Google's direct
and strict instructions I think that
Google is trying to cater to both
audiences I mean the notch the notch has
been the most polarizing topic of the
past two or three years in the
smartphone business and there are people
who love it there are people who hate it
and there are people who just go with it
regardless and I think that with this
and I'm not sure that there will be any
other difference between the two say for
some minimal aspects they're trying to
cater to both audiences and as such
boost their sales before I guess I was
actually gonna go to your Brendan go for
it yeah yeah it's so funny because in
the last like two weeks I've been
messaging people in the industry and
saying like hey Jaime I've been feeling
very upset about the design of the pixel
3 Excel I think that not just too big
and then it occurred to me and and I and
I mentioned this last week that there's
probably a reason
for the knotch being so big and for the
pixel 3xl having it in the pickle 3 knot
and I think the reason is face ID I
think that Google is copying the feature
that Apple introduced last year and in
order to do that you need extra hardware
whether it's an extra camera or an
infrared flood illuminator and it makes
sense that they would put it on the
Excel model I'm not the regular model
because that's a more premium feature so
I think that the knotch
is big for a reason I think it's a touch
ID competitor not touch ID face ID so
that's what I think about the big notch
but it does upset me but it's for a
reason if you're talking about touch ID
I mean Google pixel already wins it
because the iPhone 10 doesn't have it
and yeah which is probably the number
one thing that I really missed from the
iPhone 10 personally but without even
getting into any of that hopefully the
face ID competitor is going to be pretty
compelling especially coming from the
Google side of things though face unlock
has been around in Android for a little
while already so it's not as if there's
a huge leap happening there they're just
gonna be a bit of extra technology that
makes it better I suppose but there's
one thing I wanted to mention before I
move on to our next topic if you look at
the contents of the box am I the only
one that absolutely adores the fact that
it comes with pixel buds style ear buds
that are USBC I just I really loved the
rope hook design of the pixel but I'm
probably the only one but I like this a
lot I mean well it's kind of hard to
tell from the picture here that we were
provided it's white so anything kind of
looks out of matte or slick if it's
white but I mean the general bud style
of that extra hoop with the plastic
little pad thing mm-hmm like I don't
know how that feels for you it may have
been the best fit for you but I've been
hearing a lot of critical response
against that design so I mean you know
take your pick
air pods or anything else that are on
the market just kind of you never really
get a win a definitive win in this
category I'm sorry go ahead
I'll just go say Brandon's gonna
Brandon's title of mr. Paws
I'm giving it a run for its money cuz I
I loved it that to me that's such a
quirky and interesting way of creating a
hook design in an earbud and I just
that's the reason why I liked it so much
and it didn't it didn't hurt me at all I
know some people found it uncomfortable
but anyway Tony you were saying I was
locked on this picture ever since I saw
it and I was looking at the email
address on those own said I was just
checking literally whether the
google.com domain actually exists its
redirects to Google so somebody is
either toying with us or somebody made a
huge typo I'm not sure what's going on
there but if anything from that picture
that particular email address I found
fishy because if that's a Google email
address and it's a typo then that person
is going to be probably in in the leap
or if it's not then somebody is really
really playing with us yeah definitely
and speaking with speaking of people
just playing us all over the place okay
so we do have to move into a huawei
story that might seem a little bit
familiar I I love when this happens
because it gives you sort of a sneak
peek into like the marketing 101 that
these companies have and whether or not
you're actually very upset about the
fact that Huawei seems to have doctored
in a very very obvious way the
front-facing selfies of their phones
there was an ad that came out in Egypt
for the huawei nova 3 and in the ad
there's someone taking several selfies
with the phone and their significant
other
well that's significant other this
lovely lady who went on to social media
and posted some behind the scenes photos
of how they did this ad kind of gave the
forum away like just just romance that
this selfies looks so good
this is the part that is so incredulous
to me because I looked at I watched the
ad and obviously the ad is available on
YouTube you could see it for yourself
and it's also available at the Oracle at
pocketnow.com but what you'll see is
this photo on the person's Instagram
showing behind the scenes of the
gentleman holding his hand out with
nothing in it and the tan is right next
to the actual camera lens kind of like
this if you're watching the live REO
that's that's a nice that's
nice selfie Josh so some hot takes on
this one but also like yeah okay we we
obviously understand smart phones being
reviewers and whatnot but also as
consumers don't we also understand as
general consumers that no selfie looks
that good so why is it that some people
would get upset at this realized without
realizing that it's a marketing strategy
why would you suspend disbelief that
this selfie looks that good when none of
them ever looked that good in the first
place even on a pixel but anyway general
thoughts on this little controversy you
know how they have how Apple has
billboards on the side of major roads
and in like Times Square a billboard the
size of it's really really big you know
what I mean yeah yeah do you really and
it says like shot on iPhone and it's
like a scene of a mountain do you really
think that that picture was taken on an
iPhone there's no way it's not it needs
to be like hundreds of megapixels right
so like this happens all the time
I don't know why people would get upset
about it I mean I'm sure the
front-facing camera on the Nova 3 is
quite serviceable especially if you have
good lighting and you're not ugly but
like this is just so common why is it a
surprise yeah it's all about ad trades I
mean we've seen a lot of this you know
behind the scenes for food where you
stick a cotton ball soaked in water and
you heat it in the microwave and then
you place it behind a bowl and then it
becomes a steaming bowl of food like
they use these little tricks to
demonstrate or VOC qualities of the
product or to demonstrate a feature of
that product in in lieu of having the
product for one reason or another maybe
the production unit has not been made
available to the ad crew or something
like that so you make do and I don't
think it's entirely fair that every
single time we go after a company for
these tactics like there there are some
things that should be scrutinized like
if they're making a specific performance
performance points and they're using
comparatives one-on-one comparisons of
devices like that should be really taken
into view that should be looked at very
very closely other than that I really
don't see anything here well Anton you
you wrote you broke the news on this one
and you also got updates from Huawei
themselves you want to yeah sure but I
want to just do a short you know trip
down memory lane it was 2012 and I was
back then just a senior editor at pocket
now I was covering Aoife in Berlin for
48 2012 edition and it was late in the
evening because my post went up at 3
something eastern time which translates
today 10 p.m. in in Berlin when I saw
the first Lumia I'm not even sure what
kind of Lumia ad that was when there was
a clear reflection of Nokia or Nokia's
ad team using a professional camera rig
to film a video presentation or a video
ad which was claimed to be filmed on
that particular and if my memory serves
that was the first instance where we saw
either a company or an advertising
company mislead us this way and ever
since then it's become a trend now I'm
not saying I'm not saying I approve this
I'm and in the post I even said that I'm
not even sure this was who always
decision maybe just the a production
company went the extra mile they wanted
to make a great ad and that's pretty
much it but yes Huawei reached out to me
but just like minutes after posting that
particular article and they sent me two
updates first one was a translation from
arabic arabic i'm sorry to english which
was a disclaimer at the end of the ads
saying that misquote that the product
images and contents are provided for
reference only and then the second
update was that the purpose of this
advertisement is to demonstrate how
consumers can use the features so it's
basic marketing talk of a company that
knows they messed up even if it's not a
direct mess up but they're now trying to
just sue them
or change the conversation a little bit
yes they did it people did it before
people will did it after them I'm not
reading too much into this but I
personally disagree with this kind of
advertisements hmm yeah I think I think
that there are very valid arguments for
why this this level of I'll use the word
trickery is is used and it wasn't there
another wall we won because I was I was
on it I was on a different show the
other day and they just about how while
we used it was Huawei right that you see
yes images and doctored those that
actually kind of made me mad because
when I when I when I see that like
you're literally taking someone else's
work and making it your own like that's
something that really upsets me as a
creator in this case yes it's deceiving
because it's not the phone itself but
they go through the actual process of
creating the ad which to me is okay that
part is okay there's a creation aspect
to it but in the other in the other case
where they use the stock photo that's
just straight copying that's just
straight taking away that that one I
really didn't like and this one or
different layers to this kind of thing
yes exactly so while the trickery is
deceiving and it's not something that
we're all I would say probably everyone
here is not really in support of this
kind of practice at the same time like I
really the only person I really feel bad
for is the actress who now no longer
will ever work with Huawei ever again
it's really my one my one piece of
sadness from this story oh my be sore
sadness is a little bit bigger larger it
it can be basically summed up to a
simple thought we are in the business
and we are watching the business closely
so we know what we're talking about and
we spot when we see it but yeah
my mother your sister is watching an ad
on TV or on YouTube says oh my God look
at the selfies this photo is creating or
snapping and they go by that phone and
they snaps Nell fee after selfie after
selfie a hundred selfies later they
return the phone because it's bad to get
a new on a replacement and it's still
bad now should I sue the company for a
misleading ad or should I never buy
anything from that particular company or
should I just give it a pass this is my
main
because we cannot be influenced but a
typical average not well informed the
user can really be influenced by this
well you know grandma who just bought
the Nova 3 should have asked for
grandson who is in the phone industry
grandson what phone should I get I like
the big selfies this Nova 3 looks great
should I buy that I saw the innit
and then you'd be like grandma no why
don't you get an iPhone or a samsung
galaxy s 9 which has a fantastic
front-facing camera and regardless of
what phone you get make sure there's
enough light on your beautiful face
before you take the picture or else it
won't work also grab know you're a witch
you can create a better phone than that
just by alchemy also grandma what are
you doing in Egypt yeah thoughts aside
on advertisements like this maybe we
will end up seeing more of this happen
because there is another phone that
while we is slated to announce in the
coming months and we are getting as
usual leaks galore on this kind of thing
so the meet 20 the May 20 protein meet
20 light whatever you want to kind of
speculate might be getting announced or
released the guys over at xda-developers
commissioned and published renders of
the may 20 based on new details and
photographs that the outlet that you
guys obtained from an anonymous source
now the device itself does have what you
might be able to call a teardrop notch
it'll be more like the essential phones
where it's really only housing the
camera and then speaking of cameras on
the rear there is an l-shape of three
different cameras are you still getting
three much like on the p20 pro but
they're in a different configuration now
any thoughts or any excitement over the
mate 20 especially considering what
we've seen in the p20 earlier this year
i'm really always super excited about
the full flexion from Huawei because
that sets the tone for whatever we're
going to see next it's gonna have the
new Kiran processor is going to have
advancements and it's gonna probably
reuse all the cool stuff from the b20
pro I agree with
Stud the renders which have been
published with the teardrop thing with
with removing the fingerprint scanner
and button finally from the front of the
phone what I do not agree with and I'm
gonna argument it is the back of the
phone and that particular placement of
the lenses I'm probably 100% sure that
the main 20 in its pro iteration not
maybe that not that 20 or that 20 light
but the probe will have three cameras
but just think about it for a second
there's a reason why why cameras have to
be aligned because regardless if they
are horizontal or vertical there's a
difference in the vantage point in the
angle at which the camera is looking at
you and if you're looking from this
perspective and the other camera is
looking just on an X or Y axis from a
different point that can be corrected
but if the vantage point is different on
both axes that's hard to correct because
you're gonna have one snapshot from here
and one from here and that cannot be
corrected so that's that's the only
thing that I'm objecting to the I'm
excited yes of course I'm excited I hope
I get the chance to go to the unveiling
which historically happened in Germany
for the past two years and I'm really
close I think I agree with you on the
parallax situation it's going to be
harder to correct for nonetheless I mean
Google and other tech companies are
finding new ways every single day to
figure out what to do with their cameras
so perhaps we might see that correction
to the future so but I don't think
that's we're here at this stage right
now in any case I don't think in terms
of like that line of thought would be
really for a hybrid product like if all
three cameras were used at once to take
a picture and I don't see that happening
with this set up I think it's gonna be
most useful if we see that 41 Magus or
whatever like large-format megapixel
sensor as the sole kind of that
one out as opposed to the whatever the
traditional ones that might be on one
side because like we see you see though
I'm gonna meet meet 10 no P 20 Pro we
got the zoo
we got the regular and then we got the
big biggie like here like a hero
oh yeah it's it's AB less than me to put
a case on this it is it is I saw one
recently by the way in Ukraine with one
of my friends like he was toning it
around it was lovely and we have some
great beers with it too in any case yeah
like I don't see that going into a
hybrid product for imaging that's all I
don't know I feel like I feel like there
are some instances where multiple
cameras or multiple lenses multiple
sensors whatever you want to call it are
use together and I I agree Anton that
that the just even just the millimeters
of off access could end up making things
a little bit difficult but but maybe
like a slash huawei's engineering is
gonna find a way to make that work i
thing is though I don't like it either
but not even just for that reason I just
don't like how that looks
[Laughter]
yeah they're in an L shape but then you
have the flash right there so it's like
I don't know it's just this big and and
you know what these renders great that
they even exist it just makes it seem
like it's gonna be this bulbous back
it's gonna be moto Z like almost I and I
don't want that at all like this you
you're required I'm just gonna pop up
the Moto zz3 real quick which my review
is almost done by the way it's gonna be
on Pocket house soon so stay tuned for
that but this this hump back here you
need a style cover to make this make
sense and I don't like that and if the
if the p20 Pro or whatever the case may
be has this large hump on the back I'm
not gonna be happy about that whatsoever
the Brandon any thoughts on this it also
has by the way speaking of high-end
features for the flagship from Huawei
4200 milliamp hour battery I mean I'm
just saying that that could be a lot
that could be amazing
yeah I'm also
kind of made uncomfortable by the
l-shaped triple camera system but
actually you know what I'm starting to
realize this triple camera thing is like
a thing and it's gonna stay I don't know
if you guys saw the leak for the v40
that's another triple camera system
arranged horizontally which actually I
think looks awesome very badass I don't
think that the fact that the cameras are
arranged like an L are a problem for
taking pictures I can i they can fix
that probably very easily with software
just compensate for the for the distance
but this triple camera thing is a thing
and I just hope that you know the OCD in
me wants them to be aligned vertically
or horizontally not in an L shape I mean
why don't they put them in a triangular
shape can you imagine how horrific that
would be looks like Brainiac yeah like L
16 has been mentioned many times in this
podcast domination it is I am NOT going
to go further than that also you know
what would have been helpful here if we
got on George Georgia Byrd Dooley who
wrote up the original article on this
but unfortunately but I think I don't
think he's available right now maybe
I'll talk to him later
well oh sorry I was just about to say
one thing to your point Brendon yes I
agree with you and apparently analysts
agree with you as well I posted
something yesterday it was analyst
reports industry sources all the kind of
pieces I hate writing because I don't
trust analysts and Industry sources but
the trend has been set and I think that
as you mentioned everybody will follow
and as that particular report mentioned
triple cameras will become and standard
moving forward on flagship smartphones
just like double-double cameras are now
the standard and it took the first
double camera that mattered was the
iPhone 7 plus which was 2016 so it took
about two years just like the
fingerprint sensor with the iPhone 5s
took about two years for you know all of
the major manufacturers to follow that
so what's interesting about the triple
camera thing just as a final note about
that is that it's not it's not Apple
the way it's it's Huawei and Huawei has
a lot of influence but then again when
did Apple lead the way in in in
technological advancements but is it
doing it it's always Apple doesn't lead
but it does it better and yes has it's
been able has it been able to argue this
points in recent times with its double
camera feature it makes a lot it makes a
lot of sense to be the second person to
step on ice just to see if it breaks
under the first person so it makes sense
to do it that way and it doesn't
necessarily means Apple is a follower
but it has been proven that whenever
Apple does something second or third
they not officially do it better but
they find a way to make it more exciting
and useful more appealing to the public
that's what more mainstream yes maybe
one of these days we'll do a deep dive
instead like what we would prefer out of
our smartphone cameras I will just put
down two quick things number one more
wide-angle please and speaking of which
if we're going to put a lot of work in
the rear cameras and even adding more
cameras to the back why don't we put
this level of work into the front-facing
camera I can't the number one thing that
I hate in any smartphone is a too narrow
front-facing camera I'm a vlogger and if
you can only see this when I take a
photo on the front facing camera I need
to be able to show more like this that's
all you need to see that's not like this
little format of like the face a face I
would prefer it if the vlog actually
just masked my face and tracked it and
normalized it it's a it's a video log
not a not a is the perfect solution for
you Josh I got the perfect solution back
and I don't know what it was I since
I've reviewed most of the Sony Xperia
phones and pocket now I of course
reviewed the Xperia z5 premium which was
the first 4k smartphone and I had the
mirror finish
it was the breeze to take selfies with
the back camera because it was mirror on
the back so you basically could easily
bring herself that's your that's your be
logging phone my friend yeah I would
love to check I would love to try that
out and and little things like that
little details like that just me just
matter to me and I like phones that
actually pay that attention we were just
that just a little a little bit of
trivia
what was the firt
the first and only phone do have oh is
on the front-facing camera
HTC HTC which you know what I loved like
that level of detail it's it's it's
something that is very something that's
not really found in front-facing cameras
too often these days and and it should
okay we were talking about dual cameras
earlier we were talked about the iPhone
let's talk about the iPhone 10 a little
bit so some analysts in the tech world
can can usually see when a phone is
going to get really popular especially
when it's at its release but it seems
like a lot of them were for the most
part a little bit wrong about the iPhone
10 it did not sell like hotcakes like
they expected however it seems that the
sales of the iPhone 10 are kind of an
upward trend which is kind of the worst
time for it to happen because a new
iPhone is slated to be announced in the
next couple of months here's the thing
about the whole situation is like no one
can agree on what's actually happening
with iPhone sales because we see the
supply chain reports say oh we have so
many parts left into these bins what are
we going to do with them and then you
have Apple which goes on you know every
earnings call to say the iPhone 10 has
outsold every other model every week in
your entire life that's the dissonance
that we are seeing here and it's kind of
crazy to be talking about this
especially as the numbers might have
disappointed analyst a bit but a general
kind of feeling and flow of the iPhone
10 has been that it's fairly popular and
to hear this new street research has
analysts to talk about how this
popularity of the iPhone 10 which is
said to be going out of production soon
and to make way for the new iPhones it's
going to have this popularity bummer is
going to have a negative impact both for
the current well the upcoming year as
well as the year after that so in the
2019 fiscal year for Apple which starts
in the holiday quarter they I believe
the number is 10% lower revenues below
the consensus consensus of Wall Street
and then for 2020
earnings per share is gonna go down 6%
below average projections so that's the
summary for that um I don't know how to
really yield I mean good to speed on it
okay could this be a strategy moving
forward that when you release a phone
you're expecting a year later for it's a
it's actually it because we've been
saying that our smartphones are getting
really good so obviously like people are
still using the let's say Galaxy s8 to
great effect you know and the iPhone 10
could be a very relevant phone it just
takes a while for it to actually stick
obviously this is wishful thinking on
the part of a company to be able to do
that kind of strategy but maybe that's
what's happening with at one time I
think I think there's there's a lot of
logic and common sense behind what's
happening with the iPhone 10 which I
cannot say for what the analyst says and
let me address both of them I think that
the iPhone 10 is selling well
particularly at this moment in time
because of two reasons number one we
knew from the get-go that the iPhone 10
will be an anniversary edition it will
be the 10-year of iPhone and Apple will
probably discontinue it after producing
the initial batch which instantly
boosted its resale value number two
since we are so close to the new iPhones
the iPhone 10 is becoming cheaper and
cheaper to purchase so more and more
people who wanted to buy it in the first
place are looking at the iPhones hand
now so that explains a boost now towards
the end of the cycle for a phone which
Apple will no longer do ever the iPhone
10 is unique that's the explanation as
far as the analyst and and the report is
going it doesn't make sense in my mind
to say that the new iPhones will not
sell because the old iPhone was popular
it's like saying the note 9 will sell
less because the note 8 was popular it
doesn't make sense in my mind that my
logic and my brain is just breaking into
if somebody can explain this to me
please go ahead but well I mean you know
it depends on how many how many people
in the upgrade pool the eligible upgrade
pool have been able to say alright this
is what I want and
I'm gonna go with it for the next 24 to
30 months or whatever the next upgrade
is and whenever that number kind of you
know it always goes up and down but you
know if there has been an average cut
there's been an aberration in the trend
going up then that's kind of what they
used to tell so perhaps that might be
the situation we're dealing with I'm not
exactly sure in terms of the iPhone 10
itself I mean we've been looking forward
to the iPhone 9 I've been calling it
some people have been calling it the
iPhone 10 ass like no no the LCD model
is what we're talking about here and no
I'm sorry I'm just confusing myself here
because they're ready let me let me take
it over so we've had the eight and the
eight plus it will make sense knowing
Apple to have the eight s and the S Plus
but Apple already has an iPhone set so
the discussion is whether we will have
an eight s we will have a 10 s we will
have a nine it doesn't really matter
these are the 2018 iPhones regardless if
it's going to be the iPhone 25 or the
iPhone 44 the question is why shouldn't
people purchase the new iPhone because
the iPhone sin is popular because again
I'm stressing this no I was about to say
at the 5.8 inch model has been told by
many many sources rumors and otherwise
that it will be the exact it'll be
identical even down to dimensions to the
iPhone 1000 it's green it's got a
five-point eight inch screen it's gonna
have new internals of course which but
like does that really what's the meaning
to that though what's that meaning to
that except it's not the iPhone 10 it's
not the anniversary edition and it's not
a so-called limited edition phone which
to many including to me means a lot
because just the same way I've held on
to my 808 PureView and my 920 and I
might went 10 20 all the phones which
are milestones means something to either
their owners their users or their
companies so I think that the iPhone 10
is in a situation Apple is it a
situation with the iPhone 10 where they
can say years and years later that that
was the 10th anniversary and people
loved it not because
the AMOLED screen or because we remove
the touch ID home button but because it
was the 10th anniversary of the iPhone
that's the one that's gonna get into the
glass case right Brandon yeah yeah just
jump in real quick um one way to
understand the popularity of a device is
to very simply look around you and I
don't know about you guys but I I
noticed that when the iPhone 10 came out
all of the end of 2017 and the first
half of 2018 I barely saw the phone but
now I see it pretty frequently
maybe because as Tony says the prices
are going down people are realizing that
it's a special edition but I think it's
just because people were waiting to see
you know if it's any good
so the early adopters kind of picked it
up in the in the end of 2017 early 2018
and now they're out in the wild enough
for like Grandma to be like oh that
looks cool and and I haven't heard my
grandson complain about that phone so
I'm gonna get that phone and so sales
kind of accelerate as there are more
phones in the field more people buy them
because it's like advertising and more
sales coming in yeah go ahead when when
the iPhone Center launch Brendan it was
the first and the only mainstream phone
which had a $1000 price tag now there
are at least your three others so the
shock factor the the wow factor the
surprise factor is no longer a deciding
factor on whether I'm going to buy that
or not of course I'm going to go for an
iPhone 10 one year later to just
purchase it for 750 instead of 1,000 at
launch day but it is no longer the only
$1000 phone out there and I'm not
talking the about the Lamborghini and
rolls-royce citizens and I was one more
thing and that's you know even price has
less to do with it these days I know
that so so very few people
proportionally go buy phones that are on
sale just for the fact that you know
sales only happen enter a short period
but like they're looking for bargains so
looking for depreciation because that's
what time does
and they might be searching on like
different markets or even market places
such as swap ago to swap comm to trading
your iPhone that was the the flick Atari
plug that plug or no plug you're right I
mean even before we looked at swap buzz
listings
I have personally written about a report
saying that the iPhone 10 is about the
only phone which is retaining more than
75 to 80 percent of its resale value so
that that's and that has to mean
something and not necessarily to those
who own it but to the rest because I can
easily ask $400 for my phone if nobody's
gonna pay that but if somebody's willing
to pay 80% of its original value then it
means that the perception the wide
perception is in agreeance with that and
whether you have an iPhone 7 8 or 10
when the iPhone neck the next iPhone
gets announced the prices on all of
those will plummet so like you know it
is a good time to sell yeah definitely
wouldn't it be nice though if we were
having conversations as deep as this
that we have with the iPhone that we
have with the Samsung's of the world
wouldn't it be nice if we had these
conversations about a brand like Nokia
would it be great if we could get a
little bit of that love on there because
the Nokia 7 plus is actually getting a
bit of that love as we move on to our
next story where apparently the Nokia 7
plus was awarded the best consumer
smartphone of the year by the expert
imaging and sound association now if you
don't really if you're not really
familiar with that association don't
worry neither am i so the Nokia 7 plus
if you could forgive me for not
remembering the library here a pocket
now but did you guys do a review of the
Nokia 7 plus here no we had a hands-on
at MWC but we never got the review the
phone I got you apparently there are
certain aspects of this device that are
very special there's a reliability
elegant operating system it does get
some marks because it has the fastest
but one of the fastest update cycles but
the reason why is because it's using
Android 1 in the first place
and apparently in an event in India the
Nokia seven-plus is going to get the
official PI image in September so it's
actually going to be Android Pi as well
one of the few by September any thoughts
on the Nokia 7 plus I I think I do
remember it was MWC that we saw it I did
like it a lot I will admit but is it
enough to call it like the best bone of
the year you know I'd like I'd like to
go last because I have some notes which
are not related to the Nokia phone
itself but to eisa so please okay
did any of you other guys Brendon and
Jules as you take a look at this phone
at all like have you been able to like
hold it or anything like that I was
barely able to hold it I like the
construction on it and it was just fine
for let's say like a 250 to 300 dollar
ish phone and it's great I mean it was
no Scirocco yeah yeah it was no Scirocco
there's no like pretty thing but you
know stock software fast updates this
has been the tech enthusiasts dream
they've been clamoring for this kind of
thing and they have finally got it and
it seems like this validation has come
from Issa so like this is what they've
been hoping for for long and someone has
come to save them the savior has come
Brendon what was the last Nokia you've
ever used a few years ago there was I
wanted to try Windows Phone one last
time and there was like on Amazon they
have like a hundred and $49 Nokia G's I
forget what it was it was some Nokia
Windows Phone and I returned it because
there were literally no apps for it but
the seven plus I think the seven plus
looks really nice and I haven't had one
but it's good to hear that Jules says
that it has good construction it reminds
me of the note 7 the way it has like a
chin and a forehead and just like a
immersive display in the center I think
it's a really beautiful design and the
fact that the Android updates are fast
make it really compelling mmm and now
ends on I feel like you're gonna blow
the lid off of this story oh yeah oh
yeah
I have the utmost respect for eisa and
according to Wikipedia it's a
collaboration between different
multimedia magazines that offer tests of
cameras video cameras and so on so their
fellow journalists but I would like to
ask you guys one thing what's the
difference between a consumer smartphone
and a smartphone I mean I'm looking at
their website now and while we do see
the nokia 7 plus the best consumer
smartphone the best smartphone is the
Huawei P 20 pro what's the difference
between a consumer smartphone and the
best smartphone that's question number
one and the only reason why I'm in doubt
about this again with all due respect to
E is a number two this is probably
another thing which makes my mind just
crack into and my logic just go out the
window
it's the same thing like in the USA with
the cars you're talking about a 2019
model in 2018 how can you see is a or
any other publication for that matter
call a smartphone in 2018 the best
product for 2019 because its best
product 2018 2019 I mean there's so many
phones to come out even this year it's
the pixel it's the iPhones it's you name
it you cannot call a best product
2018-2019 for a consumer smart phone the
Nokia and the best product 2018-2019 has
the best smartphone the huawei because
the two categories don't make sense in
my mind and it doesn't make sense for
you to call a phone the best phone for
next year this year
that's the lid there we go wow I was
about to say this does feel like yeah I
love the automobile industry analogy
there because maybe that is where we're
going because literally in the car
industry you have a new model every
single year and it could be this car
this model 2019 this car this mile 2020
that kind of thing and that's kind of
where smart phones have gone in the last
few years so this trend might be
starting this might be a sign of that
starting and whether or not that's a
good thing I mean it depends on how much
weight you put on the wards like this
but anyway Brendon yeah Tony
just asking what's the difference
between a consumer phone and just a
regular phone and I think it just comes
down to price like consumer more price
friendly just a regular phone is like
kind of more like if you're using your
phone from for work you will spare no
expense and you're willing to pay more
money and the you know the b20 Pro much
more expensive than the Nokia I'm
totally with you but wouldn't have been
easier and more transparent to call the
Nokia 7 plus the best mid-range or
budget or affordable smartphone and the
b20 Pro the best flagship high-end
expensive smartphone it'll have been in
my mind and my logic a lot more
straightforward
I agree but that's not how people on the
street talk like my brother that has the
iPhone 10 isn't like hey check out my my
high-end my flagship and hey hey babe
buddy over there you got the mid-range
err don't you well known fact about
Philadelphia so there is an intersection
that I have wanted to visit and this has
been pointed out by the Facebook group
new urbanist memes for transit-oriented
teens there is a there's a intersection
I believe it's 69th Street and Dix
Avenue 69 and Dix which is awesome talk
about Street hog right okay so not to
really cut anybody off Brennan if you
had one more point I wanted to make sure
that you had it now that's it I'm gonna
next podcast I'm gonna go to 69th in
dicks all right so um we do have to we
are going to get into our deep dye of
topic in a second but we are going to
have a tiny break one thing that I do
want to mention though is that Anton has
a bit of a hoarder out on this show so
in about five minutes he's gonna be on
his way out which is perfect for me to
ask you in this little break that we
have before our final or final portion
of the show can you give us like it's
been ten years that you've been here at
PocketNow and are there any sort of
stories or memories that you want to
share
that long history that you have with
this company oh there's there's plenty
of stories we don't have enough time for
those stories starting from the first
the message I received from Brandon when
I was an active user and I stay
developers to come and write for a
website all the way through working with
Evan blasts of leaks to becoming
managing editor and then to taking over
PocketNow and then to take a step back
and focus more on content now all the
way through everybody with whom I've
worked with whether it's a client a
partner a colleague and my colleagues I
mean I don't know all the people that
that were here with us even on the
podcast I mean if I come to think about
the podcast I've bought casted with Evan
blasts and I'm talking only about hosts
now Evan blasts Brandon minimun Michael
Fisher Stevens shank Jules Wang and now
Joshua Vergara and I've been a host
myself several times and not even gonna
go into all the EFA's where I said that
it's gonna be my last
Aoife and the MWC so it's it's been a
long it's been a long and interesting
ride and as I said in my tweets and on
my Facebook updates on social media I am
so so thankful to everybody who has been
here with me in these ten years because
it's been it's been ten interesting
years there have been challenges there
were good signs and bedtimes but what
matters is that we are here a community
talking to our big community and that
makes me feel like I'm home whether I'm
talking to Brandon what I'm talking to
you Josh who are the newest member of my
family that's that's how I feel every
time I talk to you guys that I'm I'm
home where's my Kleenex that was really
awesome and you know what it's it's
gonna be great because like no matter no
matter where you might be in however
many years down the road like I feel
like anybody who is new to the team and
right now I'm the I'm probably the
newest member I would the newest members
would come to you for like the history
and for a lot of like the old stories
and just ways of knowing like
history of a place like PocketNow and i
didn't realize that the the the
symbiotic relationship between PocketNow
and x da was so strong even way back
when yes I started off as as an XD
developers senior moderator and that was
a popular ROM chef back in the day so
yeah it back then it was pocket now in
some other media outlets which started
off really really early and there was
xda-developers the only place where
somebody could talk to somebody else who
was probably interested in the same
things as you were and have a normal
debate about something which was usually
how to take out your stylus and tap on a
huge icon on a 320 by 240 screen yeah I
always remember those those rom talks on
next day developers back in the day well
it's it's speaking just as the newest
member and one of the younger members of
the team like it's it's an honor to be
with someone who's been such a veteran
here so thank you for all the work that
you've done as well thank you for making
me feel I'm older too man I was trying
to think of the right like word and
phrase of a better term the only word
that could come up was like I respect
the seniority but then that's kind of
alright awesome so yeah I do want to
continue our check in a little bit thank
you again Anton and a fan here's thank
you for having me more years and
whenever you feel like you need to pop
off feel free to do so
I wanted to check in with Jules and Nan
Brendan how are things been since our
last episode Jules I think is who I
really want to hear from because we
really missed you this week I'm very
glad that you did and you put a very
good show in my place I mean I've been
checking the ratings for that and it's
been doing exceptionally well so
congratulations you guys in any case my
travels have been going well after
leaving New York a couple weeks ago so
I'd go to Dublin well I didn't decide to
go but I planned out a trip centered on
wedding in Kiev that I
at 10:00 I was honored to be invited and
I was glad to be able to you know call
this guy friend he's actually the CEO of
Yves tech which made the eve computer
the crowd-sourced specs computer that
was also crowdfunded it got backing from
Microsoft and whatnot so like you know
for him to have invited me the only me
like media guy the only he west guy that
he really you know knows like that was
interesting and I made sure that I did
this whole operation as cheaply as
possible so that meant integrating the
note 9 thing going on there and then
making sure that I hadn't had places to
stay in Dublin or in London that were
cheap I actually here this is actually
all my friends work from my childhood
friend who happened to be planning a
trip to London anyways and wanted to be
here for the first time so like he just
gave me this Airbnb for free so I'm very
fortunate to be doing this right here
right now and the sky internet here this
guy is doing pretty good for this
podcast so yeah it does look pretty good
and you've been you've been just
literally touring Europe and it's it's
awesome that uh it's awesome to see that
so thank you for being able to join us
despite being out and about right now
finally borrow oh there you go we'll
have a good trip and oh and on the way
out
thank you yes thank you very much for
having me and one last thing
Jules hashtag shave that mic all right
Brandon quick check-in from you before
we get to our main topic for today yes
so I got the note 9 here I got it
yesterday and pull the trigger man huh I
just
yeah I had to that's right you messaged
me about this what was the phrasing that
you did the world something wins again
or whatever like I just had to anyway
people like both Jaime and Josh were
trying to convince you not to jump from
the 1 plus 6 because you had already
made than vest
so like like this was a surprise hey
check out how my recent look oh my God
look at that parallax scrolling that's
so cool so I just made a video that I
have to edit and it takes me four times
longer to edit a video than you guys on
how to speed up the note 9 there's a
bunch of things you could do to make it
faster but there's an app that so many
people forget about it's called good
luck 2018 which which like has been so
much improved that it allows you on the
note 9 and any Samsung phone to add
gesture control from the side so swipe
over and down goes home swipe over goes
back swipe up goes to your recents which
is great because you can hide the
notifier on the bottom and still use
gestures it also lets you change the
look in the feel of the recents which is
what I just showed you until like a
carousel like thing and I know it's kind
of foo-foo but it's fun and different
it lets you customize the lockscreen and
do a lot of other like deeper like UI
changes to a Samsung phone and it's
called good good luck 2018 and if you've
got a note 9 or really like any Samsung
phone it's really worth checking out
there's a lot of cool stuff you can do
that bit about the swiping would have
made the perfect segue but like I just
had one more thing to say and that's
like going to like you tap on the
developer settings like the kernel
whatever they can get into developer
settings and then you go into all the
animation logs and then set that to
either like scale half time or no
animation yeah that's another cool way
to just you know get rid of all that
fluff when you and that's one of the
things I mentioned the video but if you
go to 0 animations because this system
needs time to draw the app on the screen
it can actually feel more laggy so
that's why I think point 5 is good and
actually if you know how to use ADB with
Android developer tools you can change
these the animations to any variable so
like if you want to go 0.25 you can do
that and that's super fast but not not
zero so you're right that's a very good
one that a lot of people also to forget
about the screen animations speaking of
tweaks we are moving
to a phone that has a pedigree of
software tweaks and software
enhancements speaking of launchers and
whatnot
it's a little bit of the me UI in a new
brand new brand I love that phrase I
keep using it it's a brand new brand
from Xiaomi it's called poco or poco
phone it's a little bit different
because in India I kept hearing that the
brand is just poco it's not poco phone
so there's a little bit of a mix-up here
but well I mean your phone just as well
as mine has the tramp stamps that says a
poco phone on it so yeah exactly yeah oh
they can go like straight up over here
but the thing is to refocus the polka
phone f1 and Jules and I as we have just
revealed have been using this phone for
a little while I unfortunately just you
know cards on the table I haven't been
able to give the phone the quality time
it deserves but I did do a first
impressions video of it over on my
channel meanwhile Jules wrote an article
about it at pocketnow.com so I'm going
to go ahead and pop it over to you Jules
and give us your reactions on this
really interesting device so basically
can you show me about 20 minutes can you
talk about the kick the camera please
because no one's no one's really talked
that much about the camera and it seems
like such a good lower priced phone if
the camera is good today to that note I
will say a real quick sorry Jules um
that that's the reason why I didn't want
to give my final thoughts on the phone
yet because I do want to give the camera
as much time as possible so I can
actually see how it would perform but
anyway Jules I'm not even sure we have
final software yet because I believe
this was supposed to be launching with
me UI 10 and what we have on here is me
UI 9 so yeah and the other thing too is
that they have an infrared camera a
selfie camera for facial authentication
that has not been activated yet so we
can't use that feature yet we would love
to although at least consumer launch
time that feature still won't be
available so I guess we could do apples
to apples
but in any case I've been using this
phone with multiple sins from Ireland
and even project five right now it's on
Project five for the past twelve
thirteen days it's been providing great
connections for me with that snapped
reckoning 45 that integrated snapdragon
xx4 modem yes correct qualcomm thank you
for that and it's been performing just
well I mean this this this does have the
analogues to the no.9 no.9 because it
has its touts a liquid cooling system
with that copper stripe going somewhere
I haven't seen the tear downs at this
device yet so it's anyone's guess how
that exactly works or how you know what
kind of numbers they produce but it's
been I haven't seen any hang-ups on this
six gigabyte model six gigabyte ram so
it's been doing alright for me and yeah
like there's a whole bunch of other
stuff in terms of me Eli that we'd talk
about a lot of the changes that they've
already made even though it's not final
software or have been baked into nine
six this version this poco launcher here
and it does have those full screen
gestures so that you remove the
navigation bar of course you can still
have it it's an option but you can swipe
up to go home swipe and hold up and then
you'll get multitasking and then swipe
from the sides for back either way you
just go back which I really got used to
quickly I'm dual wielding with the pixel
too and I found myself swiping from the
sides and trying to why is it not going
back like that it felt very very natural
for me it does suck though that it does
interfere with a lot of the side menu
interfaces on app yes yeah I was about
to say it like when I when I use G board
and I want to swipe from the back space
button in order to remove full word
sometimes I hit back on accident and
it's yeah yeah you have to be kind of
careful about that
again you know I'm going to be there are
certain things that in the tech world
people understand me as I'm the Smart
Watch skeptic for one and number two I'm
also the guy that hates full screen
gestures so that's just gonna be my hot
take on those but speaking of hot takes
like here is here is one angle that I
wanted to ask you guys and and Brandon
Brandon from being from being on the
outside looking in since you're not
using this phone you see the spec sheet
you see what's possible here I suppose
it's not going to be the biggest
surprise that Xiaomi is able to put all
of these high-end specifications on
phones that are supposed to be more
affordable they've done it with their me
series quite a bit and even with a phone
that has ceramic even with phones that
have ceramic it's still probably better
priced than most other flagships
generally so Xiaomi is they know what
they're doing in this case and with poco
phone with the f1 they're actually
undercutting it even more with the phone
that's $300 and it has the a45 so my
question to you guys is this hot take
that people seem to have at least from
the preliminary outset the flagship
killer killer like does this does this
strike you as at all even close to that
type of moniker that's why I wanted to
know what you guys thought about the
camera and I appreciate that it's too
soon to give your take on the camera
because my my thinking was that for a
while for most of this year the best
budget phone if you care about camera
build quality performance and that kind
of thing was the honor 7x which you
could get it for like $1.99 the camera
on that is very good for the price and
so but but but I think the
specifications of the poco phoner are
very impressive and so whether it's the
full package
you know relates to whether the camera
is any good and I've never used a xiaomi
phone so III don't know how they perform
like I used the vivo next recently and I
was just super impressed with I've never
used to Yvonne super impressed with how
that phone this camera was so I wouldn't
be surprised if I and you guys were
surprised by the camera
so in terms of the camera let's we'll go
with the selfie camera first 20
megapixels I have the thoughts on this
bring in the first impression during the
cold I put down and I also have some
photos which some of them are in the
wrong orientation and it can't do
anything about that because the back end
is acting up weird so thank you
WordPress for some reason but in any
case 20 megapixels there are still a lot
of the features that you would expect
out of a me UI things such as
beautification a I sort of thing you got
the portrait mode for extra bouquet
features and in terms of you know being
able to execute those features it does a
mediocre job and I'll be honest there
there is kind of an Asian Syndrome thing
going on too because if you set the
beautify mode at all to any level you'll
get whiter skin you get softer but
apparently whiter skin and that's I mean
I understand at least initially that
we're dealing with the Indian market and
you know as much as we don't like it or
as much as there are ethical questions
that's a feature that's in high demand
look at that look at that Josh look at
that look how blight skinned I am in
this photo oh and the thing is like as
as American users as Western users like
your t-zone was like the whitest that as
I attempt to refocus on myself over here
there you go the the thing is that this
is something that if you've ever used a
Xiaomi phone before you come to expect
and any Asian phone in general and you
know far be it for me to be that Western
user that says it's not what I want out
of my selfie cameras but you know what
it's it is a marker that they're hitting
and that's almost to their credit
because they're they're managing to put
a 20 megapixel camera on here that gives
the users in the markets this phone will
be coming out in exactly what they want
which is softening which is lighter skin
Beauty modes and stuff like that so I
can't I I want to knock it but I still
understand why it's there you guys do
you guys know why I like this
question but why do these phones that
tend to come from the Asian side of the
world have this very heavy skin
smoothing beauty mode what do the story
it's the simple answers demand and for a
lot of the users who are on that works
like weed chats or I'm sure I remember
what the name of some other networks are
but we chat is like one of the biggest
one China if you look at any photos of a
user on WeChat they what they're looking
for is to as to softn and to remove
blemishes or anything like that like the
beauty industry and Asia is so prevalent
that it even bleeds into our smartphones
in the digital space oh good blog to
follow by the way is the Shanghai a been
posting lots of photos lots of a video
like time-lapse videos from Weibo
showing off these girls that you know
start off you know bleary-eyed like
they've just woken up and then they go
through a whole transformation process
like those videos have been very popular
recently and they've been just popping
up like wild flowers yeah this could be
this could be in and of itself a deep
dive that we could do on a different
show a different episode because it is a
big topic and it's something that I
think Western users like myself have had
to struggle understanding a little bit
and I want to know this if I wasn't
dating somebody who is from the
Philippines who was from that market who
understands that because whereas people
like us would review these phones and
look at like all the front-facing camera
has good detail
it does a pretty good job she would
actually review it in terms of how well
it applies its beauty modes so if if her
skin was way too waxy then she would say
it's a bad front-facing camera
and well you know what people look for
that and I really need beauty mode I'm
telling you guys I'm gonna keep it on
give you an example what a bad beauty
mode would be a bad beauty mode would
take away your 5 o'clock shadow and like
that's a bad beauty mode it's too much
and on the flip side of bad beauty mode
would also be too much detail because
it's not doing anything so right there
are users who want beauty mode in the
front-facing camera who would probably
go for something like the poco phone who
wouldn't like the front-facing camera
off the pixel too because it's too
detailed because it's not because it
doesn't hide Minh
it's it this is a very odd conversation
to sort of skirt because yes the point
of the beauty mode is to hide your
imperfections and there is there it is a
problematic phrase to use but ultimately
that is what is in demand in Asia anyway
we've gone off tangent in this case but
I understand this is the front-facing
camera that we're talking about and you
thoughts on the rear facing camera
jewels that you can share cuz I don't
have it yeah yeah so in terms of the
rear facing camera I'm not sure if I'm
at if I was clear to you know talk about
what their internal benchmarking
standards were like so like I was very
vague in terms of what they want to aim
for we do have what's considered
something from last year it's the sensor
that I used the sony imax 363 i believe
and you know it takes
decent-enough photos you know i think if
you were to describe it you know it's
like it's firmly within its price back
bracket in terms of camera performance a
lot more HDR activity going on than I
would like to see and low-light is kind
of on and off hit and miss I was able to
show off one of the photos which was of
the bride just caught in a good
spotlight and she was like yeah she was
dancing she was feeling her best so like
there are some moments where it shines
but more often than not like if you were
even subject to any slight jitter it's
yeah yeah it's going to be it's gonna be
one of those situations and I think this
is so common in our industry where even
though the price is is something that
can mitigate these issues that you see
in the camera we can't look past what
it's unable to do and I would implore
everybody to sort of think about this
phone in a different sense this is
probably the phone that every Android Go
user wish that they could get for that
price
you know because $300 out in India is
just just in general that's a really
great price to have for a phone that has
the best possible specifications
you can get right now and even users
here in the US here in North America
would kill to have this phone and there
are a lot there are a lot of users out
there who actually don't really care
about the camera as much as you think it
as reviewers we are tasked with looking
at everything laterally like the camera
is going to be weighed upon as much as
the specifications but the thing is for
a lot of users out there it's a little
bit more weighted so I would say that
the reason why this one excites me so
much is because if I know somebody who
is not going to be taking photos that
end up on Instagram that end up on
Twitter Facebook whatever what me what
what have you what they want to fund
that they can rely upon for probably the
next year or so granted they don't break
it or drop it this is gonna be this
would be my first recommendation and it
would be an easy one to make
it's also a good burner phone if you
want to keep things private I do i I do
agree that it's a little bit hard to
talk about it in final terms because we
don't have final software yet me oh I 10
I'm actually excited for because we got
Jules and I were together during our
meeting with them and me UI 10 looks
pretty dope and I'm just I want that to
arrive before I give any final verdicts
on this but as of right now if this is
something that we're going to see more
often in 2019 have at it have at it I
want to see more I want to see more
cheaper phones with high-end
specifications make it clear to us that
the things that matter the most to us
don't have to be 1,000 dollars because
what you're gonna end up paying for for
a phone that's over $600 is the overall
package but if you're just looking for
very specific things to be stellar you
can get a $300 phone yeah and you can
pay the extra $300 $300 for the camera
yeah exactly as one famous youtuber once
said or said many times and I very much
believe this cheap phones are getting
good and good phones are getting cheap
except for like the note 9 or the iPhone
10 and stuff mm-hmm
yeah I totally agree with that like it's
become clear to me after using this
phone with the note 9 at the same time
which is probably like this is the worst
time to be a totally unbiased
reviewer because we have all of these
phones at the same time the best way
that I can mitigate that bias is to say
that the note 9 is priced the way it is
because it's the package it's the entire
package you can do literally anything
with that phone and it will handle it is
that the same case for the poco phone if
you think of the if you think of the
camera in particular maybe not but then
again that's probably not what you're
paying this paying that money for so
keep that you're paying money to play
smash hit four or five hours at a time
yeah and you know not blow out the
engine just by playing it for that long
I guess exactly and I love that this
phone came out at this price point right
now to prove to us that a cooling system
in a phone doesn't have to break the
bank because that well you had the ROG
phone which had its own cooling you have
the no.9 which has its own cooling but
those are gonna be like skyrocketed
prices and people are gonna people I was
afraid that people would think that they
would have to go to a phone like that
and then here comes Xiaomi and polka
phone proving to us that it's possible
to have without having to break the bank
all right and the YouTube chat studios t
camera is not very important for me
performances since I'm struggling with
my phone which is now the LG g4 see ouch
when you have to add extra letters to
the main models it's like you you know
where are you doing there
goran petrovic also why manufacturers
don't make budget phones with some
special top feature like the LG q 7 plus
with its top audio or that elbow with a
great camera I don't know which
particular series they're talking about
there but yeah like there are a lot of
mid rangers LG has tried out with the x
series which focused on one specific
spec like battery or the camera or other
like laser or something I don't think
anyone bought an x series LG but I do
remember that the X cam and like I think
yeah speaking of which I apologize for
not going into the chat more often one
thing that I was that girl yeah the one
thing that I will say is that some
people were asking about you know like
for us to answer questions throughout
the
entire first portion of the show all the
questions are about the polka phone and
now here we are so exactly does the
polka phone have NFC says Zachary Webb I
can say now unfortunately I was not able
to use my phone to tap in and out of the
tube and yeah it's a surprising house
contact list has made its way across the
UK just so easily so why can't that be
us corner stores 7-eleven yeah one final
one from the Chad before we go into our
final final little thing before we close
out where is it such a nut he says slap
a skin on the polka phone and you're
good to go
I would kind of agree with you unless
you get this armored Edition and this
Kevlar it's pretty nice oh yeah
absolutely and there's also a bit of a
heft to the phone which which which kind
of gives you that sense of safety and
which is funny because one of the
philosophies behind the polka phone f1
is that they think that people are gonna
put cases on this phone to begin with
anyway so it doesn't matter that it
looks provide one in the box and also I
have to call out mr. mobile here mister
Michael Fisher for you know talking
about the oleophobic at the lack of
oleophobic coating which I'm not sure
what you think of but I'm actually glad
that it's like do people say it's yuck
and you have to deal with fingerprints
like you had to deal with finger prints
anyways with those oleophobic coating x'
and what's more is that they made the
phone slicker so that when ever i put my
phone face down on a surface or what I
perceived to be a near flat surface and
then it ends up all of a sudden I'm just
working on and then all of a sudden boom
the floors the like the floor has met
the phone and you know regardless of any
of that I will say that despite the
Kevlar looking so nice the armored
Edition still gets smudged up to hell so
I mean to me it doesn't matter much
because it still happens all right so we
have one less thing to talk about
something a little bit fun for just a
couple of minutes and that's I love I
love that Jules you put this as the
question
has there ever been an email that you
wish you could take back immediately so
the story behind that is gmail has been
running its undo send feature for emails
you've been able to only on the web have
you been able to you know take back an
email just made mere seconds after
you've sent it like you realize oh that
that feeling of dread when you might
have said too much out there so you're
able to press the undo button quickly
and then you know in some case in many
cases if you're dealing with another
gmail client then you can do that
immediately if you're dealing with
another like a hot meal or something
like that it might take a few minutes so
that kind of suspense still hangs around
but yeah that feature has moved on to
Android now so that's a good thing I
guess and there are plenty of emails
that I wish I could have taken back in
my time throughout I've never had that
because if I'm going to say something
that I would ultimately want to take
back it's gonna be through a text
messaging I don't think I would ever
send something that could come back to
me in a bad way in an email I don't
think I've ever done that before he
knows very permanent yeah I mean for me
like it was email that you used to talk
to professor's or something and you used
to do that in a harried rush just before
class when you're sending something and
you send the wrong file you've said the
wrong whatever the heck so like for me
in terms of like you know typing
something on my phone and just saying
and not making sense at all because
autocorrect has screwed you over really
good today yeah that's that was the case
for me so I wish that undo send could
have undone a whole bunch of things if
you get an email from me and the word
ducking is in there I meant it for it to
be in there okay Brendan is it is the
undo send feature godsend for you it is
it is a godsend except that you have a
window of like 10 seconds to
yes I want I want a window of like 72
hours because I can't think of a
particular example but I've set my wife
emails in the past that I was telling
her something I didn't I I didn't agree
with or something that bothered me and
let's just say it put our relationship
into a tailspin and I wish I hadn't sent
it but you know there was no undo send
there was no 72-hour undo send so what
the reality is is that that notification
pops up you know just 30 seconds after
you've sent that thing and you know
depending on the push cycles or whatnot
like that could be even sooner so it's
like in reality you only have just a few
precious seconds that you could really
use so I should find her phone and smash
it classic a classic family sitcom trope
right there is like no don't open that
and the wasn't there a Google Labs
application in Gmail that would test if
you're sober before you can send an
email I think I think that's sometimes
more useful but in any case there's no
reason to undo send this podcast it's
very informative and very fun podcast
