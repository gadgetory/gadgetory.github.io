augmented its fancied top-shelf
smartphone with a ruggedized version for
outdoorsy types and for the third year
in a row
it's an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive in the US I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is an unboxing and quick look at the
samsung galaxy s6 active the first thing
I thought when popping the cover here is
that there must have been a mistake
the s6 active is so similar to the s5
active at first glance that I thought it
was the older phone but nope
check it out of the box and you realize
it's a little thinner a little sleeker
though that's not saying much and
there's no jungle camo paint job to be
seen at least not on our grey review
device the imitation rivets have been
carried over from predecessors to give
the s6 active that burly construction
site certified look and while the
rubberized back panel almost looks
removable it isn't usually that's not
reason to celebrate we like removable
batteries a lot but here it's actually a
big relief the galaxy s4 active
featured a famously finicky battery door
that led in water unless it was sealed
just right and last year's s5 active had
a similar problem with its hatches when
dropped on hard surfaces so omitting a
removable cover entirely was probably a
good move
also at 3,500 milliamp hours the battery
is much bigger than on the standard s6
and in a first for the active line it
can also be recharged wirelessly or
plugged into the included adaptive quick
charger without the need to fiddle with
a hatch cover the USB port here meets
the ip68 standard just like the
headphone jack so it can free flood when
the phone's underwater up to 1.5 meters
of it without damaging the hardware the
s6 active is also rated to military
standard 810g for impact resistance
which we'll explore more thoroughly in
the full review we'll also be taking a
look at Samsung and ATT's custom
software load here which means we've got
to boot the phone which means we need to
take off the screen protector quiet
please
the specs under the hood are almost all
the same as on the standard s6 by the
way screen size and res to processor to
camera and controlling the phone is just
like controlling the standard s6 as well
except physical keys replace the
capacitive ones for easier interactions
through gloves and so on there's also an
added active key above the volume
controls that allows for jumping right
into the activity zone which includes
everything from a compass to a
flashlight to a barometer you can also
assign specific apps to the active key
to be launched with a long or a short
press if that's more useful and AT&amp;amp;T has
also bundled its usage manager for
battery life RAM and connection
optimization in the coming days I'll be
testing the Galaxy s6 active in bad
weather and with power draining
applications like ingress to see how
that big battery stands some real
outdoorsy use let us know what you want
to know about the Galaxy s6 active and
we'll do our best to answer your
questions in our full review coming soon

earlier Galaxy S active coverage here on
