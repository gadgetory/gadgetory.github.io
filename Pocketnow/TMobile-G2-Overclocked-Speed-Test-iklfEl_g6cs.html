thought you'd like to see what you can
do with a fully rooted t-mobile g2 and
how fast you can make this thing go
let's take a look okay so here's my
t-mobile g2 I have applied the perma
route solution to it and I have also
downloaded and installed setcpu for root
users we're just going to cost you about
five dollars us but it lets you do some
cool things like set up profiles so when
my battery is under thirty five percent
I'm going to scale back my processor to
a maximum of seven hundred and sixty
eight megahertz and a minimum of 245 and
that scaling is going to be on demand
whenever an app needs it it's going to
scale up and go back down when my
battery is a little bit lower I'm going
to scale all the way up to a maximum of
3 68 and down to 2 45 and when my screen
is off I'm going to run it at the
absolute slowest so that I can recover
some of my battery life now I said
recover my battery life and why is that
well first and foremost take a look at
this I've got it scaled minimum 2 45 but
maximum at basically 1.5 gigahertz and I
have this set to performance mode
running at boot so let's go ahead and
take a look and see what this thing can
do now overclocked running cyanogenmod
bacon bits version 0.3 scaled all the
way up with a performance governor and
see where the score is in quadrant
alright so here is quadrant standard
let's go ahead and run the full
benchmark running it through now the
t-mobile g2 comes with what a lot of
people have complained to be a very very
slow 800 megahertz processor fortunately
for us it's the scorpion processor which
is the next generation or the current
one if you want to look at it that way
it is very fast in and of itself and
it's very very white if you will on i'm
using the battery in fact they decrease
the size of the battery unfortunately
which gives you even more run time but
running through quadrant you can see
here it's running at about 20 frames per
second on that test this one usually
scorers a bit better so its up into the
high 50s low six
these this one usually scorers a little
slower it's running about 20 23 frames
per second and just like that the test
is all over and looking at this so if
you can zoom in and see that the
quadrant benchmark score here is 2202
points now I have regularly been getting
over 2200 points on this device when
it's all the way up and it's just just
fabulous and I haven't noticed battery
life suffering at all not one bit but
that is with the performance governor I
want to run this one more time on what I
do every day then that's on demand which
basically means you can see here how the
speed is jumping up and down it doesn't
need much right now so it's 245 and as
it has processes it needs to run faster
it will speed up so let's give it
something that it really needs the whole
processor on shall we let's go back in
and let's run quadrant standard and
we'll go back here run the full
benchmark again this should perform a
little bit slower because that on demand
requires a response time when you're
running full performance you're running
full performance it's running out full
bore most of the time when you are
running on demand it's basically sitting
back and saying oh okay you need more
power let me give you more power well in
the small amount of time that it took
for this app which is again setcpu for
root users in the time that it took for
that app to notice that it needed more
speed and then scalar your processor up
of course that's going to impact the
speed that you you were running at for
those few milliseconds while it was
asking for for the faster speed speed
excuse me so we can see here it's
running still pretty good the frame
rates are about the same and it's really
when we get into the nuts and bolts are
that you'll see a difference and as you
can see right there a huge difference
huh 2210 it performed even faster when
it was in on-demand mode versus in
performance mode I don't know why that
is but it's been consistent so that
might be a little issue with the
governor that
we're using or it might just be this
device likes being able to ask for
things on demand and scale up quite a
bit faster but playing around with it
see which one of those governors really
works best for you but you know what for
a device that scored 1600 points when we
first got it now all the way up to 2,200
that's phenomenal okay now I got one
last little bit of goodness here you
ready for this this isn't even the
fastest Colonel out there they've got
another Colonel like we told you about
earlier that isn't well it isn't what
you'd call stable but it's more than
twice the clock speed that the phone
came with you can go all the way over
1900 megahertz and I can just imagine
the scores that you can get from that
hopefully we can get it to run stable
you at that speed but in the meantime
1.5 that's phenomenal and the phone
doesn't get warm it doesn't run hot the
battery life I haven't noticed any
problems at all if you do definitely let
me know in the comments if you've got a
different score that you want to report
leave that in the comments if you
haven't checked out our video channel to
see the other tests that we're running
with well unlocked phones and off the
shelf owns make sure you subscribe to
our video channel and you know if you
want to see more of these videos I like
positive encouragement the best way to
do that is with a big thumbs up to the
video you can click that down at the
bottom right now so showing you how fast
an overclocked t-mobile g2 can run I'm
