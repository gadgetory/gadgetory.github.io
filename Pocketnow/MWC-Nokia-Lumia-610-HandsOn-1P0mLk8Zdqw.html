pocketnow.com and we're here with the
Nokia Lumia 610 which just got announced
at mwc 2012 out of the box and well
we've got this little yoyo here that
makes it actually look nice it's a
pressed phone obviously but if you look
at the Nokia Lumia 610 this is obviously
a budget phone it's 189 eros just to buy
unlocked anywhere it's pretty much 250
bucks and you'll notice that well it's a
budget phone definitely but it doesn't
look cheap I mean it's got this sort of
sort of chrome finish around 3.5
millimeter headphone jack we've got the
microUSB port here these are they look
like land yard holes they could probably
be for noise cancellation could be
nothing on this side we've got a
microphone at the bottom nothing at the
bottom aside from that except for the
speaker looks a lot like the Nokia Lumia
710 we've got a 5 megapixel camera not
Carl sighs obviously we've got an LED
flash though good feature and this is
sort of rubberized then at the front we
don't have a clear black display here
but it's not bad at all even though it's
a budget phone I mean it performs just
as well as a windows phone though if you
look at the settings on this phone this
is a 256 megabyte Ram phone it's got 8
gigabytes of storage out of which only
four megabytes 1.5 gigabyte sorry of
storage or user accessible so you
remember that Nokia Maps and all the
other nokia music features available
take a lot of storage from your phone
you can actually use a remove them so
again this is a budget phone probably
not for everybody but if you're out
there for windows phone you're on a
tight budget you don't want to get into
a contract this probably your next phone
it comes out in blue this lovely pink it
also comes out in black white I believe
also yeah white and which other color
yeah and black as I mentioned earlier
and well again it doesn't look sluggish
at all let's try to launch the browser
let's see
you know it looks like the typical user
performance that we get in just about
any windows phone probably some things
are a little slower obviously the
network here is probably not the best
got a lot of people here at the booth at
nokia but aside from that well the phone
is cheap but it's not cheap looking so
again this is high memory let up in
parking now calm really good design from
nokia hopefully we'll see more phones
from here on thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
