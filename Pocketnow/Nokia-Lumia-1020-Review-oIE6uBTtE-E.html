of a flagship Windows Phone if that
sounds like an exciting combination to
you you're in the right place but how
well does this monster live up to its
PureView promise let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Nokia
Lumia 1020
we've already exhaustively covered the
1020 as it compares to its predecessor
the 920 and its Android contemporaries
the samsung galaxy s4 and the HTC One
you can find those comparison videos on
our channel page and follow PocketNow
and all the usual online watering holes
so you don't miss future ones but now
it's time to let the Lumia 1020 take the
stage by itself as we examine the ins
and outs of its hardware software and
it's one-of-a-kind camera as well as a
few test notes let's get to it
given the Lumia 1020 s model number it
should come as no surprise that it's
built closely resembles that of its
predecessor the 920 but like a sweet 80s
mullet the 1020 is business in the front
party in the back
the PureView camera module is made of
aluminum like the phone's few physical
buttons and it rises like an Oreo sized
pimple from the surrounding
polycarbonate ringed by a gentle slope
that tells your hands it's there before
you can smudge up the 41 megapixel
sensor lens with a fingertip it makes
the 1020 pretty awkward to hold but it
also reminds you of the principal reason
for the phone's existence every time you
pick it up and it does that without
resorting to the more absurd Hardware
design of say something like the galaxy
s4 zoom because remember from the front
it's hard to tell it apart from the 920
and it's surprisingly light and thin
given all the camera mechanicals packed
inside available colors at launch are
black white and our eye catching yellow
here all of them made of matte
polycarbonate that feels smooth and
futuristic in the hand counterbalancing
the smooth and glossy Gorilla Glass 3
protecting the display that screen is a
4.5 inch panel delivering WXGA
resolution about 334 pixels per inch and
vibrant rich
colors paired with stunningly dark
blacks it's a wonderful display outside
of the camera the rest of the internals
don't do much to rise above the pack now
that's par for the course with Windows
Phones which have never been demons on
the spec sheet though the 1020 does ship
with double the RAM of most other
windows phones and a barometer as part
of its sensor package otherwise the
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor at 1.5
gigahertz and the 32 gigs of non
expandable storage shouldn't surprise
you nor should the fact that neither the
storage nor the 2000 milliamp hour
battery are user accessible we're used
to embedded batteries at this point
after all you can always carry around an
external charger but the lack of either
microSD expansion or a 64 gig storage
option means you'll have to stay very
chummy with your SkyDrive account if
you're going to be taking lots of photos
with this phone but which you will and
more on that in a second Windows Phones
software experience is very consistent
across almost all hardware makes and
models and we're happy to report that
the 1020 runs the OS just as smoothly
and reliably as its predecessors with
all the hallmarks of the platform like
live tiles the modern UI design language
and Nokia's special suite of apps that
really do a nice job of completing the
Windows Phone experience we should also
note here that the Windows Store now
sports over a hundred and sixty thousand
available titles meaning you're more
likely than ever to be able to find the
apps you're looking for on the world's
third-largest mobile platform more
interestingly the 1020 is one of the
first units to ship with the combination
of Microsoft's GDR 2 and Nokia's amber
software updates meaning the 1020 offers
some of the enhancements we showed you
in our Lumia 925 review namely glance
mode is available if you want a
persistent clock on your standby screen
or if you want you can trigger it with a
hand wave and the promised DoubleTap to
unlock is here as well
you've also got the option to adjust the
temperature and saturation of your
display GDR 2 also brings a variety of
minor enhancements to the overall
Windows Phone experience sharpening up
media streaming in the browser enabling
the phone's FM radio and turning on data
sets the
sadly carriers still have to enable that
feature meaning it's nowhere to be found
on our AT&amp;amp;T Lumia 1020 here finally the
platform's deep SkyDrive integration is
as robust as ever and you're going to
need all the cloud storage you can get
if you're planning to use the 1020's
camera to its full extent the 41
megapixel shooter is a monster it
features a new motor-driven optical
image stabilization system a six element
lens and a xenon flash alongside the LED
focus light in its out of box shooting
mode it produces two photos for every
snapshot you take a raw 34 megapixel
shot usually around 10 megabytes and a
more manageable 5 megapixel photo which
is around 10 times smaller in terms of
file size because of that more petite
footprint the 5 megapixel version of the
photo is the one you're going to share
with friends and social media over the
network even at the reduced size the
1020 s photos pack much more quality
than a typical 5 megapixel photo because
of over sampling which means that each
pixel in the 5 megapixel image has been
created using data from up to 7
surrounding pixels so rather than being
just a publicity stunt
the Lumias huge 41 megapixel sensor is
actually being utilized effectively to
create wonderful pictures the results
speak for themselves
but there's more to of the PureView
experience so we'll talk about that as
you soak in the imagery the 1020 also
continues Nokia's excellence in the
field of low-light photography using a
combination of longer exposure time and
the optical image stabilization to
brighten dim photos without overdoing it
the Nokia pro camera software does this
automatically in the default shooting
mode but if you want you can also
manually control the usual ISO exposure
and white balance levels as well as
settings most smartphones don't give you
access to like manual focus adjustment
and shutter speed that's a serious suite
of customizations and if you're just a
casual user they might seem a little
intimidating at first to be honest we're
still honing our technique after almost
a week but thankfully there's a helpful
tutorial at nearly every turn
and once you know what you're doing
you'll be able to capture some
outstanding photos with the pro cam
application of course Nokia's smart cam
app is here as well
offering useful effects like action
shots photo bomber removal motion blur
and so on in the usual catalog of lenses
is available as well while we like these
features we wish smart cam and other
lenses like cinemagraph could somehow
have been bundled into the program to
streamline the experience as it stands
now you have to plan your shots ahead if
you want to use the smart cam features
and in any case you need to factor in
the added time for the camera to open
all that hardware and software takes a
few beats to wake up and it takes a few
seconds to save photos between shots as
well video performance is excellent as
well in full 1080p mode with crisp
imagery and rich color outside though we
were a bit surprised at how much the
image seemed to bounce even on a simple
walk down the sidewalk or up or down
some stairs
Nokia's rich recording means audio
capture is extremely clear even in noisy
environments we didn't have tickets to a
concert during the review period so we
sampled the sound suppression at a local
subway station in three recording modes
this is talking at normal volume with
and no audio filters at all again volume
approaching train no audio filter this
is train arriving with audio filter set
train arriving an audio filter is set to
the strong audio filter
turn
200 kilohertz setting the audio filter
is set to strong as the centerpiece of
the Lumia 1020 experience
Nokia's newest PureView camera is
exemplary it's not always going to give
you the perfect shot every time but it
definitely outclasses every other
smartphone shooter on the US market
while it's not quite as simple to use as
most other phone cameras that's because
it's capable of so much more if you're
like us carrying the 10 20 will make you
want to be a better photographer just so
you can live up to the potential of the
device we tested the Lumia 1020 over the
course of five days in and around the
Greater Boston area outside the camera
experience it was a lot like using a
Lumia 920 network speeds were excellent
over LTE and serviceable on 3G voice
performance was adequate on both ends of
phone calls and the speakerphone
provided just enough oomph to blast our
Spotify Tunes or loudspeaker calls
across a room of course we always wish
speakers were louder and that holds true
here as well we're glad the Lumia 1020
ships with two gigs of RAM but it's an
open question as to whether that's
enough for the pro cam app it typically
runs fairly well but we've run into a
few stammers and stutters here and there
and on one occasion the app crashed the
phone requiring a soft restart that's
not a great sign and we've seen the
issue crop up on other sites reviews as
well so we hope it's one nokia addresses
quickly because I nobody got time for
that we'd be lying if we said we didn't
miss wireless charging we do the 10 20s
USB port is especially hard to find in
the dark for some reason and we're not
keen on adding even more bulk to the 10
20s frame with a wireless charging case
fortunately battery life seems about
average given our testing so far see our
full review at pocket now for more
specific endurance figures but in a
depletion test we were able to get to 11
hours of moderate to heavy use before
the low battery warning came up the more
you use that beast of a camera the
faster your power will drain so shoot
sparingly
the Lumia 1020 exists as a smartphone
vehicle for its 41 megapixel camera that
feature is the centerpiece of the
phone's entire experience and the
device's success or failure in the US
will ride on how well it's accepted by
consumers that's a tough thing to
predict given the relatively low impact
of the Nokia and Windows Phone brands in
America and the phone's high price point
of to $99.99 on contract exclusively
with AT&amp;amp;T but being able to say you've
got a 41 megapixel phone appeals to a
specific set of folks and being able to
back up the talk with walk appeals to
nearly everyone
Nokia's latest achieves what it sets out
to do that is to say it's camera
demolishes the competition if you're
someone who prioritizes camera
performance above all else when shopping
for a new smartphone the 1020 should be
at the very top of your list and it
deserves a very long look even if it
might require jumping platforms or
carriers to pick it up we give the Nokia
Lumia 1020 an eight point nine out of
ten folks that's going to do it for our
Lumia 1020 video review stay tuned for
our written review which will be
available on July 26th at pocketnow.com
visit us there for that but before you
go check out our other videos here on
YouTube including comparisons with the
Lumia 920 the galaxy s4 and the HTC One
as well as a camera tour some other 1020
videos coming up we are far from done
with this device toss us a like if you
did enjoy the video leave us a comment
down below if you have something to say
and thank you as always for watching
