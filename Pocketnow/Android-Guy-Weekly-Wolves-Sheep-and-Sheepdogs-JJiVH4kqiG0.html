about who uses technology today now the
way I've looked at it there are pretty
much two types of users you've got the
people who just used the technology
because it's there and it makes their
lives easier and then you've got the
people who are really enthusiastic about
it these are your developers your
hackers your XDA developers and your fan
boys they're not all the same but they
share a lot of similarities so in this
episode of the android guy weekly we're
going to talk a little bit about that
and a little bit about how that might
mirror what we're seeing in well the
world around us and maybe even a little
bit of politics too it's going to be fun
let's go take a look so we're going to
try and talk about politics and
technology and sheep and all in the same
video and we're going to have to kind of
be a little bit fast and high-level
doing it so let's level the playing
field when I say smartphones and tablets
I'm talking about smartphones and
tablets not any particular OS or vendor
or anything like that we're also not
going to be talking about political
parties or positions don't worry about
that we're going to more be talking
about your state of mind and how you see
the world around you and I know that
doesn't sound technological at all but
this is pocket now so we're going to use
a tech heavy metaphor here but we're
going to try and expand our perspectives
by bringing in some politics and some
animal husbandry as well that's sound
good it should be interesting to say the
least so we have a tablet okay this
tablet is running an OS and it's being
used by essentially two different groups
of people so if you go down to the store
and buy this tablet who knows we'll just
call it the tablet you're going to be
one of two types of people you're either
going to be a user somebody who is
probably saw commercial or has a friend
who has one and say hey I want that
tablet because it'll make my life easier
happy or fun or better it'll make me
sexier look better and smarter and all
that stuff
you know everything that the TV tells us
that that product will do for us so we
go and get it we buy and we like it you
know and everything's great and it's
fine we don't know how it works or why
it works we just know it works and
that's that's good and that's all that
matters because we're that type of
person the other type of person is
somebody like me now I'm the guy who
does a lot of research who asks a lot of
hard questions reads a lot of reviews
actually gets hands on the device and
does some of the most reviews in South
whether or not you agree with my reviews
that's a different topic but I go into
this with my own bias and my own things
that I'm looking for and I do the
research and I come up with the best
decision for me a fully informed
decision you see I'm not a sheep this is
the animal husbandry part I'm not a
sheep I don't just go blindly by and
accept that everything is happy around
me and trust in everything around me I
do my research and I make sure that what
I'm getting is best for me and that I
know all of the advantages and more
importantly all the disadvantages that
come with it and that's how I make my
decision that's how a lot of this type
of person does this type of person is
more fully informed than the Sheep okay
so that's that's kind of where we are
now animal husbandry let's get into that
a little bit okay and before we do that
I'm not saying either side is bad I'm
not saying that the sheep are bad no pun
intended there they're not that's just
who they are and that's just fine and
you might be in that same group 2 i'm
going to tell you why that might be a
problem what dangers to look out for on
the other side of the fence it's not all
peachy over here either because on this
side of the fence we've got developers
we've got techniques we've got reviewers
we've got you know all these people
people who make brahms really smart
folks by the way they're really really
knowledgeable about this subject they
know a lot they use technology to
advance something that's the big
something with a big fat asterisk next
to it you see on this side of the fence
we don't have sheep we have wolves and
we have sheep dogs and they look not a
lot of light to the sheet by the way
they both are kind of dog looking have
long snout have ears have big teeth
claws the whole thing they look the same
to the sheep and the Sheep really don't
like either one of them but the Sheep do
tolerate the sheepdogs the wolves wolves
are bad they're bad news okay because
the wolves you see the wolves are the
developers who write stuff that either
exploits things on the phone whether
that's an Adobe product like a flash
exploit or a Java exploit or they write
an app that is deliberately written to
steal stuff from you whether that's
information or money they're bad guys
they're doing stuff for their own gain
at your expense then you got the
sheepdogs sheepdogs hey I have an app i
wrote a nap here you go it's an app my
app by the way sucks if you want to go
out and look at it it's what day is it
Rebecca Black just search for that back
one Rebecca Black was popular me and a
couple other friends got together and in
literally two hours we have this app all
put together submit it to the store and
an hour later we were distributing
copies of that app luckily I didn't
charge for it because it sucks but you
can go out and see it is just some of us
guys you know we just put it all
together we didn't mean anything by it
we're just having fun nothing malicious
at all but we know what to look out for
it we're the good guys were the
sheepdogs again sheep don't necessarily
like us as we look like the wolves but
it's out there now the sheep dogs do
something different for the Sheep they
live amongst the Sheep they protect the
sheep from going to places they
shouldn't and if the wolves come around
the sheepdog are there to fight back to
protect the Sheep that's just what we do
again she don't necessarily like us but
they put up with us because we're the
good guys so that takes us to our
markets okay and this is where we go
back into technologies Apple and
Microsoft both have markets that if you
want to get an app into it you have to
submit it to them and they have to
prove it Google on the other hand you
write an app you submit it to them it's
in the market the end now of course if
it's malicious Google will remove it
forcefully not only from the market but
from any devices that it was installed
upon but it's reactive that implies that
the Apple and Microsoft way is proactive
that during that approval process
they're taking an opportunity to go
through and make sure that all apps
submitted to them are not malicious in
any way shape or form and that let me be
frank is not the case they may try to do
that in their defense but they cannot
guarantee with one hundred percent
certainty that every app that you get
from their official stores is clean that
it is not malicious but the implication
is there people think that they're safer
which is dangerous as soon as you think
that someone else is taking care of your
security for you that's where you get
into problems because if there is any
failure whether it is deliberate whether
it is intentional or whether it is
accidental any fault they're affects you
now in this case that's just a nap it's
just you know your money it's just your
information which is important but when
we get over into politics real world
politics and governments that's when it
goes from your money and whatnot into
your livelihood maybe even your life hey
so we're not going to spend too much
time there but it would be very very
advisable to this sheep to get to know
the sheepdogs to understand more about
these things so they don't have that
false sense of security just because
it's an apple product doesn't make it
safe just because it's a Microsoft
product doesn't make it safe that said
Android is not inherently unsafe you see
they all have this market to them this
market approach where you can rank
things you can rate things you could
submit ratings and
feedback so you go to the market you
look for what day is it Rebecca Black
you're going to see it doesn't rank very
high but there's nobody who's made any
comment saying that it's doing anything
malicious see what you did just then you
went out you did a little bit of
research you didn't take somebody for
you know face value you didn't put your
safety in someone else's hands you took
the initiative you found out and you
said this looks okay now that's not to
say that it is ok but you did an extra
step you did that research and you found
out and guess what if you download it
and it does something that it shouldn't
it's time for you to stop being a sheep
and start being a sheepdog and you start
letting people know that hey you submit
a poor review on it please don't do that
to my app it can't take any more poor
reviews you then let the market
administrators know if you don't know
how to do that and I'm not going to tell
you because I want you to learn for
yourself that's part of this whole
mentality this whole mindset thing if
you don't know how to do that you find
out and you say this particular app is
bad it did this this and this to me you
let them know because you are protecting
the rest of the flock hey you're not
letting other people do that for you you
are doing it for yourself and then for
other people as well that's the
mentality change that's what I want you
to get when you go out and get a new
smartphone when you get a new tablet
don't be sold on well this is safer
because it says it's safer or this is
safer because the market has all the
apps pre reviewed and prescreened before
they're approved don't do that be
smarter than that do what you're doing
right now watch videos get educated go
to websites I've got a couple that I
could recommend pocketnow.com we try and
let you know all this stuff we can't do
all of it though so make sure you go out
and get a broad range of opinions hey
find out for yourself and become
educated that's where we want you I know
my screen just went off so that's where
we want you to start participating to
join in that's what this segment is a
out to get you thinking get you thinking
about all of this stuff and
participating be part of the discussion
come across from being a sheep to being
a sheepdog and start making this whole
ecosystem safer for everybody and not
just safer I mean safety is vitally
important but beyond safety then is
going to become where we make our
advances where we get better where we do
all this stuff from one another and we
we not them not whoever they are we
become the driving force because these
are our technologies these are our
platforms we may not have the patents we
may not have the assembly plants but we
have the dollars we have the microphones
we have the keyboards we have the input
and we have the ability to vote on what
we accept and what we don't accept and
we're going to do that and we're going
to be active not just me you're
recruited to so if you're on board with
this concept give the video a big thumbs
up if you're not on board yet that's
okay because the more people who join
this cause the safer you're going to be
in the better your products are going to
be you can continue to be a sheep we're
not going to hold that against you
that's fine but if you want to be safer
if you want to be more informed if you
want to have a say in how this goes will
welcome you over here with the rest of
the sheepdogs anytime you want kind of a
different episode today and I do hope
that I kind of brought a different
perspective to things we don't do this
all that often and really the android
guy weekly is the only forum where we
even attempt anything like that but we
want to hear from you and I up in the
night because I could be absolutely
might be and if that's the case comments
down below if however you think that
this was a good video and that it's a
good message not just protect but for
perspective in general
here's your your assignment your
homework comment down below and thumbs
up the video definitely we always
recommend that okay but share it with a
friend share it with five friends and
after you've shared it with them get
them to share it with fine we need more
people thinking not just buying and
being led along but thinking let's do
that this week's experiment let me know
how it goes in the comments thanks for
your time and for your patience with
this episode it was a little bit longer
than I intended it to go but a lot to
talk about when you're talking
philosophically and I appreciate you
being part of the discussion I really do
4-pocket now and the android guy weekly
I'm Joe Levi
