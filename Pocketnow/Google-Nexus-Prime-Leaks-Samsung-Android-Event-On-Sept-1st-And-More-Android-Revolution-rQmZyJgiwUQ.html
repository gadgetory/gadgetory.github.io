first as is all waiting leaks of an LG
and lion and a samsung google nexus
prime coming to verizon and samsung
hives the cyanogenmod founder all this
and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm high Meadow be better
with talking out out common welcome to
android revolution the show we wrap up
what's hot and what's not inside of
Google's Android project let's start
this week off what's hot Samsung has
been teasing us with an event planned
for September first in Berlin and
judging by the marketing campaign we can
definitely guess that it has to do with
smartphones and that it has to do with
Android sadly there are no details as to
anything else except for the fact that
there is an application called unpacked
that you could get at the android market
for free that will give you details on
the events so remember to hit us up on
pocketnow.com for details of whatever
gets released on September first because
we'll definitely be covering it
completely and while following up on
rumors are man Evan blast which is our
expert in leaks all foreign and domestic
has hooked us up with images of the LGN
line which is probably going to hit a
couple of carriers in the US they'll
bring a slide-out keyboard but it seems
to be a mid-range device because it will
be carrying a hundred dollar price tag
it'll probably be released on august
25th and many are also waiting for the
AT&amp;amp;T LG thrill 4g and even though
targets got some billboards that it'll
be costing 80 bucks somehow not sure how
we still don't have any specific based
on when it will be released hopefully it
will be soon we also have images of the
sony ericsson xperia arc which got
leaked and white and the play which God
leaked in orange not really sure what
these designers are thinking of what
they come up with these colors but
anyways rumors of a samsung powered
google nexus prime have been coming up
around there and the cool thing here is
that first of all it will be made by
samsung not motorola let's be clear on
that and second of all it's interesting
that whoever saw this phone start
carrying a 720p screen resolution can
you imagine that 720p is allowed we're
currently a qHD I mean and the retina
display 720p is the resolution of a
typical 50-inch plasma if you could
think of that that's amazing and well we
also have probabilities of this sprint
galaxy s2 being announced somehow
somewhere it seems to be called a galaxy
within for sprint but not really sure on
that just yet but there are also rumors
of an epic touch 4g being launched on
September 9 so make sure you write that
down on your account
they're an well stay tuned of a droid HD
not really sure what to make of that
because there are also rumors of a dyin
Eric codename device from Motorola and
well it seems to be bringing a 4.5 inch
screen with 720p resolution also all
really good devices let's see what
Samsung brings to the table on their
September first event probably they're
going to make that google nexus prime
720p resolution screen official and
probably those other lease can hold
water after that out of the smartphone
releases for the week we have the sony
ericsson bring their gingerbread powered
walkman which has a cool design and all
but it actually disappoints with the
spec sheet because it's a single core
one do you hurts device that barely has
hvga resolution in this decade where
that was last decade and LG finally
makes official their optimus sol which
is a mid-range device single core wound
hurts processor the usual specs no
pricing yet nor us availability either
because that thing's going to Europe
Central America and South America not
sure when we're going to get it in the
United States probably partly going to
get a variant or something like that
also the mid-range in cheap sanson
conquer 4g was also released recently
and well it will bring you why max for a
cheap price really good device for those
people who are interested in 4g but not
really wanting to pay the price for it
and well make sure you also catch on
anton's full review of the lg optimus 3d
which made it 4.5 out of 5 star review
really good device actually and also
we're covering the deke Adams is
actually covering the samsung galaxy tab
10.1 for jeep will reisen also a really
cool device really good video reviews as
of now out of the software updates for
the week we have a more advanced version
of the swype keyboard making it two more
devices than just the exclusive sprint
nexus s 4g not sure why but apparently
it has to do with the fact that people
at XDA were able to pull the application
and offer it for free so it's currently
free of you want to sign up for the beta
remember please do that because most
probably will decide to sell it you'll
probably get a deal if you were an early
beta tester aside from that well google
has just released a version of their
Maps application it's currently in
version 5.9 and it brings you transit
notifications and also bubble buttons
it's got a lot of really other cool
features so make sure you update because
it's free and finally we have firefox
mobile 6 which also brings some of the
really good new features that it's
brought to the desktop version of
firefox to the mobile version so make
sure you get it because it's also a free
application in the android market and
well we've got a rare dark site this
week so first of all let's start with
the good news the HTC EVO 3ds bootloader
just got unlocked so make sure you start
playing with that if you have the device
definitely really cool news but on the
rare side Samsung just hired Steve
Kondik if you don't know who he is well
he's the famous founder of the signage
in modern well he promises that he'll
continue bringing really cool new things
for samsung devices but not everybody
wants a Samsung device a lot of people
are into HTC Sense and just about
everything else so not really sure what
to make up Steve's higher and Samsung
we're definitely happy for you it's
definitely worth it for you I mean you
you definitely deserve it but let's just
hope that Sammy remembers to give you or
allow you to have a side job and
continue with the signage in mod because
not really sure what to expect for the
platform after you leave buddy okay so
that does it for what's hot that's
consider on with what's not and let's
continue talking about some fake things
that are happening in the android world
first of all Joe Levi our editor
recently found the counterfeit version
of plants vs zombies the game in the
android market and it's a completely
fake knock off a Chinese fig knockoff of
the real version that cost three books
in the amazon appstore and well even
though this version of plants vs zombies
is free it's kind of a slap in the face
to a developer that you allow a fake
application to be ported in your Android
marking when you're supposed to be
protecting developers and you know in my
personal opinion it could be a life of
persons life's work for an application
to be published and then having somebody
discounter for tonight I don't think
that should be allowed in the android
market in well aside from that you
remember some images some retail images
that we posted up an hcc vigor being
supposedly coming out soon well sadly
those were fake imagine this this was
these were images
an HTC Sensation with a google nexus one
screen you know sadly counterfeit stuff
but still you know hcc you could
probably draw this down because the
phone actually kind of looked good you
probably consider that for a future
design that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm high
metadi better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
