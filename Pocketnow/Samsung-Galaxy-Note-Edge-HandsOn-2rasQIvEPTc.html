now and we are here in Berlin at
Samsung's unpacked event where it just
announced the Galaxy Note 4 but
alongside that device we got an
additional little prize the Galaxy Note
edge samsung has been teasing this
display that just kind of flows over the
edge of the device and they call it
thusly the edge display um it just kind
of wraps around the edge of the phone
and it gives you an additional bar of
information so whether it's
notifications or status for stocks or
your s health information or just your
home screen bar which gives you
shortcuts to some of your most used apps
so you have some functionality there you
can even check your your notifications
with a certain case which we couldn't
find any displays up but it does give
you some additional functionality we're
not certain how much functionality
you're actually going to get out of this
but Samsung seems to think there's a lot
behind it and that this is innovative
and it's gonna change the way that we
use our phones as far as design goes
this phone looks and feels a lot like
the Galaxy Note 4 it's very similar it
has the leather around back it has the
same button configuration on the front
and it just looks very similar say for
the display which kind of floats over
the right edge and even on paper these
two phones are very very similar they
have pretty much all the same
specifications except the Galaxy Note
edge comes with a smaller battery 3000
milliamp hours versus the 3220 milliamp
hours on the galaxy note 4 it has two
sort options 32 gigabytes or 64
gigabytes and it's display if you factor
in the curve and all of that is just a
hair smaller it's 5.6 inches whereas the
Galaxy Note 4's is 5.7 of course they're
both quad HD if I've come with three
gigabytes of RAM the same chipsets
pretty much everything else is exactly
the same under the hood
even the cameras which is a three point
seven megapixel front camera that's F
1.9 and it is a ninety degree wide angle
camera so that's very good especially if
you're into taking selfies and the rear
camera is 16 megapixels with Hardware
stabilization something we've been
begging say
some to do for the longest time and of
course being a galaxy note this thing
does come with an S Pen and all of the
new S Pen features like smart select
which we found to be very helpful it
also has the new multi window feature
and much much more especially
considering the curve display and what
other features it will bring in the
future but so far this is a pretty
interesting thing it I think it's more
interesting because it's different than
anything else and oh one more thing with
that display bleeding over on the right
edge the power button can't go there
anymore so the power button on this
phone is actually on the top so that
might turn some of you away now that
we'll see but stay tuned to more IVA
coverage here in Berlin on the PocketNow
channel and until next time I'm Taylor
Martin and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
