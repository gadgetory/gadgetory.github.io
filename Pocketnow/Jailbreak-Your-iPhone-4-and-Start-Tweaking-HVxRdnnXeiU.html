pocketnow.com if you've been waiting to
jailbreak your iPhone now is a really
good time even if you have an iPhone 4
the reason being that a new web-based
jailbreaking tool is just released it
allows you to jailbreak your phone in
less than 2 minutes it's incredibly easy
I'll talk about it in a second now the
reason that jailbreaking is so
interesting is because it allows you to
load on third-party applications that
can change the entire iPhone experience
and really fix all of the problems
relating to the iPhone that Apple still
hasn't fixed for example the lockscreen
after you jailbreak you can download an
application that will allow you to put
new messages on your lockscreen the
weather sports score is really giving
your all that empty space some life
another thing you can do after you
jailbreak is add five icons to the
bottom dock instead of just four like
Apple thinks you should have and another
thing that you can do after you
jailbreak is load themes onto your
iPhone and make it look a lot different
than any other iPhone out there it seems
that every iPhone is just icon after
icon because that's how Apple thinks
your eye your iPhone should look so in
this video I want to tell you what I've
done
after jailbreaking my iPhone let's get
to it
now of course jailbreaking isn't for
everyone it voids your warranty although
you can always restore your phone back
to the way it was before you jailbroke
and also many people that have
jailbroken their iphone 3gs or below
find that the device gets slower and
battery life gets compromised now with
the iPhone 4 which has a bigger battery
and a faster CPU this is not really the
case I've been using many different
tweaks and my battery life hasn't been
affected that much it definitely has
been a little bit but not enough to
where I wouldn't want to keep it
jailbroken so let's talk about some of
the things that I did I'm no expert on
this and I'm kind of a beginner so what
I have here on my lock screen is a
couple of things I've got to look into
my email and you can add multiple email
accounts and I also have the weather I
can tap on one of these emails and bring
up a quick view which is really awesome
so I don't have to unlock my device to
read this email or to know that I have a
new email from somebody that I do or do
not want to hear from so it's very
convenient to have that but unlock the
device now and I've got a few tweaks
done here for example I've changed the
carrier name up here to pocket now with
a simple program called mi M make it
mine now I took away all of the the
labels here with a program called winter
face down here and I'll talk about that
in a minute
now there's a few other tweaks that I
made that I want to talk about but first
let me go into Safari and show you how
to jailbreak your iPhone it can be an
iPad 2 now okay so I'm going to go to
jailbreak me calm and by the way I also
have a new message notification in the
upper right corner that's something you
don't get out of the box but it makes a
lot of sense you should be able to see
within a glance from any program whether
you have a new email Android lets you do
this Windows Mobile lets you do this I
mean you should be able to do that on
the iPhone so here you go this is how
you jailbreak your phone you slide it
and within two minutes you'll have a new
program that is called Cydia and of
course without the labels you can't tell
but this one is Cydia and basically it's
like a parallel app store that has tons
of free applications that allow you to
tweet your iPhone now something else
that I've done here
is with a tap and a hold of the center
button I get this quick launch area at
the top where I can instantly toggle on
and off Wi-Fi Bluetooth cellular data I
can get to the brightness to control
within a touch without having to dig
into the settings menu on the iPhone
another thing I've done is added a
program I believe it's called 5 icon
Docs so that you know down here there's
only four icons allowed well actually
you can do five with this little
application granted they get a little
bit scrunched up especially if you have
a mail notification there but it's
pretty cool now you can have five icons
in your dock so I'm going to bring that
back out here
something else that is super key when
you when you jailbreak your iPhone is to
get a program that is called my-y now
this actually cost money if you want to
use it more than just for a couple of
days but it turns your iPhone into a
portable hotspot and this has been the
case this has been available on Windows
Mobile and Android for a very long time
but you can't do this with the iPhone
out of the box but when your jailbreak
you can download this application you
got to make sure you have an unlimited
data planner you're also you're going to
go over pretty quickly but it works very
well I tested this earlier with my
laptop I was getting 1.5 megabits per
second down and about 1.4 megabits per
second up critical awesome application
to have once you jailbreak your iPhone
ok what I do want to do now quickly go
into Cydia which is sort of the the
parallel application store it's hard to
describe but it lets you download these
third-party applications that change the
functionality of your device quite
dramatically so I'm going to go over
here into sections this lists all the
applications a lot of this is free
there's another more premium application
I guess repository you would call it
called rock which has a lot of for pay
applications things that cost you know
two five dollars so let's go down to
something here and find something that
would be interesting so let's go to say
themes and a hundred percent wooden
theme that could be interesting or maybe
not and so sometimes it loads a
description here it is a winterboard
theme is fully wooden and this is what
it looks like so it just simply
has wood in the background nothing
terribly spectacular I'm gonna click
install and confirm and it's about 444
Killip kilobits kilobytes ok and it's
done so now I'm going to go to winter
face which is that application that
allows you to load themes it's sort of a
central application and I keep calling
the winter face it's called winter board
told you I was new at this so I'm going
to select theme I'm going to check off a
wooden theme and now I'm going to click
respring and that will refresh the
interface this takes about 10 seconds
and I should have the wooden theme
sometimes this doesn't always work you
have to be patient and finding the right
ones hmm interesting ok so all this did
is change the wallpaper in some cases
it'll totally change the icons how big
look so that was a quick look at what
I've done to my iPhone within about 24
hours of jailbreaking there's a lot to
learn it's a little bit confusing but
I'd say that at this point it's safe
there are a lot of things out there that
you can do to impact your iPhone to make
the experience a lot more interesting so
just as a recap what I did is I used in
telescreen to do the widgets on the lock
screen I used a program called SB
settings to get the drop down menu from
up here I used winter face to load
themes I use something called mi m to
change the carrier up here and I also
used a program called 5 icon doc to
allow me to place 5 icons in the doc on
the bottom of the screen here so please
leave a comment if you've done anything
interesting with your jailbroken iPhone
and be sure to give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it that's it for now
