and in this video we're gonna do a
hardware tour of the Nokia Lumia 900 for
18 t let's check it out
so here we are with these Lumia 900 now
let's take a quick look around the
device let's start up here there's your
Nokia logo a front-facing camera some
light sensors there's your speaker
grille 18 t logo at the bottom we have
our capacitive buttons back Start screen
search over here are all of our hardware
buttons volume up and down power is
right there in the middle camera button
now the camera button is very flush it
doesn't stick out that much and it's a
little bit hard to tell what is a half
press and what is a full press but it
works pretty well actually now at the
top you have your micro USB port a
headphone jack and this is the SIM card
slot but we need the special key to pop
it open so it comes out like that and
you want to hold it this way
and your SIM card and what what is that
a QR code not sure why that's there or
what that does but okay let's put it
back together and on this side it's just
straight polycarbonate pretty nice and
smooth on the bottom we have a speaker
and on the back we have your eight
megapixel Carl Zeiss lens and camera
with an F 2.2 Apter and the 28
millimeter equivalent wide-angle field
of view with a dual LED flash and the
back is really nice very smooth now the
texture the way to the I would describe
the texture is it feels kinda like paper
I mean you know it's plastic it's very
sturdy but that it's a very matte
texture mm-hmm seems to get a little bit
of fingerprints there now something else
about the screen that it's it's
different than the 800 it's very flat
and there's a little Ridge around the
edges the lumen 800 was very smooth very
contoured with the shape of the
polycarbonate body this one you you have
a very noticeable edge you can see it
over here too now I think the advantage
that is that it might protect the screen
a little bit better if you drop it like
that
now our review unit is in the black on
April 8th this will be available in the
black and the cyan blue color so that
you can get a version in this color this
is the Lumia 710 but that's a good
example of what your color options are
going to be so you can imagine this in
this color and that'll be one of your
choices
20 second a white version of this will
also be available in the 18 t stores not
online however the black and the cyan
versions will be available online as
well as the stores so one of the special
things about this is that it has 18 t 4G
LTE
so let's do a little speed test the
speed will depend on your location of
course so over here we're getting about
eight and we're getting about nine point
three download speeds over here we're
getting two points eight upload but only
a very slow upload on the 18 TLT now for
benchmarks we're getting some pretty
decent scores you see the Lumia 900
about 89 or so so it's a little faster
than a lot of devices but not as fast as
some likely tightened now let's look at
the display so here's the Lumia 900
right next to the Samsung Focus s with
their Super AMOLED display and let's add
check out let's comparison of course
we're looking pretty close let's look at
the blacks
very close again both of these are on
their highest brightness level so we see
a little bit of difference in the whites
color ramp very close slightly different
white levels here tor seems pretty
consistent now let's see it compared to
the Lumia 710 on t-mobile this is not an
AMOLED display so we should see some
differences here you can see this one is
a bit blacker the better blacks on this
one colors green ice now again both of
these are highest brightness and we see
much brighter whites over here now let's
do the and you can see quite a color
shift with the Lumia 710 the camera so
far I've only done a few little tests be
sure to check out the review the full
review for some more in-depth
comparisons but it seems pretty much the
same as the Lumia 800 which is good I
have a front-facing camera as a this
includes a wide-angle camera on the
front so instead of just getting a video
call of up your nose you can you'll
probably be able to see you know the
whole person space and maybe two people
so overall I'm really enjoying the feel
of this device I really like the
ergonomics if you hold it with your left
hand you can touch all the buttons with
your fingers over here and it's really
well designed so that's it for our
hardware tour of the Nokia Lumia 900 I'm
sure to check out our full review and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
