there will be a better FaceTime in
addition to better iPads in 2019 we hear
that Samsung is already considering
killing the iris scanner for obvious
reasons and if you have an iPhone 5 it's
about to become obsolete in ways you
don't want I'm high metal Iveta and the
only problem with app having so many
t-shirts is not remembering which one I
used two weeks ago and making this
boring
this is bogging out daily sponsored by
ting the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for
devices like the iPhone 10s or iPhone 10
eBay currently has some very interesting
first minute deals that are gonna work
between November 1st and November 11th
where depending on what you're looking
for you get up to $100 off devices like
the iPhone 10s you can learn more in the
description
now speaking of iPhones there are some
sad news when it comes to planned
obsolescence kind of understandable I
mean if you're currently rocking an
iPhone 4s or an iPhone 5 that device is
apparently about to be considered
obsolete or should I say it's already
considered obsolete meaning there are no
parts for it you can't get any repairs
you definitely need a new phone I mean I
think the iPhone 5 is what like six
years old iPhone 4s is from 2010 that
would be eight years old I still have an
iPhone 4s and I love that phone but
there are also Macs on this list so
follow the link in the description if
you want to see that now let's talk
about the samsung galaxy f aka the
possible foldable device that we should
hear about over the next few days at the
Samsung you know developer conference
we've got model names being leaked and
firmware and the most interesting part
are the specs things like 512 gigs of
storage and also the fact that sources
claimed that samsung has been working
really hard with Google with Google on
how Android is going to work on this
phone / tablet which I'm really happy
for because we've seen this whole idea
of making a phone into a tablet with
terrible implementation now let's move
the spotlight over to Samsung as we've
got other trusted sources claiming that
that iris scanner that can become very
annoying every now and then
is no longer going to be part of devices
that could be the case of the Galaxy S
10 for example why well I love the whole
concept of how secure the iris scanner
is but we have to admit it's like really
bad when it comes to its implementation
and just how well it does and you know
scanning your eye and everything it's
just it's clunky sometimes it doesn't
work it's not reliable
so Samsung is working hard on things
like the on display fingerprint scanner
we hear rumors of a possible phase ID
that could could not I don't think it's
gonna happen I think it's gonna be more
the on display fingerprint scanner and
with the testing that we've been doing
on devices like the oneplus 60 and the
huawei mate 20 Pro I have a lot of good
positive vibe for that and finally the
hot news today I have to do with Apple
and predictions for what to expect in
the future it's hard to deny that at
Apple's event not everything that we
were expecting was announced things like
air power new air pods and surely we
wanted an upgrade to the iPad Mini
because the current one is what four
years old so according to me she quo it
seems that we are getting new iPads and
a replacement to that iPad Mini but that
doesn't seem to be happening until late
next year we also hear that there will
be a significantly improved version of
face ID things like 3d modeling also
coming and apparently the next iPad pros
will be able to support it a lot of
things that are focused on iPad and it
gives me I don't know let me know in the
questions today what do you think I mean
do you care about iPads I like I
currently have a nine point seven inch
iPad pro which I use for this video and
surely I want the new iPad pros but my
iPad still works great I mean is this
like what we've seen right now enough
