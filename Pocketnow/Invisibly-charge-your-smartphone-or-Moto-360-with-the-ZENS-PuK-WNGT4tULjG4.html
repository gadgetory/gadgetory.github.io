about its utility you've got to admit
it's a pretty awesome feature if you
like a certain futuristic Flair if you
own a Nokia Lumia a Nexus 5 or a moto
360 smartwatch you've probably used
wireless charging with a cradle or a
dock but what if you could charge
wirelessly and invisibly I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
quick look at the Zen's puck Zen's is
the dutch outfit behind wireless
charging products we've featured before
notably the portable speaker iphone flip
case and car charger all these are based
on the Qi charging standard and the
Zen's puck is no different it's an 80
millimeter aluminium cylinder with seven
inductive charging coils mounted in a
flower petal pattern and a simple power
adapter that plugs into the wall the
coils are visible behind the plastic
here because you're never meant to see
this component the puck is made to live
inside a desk table or a countertop with
its existence called out by either a
plastic landing pad or a simple sticker
or nothing at all as ends sent us a
sample kit including the puck itself to
countertop cross-sections AC wall plug
and the installation tools namely two
Phillips head screws we provided the
screwdriver Lumia icon and Moto 360 as
well as the testing venue now I didn't
have any furniture I could drill holes
in because all my furniture is made of
rich mahogany so I tested the puck
mainly on the provided samples it worked
as well as any cheat charger with a nice
wide charging area so precision wasn't
terribly important and I liked the
confirmation beep when it detected my
device and began charging it
the instruction manual calls for a two
millimeter gap between charger and
device so again the puck is best when
integrated directly in the furniture
it's not something you can expect to
work if you bolt it to the underside of
a table but if you do find a place for
it under the laminate of say a desk
simulated here with our self-healing mat
insulation really is as simple as two
screws or some adhesive tape also
included the charger is smart enough to
turn off if you drop metal on top of it
and it's also water-resistant
obviously it doesn't have the
convenience of a cradle that stands a
device upright for you but it's not made
for that it's meant to be something you
look down at when working and if Zen's
is successful in marketing the puck to
furniture makers I'm sure they'll find
new and interesting mounting methods
still I wanted to do something
innovative if not practical with the
puck
so I found a decorative box one of the
ones we bought while filming our galaxy
note 4 test footage in fact and patted
it out a little bit and then stuck the
puck right in there it took a lot of
trial and error because of the thickness
of the wooden box top maybe 1/2 to 3/4
of an inch but eventually my persistence
was rewarded by the best-looking moto
360 charger in Boston if you think you
can do better we'd love to hear about it
down in the comments further information
including availability and pricing is
forthcoming and if you want more info on
the operation of the Zen's puck head on
over to make sense comm be sure to check
out our other wireless charging coverage
from Zen's to tilt to the power card and
beyond and please subscribe to pocket
now and give us a thumbs up if you
enjoyed this quick look till next time
this been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on Twitter reminding
you that wireless charging is more than
a feature it's a lifestyle we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
