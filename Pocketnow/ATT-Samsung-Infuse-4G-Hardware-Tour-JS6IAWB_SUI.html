calm i'm here with the Samsung Infuse 4G
on 18t we're going to take a look at the
hardware this time let's check it out so
first off the big thing about the infuse
4g is it screened this is a new super
amoled plus display and it's four and a
half inches so that's a pretty
impressive screen size you can see and
here's a penny right there that's how
big it is now we did a little hardware
comparison in the unboxing but i just
want to show you how how this looks
compared to you know an old phone this
is a benq this is how phones used to
look so here's look how big that is the
screen could probably swallow this whole
phone and here's a old HTC diamond so
you can see we're got some big screen
going on there now this device from
Samson has a new one point two gigahertz
hummingbird processor inside it's also
got 16 gigs of internal memory well
internal storage 13 gigs of that is
available to the user and it comes with
a two gig micro SD card will show you
that soon and android 2.2 Sampson's
flavor and the other big thing about
this is it is eight point nine
millimeters thick so that's pretty nice
let's take a look at around the device
here up top you got your 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera a couple of sensors
here speaker grill 18t logo now at the
bottom we have our capacitive buttons
and these are really close to the edge
and kind of kind of thought kind of
small there and that's a not very tall
with
okay there's our Samsung logo at the
bottom we have a micro USB port and
microphone hole around the side of some
nice shine and there's your power button
so some people find it strange this over
here but you can hit it with your finger
pretty easily kind of like that up
there's the headphone jack over here is
the volume controls up and down and
nothing over there on the back you got a
little bump this is similar to the other
galaxy s phones let's have a little bump
there and that's where our speaker grill
is what the top is an 8 megapixel camera
with an LED flash that's pretty good and
now i'm going to open this back it's
kind of weird you see this little slit
there that's how we get it open and you
got your fingernail in there and pop it
now look at this is going to bend peel
it like that it's kind of flimsy and
here's our battery this is what was it
1750 milliamp hours that's a pretty good
sized battery let me take that out and
but where is the micro SD card it's
right there hidden under there see that
and the one that comes with this flat
right here usually they have like a
little thing they can grab it with but
yeah see it's pretty difficult to get
that out of there I can even do it I
don't think I'll have to get some
tweezers come on come on nope not going
to happen so I'll just leave that in
there just back together
now the build quality this feels really
nice let's compare it here's the galaxy
s 4g this is kind of feels kind of
flimsy that's the kind of vibrates this
is nice and sturdy still plastic but
feels like a better build quality
alright let's take a look at the screens
a little bit compared with the galaxy s
4g okay so here we are both of these
have pocket now loaded and they're both
on full brightness if you can tell this
one seems to be a little brighter a
little lighter in the page here so
that's the super amoled plus vs the
regular Super AMOLED on the galaxy s 4g
versus the infuse 4g from samson and
just for haha's let's throw in the hd7
and you can see this is a much more
washed out here what else is special
about the infuse 4g is its 4g radio this
supports category 14 hspa+ rather than
category 10 like the Atrix 4G and some
of the other 4g phones on ATT this is
the first one to sport category 14 which
supports up to 21 megabits per second
download speeds if you are under optimum
conditions you know that's theoretical
real life mmm maybe you're not going to
get that much speed out of this anyway
that's our hardware tour of the infuse
4g pretty nice device really sturdy very
thin and a pretty quick humongous screen
pretty nice like it a lot that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
