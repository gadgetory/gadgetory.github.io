behind the camera with the new kid on
the block the Sony Xperia z2 and we're
going to compare it with the two current
flagship Samsung has one is the flagship
tablet and the other one is a soon to be
old news galaxy s4 so let's go take a
look we're having them lined up here
Xperia z2 in the middle the note 3 the
current samsung flagship as you can see
there approximately at the same height
and of course the galaxy s4 on the far
left which will be old news soon in
about a couple of hours when samsung
will hopefully announce the galaxy s5
but what's important here is a size
comparison the note 3 is a huge device
and the z2 as you can see is just a
little bit little bit shorter and about
the same thickness if my eyes do any
justice in comparing it on the back we
have a 20.7 megapixel camera on the z2
we have a 13 megapixel camera on the
note 3 and we won't go into too many
details in terms of software because
we're talking about the brand new phone
running android for that for two dat n 3
version here again o 3 runs 43 and the
samsung galaxy s4 which is the octa-core
version here still is on for that free a
quad-core snapdragon 808 01 i should say
on the sea to clock the two point three
gigahertz this is the Snapdragon 800
version of the AT&amp;amp;T note 3 and the
Galaxy s4 is the Exynos octa core
version of the samsung galaxy s4 in
terms of internal storage we have 16
gigabytes here 16 on the left and we got
32 gigabytes on the note 3 of course all
of these are expandable via microsd but
what you cannot do with the Samsung
phones is submerge them or abuse them as
the z2 is rated ip55 and 58 for
submersion and dust proofing so we'll
have much much more when we'll get this
vote in our review labs until
I want to thank you for watching
Hannah's been doing a great job at
framing the videos evidence on and
you've been watching pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
