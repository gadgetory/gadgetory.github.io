calm and you're watching the hardware
tour of the t-mobile HTC radar 4g you
are so right away when you take it out
of the box it's got this sticker on the
screen that actually shows you where
things are so it shows you the power
button the volume and it tells you what
they do so that's a pretty nice little
feature there so here's the screen there
and it's got this nice white body in the
silver metal unibody construction there
let's take a look at the device there's
our sensors so proximity and ambient
light sensors there here's your speaker
grill front-facing camera of course your
team only HTC logos the top is your
power button it's a pretty easy to press
so that's good there's your headphone
jack volume control and camera button
much easier to feel then the hd7 has
kind of a little different texture on it
so you can feel the difference there
there's our capacitive buttons for
Windows Phone and there's your micro yo
speak micro USB port and we'll said slot
and on back is your speaker and 5
megapixel camera and a flash now you're
probably thinking 5 megapixels HTC that
might not be very good for example the
hd7 also had a 5 megapixel camera but it
to kind of pink pictures and whatnot
I'll tell you right now this is a lot
better it's got a wider aperture with f
2.2 I believe and the flash it works
pretty nicely we get in some pretty good
color now let's look at the screen
so there's how the screens compare color
over here is a little bit warmer where
does this is a cooler color but we get
much better contrast on the radar so
there's that now the battery is not
removable here but you still have to put
the sim card in somehow so this little
rubber chin at the bottom slides off I
don't like so there we go and that's
where you can put your sim card there's
also some contacts there to make the
device shut off because he is saying
goodbye so when I remove that there's
your contacts it's going to shut itself
off so you can remove the sim and that's
about it that's in there the plastics of
the kind of translucent which is pretty
cool and when we slide it back on should
click into place there we go now this
might be my device but this kind of a
imperfection there in the cut I've seen
the european version i wish it was a
little nicer but might be just mine that
fits pretty nicely and it's rebooting
because i've removed that thing
there's your hardware it's a 1 gigahertz
8 megs of storage so not a huge amount
but this is a budget device it's only
nine nine dollars on t-mobile so you got
to think of it that way but it feels
really nice in the hand is a good size
3.7 inch screen is small enough so that
my fingers can reach each part with one
hand but big enough to see everything
pretty nicely no way thats it for our
hardware tour as stay tuned for more
will cover the camera software and
another video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
