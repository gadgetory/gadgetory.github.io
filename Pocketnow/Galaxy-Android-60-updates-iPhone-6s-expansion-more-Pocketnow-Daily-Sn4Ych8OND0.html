countries and even payment options it
seems that Windows 10 has already made a
dent in mac sales and blackberry has set
an aggressive goal for its smartphone
business I'm hi Mary betta and is it
just me or do we all want this weekend
to get started this is parking out daily
blackberry is definitely betting
everything on its new Android powered
Priven the official news today start
with the company's goals for this
particular product they want to sell 5
million units of this phone and we
wonder exactly if they will be capable
of doing so giving the leaks and given
all the presentation that we've received
for the smartphone we do believe that it
is a very beautiful phone and that it
does stand the chance let's just see how
the company wants to market it as will
the spotlight over to Apple those of you
interested in getting the iphone success
abroad well links in the description
there is a list of 36 countries that are
getting the phone as of today and
there's a 37 facet tomorrow which is
great news but even better as those of
you interested in a sin-free iphone
unlocked no carrier subsidies or no
carrier commitments at all well there is
an option now available at the apple
store something we've been waiting for
for a while me particularly I even
though apples quarter results are not in
yet analysts are already starting to
predict what to expect and things are
not necessarily good obviously they
paint the very nice picture for iPhones
but according to them Mac sales are
either stagnated or on the coin or very
minor growth according to them it seems
that Mac 7 really performed well but
analysts do claim that at least Apple is
doing better than the PC business than
its competitors but then again we do see
some windows 10 gross so it could be
that something is biting from the other
and for those of you the thought that
the Lumia 950 950 XL were only going to
be cool because of continuum well that's
just part of the story we've got some
trusted sources that claimed it at least
the Lumia 950 XL is capable of using the
surface pen it is very interesting
because this would be the first time
that we see a Windows 10 smartphone
being able to have pen input and it's
very odd that Microsoft and not announce
it because we do know that there is a
need for hardware for this to happen
stay tuned we will keep you posted as we
learn
more and finally for the very hot news
of the day it seems that Samsung is
already gearing up to bring marshmallows
to its current Galaxy smartphones at
least the ones from this year the
hottest ones obviously like to note 5
the galaxy s6 etc will get the update
obviously and then from last year it
seems like the notes for on the galaxy
note edge will also be getting the
update which is great news we don't know
exactly when the timeline will be or how
it will happen but it does lead me to
the question of the day would you jump
ship and change your smartphone OEM
because you don't get software updates
like but say you are right now using
samsung phones and you see that you're
not getting the update will this make
you buy a sony next year given how well
sony is handling software updates in my
case I'll tell you this much i would but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think friends as always
you know the drill if you want to get
the nose earlier before this video was
still mushy follow us i'm talking about
comment subscribe to a channel as well
you follow me on twitter hi managers
watery better on instagram and I'm any
better visit this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am Hein that we
better thank you very much for watching
we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
