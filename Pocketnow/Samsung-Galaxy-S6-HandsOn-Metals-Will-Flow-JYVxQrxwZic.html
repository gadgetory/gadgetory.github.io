reflections will be free it wouldn't be
a smartphone launch without vague
marketing copy but this isn't just any
smartphone this is the device setting
the pace for Android smartphones in 2015
and it might just be the most exciting
Samsung smartphone since 2011
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our galaxy s6 hands on from
barcelona samsung calls the s6 a totally
new design and like another smartphone
we just took a look at here at MWC that
fact doesn't really click home until you
pick it up the galaxy s6 is
exceptionally thin at 6.8 millimeters
and exceptionally lightweight at 138
grams and while Samsung might have been
content to stop there with previous
iterations here it pushes the visual
frontier as well
the Gorilla Glass for covering the front
and back sides is a haven for
fingerprints but it's also quite
striking with flowing rounded edges and
a refracting layer that gives the
illusion of depth and subtly changes the
color tone depending on the angle at
which you look at it samsung claims the
metal frame is 50% stronger than its
competitors and jaycation took the
opportunity to make a jab at the iphone
while he was at it but what's more
significant to me it finally feels like
a premium piece of hardware and not a
cheap plastic plate same goes for the
new fingerprint scanner which is now a
press and hold sensor instead of that
cumbersome swipe pad the Super AMOLED
display is also what you'd expect a 5.1
inches quad HD resolution and 577 pixels
every inch of course it looks fantastic
but Samsung screens have looked great
for a while the real story here is
what's being projected on that screen
the new version of Samsung's user
interface once again the changes aren't
immediately apparent those stock home
screen icons haven't changed much but
Samsung went out of its way to promise a
lag free experience no less than three
times in its presentation
demo units don't really tell us anything
about responsiveness so we'll wait for
the full review to evaluate that but a
layer or two beneath the homescreen some
stuff has been tightened up themed
colored highlights give app categories a
unified feel the settings screen has
been tightened up and classic shortcuts
like double tapping the HOME key now
lead to something useful like the camera
instead of something useless like s
voice speaking of the camera Samsung
really impressed us with the note 4 in
this regard and it looks like they're
primed to build on that here with a 16
megapixel sensor and F 1.9 lens start-up
time of less than a second and object
tracking autofocus also the software
simplification extends to the viewfinder
you don't need to scroll to get around
the interface and the front-facing
camera gets a 5 megapixel sensor with
that F 1.9 lens as well which could mean
great things for your low-light selfies
to bring it all home Samsung hit us with
a few nice surprises in the power
department a renewed and surprising
focus on wireless charging with both PMA
and WPC supported and fast wired
charging in line with what we've been
seeing on recent phones elsewhere that's
good news but with the non removable
battery of only 25 50 milliamp hours
those kinds of charging options are also
essential and the s6 also breaks with
long-standing Samsung tradition in
another respect there's no microSD
expansion here Samsung brings new
onboard storage technology for the three
capacities available but you're stuck
with what you buy and you can't expand
it despite these sacrifices breaking
with tradition is just what Samsung
needed to free itself from the
disappointing returns of last year's s5
and it's got us pretty excited for the
potential of the galaxy s6 as we head
into the spring of 2015
whether the phone lives up to that
potential remains to be seen
stay tuned for our full review coming
soon to find
for more from Samsung at MWC 2015 check
out pocket now is continuing coverage on
the galaxy s6 s6 edge and more here on
YouTube and at pocketnow.com until next
time this has been michael fisher with
pocket now with Anthony Nagy and Jaime
Rivera on production back soon with much
more from Barcelona</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
