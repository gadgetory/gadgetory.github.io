pocket now calm and this is a look at
chrome to phone for android 2.2 froyo
let's take a look so this is a very
small little application for your phone
and a small extension for your Firefox
or Chrome browser that makes a huge
difference it's one of those things that
you don't know how you could have gotten
along with that the idea is quite simply
you're in the browser you find a link
that you like and you can send it to
your phone instantly through some sort
of voodoo magic where your browser knows
where your phone is well it's not that
complicated because it just is assigned
to your google account but it's just
very very helpful so let's say we are on
pocket now calm and we're walking out
the door and we want to remember this
site we're going on the train we want to
access this website on our phone when
we're gone of course you can email the
link to yourself but that is an extra
step so quite simply there's a button in
the upper right corner that you can
press up here that says google chrome to
phone extension i press it let me turn
on my phone so you can see what's about
to happen ok you see a notification here
at the top and if i bring down the
notification shape you can see it says
pocket nail calm if I tap on that don't
open it pocketnow calm right in the
browser now this also works for multiple
links so let's say I go a little crazy
and I say okay I like this story here
I'm going to click send to phone click
the back button i'm just going to bounce
around real quick i want to read this
one this looks interesting going to kind
of send that to phone then i'm going to
click on the android tag filter i'm not
even letting the pages load I'm just
jumping around real fast I want this one
it's the third one sent to my phone okay
and now if I go over to my phone I
should have three different links here
and I do here they are three different
links one two three they can just stack
up so that if you're running out the
door and you want to give yourself some
reading material you can do that quite
easily with this simple extension and
combination of a program i'll post a
link on pocketnow.com on how to get it
if you have froyo it's a great thing to
have that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
