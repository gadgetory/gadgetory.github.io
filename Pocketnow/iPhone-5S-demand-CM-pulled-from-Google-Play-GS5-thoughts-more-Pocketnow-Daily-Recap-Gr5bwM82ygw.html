ipad in our free superfan giveaway and
please stop spamming the comments uh hi
they love your snooty remarks in every
video LOL and can somebody please google
snooty yes right that's right it's that
time of the week i am high metal iveta
this is pocket now and these are parking
i'll daily recap to last week so on
monday i asked you if you have many
friends that have switched from my OS
devices to android devices because the
news were that Eric Schmidt was saying
that a lot of his friends were doing so
and therefore he wanted to push a
tutorial for everyone we have 751
comments out of which for example Andre
Philippe says most of my friends have
android phones and mostly all of them
will want to change the iphone biggest
reasons are iOS and the screen size um I
thought that's actually the other way
around or at least that's what I'm
noticing but yeah I do have a couple of
friends do want to move back to the
iphone then rel says almost all of my
friends move from iphone to android 1.5
billion android users can't possibly be
wrong well those people that have bought
those like really cheap seventy dollar
android phones don't feel the same buddy
then Willie says HTC to iphone 4s to
Nexus 5 transferred files and I devices
such annoying and sorry buddy
transferring files on any mobile
platform is actually terrible we need
windows mobile for that then on Tuesday
I asked you if you were interested in
the Moto G n if you were buying it
because Motorola was launching it in the
United States and we have 225 comments
out of which DJ atomic five says nope
i'm happy with my Nexus 5 and buddy for
what you pay for that phone I don't
blame you then rice says I just ordered
the 8 gigabyte Moto G today smiley face
and buddy how can you survive with 8
gigabytes I mean seriously and 420 I
think it's thirty dollars more for the
16 gig model how can you survive with 8
gigabytes and then YouTube edano says
it's kind of smarter to buy Google
edition phones off contract since you're
not stuck in a contract kinda buddy I
don't think you know anything about the
Moto G number when it's off contract
number two you can buy three almost four
moto g's for the price of any Google
edition
phone that's not a Nexus device August
then on Wednesday I asked you if you
thought that the iphone shortages were
real or fake because the news where that
apple finally was able to meet the man
with the iphone 5s we have 415 comments
out of which clark Evans says completely
fake it's happened too many times too
often and they need to pull it together
and you know I'm gonna have to agree
with you there seriously Apple needs to
figure it out why is this such fanfare
make people making crazy lines to buy an
iPhone and then you buy an iPhone and
you have to wait a couple of weeks to
get it that's just dumb i don't know how
really have people wait for that so long
then steph says i bought an iphone 5s
one month after launch and it came two
weeks later seriously two weeks i'm you
can just walk to the store to fest by
and by pretty much every other phone
that you want and not buy an iphone i
really don't understand the United
States fanfare over this phone then Varo
2471 says i think that the man is real
but the man could be real but we don't
understand is why is it that Apple is
never and I mean never able to meet it
there are thursday i asked you what do
you think about booboo blocking
applications like cyanogenmod installer
from the google play store because the
news were that gula just walked it
because they said that it incites people
to lose their warranty after rooting
their phones and we have 250 2 comments
out of which for example anthony bonita
says google blocking cyanogenmod is
crazy it sounds like that they're going
against their own open source philosophy
and you're completely right I mean they
sold this as open source and just think
about it you can get a lot of routing
applications a lot of apps that are
currently exclusive to people that root
their phones like for example I'm
thinking about clockworkmod and I'm
thinking about every other raw manager
for example and yes you can get them on
the google play store I do not
understand what the problem is with
cyanogenmod for example especially how
good it is then odg says ovg all right i
already bricked my device with CM in the
past so I say Google did it right by not
allowing apps to void your warranty on
the Play Store um buddy you know it's
really your choice you don't have to use
it you don't have to do it and even
after you download the service you're
not really forced to install it you can
keep it there so i think that no and
especially because you can siloed
applications anyways so what's the point
Ryan castle says boo boo has repeatedly
said Google Play is not open source
android is open source what's the point
of the store not being so and finally on
Friday I asked you if optical image
stabilization or the lack thereof would
be a deal breaker for you to buy a phone
or not because the news were the Samsung
Galaxy s5 is not bringing the technology
we have 225 comments out of which for
example Danny fala says I really don't
think Oh is is needed it's good to have
but I don't really care i think that I
are is more important than that and you
know it depends on the phone it really
depends on the phone like for example
the iphone 5s doesn't need optical image
stabilization they've done something
really interesting with the software and
the same case goes for the galaxy note 3
so it depends on the phone and java jar
says the camera itself is not a
deal-breaker for me it's important but
not a deal-breaker buddy in the case of
most people for the amount of money that
you pay for a phone the fact that there
are companies that figure it out and
companies that don't is a deal-breaker
for most of us especially the tech world
then Rob Lowe Oliver says 0 is makes the
camera slow it takes good photos but the
experience is so slow on the Nexus 5 and
do to you know I did have that
experience with the g2 and yes the nexus
5 has that problem but I think that it's
a software optimization problem because
Nokia Lumia customers do not have this
problem so again it really depends on
the phone some companies get it right
send companies don't in my particular
case I would rather have it than not
have it at all but again it depends on
everybody that's it for a pocket out
