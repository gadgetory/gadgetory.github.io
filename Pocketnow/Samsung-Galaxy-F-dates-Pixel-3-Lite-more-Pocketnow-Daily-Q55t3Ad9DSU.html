struggle train by getting big on the
galaxy effing galaxy s10 next year
speaking of struggle train Apple just
cut down on production for this year's
iPhones because of lack of demand and we
may be seeing a pixel three lights and
with a headphone jack and no knotch I'm
high metal Iveta back in studio number
two and with enough devices to feed an
army with reviews this is market out
daily sponsored by swap on the official
news today begin with the hold on LG X
boom a I think UW canine who is in
charge of your production names like
seriously alright fine it's a 20 watt
hi-fi speaker with a smart display it's
being priced really aggressively a $1.99
because of the holidays it just launched
today you could find that it be an age I
just I
come on LG where'd you get this name as
with the spotlight over to more serious
news for those of you that saw that
white Samsung Galaxy Note 9 I want that
phone really bad and apparently it is
true I mean it was leaked by Evan Blass
now it's being officially announced for
Korea we have no idea what its gonna
reach stateside or if this is just going
to be a pretty exclusive but my god that
phone looks gorgeous I hope it does move
this way now let's talk about Google as
a there are some leaked images and
benchmarks of a Google pixel 3 light if
you remember there were code names for
three devices one of these being sargo
and we never saw a product being
launched so yeah this is a mid-range er
snapdragon 670 processor specs aren't
really that great but it does have a
headphone jack
it looks like the pixel 2 from the front
more like the pixel 3 from the front and
then the pixel 3 XL the pixel 3 from the
back we see it and why it looks
interesting let's just see if it does
happen and how about if we talk Apple as
the Wall Street Journal has just chimed
in that Cupertino has drop production of
iPhones meaning lesson not dropped fully
and apparently it has everything to do
with the iPhone 10 are it seems that
analysts didn't really know how to
predict what this phone was going to do
and as it turns out it hasn't
really sold as much as Cupertino was
expecting up to the point where yeah
things have slowed down our review will
be ready very soon the experience has
been interesting I mean the phone
behaves like a 10s but is not a 10s and
a ton of things like the display so I
get it why people aren't willing to pay
that much money for a phone that's far
lesser and experience when it comes to
the quality and finally the hot leaves
today have to do with Samsung in its
future particularly foldable devices and
the Galaxy S 10 you've seen photos on
Instagram right now of a possible
concept of design it looks great for the
case of the Galaxy S 10 that's great
but the interesting part is the Galaxy f
as apparently the company's co-chairman
is pretty much putting some pressure on
Samsung's mobile CEO and that something
has to happen
some turnaround has to come and
apparently the Galaxy f is gonna be the
big bet up to the point where we're
apparently seeing a final product on
February next year and a launch and
March that's rather bull let us know in
the comments what do you think I mean do
you really think that Samsung is going
through dire straits I mean I get it
from the point of investors the company
isn't really selling more every year I
mean come on man there has to be a limit
ample to reach that limit with the
iPhone 6s it has to happen I get it it
happened to Sam Singh after the galaxy
s4 so sure they need something to pull
them back but they still pretty much own
the market I don't know let us know what
you think leave us a comment down below
