we can't deny that it's been a very
polarizing year it's been great for some
companies and it's been terrible for
others some of them are even deceased
and that doesn't really mean that we got
the products that we want for this year
so I'm high Meadow iveta this is pocket
now and these are top five wishes for
the smartphone industry in 2014 number
five is a little bit of the old and the
reason why I say this is because the
music industry does this all the time
there were great songs of the semanas
that we here now in a sort of a revamped
way and why can't we get that with a
smartphone industry just because the
iphone was successful with a big slab
display doesn't necessarily mean that
the whole slide out curity industry had
to die I mean a lot of companies HTC for
example had a lot of success with slide
out cuties these are pretty much that an
HTC is not succeeding any better than
they were when they had these slide-out
purity so it would be great to see more
fun in factories more options
front-facing curity slide-out purities
whatever you can think of tilting
displays it doesn't really matter but we
would really want for companies to go
back to the whole experimentation
process that we had before especially
now the products are more miniaturised
so we could think of a slide-out qwerty
phone that doesn't have to be as thick
as they were years ago number four is
less gimmicks more functionality and
that's a very big deal right now Samsung
devices are plagued with a ton of
features that I never use and the reason
why I don't use them is because it's not
that they're bad it's just that they
don't really work well so what is really
the point of having all these TV ads
trying to sell you a phone that's got
great air gestures and stuff like that
if these are things that you're not
really going to use or that are gonna
drain your battery life because they're
not really as good as you were expecting
them to we want companies to focus more
on doing at least a couple of things
right and we do have to praise companies
like Apple for doing it right they don't
do everything but what they do they do
well so hopefully companies focus more
on doing things right HTC did a great
job with the HTC want to build quality
and with their whole boomsound we want
more focus on things that actually do
work well and that's what we expect for
the industry as well number three we
need more winners in the industry we
cannot have a successful industry with
just two companies innovation stalls we
need more companies
doing great things and so you know there
was a time where we had blackberry palme
HP and these companies pretty much left
the industry and are now striving to try
we probably need some more blood some
new blood different companies trying
different things I have a lot of
expectations for nokia 2014 for example
if a lot of innovation to the table they
probably chose not the best platform to
do so but they have so much innovation
on the table that we want them to push
the needle and we are expecting that for
2014 as well number two is more
aggressive pricing we really have to
praise google on this one for their
whole Nexus lineup and for the whole
Motorola scheme that they're using right
now two hundred dollars for a very good
smartphone in the case of the Moto G is
just amazing two hundred and thirty
dollars for an amazing tablet like the
Nexus 7 is just great let's not talk
about the nexus 5 as well we need more
aggressive pricing we need smartphones
to be more affordable if you want them
to be ubiquitous you need to make them
available to everybody not just
half-baked smartphones I'm sure you have
a million activations a day for Android
devices but half of these really suck
and we really need for things to change
we need better smartphones and better
price points that's really one of our
biggest wishes hopefully the Moto G
pushes that needle and having companies
do this because we really want this to
happen and the top number one wish we
have 4 2014 is better battery life and I
know this is funny we complain about
this all the time but it's true
companies are focusing on so many things
that aren't really that important to us
right now for example flexible displays
these are great fine that's great bring
it to the industry but what's the point
of having these flexible displays if you
won't be able to enjoy them because your
battery sucks it's pointless for you to
climb up a ladder faster up the wrong
wall why don't you set it on the right
wall the one we really want consumers
want better battery life what's the
point of having these amazing app stores
if you can enjoy them because your phone
is gonna die that's really one of the
biggest reasons why we feel companies
are lost right now why not focus on
making better batteries the industry
needs it and it needs it really bad but
anyways that leads me to the question of
this top five what would be your wish
for 2014 and smartphones what would you
want companies to push forward for again
in my case battery life is pretty much
the biggest one but leave us a comment
down below what do you want
that's it for today's top five thank you
