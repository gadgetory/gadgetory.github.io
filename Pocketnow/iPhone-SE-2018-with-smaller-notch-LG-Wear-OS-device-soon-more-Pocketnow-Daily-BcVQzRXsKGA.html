2018 emerges and things start to get
interesting we get the color information
of the HTC u12 plus along with the fact
that it might get pricey and Apple is
trying to be ready to replace your
batteries quickly according to certain
issues I'm Jaime Rivera and the winning
joke yesterday according to the ego is
that my new name is Jaime apparently
Lavetta this is PocketNow daily the
official loose today begin with deals if
you're in the market for sony phone in
the united states and you should these
are good phones the XA two ultra which
we reviewed recently is currently on
sale for threads v 360 bucks
almost got tongue-tied there but second
the XZ 2 compact is currently available
at $600 which is pricey but you get $100
off at Best Buy you can learn more in
the description now let's talk about
where OS from Google Android wear OS we
haven't seen any watches this year and
we've been wondering exactly what's
gonna happen and there are some strong
rumors that this LG SmartWatch is coming
last year's variants weren't so good I
mean they were you know they had their
usability but like for example a watch
support wasn't really that much of a
sporty watch and it was huge but now
apparently we are getting one welcome
snapdragon 2,100 processor along with
the usual bells and whistles of specs
1.2 inch circular display we're
wondering exactly what's new aside from
the design but we'll keep you posted
apparently June is the launch now for
those of you that have been waiting to
replace your batteries because Apple has
been out for the longest time in the
case of iPhones apparently there's this
memo that's now telling Apple stores
let's ramp it up let's hurry up with
this there are still discounts $30 and
we highly recommend that you follow this
obviously there is a tool in iOS 11.3
that will tell you if you need a battery
replacement and even if you didn't I
mean for 30 bucks I would totally do it
if your phone is more than a year old
definitely we're still not exactly sure
where we're getting an HTC you 12 are
you 12 plus we're hearing color variance
now with cases like black rose and some
sort of lilac
storage options started 64 gigs but most
interesting is that according to the
source this phone is not going to come
in cheap
we're not exactly sure what the price
tag will be but apparently it will be up
there we will keep you posted dual-sim
capabilities are actually being
mentioned as well and finally the most
interesting news today has to do with
the iPhone se 2018 according to the
source that's going to be the name
according to the source this phone will
bring a notch and apparently the notch
is going to be smaller than what we have
on the iPhone 10 now this is rather
interesting mainly because there is no
fingerprint scanner according to the
source so it's not like if it's just
there for selfie cam or whatever it
seems that face ID is coming to the
iPhone se 2 and the notch is smaller so
all the rumors that we heard about the
iPhone 10 2018 getting a smaller notch
or getting more credibility now which is
great but it means that the iPhone SE 2
would not se to just SE 2018 is going to
be the phone that brings this let us
know in the comments what do you think
would you be willing to put up with a
smaller notch because in my case there
are a couple of phones that I can't tell
you about right now that bring a smaller
notch and I actually like them I know
some of you hate me for that but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
