leaks of the oneplus six take the
spotlight get more details on the design
and color variants for 2018 of iPhones
and variants and our coverage of 2018
MWC continues we got more videos coming
to prove it I'm Jaime Rivera and I know
that I owe you yesterday's video but
we've got the unboxing of the galaxy s 9
plus that was compensation this is
parking out daily
the official news today begin with a
soos I have no clue why the company
chose to leave their event last but
yesterday we saw the new zenfone zenfone
5 light send phone five five and the Z
now the most interesting part is that
yes the five Z is the full-blown
flagship snapdragon 845 and everything
you want there was it available at the
show mainly because it's not going to
launch until June we did get to see the
five though and well if you look at the
design that they're pretty much the same
phone which is great it looks like
another phone I know but that's really
not the point the cool part is
everything this phone can do you can
learn more about them once they're
hands-on videos go live very soon now
one neat surprise came from Qualcomm we
weren't expecting a snap tracking 700
series but it got announced it stands in
between the 600 and 800 obviously but
most interesting part is it's designed
for higher-end phones that are still mid
Ranger's and it brings AI capabilities
pretty much so it kind of mimics the
Snapdragon 845 to a certain degree we
can't wait to see when we'll get new
hardware that includes it now let's talk
about the Huawei P 20 we've got some
leaks on video today portrait video I
hate those but they show us the phone
pretty much being I mean I don't know
leaving the manufacturing plant or
whatever it's very shiny so it's very
hard for us to know if it's a glass
phone or if this is just another jet
black variant just like we saw with the
iPhone 7 at some point the design looks
interesting definitely this is the p20
not the p20 Plus that apparently brings
three cameras now let's talk about the
iPhone 10 2018 we've got some more news
this time with Bloomberg as the source
we hear that dual SIM cards are
definitely going to be something for
certain regions in addition we also hear
that there is a gold color variant
that's coming and for those of you that
are thinking that at least one of these
devices is going to bring touch ID now
apparently face ID is going to be the
way to go for all three variants seen
such ID will remain at least in the SE 2
we'll keep you posted as soon as we
learn more
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with some leaked photos
of the one plus six probably I'm gonna
call these focus because you'll notice
that the fingerprint scanner is not
aligned with the camera so definitely a
bad Photoshop job if anything but you
know the reason why I left this for the
most interesting news is the design
actually doesn't look bad if this would
be a concept design I would highly
suggest oneplus considerate but let us
know in the comments I mean what do you
think would you want the oneplus six to
look like this phone you know probable
glass back and vertical cameras and the
fingerprint scanner at the bottom
because again in my case I would like
that but leave us a comment down below
