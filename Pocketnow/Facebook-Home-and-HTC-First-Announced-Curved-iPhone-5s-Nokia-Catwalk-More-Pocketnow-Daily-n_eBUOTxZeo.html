official along with the HTC first a
curve iphone 5s gets leaked in photos
and the note get catwalk gets rumored
for May fifteenth I'm hi Mary betta
after a crazy day of Facebook everywhere
man this is out daily let's
start today off with some mobile browser
Wars is apparently google is leaving
WebKit for their own program called
blink because apparently WebKit wasn't
moving fast enough for them but hey it
doesn't end there that we have samsung
and mozilla teaming up to build their
own browser engine because WebKit and
blinker not enough for them as well and
this just reminds me of the old HD DVD
versus the blu-ray wars which standards
going to be the best time will tell and
for those of you complaining about
samson not having a store front of the
united states but think again they just
teamed up with best buy to bring you
1400 stores with a samsung in store
there for you to check out samsung
products all you want and it's not
focuses specifically on phones you can
also see TVs tablets whatever you want
it's going to start off with 900 best
buy stores for now so visit best buy it
almost probably be a lot like the apple
store inside that's why now let's talk
about nokia there are some vague rumors
of the no kick catwalk being released in
London on May fifteenth and for those of
you that don't know the catwalk is the
code name for their first metallic Lumia
smartphone that a lot of people have
been waiting for and apparently it'll
bring the next generation Lumia PureView
camera so stay tuned for the rumors
obviously this is very vague it could
probably not happen but hopefully it
does then let's move over to Apple as
we've got some leaked images of the
future iphone 5s or at least a prototype
and what makes this device special is
that it looks a lot like the iphone 5
but this time it has a curved back for
your hand which is obviously ergonomic
but it also has a curved front glass and
there are some other rumors in the past
of a curved glass prototype patent for
apples so it could just be something
that is happening in the future but
again Apple test products a lot and this
could probably just be something they're
trying out and will never happen so stay
tuned and finally for the interesting
news of the day Facebook has been all
over the news today because they finally
released their Facebook home which is an
Android launcher that focuses on people
and not apps as Mark Zuckerberg
a-and this launcher works on strength
devices flagship mostly HTC One 1x and
the one x+ and then we've also got
samsung galaxy s3 galaxy s4 and the
Galaxy Note 2 but it does not end there
they're also launching their HTC first
which is the first facebook phone out
there that will launch with facebook
comb as the stock default launcher which
is kind of interesting everything will
be available on April twelfth this HTC
first will be available on AT&amp;amp;T for 99
bucks and it is a mid tiered phone but
that leads me to the question of the day
would you consider installing facebook
home on your phone and leaving it as a
default I mean in my particular case
well I'm not really that big into
facebook and i just can't consider the
fact that i'd be bugged by farmville all
the time but still i mean leave us a
comment down below when you consider it
to be good for you to have a new
launcher out there of course is always
for an earlier tube of everything that's
happening in the smartphone in top of
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com and subscribe to our
youtube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw i am home i believe it i'm thank you
very much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
