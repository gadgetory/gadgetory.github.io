pocketnow.com today we're going to do an
unboxing of the LG spectrum from verizon
so sit back relax enjoy the show alright
so here we have the box from the LG
spectrum for verizon it's an LTE phone
actually I'm really surprised from help
from LG that this box is actually is
decent looking as it is God's while it
boxes are relatively uninteresting this
is the first box I've seen in a while
that is actually something better than
just the average cell phone provider box
so we slide off this cover here pop open
the box we got the phone itself which
come back to in just a minute and then
also in the box we've got a wall wart
charger and the micro USB cable there is
a few manuals and then not much else
even under the device itself so well
booba the fallaway turn it on and take a
look so we got a 4.5 inch screen on this
device it's LCD resolution is 720 x 1280
and that's really surprising for the
type of device that it is pixel density
is about 326 PPI and it is a
scratch-resistant glass whether or not
it's grill a glass I imagine that it is
down at the bottom we've got the menu
button the home button which is in
silver we'll see if that has anything
different and a back button 1.3
megapixel front facing camera there on
the side here we've got a volume rocker
and on this side nothing the bottom here
just a small microphone important this
where you remove the battery cover which
sit in a second top here is the micro
USB ports it's got a little flimsy door
on it we'll see how that turns out
headphone jack and the power button and
flip the device over and we've got a 8
megapixel camera on the back with a
flash and a kind of slick feeling but
carbon fiber look to the plastic here
and then the speaker port there you can
see it's a 4G LTE
phone pop off the back cover and we have
the 4g sim card a 16 gig class 2 micro
SD card that's pre-installed and then in
1830 milliamp hour battery and then
underneath that there's just the
standard information and a water sensor
so let's go ahead and start this up
we'll take a first look at how it is so
here we've got the device finally booted
up it it actually for the first time on
an unboxing for me at least the battery
didn't have any power in it at all so
but I plugged it in and we've got it
plugged in right now and it's charged
and you can see at the top here and as
we swipe back and forth we just did this
just a moment ago and it's a little
sluggish in the swiping back and forth
it is in the process of downloading a
system update so we'll make sure we
verify that in the fold software review
we've got a unsee I rather skinned
Android device here it's running
Gingerbread is not running ice cream
sandwich at this time if i go into apps
here then i've got the app locations and
some setup wizards and that's where
thing will go over more of that in the
actual software overview and my tap home
it comes up just a little bit slower
than i expected to for this processor it
specifically has a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz snapdragon processor it's got
a gig of ram and as you saw it's got the
16 gigs of built-in storage let's go
ahead and take a look at that then we
can see we've got 14 gigs free available
of the 16 gig card that was in there and
then it's got some some internal storage
according to the specifications it's got
four gigs of internal storage but you
can see it's only got one point six nine
gigs available oral actually 1.5 three
gigs available with one point six nine
gigs as storage space there so we'll see
how that affects the device especially
with not all apps being able to take
advantage of SD storage other than that
we got some verizon software and
applications on here unsurprisingly it
does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi the 4g
service will try with as part of the
hardware review and we'll try out the
camera as well that wraps up our
unboxing of the LG spectrum from verizon
if you've any comments or questions
would like us to cover something
specific about this device and software
and or hardware let us know in the
comments below give us a thumbs up if
you liked this unboxing thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
