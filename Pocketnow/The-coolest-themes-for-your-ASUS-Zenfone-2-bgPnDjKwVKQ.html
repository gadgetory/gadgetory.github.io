for your buck smartphones available
today we spend a considerable amount of
time covering it and we've continuously
mentioned the theming engine is one of
our favorite software features I've had
to houston with pocket now and these are
some of the coolest themes for your soos
zenfone 2 it's worth mentioning that
there are currently only ten themes to
choose from for the zenfone 2 all of
which are downloaded directly from the
Google Play Store I'm curious to see if
a soos will add more themes in the
future but for now our top picks start
with simple blue the default Zen UI
theme looks fine but simple Lou has a
nice geometric flair to your icons and a
cool tone in the interface it did
occasionally miss an app or two for me
when theming it like Spotify here that
retain its original circular icon until
we adding it to my home screen but it's
a quick fix and the theme looks great
there's also iron this is a much darker
theme with a round blue gradient in the
toggle shade and circular icons with
gray rings around them since a theme
can't be expected to cover every app on
the Play Store there's a bit of
inconsistency in the icons stock apps
are all a brushed metal gray but third
party apps tend to retain their color I
actually like this a lot on my home
screen since I only have stock apps in
the dock and third-party apps on the
rest of the screen but of course your
mileage may vary based on preference and
home screen setup if you prefer a
brighter more upbeat look on your phone
you might like travel best this one
turns your quick settings panel into a
bright hues of blue and green and gives
the icons a sort of makeover that you
might have to take some time to relearn
but again not every app is supported by
these themes so in the case of travel
your apps sit in some kind of glass
container or something luckily if you
like a certain theme but don't care for
its icon pack this also separates the
icons into their own page letting you
mix and match to your heart's content
the default packs match each of the
phone's themes but here's where it gets
really awesome it works with any icon
pack on the Play Store meaning you can
really get exactly the look you're going
for I really like the Mayoress icon pack
and it goes great with simple blue there
are endless combinations here and if
you're like me you might spend more time
playing with the themes than doing
anything else with the phone the zenfone
2 is a great phone for the price and
we've got a great video review if you
want to get to know it better it's also
a written review of pocketnow.com for
even more info on the phone and plenty
more mobile coverage to come so be sure
to subscribe to the channel and visit
our website for more this has been hiya
Houston of the pocket now and thanks for
watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
