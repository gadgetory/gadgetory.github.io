our mobile devices our cell phones are
literally a part of us that we well
sometimes can do without we can't do
without our email we can't do without
our calendar sometimes we can't even get
from point A to point B without GPS and
online maps that tell us how to avoid a
traffic jam but what do you do when you
lose your phone or when it's stolen like
happened with my wife just recently
that's what we'll talk about on today's
episode of the android guy weekly so
i've got a samsung galaxy nexus one of
the unlocked variety I've got to running
on t-mobile and I've had it since well
it was released I liked it so much that
I got one for my wife I paid a pretty
penny for it I went through expanses and
I had it imported and it cost me far too
much money about 750 bucks us and gave
it to her as a gift and she loved it I
mean this is a big phone I have big
hands and I thought you know this is
something that I can do but she liked it
she liked using it I went ahead and
upgraded her from a tmobile g2 all the
way up to a Galaxy Nexus and she thought
it was too big until she started using
it and then she really really liked it
and she got over the fact that it's a
big phone right away which don't just
might tell you that big phones aren't as
bad as some people might make them out
to be they come in really useful the
one-handed operation kind of goes out
the window especially if you have
smaller hands that having been said this
phone became her lifeline it was so much
more useful and she could do so many
more things quicker and more
intelligently than she could with the
previous version of Android on a smaller
screen even though the smaller screen
had a slide out keyboard was something
that she got used to pretty quickly and
really adopted what I'd like to call the
mini slate platform you know the big
smartphone well she had her contacts she
had her phone of course she had her
email and her Kalin
the calendar is what was really
important and she even started using
this as her alarm clock well one
Saturday morning she woke up and went to
pick up some fresh fruit it kind of like
a farmers market it's a local co-op
basket thing where you get a whole bunch
of fresh fruits and vegetables well
being the supportive husband that I was
I slept in under the guise of taking
care of the kids yeah that's that's the
story that I'm going to stick with so I
was home with the kids taking care of
them by sleeping and she went and picked
up this wonderful fresh fruit for us
throught Invisibles she came home and
couldn't find her phone oh no she had
lost her phone at this baskets pick up
well that's okay she spent the next
20-30 minutes frantically trying to find
a phone number for someone that she
could call that worked for the place and
let them know hey I lost my phone while
i was there can you can you help did
anyone turn it in unfortunately no one
was available it took days before we can
get ahold of someone who worked there
and eventually no one had seen her phone
which was a problem well in the meantime
we've used google latitude which was all
we had on the phone to try and locate it
and it was well twenty fourth street in
ogden as far as we could tell which we
thought might have been the headquarters
of this baskets co-op thing turns out it
wasn't and it turns out it wasn't even
there now why was it not there and it
said it was well when cell phones are
reporting locations whether that's to an
application whether that's to to you
looking at it on screen whether that's
helped me find my lost phone app there
are a couple different ways that they
can report location they can either
report what's called a coarse location
which is essentially looking at Wi-Fi
access points around them and cell phone
towers around them
they may be connected to and saying well
I know that if you're connected to this
access point or this cell tower you must
be within five miles of it well five
miles that's a pretty big radius and
actually it was a little bit bigger than
that it was very very coarse and it went
from the tops of the mountains out to
the middle of the lake we didn't know
that because the circle on the map was
so big we couldn't tell that it was that
big of an area to cover it was really
quite miserable but we didn't know that
at the time fine location fine locations
where you're using GPS the GPS chip and
antenna and your phone to get it I want
really precise sometimes you can get
within 5 to 15 feet depending on your
accuracy and where your phone is if it
has a clear view of the sky and whatnot
you can get really accurate pinpoint I
can find out where my phone is in my
house within a room or two is it in the
front of the house the back of the house
east or west I can find out where it is
doesn't help me with floors at all so it
might be on the bottom floor it might be
on the top floor who knows but in this
case it didn't help us that much and by
the time we realized that and went to
put on some other app like Plan B we
were too late the battery was dead so
that's what happened in chapter one so
after going to this location and looking
for it multiple times and you know there
was a tattoo parlor involved in a funky
upscale salon with interesting people
that didn't know anything about it we
weren't able to find the phone she was
diligent in trying luckily we had a GSM
plan so I was able to call up t-mobile
and say hey guys can you please turn off
their sim and I'm gonna go pick up
another one at my local store all the
local stores had no problem they
confirmed I was who I said I was and it
just handed me a new sim I popped that
in an old nexus one and she was up and
running and not a problem going from a
Galaxy Nexus to a nexus one not that
Pleasant of an experience so she was
motivated and she decided you know of
all the phones that are out there today
I'd like another galaxy nexus so she
saved her money luckily was available
through the google play store for 399
now since then it's dropped another 50
bucks so fabulous there but she saved up
her money and went ahead and bought a
new Galaxy Nexus and the first thing
that we did was we put lookout mobile
security on it so we could do a little
bit more stuff with locating and
pinpointing where things are as well as
doing remote wipes and other fun stuff
that you can do with the apps like that
and she got everything set up and
everything was great and then chapter 3
we had some friends over one of these
friends has a teenage kid and this
teenage kid lost something in our couch
well he went fishing for it and what did
he find while he finally found my wife's
phone okay well she has a Galaxy Nexus I
have a Galaxy Nexus they all look
exactly the same pulled it out it's dead
put it on the charger we forgot about it
and then my wife tried to log in to her
phone and couldn't and it was odd and
interesting because it was kind of like
your old phone and we went looking and
sure enough we have three phones so
either she lost the phone in the couch
or and this is the story were going with
whoever it was that found her phone felt
guilty about trying to keep it for
themselves somehow found out where we
lived snuck in and put the phone in the
couch somewhere that it would make it
look like we might have lost it there
but we really didn't and then we could
find it a later date and then they snuck
out again really really creepy that that
could have happened but what does that
taught us well first of all google
latitude is great for trying to find
where someone is but it's not really
good for finding out where your phone is
second when you've lost your phone
minutes count you've only got so much
battery life and as soon as that battery
goes dead chances are you're not going
to find it again third you want to make
sure you have an app on there like where
is my droid or lookout mobile security
or one of the several others that you
can find that will communicate with your
device after you tell it to remotely of
course and say hey this is where I am
and then they can either sound an alarm
or give you a precise location or
whatever the case may be again as long
as your phone still has battery in it
and as long as it's still covered by
some kind of a a mobile network whether
that's voice or or data preferably data
but another thing to keep in mind you've
got to be using a SMS plan rather than
something like google voice google voice
isn't going to work very well at all
with these so you've got to know the
number of that phone the phone itself
not the google voice number but hate
whoever it was they found the phone and
sneakily gave it back to us and we've
got it back and we learned some valuable
lessons and now by sharing them with you
I hope you have to if you've got some
stories that you can share with us about
how you've lost a phone and found it or
how you've lost a phone and had to get a
new one and what you did to prepare for
losing your phone in the future we'd
like to know head over to pocketnow.com
and leave your comments down at the
bottom of the article for pocket now
sharing some embarrassing stories i'm
