18t announces their official windows
phone prices and Microsoft seems to be
working on a gaming tablet I'm hematoma
vana wondering just what an xbox tablet
would look like and this is parking out
daily that's right the press invitations
are out for a verizon an HTC event in
new york city on november 13th and you
know what that means the HTC droid DNA
aka HTC j butterfly in japan has been
rumored for weeks and it's the 1080p
smart phone that everybody's waiting for
and it's just in time for black friday
so let's just hope the verizon HTC don't
pull out another dud here amazon has
just made the race for online video
streaming a lot more compelling by
offering their Amazon Prime services for
just seven ninety-nine a month now even
though this is a little more expensive
than we used to pay before in a year it
does bring amazon prime at the same
level as netflix and hulu with the
difference that you'll be getting today
shipping for free and you'll also be
getting their amazon kindle in their
library aside from other things so i do
call it's a really good deal ATT is just
announced their pricing for their
windows phone line of this holiday
season and it does come as a shocker in
the cases like for example the Lumia 920
which will be prices just 99 bucks you
get the wireless charger and it's the 32
gigabyte device and just think about it
I mean the Lumia 920 has better specs
and better features than a lot of the
high-end smartphones that cost two or
three hundred bucks in the market right
now you'll get the Lumia 820 for 50
bucks though you won't get the wireless
charger as you do with the Lumia 920 but
things get a little more expensive when
you see the windows phone 8x being
priced at 200 bucks for the 16gb by
model make sure you watch Adam lanes
full review on the Windows Phone 8x from
HTC though now do any of you still use
the windows live messenger I know I did
a lot of decade ago but if you are just
make sure you migrate to skype from now
on because microsoft has just made it
official that they will be retiring the
service as of early 2013 and their new
option is their new baby which is skype
so it's just kind of nostalgic for those
of us that still have accounts there but
hey the feature is the feature the
passes of past then the Live Messenger
was kind of getting old and finally for
the interesting news of the day
Microsoft
is now rumored to be working on a 7-inch
tablet to make a family with the rumored
surface phone and their current surface
tablet but wait a second it does get a
little bit more interesting apparently
Microsoft is not building another
windows 8 tablets they'll be building a
new Xbox gaming tablet to cater for
those of you that are currently using a
PSP or PS Vita or a nexus 7 or an ipad
mini and if you think of it it kind of
makes sense i mean one of the best uses
for a tablet of 7 inches is for gaming
so at least we do the question of the
day would you like an xbox tablet would
you buy it you know I kind of finally
debatable to have another device just
for gaming but I do feel that it's going
to have very good market so leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in a smartphone and tablet
will make sure you follow us on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi
Marilee better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
