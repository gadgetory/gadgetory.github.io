for one of the boldest smartphones that
has ever built
reporting from Beijing in China this is
high metal Iveta with pocket now and
let's take a look at the new axon 7
no worries folks I actually did not eat
a ward with a new slogan ziti is making
it a big deal about how important it is
to blast the speakers on the new axon 7
flagship and we actually agree the
company has provided us with a
preliminary unboxing experience of the
unit being slated for the US market the
thick cardboard box finishing the golden
accents into a premium product within
and that definitely is the case sliding
the box open were greeted by the new
axon 7 and below we find the very
interesting package of accessories which
range from USB type-c wires matching to
regular USB the quick charge 3.0 adapter
a set of headphones that bring back some
fruity memories a spare screen protector
in addition to a silicone case and
literature that hints tazzy t's free
two-year passport warranty that covers
smashed displays and things all around
the new axon 7 is definitely a gorgeous
phone thanks to its design that emerge
with collaboration with BMWs design
works the company even teased how
different and clean this design is when
compared to the likes of the iPhone or
current Galaxy phones the aluminum body
feels amazingly solid in the hand and
that's thanks to a chassis that's even
hard to bend in some of the demos that
we were offered in the briefing to be
fair there is simply no room for
comparison between this phone and its
predecessor and that's actually because
ZTE is pushing this product away from
the mid-range and now into flagship
territory as such it includes all the
best specifications of 2016 meaning a
snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigs of ram
64 gigs of expandable storage via
microSD and even so this product does
stand out from the crowd when compared
to other flagships by offering an option
of 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage dual-sim capabilities that come
standard and the same goes for a new
pair of
firing speakers that support Dolby hi-fi
audio the presentation focused a lot on
all the technology behind the dual AKM
amplifiers and the speakers another
quick glance it's really hard to deny
that these speakers are great
the experience extent the phone calls as
ZTE claims that this device could
replace a conferring room speaker and
even the use of headphones another
positive story is the 5.5 inch quad HD
AMOLED panel protected by 2.5 degree
glass for the units we have are not
final but that didn't stop these
preliminaries from providing great
viewing angles in deep color saturation
powering that displays a 31 40 milliamp
hour battery that supports quick charge
3.0 and other essentials like LTE cat6
Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth 4.0 among other
things and then pushing everything as
Android 6.1 marshmallow running below me
favored UI 4.0 that looks a lot like
stock Android but with some added
capabilities that we will cover
extensively in our full review as this
is still not final software something
the company also boasted about is its 20
megapixel primary camera powered by a
Samsung ISO cell sensor and F 1.8
aperture along with an 8 megapixel front
firing selfie shooter and below that
primary camera is what ziti calls the
fastest fingerprint scanner in the
market as well something we also have to
test and then we mentioned that there's
also a VR headset as ZTE also claims
that this will be one of the first
device is compatible with Google's new
daydream VR service overall let's just
say that ZTE has officially entered the
flagship space with the Exxon 7 and does
so with a bang give it its sub $500
price tag and color options that range
from ion gold and quartz gray this is
definitely a phone to consider not just
for the price but because of features
like the speaker system that are very
unique whether it lives up to its
promise and paper is yet to be seen but
this is one of those phones that I
really look forward to testing in our
review period very soon folks this has
