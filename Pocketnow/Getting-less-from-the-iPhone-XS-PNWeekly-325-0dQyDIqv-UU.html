people asking or wondering what an
Android guy I mean I'm the I am the
proclaimed Android guy has to say about
this phone I bought it with my own money
I'm learning how to use iPhones again
and I know I'm not a seasoned iPhone
veteran or anything like that but I just
have one can I can't just ask you guys
one question before we get into the
today's show before we get into the
reviews of the new iPhones and all that
stuff is it is it okay for me to say
that because this phone is so easy to
use because iOS iOS 12 in this case is
so easy to use that that is what makes
it kind of boring can I say that good I
would agree with that because the ways
that yeah cool is just exactly like it's
easy to use this phone I know exactly
where to go but the thing is the way
that I move around this phone is also
the way literally every other iPhone
person gets around their phone there's
not a whole lot of personalization to it
there's no personalization no
customization it's that's it using an
iPhone it's like trying to play a piano
with gloves on you can't do what you
want to do or set things up that you
want yeah a little bit and you know I'm
not gonna thing let me just say that is
not a knock on the merits of the phone
itself it's just a commentary on my own
experience with it because let me tell
you this I might find it a little bit
boring compared to my Android phones
that I use on the daily but hey you know
what I'm enjoying using this phone I'm
fine with it it's a it's a perfectly
good daily phone that I have very few
complaints about it's just not as
exciting to me as many other Android
phones well it's gonna be boring and a
little bit worse than previous iPhones
if we have anything to say about that so
okay yeah well we do have a lot to talk
about in regards to the iPhones but
there are a ton of stories in general
I'm going to go a little bit backwards
when it comes to the the intro today but
first of all hello everybody and welcome
to episode 3 to 5 of the weekly brought
to you by Pacquiao and xda-developers on
this day Friday the 28th of September
2018 from Facebook to Twitter telegram
to hinge on
hinges on here and all of the ABS on
your phone that you probably shouldn't
be on anyways let's get talking about
all of this stuff
I am your facebook Messenger Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and in
the boot today we have Jules Wong who I
wanted to introduce a first because many
of the stories were talking about today
he's gonna have to help me out on
because he happened to write many of
them I'm juicer of the show and like I
don't think we would have been able to
get through a one plus sixty rumor
without digressing two minutes in and
talking about like the HTC g1 because of
course it's it's an eraser II this week
yeah I kind of missed my I miss my boat
in terms of posting that on social media
but well gets that in a second brands
and minimun a simple question here in
the script today are you a Google - or
Google+ today oh my head I'm so glad
that I'm a Google in the middle zero
Google Mall Google know exactly and then
insta I made a Vera Graham I would say
insta stories because the man does some
stuff every single day obviously I'm
talking about the pocket now daily how's
it going hi me I'm doing great man I'm
actually here like Brandon's and the
other office I'm actually gonna have to
close the door because of the feedback
if I kind of be able to hear both of us
within the microphone do it live let's
see it now because I'm all set up
because I'm importing footage for
another video that we're working on that
actually has a lot to do with what the
way you started the the podcast Josh mmm
it was gonna go live tonight after the
daily and so stay tuned because it has a
lot to do you're not the only person
that feels that way actually okay fair
enough I know that's probably a lot of
people in the live chat I should pull it
up in a second but I know a lot of
people in the live chat probably
commenting right now they're all like
come on yeah actually being too hard on
you what the hell man
but I totally get it there are there are
reasons why this is such a hotly
contested phone everyone has opinions on
it but another phone that everyone has
opinions on is its competition and the
number one phone in competition is of
course the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and
according to Consumer Reports it is at
the top of the smartphone rating
which is a pretty incredible thing to
say I have mine over here I've actually
taken this pan off
I have mine with the Rhino shield bumper
which is my favorite way of having a
note because it's like this is such a
massive phone you actually don't want
anything in the back and you can't enjoy
the color and so the bumper just like
protects it really well everybody
remember the iPhone 4 how cool those
bumpers were we had a glass I think this
is the best way to case a glass phone
where you can remember enjoy remember
Apple sent everyone a free bumper on the
iPhone 4 because of antenna gate of
antenna gate which they're actually
dealing with I feel that that's a topic
we should discuss actually eventually
eventually well the note 9 as I have
mine here right now my two dailies are
the 10s Max and the note 9 the no 9 it's
it's not easy my pockets are constantly
drooping does it mess with your la style
pants or well this is the thing you know
what you know what is la style nowadays
is fanny packs but it's across the chest
like this no use men are allowed to have
bags now let me just say that okay I
mean I've always been an advocate for
the murse but I mean you could go with
the car goes the car goes for that did
that that is something I haven't had in
a long long time I know that like it's
like a it's like a uniform in
xda-developers for everybody to bring
cargo pants I need to start doing the
same yeah well in regards to the note 9
many of the reasons why this phone is at
the top of the ratings have to do with
Lovett's internals obviously it has the
battery life that according to this
story can last 29 hours so I can go a
full day without charging durability has
apparently survived 100 drops from
Heights of about 2.5 feet which is like
I guess pocket area Oh many thumbs no
who knows
that wasn't one that was one phone
clearly it has a better camera than
previous generations and some may argue
it might even be better than its
competition in a lot of ways zoomed
photos portrait modes and whatnot and of
course the final line in this the only
downside of this smartphone is its price
as now all important phones seem to be
reaching $1000 price tags
yes I'm basically a walking criminal
like like criminals dragnet now
yeah Magnum because I'm carrying these
two phones but yes in my pockets are
basically $2,500 worth of kit you could
rob Joshua at this address tell me so I
haven't gotten my a my nest cam yet I
got it tell me something nice because I
actually covered this topic on the daily
do you actually I don't know I
first of all Consumer Reports is another
publication they've got a great name I
mean I feel that they found a great name
a couple of decades ago and it sounds
like if they were a government agency
but they're another publication just
like we are and so I don't know I find
it a little irresponsible to call it the
best phone of the year we've still got
three months and about four phones to go
yeah I definitely think that I agree
especially as we have the LG Google
coming up and unless you count your
years in some weird way like from
September to September for any certain
reason I know that we are very Apple
centric in the US so perhaps that might
be the case but I even then I think that
strongly disadvantages any entries from
November to December given that we have
to cover these in a whole spectrum like
the the market is ever-evolving and to
have like some sort of arbitrary
placement even if it's for 2018 like
like from January to December like
that's what we're seeing if there are so
many phones are that are about to come
out in October and they - you know right
Jaime - to crown any one of the phones
we have right now as the absolute best
is really weird to do when you have one
month of what is it like six or seven
phones that is about that are about to
be announced and it's in bear in mind
this is not that I disagree like is it
the best phone so far I have to agree on
that
I would call it the best phone so far no
no room for comparison that's not that
it's no room for comparison because like
display made already rated at the iPhone
10
max has a better screen than the note 9
even if by Sam's well well but here's
the thing like we know like it's
rumoured but it's not confirmed that LG
is also building panels for the 10s so
we're not sure what panel they were
using or if it's LG or I don't know it's
it's kind of hard man yeah well okay in
terms of the iPhone 10s max I'll
actually you know what Brandon real
quick you're using your no nine stole
right now I'm using unfortunate oh you
don't have more than one SIM card there
guy says my question I do but I like to
use one vice at a time okay yeah you're
not ADHD like I am well speaking of the
iPhone 10's max oh that's the other
thing to you Brendan I hope we'll get
some insight from you on the comparison
between these two phones as you use them
over the next however so long I've been
using these two phones as my dailies but
right now we have the iPhone 10s max
which has a little bit of its own
controversy because apparently as we
reported last week on the on the weekly
I should say the iPhone 10s and the
tennis max happen to have battery
capacities that are not necessarily
where users wanted them to be and
apparently the iPhone 10 still not
really smokes but it's still better than
both of the new iPhones when it comes to
battery life now clearly in this chart
that you're seeing right now is Jo's is
bringing up Android battery life is far
and beyond what these iPhones are
capable of but just as a anecdotal
evidence I will admit that even though
the battery capacities are lower than we
might want them to be - tennis max has
been able to handle days without much
problem I will ago here's something
interesting the if you look at the
previous iPhones compared to their Plus
versions the capacity increased like 30
to 45 percent so like the difference
between the seven and seven plus was
much better battery life interestingly
this year between the tennis and the
tennis max there's only a 19% increase
in battery capacity or well in terms of
battery comparison size when you compare
the iPhone 10 to the 10s it's taken
maybe like a sub 5% drop a little
and you would hope that a lot of the
efficiency is introduced in new hardware
such as the San 7 nanometre processor
would be able to increase the efficiency
lessen the heat and you know ultimately
you would have much more battery to
spare but in this case when the average
in the whole category of smart phones at
least according to Tom's guide here
doing its test on web-surfing cellularly
when you have that average at 9 hours 48
10 s max at 10:38
and Tenace at 9:41
that still gets to you a good chunk of
the day now what how much that extra
hour so might depend on what you see
later at night but I just god these
battery tests it's like yeah we're like
every human watches a video for 10 hours
until the phone dies that's what every
human does biggest problem the biggest
problem is the battery life is so
dependent like for example last night I
was staying in a hotel that had zero
cellular reception like zero it didn't
matter if it was t-mobile or or 18z they
were both on the floor and so if you
have bad cellular reception in your area
or battery life it's not gonna be any
better
so it's just it's just so subjective now
one thing that I will say is for the
sheer size of the Macs just how large
the phone is I have to agree with
Brandon then I don't understand why it's
just 19% larger
what you're getting you're getting 30%
gains in the processor technically right
it's a semi true but it's it's not like
if you're not getting gains in that
massive screen man like it's the screen
on a phone of its category and so you've
gotten more pixels to power but it could
be Ola doesn't matter it does you know I
just I feel that Apple it was too
conservative
III don't know there are reasons why I
didn't order the Mac's I just I felt
that there was not enough benefit
towards the phone to warrant having to
put up with its size like in the case of
the note I don't think it would be any I
don't think there's a better way to
include something like the s-pen like if
the screen were smaller and there was an
S Pen I wouldn't find that as useful as
the screen being larger
so there's a purpose for this phone to
be big but then in the case of the
tennis max it's just a blown up phone a
purpose for it to be big there's nothing
different about it I agree with you
there and yeah that's that's been my
experience that I feel like I'm not
getting much juice out of this actual
screen here that is more than what you
would get on iphone 10 which I have used
yeah that's the thing I'm speaking of
screen on time I just wanted to show
this real quick clearly I have a problem
with distraction because this screen
time app is telling me that I'm using
the phone way too much and the most news
app is YouTube I am I am according to
this what's that called the screen time
screen time I am psychotic I live I
checked my phone I checked my phone
hundreds of times a day I'm not even
kidding there's something wrong with me
I need I need help but wait a second he
didn't know that you didn't know that
there was something wrong oh yeah
exactly
this is on another level like I've got a
problem and I need help
well this screen is a very interesting
piece of the puzzle here because we're
talking about the cost of the materials
when it comes to the iPhone 10s max and
we have an article over on pocket now of
course that deals with how the price
turns out the way that it does even if
overall the the phone itself costs maybe
four hundred and forty three dollars a
unit to produce in particular the 256
gigabyte iPhone 10s max which is the
most expensive version of the phone now
one thing is sort of the 512 gigabyte
version but then we announce that are
discussing we could have for another day
and there's 512 oh yeah yeah and the
1249 price tag but it's not really also
a fair comparison we are comparing it to
the iPhone 10 and I don't believe tech
insights gave there a storage capacity
for that teardown we're talking about
10% difference here yeah and what I find
so interesting about this is that the
most expensive Ida phone might still
have a materials price tag of under $500
overall but it's not necessarily that
the materials themselves are becoming
more and more expensive it's more like
the housing costs and component housing
rather cause also mechanic costs
everything is getting more and more
expensive to make not necessarily that
the parts are very high in price yeah
and those pricings are every time that I
read that I'm like come on guys have you
seen how much money Apple invest in
marketing mm-hmm like you you really
can't just be like yeah the phone cost
$200 to make right you need to make a
profit that's how businesses work
they're not just gonna give you a phone
away they're not not every company
Xiaomi
well here's the thing is is that outlook
continues to report quarterly margins of
anywhere between 35 and 40 percent so
that's still a huge chunk so even if
it's not you know the massive 60 percent
here half of that they're spending half
of that for whatever they need research
development marketing that's a pretty
good traffic and that's the thing I mean
to be able to build a phone like this to
be able to build any phone you require a
lot of money in R&amp;amp;D so it's not like
okay so the components and machining and
hand labor and this oh yeah and so you
think that they just came up with the
design of the manufacturing plant
you know just magically no you require
R&amp;amp;D for all these things to be put
together and just think about it it took
two and a half years to build the first
iPhone can you imagine how much
investment went into two and a half
years of labor and coming up with a
product that we revolutionized the
market and I'm not just you know I'm not
I'm not trying to you know give a salute
Apple but it's true like any smartphone
before the iPhone was not nothing commit
like even Android was not what it was
until the iPhone came out well I would
argue it's the same thing with the iPods
because they made massive margins on
those two and it has it had been an
iterative process for them maybe since
June 3 Gen 4 so think about you here's
the thing jewels back when you were I I
would assume you were like three or four
years old when we was that we would have
to carry dis men's around and these
would skip like like whoever actually
used the dis man would be wooden like
when people see the announcement of the
first iPod people don't understand how
that product was so significant today
because they don't understand what we
used before the iPod yes Andrew
what was being marketed at the time was
very nerdy and kind of unattractive
it was terrible tell somebody that they
could carry 1000 songs in their pocket
like it was it was unbelievable like I
remember that I would have to carry this
bag it was called a quick case and so my
dis man would go into it and then it had
a spot for like five CDs because
obviously there were no CD burners back
then he had to buy the discs he's got to
buy the discs and there was no mp3s
these didn't exist either so like it was
this people don't understand just how
much the iPod change the market I grew
up in the age of Kazami and I'm sorry
yeah I was like right on I was born
right in the cusp of that of that change
and I grew up with CDs but then
recordable CDs became a thing and then
we started hustling by burning them and
selling them but shouts out silent keep
oh by the way that's a turd that's it
that's a brandy never hear any more that
laddie that was my CD player my work
like Onkyo is a non-key oh part of
technics I'm not sure I'm not sure where
they're at right now I'm not sure but oh
my god the brand technics like in the
80s you would pay thousands of dollars
for stereo system from them this this
all reminds me of my favorite line from
one of my favorite shows I know if
anyone here has watched Parks and
Recreation but Ron Swanson in the show
he's very old-school he listens to
records and and you know he's very he's
really really old-school like a man's
man and whatnot but he had to leave his
office but he wanted to listen to his
music still so he shows up with an iPod
and he goes Tom put all of my songs on
this rectangle but one last question I
want to ask about this particular story
of you guys just a quick hot take I
wanted to know like so we understand
that there's R&amp;amp;D there's marketing
there's all of this that goes into the
price of the phones because of what they
are but just how much do you think what
we might call the Apple tax goes into
these phones just the fact that this is
the brand we're talking about how much
of that do you think goes into it it's
not just that so the reason why Apple is
so profitable so people try to
understand
companies like Xiaomi exist how is it
possible that they only make 5 percent
margins over their phones obviously
Apple is not making 5 percent they're
making 100 percent margins over every
product like like every business if you
buy a car it's a hundred percent margin
if you buy a real estate they usually
make that amount of margin that's just
the industry standard the thing about
Apple is they don't just control the
product they control the store and they
make 30 percent off of every dime that
is made so if you renew your Netflix
account through Apple guess who gets 30
percent for that renewal so the way so
the the way that Xiaomi makes money
through their stores in China is exactly
the same way that Apple is so profitable
it's because they control the whole
banana and they tax not the it's not the
Apple tax doesn't just happen in the
hardware it happens in the software as
well mmm
I didn't actually I actually did not
know that very specific piece of info
there yes there is it's literally 30
percent for every movie 30 percent for
every song 30 percent for anything that
is sold within like if you do in app
purchases within Apple they get 30
percent it doesn't really matter like
that's the reason why certain
applications like Amazon had issues like
selling you Kindles like they force you
to go to the browser because if not then
Apple gets a 30% cut over that ebook for
example the Netflix is testing the same
thing with a web rap interface perhaps
exactly to avoid the 30% cut because so
just do the math I mean how much so just
do the math if Apple paid developers 40
billion dollars they got a 30% cut over
that yeah and it's I mean it's a
pittance to say what they've done to
perhaps better this situation because I
think it was last year that Phil
Schiller was talking about introducing
subscription discounts so if you're
subscribed to sur an app with a service
after year's subscription apples cut
drops down to 15% but that I never
comment on each user to stay with the
app for 12 months consecutively so
there's a lot of stuff that could go
wrong with that and you're not really
guaranteed the results that apples
dangling from you which is why still men
these apps are struggling to figure out
okay maybe I can circumvent this or
maybe we'll just have to deal with it
and it's kind of crazy
um there's a comment in here that I
think would tie everything together here
from Roshan chicane it is stupid to
think Apple became one to a 100 dollar
company by not cutting corners I and I
don't think that it's cut corners in the
way that one would conventionally think
in terms of its own kind of thing but
it's able to cut corners cutting
everyone else's course no no let me let
me just say this let me give you an
example there's a vehicle brand called
Lotus in in the I think they're they're
uk-based they make sports cars but they
don't snap a v8 or a v10 engine on these
sports cars they simply make a very
light chassis and therefore they can put
in a v6 and it'll be just as fast as
your v8 or you v10 now in fact that
Apple is capable of creating software
that's so power efficient and so
Hardware efficient is not their problem
they're just smart that's the way it is
so they yes they have four gigs of RAM
instead of eight how is it that they're
able to optimize iOS in a way where they
only need four gigs of RAM to perform
just as good as an Android phone would
require six or eight that's not
something you can blame them for that's
just a smart way to make money man well
maybe these cut corners I mean you might
be able to comment a little bit on this
because our next story has to deal with
the radios that are in so how how much
of a problem would it be if Apple
apparently may have actually taken some
of the code that would support Intel
modems from Qualcomm now granted inside
of the phones what what what we
discussed this a little bit behind
outside of recording podcast like this
and whatnot that you know Qualcomm
radios I mean obviously they are they
they're hot pieces of kid that these
Apple phones don't have right now and
it's showing because of the network
connectivity issues and now Qualcomm is
filing this suit that's saying that
Apple stole some of their code and they
and they did it poorly by the way not
just I I don't know man I it's very
difficult
I hate these legal topics because it's
not that I'm hating over the commenting
it over right now it's just I hate going
through these legal topics because it's
it's you know a lot of companies will
just start throwing in there what they
assume is gonna happen and this and that
no it's it takes a while there's a lot
of Pro I could've yeah there exactly and
so but here's the thing
obviously if all iPhones are now using
Intel modems that somehow these Intel
modems are using Qualcomm patents to be
able to work on CDMA for Verizon it's
print so it's not you know well every
it's a very difficult thing so this is
all Qualcomm claim they have not sued on
this particular claim they have added
this accusation as part of a brief for
another lawsuit which is more patent
related but you know if there is a lot
of still proprietary code that is not
under a patent but also that you know
that they're talking about that is
perhaps maybe a trade secret or that
could be a differently classified thing
but we go back to Apple it is known for
diversifying its part sources as much as
possible to drive price competition
between those suppliers and make sure
that they're able to provide you know
for less and with this apple and
Qualcomm and Intel there's been a lot of
talk about how much everyone wants to
pay or everyone wants to offer to be
able to provide a modem to Apple for
it's very very popular iPhones and I
think our next story oh yeah Qualcomm it
is still positive that they can have a
relationship with Apple still and what
what the put I hope they do because I
have a story for you guys
well now the issue is over the price of
the intellectual property so there is a
precedent for this kind of thing where
back in back in China and we know a lot
of Chinese manufacturers are prominently
showing Qualcomm's name on the back of
their phones if you look at that Xiaomi
he ate Explorer edition the locals like
right there and
back in the translucent vacuum yeah but
clearly there's there had to be some way
for Qualcomm to provide their patents
and also in a way provide their their
their products to these Chinese
manufacturers in a way that actually
worked for those Chinese manufacturers
so back in Beijing there was a there was
a claim that was made there was that
there was a final claim that said that
there has to be a lower rate that
Qualcomm provides to Chinese
manufacturers which might add to the
whole point that Chinese phones like
shammies are generally a little bit
lower in price when it come when you
compare them to their Western
constituents but yeah Qualcomm is still
thinking that once those things are
ironed out they could they could
possibly come back into the Apple fold
let's let's hope they do because two
things
so David Cogan and I he was making a
video which I highly recommended since i
phone tennis max complete walkthrough
and he's like dude let's go run those
speed tests of that video that you did
for between the galaxy note 9 and the
iPhone tend to see how it performs so I
brought the Newton s which apparently in
theory has four by four my mo and
gigabit LT I don't know if four by four
my mo but L gigabit LTE we brought the
note 9 we brought his 10s Max and guess
what phone Wan denote the note 9 by God
so I was getting a hundred and sixty
megabits down on the note nine I was
getting 68 megabits down on the iPhone
10s and 10's Mattacks was pretty much
the same number I was getting 30 down on
the iPhone 10 why is there such a
difference like technically do you know
so the question is what bands are
supported is supported by that modem
does the tennis and tennis max do the
tennis and tennis max have the have all
the bands that t-mobile is now offering
is the question because t-mobile is the
network that provides those gigabit
speeds in New York sadly the I don't I
don't know of any spots where I could go
with an AT&amp;amp;T phone and get those same
speeds
and viewers listeners if anybody knows
please shine in the comments and we
would love Li we would love to go test
them like no problem but Oh give me a
small give me a second Jules
all I know is is of that sector in 57
and 7 go run your test if you want and
so two things that that's the first
you know the differences in in battery
life sorry the differences in data
speeds and then guys how good is your
battery life on your 10s is tennis maxes
man because I mean the battery life on
on like people are complaining about the
battery life on their iPhones henesys
and they're also complaining about the
connectivity of their phones that's
another piece of news it's happening
true like I said earlier battery life
seems to be pretty standard for me I
haven't had any problems I haven't had
what I used to call the iPhone syndrome
where you have to the iPhone phrase
where you always have to walk around and
go you have a charger do you have a
charger charger Ivan had that but you
know I haven't had any problems with it
but that said it does seem like a gross
oversight to me that there is not a fast
charger in the box we don't even have to
talk about the audio stuff because to be
frank I do have a pair of ear pods so I
do use them with the iPhone 7s max but
yeah as far as power is concerned thank
God I have my own chargers because they
do charge the phone pretty quickly and I
and how about your Wi-Fi connectivity
because that's the thing like if I'm in
my if I'm in the room of my apartment
with the router in the living room I get
connection on every device on every
Android device but iPhones they don't
get Wi-Fi I haven't had a problem with
that yet I have I have a Google Wi-Fi
mesh network in my house and I haven't
had any issues with Wi-Fi connectivity I
know that just a kind of a shameless
shout-out to mr. Ettinger over at
TechnoBuffalo he did say that he had
Wi-Fi connectivity issues were and he
would leave his Wi-Fi network of his
house come back and it would not
automatically be connect I don't have
that I don't have it either so I was
Wi-Fi is concerned I'm okay I'm good
but when it comes to data speed
connections I will admit I did notice
that it was slower when I was shopping
at Costco I'm such an old man and I was
in line trying to download stuff for a
game and it was taking forever they sell
good wrist history man and I just wanted
to make a complementary point like what
technologies in you know that t-mobile
network aren't they not for how
supporting like I think it's I don't
know what the I don't know what the
number of the but also quad Euler
amplitude QAM or whatever buttons or 4x4
Maya is part of it but also carrier
aggregation as well as a QAM which
Qualcomm also seems to be able to do
carrier aggregate Gibbon LT is possible
through carrier aggregation so I took my
understanding if you've got gigabit LTE
that's how you get it done but the 4x4
MIMO is what I'm not sure if it's on the
iPhone 10s that's the thing I do know
that every device with a snapdragon 845
has it but I don't know of the iPhones
it's research that we're still doing
well Qualcomm marketing yeah I was about
the same Qualcomm some marketing is that
all for that all of those my Mo Kio a.m.
as well as carrier aggregation is there
kind of package of what they classify is
gigabit LTE capability so that's what
they're talking about and if until maybe
has some code but not all of it or it's
something that it's weird its Emelia
it is weird and I'm Mike and my device
is the carrier unlock what device that
you guys get I'm sorry say that again
my device is the carrier unlocked which
guy which one do you guys get unlocked
and I've been wanting to put this is a
good time for me to ask the question if
I have a carry unlocked version of the
iPhone can I put up Verizon sim in there
or is it only GSM ah no I wanted the
Verizon sim won't work on it which is
the so I don't know about the tennis max
or 10s I know that in in in every device
before the seven you couldn't I don't
know about the ten that is a good
question because now it's just one SKU
yeah cuz I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a
good question because that's the thing
like you can do with an lg phone or a
Samsung if you've got a verizon sim you
could put a verizon sim on and on an
AT&amp;amp;T note 9 so long as it's unlocked and
it'll somehow work yeah
because again it's because the the
snapdragon 845 supports the CDMA bands
whereas if you do it again like my son
was trying to do with a 7 plus didn't
work okay work well we're talking
carriers at the moment there is there
are a couple of last stories in this
first segment and one of them the first
one of our two right now how to deal
with t-mobile as we
talking about and their acquisition of
MetroPCS now it's not just an
acquisition it's a change to what they
have acquired it is MetroPCS but now
they're gonna just call it Metro by Tina
maple we've already been colouring the
Metro for in the past however many years
since you know especially after the
acquisition in 2012
oh yeah as well back yeah and there's
the crime changing of the plans and
whatnot but this is another one of those
incentivizing changes like we talked
about a little while back I'm trying to
remember with who sprint sprint was
trying to put all of these different
add-ons and incentives to their plans
and this is the same thing with Metro
apparently you're going to get Google
one cloud storage with this also Google
one terrible name for it but Google one
cloud storage if you bump it up to
$60.00 monthly then Amazon Prime is
bagged in as well so this is a this is
what could be generally considered a
budget category when it comes to all the
phones that Metro has given their
service as well but does this make the
service itself much more enticing if you
get things like Google one ends more
importantly Amazon Prime very quick
thing Amazon Prime is a real a real
benefit let me just say real quick
because the other day they announced -
our shipping delivered to our delivery
for free on prime now from Whole Foods I
did it I'm stocked on butter now because
now ghee and butter yes but just saying
there is a benefit to it so if you get
Emma's on Prime there are some real
tangible benefits and I think a lot of
people who discount Amazon Prime are not
really using all of the services that
are included with it so that's just what
I don't I don't I don't take advantage
of friend music I don't take advantage
of Prime video I have never walked into
a Whole Foods in New York I should what
okay that's not gonna first stop every
time because I need to get stuff from my
Airbnb / department / / hotel room so
but anyways yeah I was gonna say Brendon
we haven't heard from you in a little
bit I want to see what your thoughts are
on all this
yeah I'm just listening do you guys
remember Boost Mobile and their tagline
where you at and they had like
granny's do that but I think that the
slogan on this Metro by t-mobile isn't a
genius I'm like no because what is the
slogan yeah Jules just play it again
it's it's that's a John Legere thing to
say you know I can't be the uncarrier so
I mean that's you know it has to be
something smart and oh that's genius
so I guess that's how they're pointing
it and again this cements t-mobile's
kind of presence in Metro because
they've long relied on Metro t-mobile's
network so this just puts it in front
and also t-mobile is trying to make the
case that they want to be able to keep
all of their prepaid carriers so when
talking about that merger with Sprint's
would they have three carriers that have
more than half of the share of the
prepaid market they actually did an
interesting move in Oh
allowing customers to choose whether
they pay before their term or after
their term so before the month or after
their month which is song and that kind
of just maybe disrupts if you want to
say that generously the concept of a
prepaid carrier so that might be
something to watch for in the coming
days yeah probably so
prepaid is great for the carrier because
they don't have to deal with people that
don't pay you know their Latin America
it's the way to go like that it's
cheaper it's funny but it's cheap it
cost me the same money to make a call to
the United States from on loo at US than
it does to call where they don't notice
just if I'm using a prepaid plan because
they just don't want to deal with the
drama B of billing people they just want
them the money out of time yep yeah
because the switch could be a little bit
weird
it could be speaking of weird switches
apparently the feed on Twitter is going
to be getting some changes and not to
say that anybody not to say that anybody
has become very used to the highlights
version of the feed you know there are a
lot of people who say this about
Instagram and Twitter
that when it changed from a reverse
chronological order feed to a highlights
feed that was not a very well received
change but it looks like Twitter's going
to double back a little bit they're
gonna go back to for the most part a
reverse chronological order feed but
there is going to be a setting that
allows you to quote-unquote see the best
tweets first so they are going to have a
bit of a curation that is added into the
reverse chronological feed but for the
most part you'll be able to look at
things on that from from a for lack of a
better term historical context so things
are going to be based upon when they
were last posted now if you use
something like I feel like if you use
something like TweetDeck this was never
an issue right like the third-party apps
never got the the curated version yeah
exactly so I haven't I honestly I have
not aside from the mobile app that I
used to post and maybe look at make
replies and do stuff like that I don't
look at that feed very often you know
sometimes the Twitter highlights come in
and someone's like I don't know David
Cogan and Brendan minimun liked Jaime
Rivera's tweet and I'm like what's that
tweet I hate it when I get notifications
like did you see what Joshua Vergara
just posted first post in a while have a
look if you take the time gonna look at
highlights they're actually pretty good
about what certain people have to say I
would subscribe to their tweets and I
would deal with notifications right
notifications but hey yeah like come on
yeah definitely um well okay I'll admit
that I go to the highlights a little bit
and since we have been talking about 10s
max versus Android type stuff III
noticed that the highlights on iOS look
different than the ones on Android on
Android they have the swipe like the
magazine the zine style one and then on
and on iOS it's just this like scroll of
of the different highlight so I thought
that was interesting
by overall I think that yeah I haven't
had a problem with this like I've been
looking at reverse chronological order
since TweetDeck was the thing so I'm not
really tweak that but you know they
never had
the desktop version never had any
toggles for see the best tweets first it
was it's mostly a baby
yeah because tweet tweet egg is owned by
Twitter at this point right isn't it so
yeah yeah maybe it'll get something like
that but many people you know the
Instagram has not made that that that
shift yet back to just reverse
chronological order I still see things
from like 18 hours ago that I'm like I
don't care I think because sometimes
it's sometimes it's stuff that's not
relevant why are you talking it's
dinnertime why am I looking at breakfast
tweets you know I think that's something
I always notice when I look at my
Instagram feed I think you can sorry
girl I was gonna say I think Instagram
could do so much of a better job of
putting in your feed stuff that might be
of interest there like I don't know if
you guys have ever spent time in like
the Explorer cap on Instagram there's so
many Instagram accounts that I think
would be interesting I like cars
I like phones you know and like oh I get
our women in bikinis man why is it that
I was when you look at one like the
quote-unquote bad thing on Instagram all
of a sudden the discover tab is all of
them yeah thirst traps for days we are
going to talk about Instagram some more
especially after some really big
developments over at Instagram and
Facebook land butts we are first gonna
go pay some bills all right here all
right this episode of the PocketNow
weekly is brought to you by champ now
and this ad was brought to you by a
local coffee shop that's usually where
our copywriter Jules does his work these
days on the go a lot of us do actually
including people who are owned
businesses and if you're managing a tech
fleet of Macs iPads and iPhones for
employees near or far gems now is
definitely here to help you out with
jammed
you can distribute settings for Wi-Fi
and email standardized preloaded apps
and data plus lock and wipe a device
from anywhere after all you had to buy
all of those machines so it's important
to make sure that they work to your
order no matter where they are so what
are you waiting for as a weekly listener
you can sign up and manage your first
three devices for free do you need to
handle more it's just two dollars per
device per month start off by heading
over to Jam comm slash
okay now that's Jay a mm calm slash
pocket now to get started for free with
Jeff now that might've been my best one
ever
all right really quick check in with
everybody as we come back from the break
just just quickly we did hear a little
bit about the iPhone tennis max for me a
little bit of the data connection test
from Jaime Brandon house this past week
good for you you have a thought thread
for us this week as you usually do not
this week except that I'm looking
forward to ditching the tennis max and
going back to my one plus six
now that high stable is out for the
oneplus X I'm excited I have to install
that yeah I've been hearing with some
really good things about it you should
try it because the open betas were
really good even the Developer Preview
is good so I can't imagine how good the
Developer Preview was terrible but then
the open beta was was fine mmm and on
the great but you're you're you're more
next da developer than anything I'm just
a guy that uses a phone I want it to be
stable and it was stable but maybe maybe
you didn't flash it right out it sounded
like something out of a rom-com I'm just
a guy wanted to be stable I was just
gonna say the one thing that I will give
one plus so much credit for is the
thought that they put into their OS
oxygen is just a breath of fresh air for
lack of a better way of putting it
because because for one for one thing
one thing I really dislike about the
huge screen on the 10s max is that I
have to reach for everything now you can
do the whole reach ability thing which
is it's kind of lame right it's hard to
use yeah and the thing is like you know
if I'm going to have folders in the dock
to reach for it and I dunno 9 has this
problem too let me just say I hit I hit
the folder and then I got to reach up to
hit my icon on oxygen everything's down
here you can see I actually did I
actually don't like that really the
thing about it is if the folder I was
if the folder is like a let's say the
folders up here but then you get the
icons down here like I hate the note 9
throwing them all the way up there I
like how the iPhone leaves the folder
close to where your finger is and it
doesn't yeah but your folders are like
okay then it's a very specific thing for
me because your folders are like on the
home screen while I have them down here
on the dock so a little bit different
also full screen gestures I still hate
them but this whole multitasking are
like that so much
you know what I'll admit that's not bad
and when I went back to the polka phone
which I'm trying to finish the review of
finally it not having that actually made
me mad so I'll give some kudos to iOS in
that regard well you know you can just
double tap the recent an Android it does
the same thing it's not as fast and
smooth but you can do it not if you have
full screen gestures on the poco phone
me you I me you I makes you swipe up and
hold there's no quick reasons on full
screen gestures they're got turn on the
nav bar if you want that got turn on the
nav bar right yeah all right cool so um
I guess we can go ahead and get into our
main stories because there's so many of
them but they're all related topic cuz
mean topic okay fine okay fine Gio's
mister I wrote all these stories here's
the thing yeah Facebook has had a rough
kind of the past few years I mean years
to say the least
you know elections and all that but also
the fact that it hasn't been generating
enough profit and that caused a whole
you know kind of 120 billion dollars
right from its stock value in one day
which is terrific I guess you could say
and then today we also had the ALP reach
50 million counts under compromised
because of a site vulnerability so
there's a whole bunch of stuff happening
yeah there's a story blood right now I
just got notification that there was a
hack today yeah 50 million accounts it's
amazing but the thing is that well it's
not just Facebook because it owns
Instagram it owns whatsapp
of apps that we use every day I know hi
may you your whatsapp fiend and also
Instagram theme so like you're kind of
encompassed by the whole Facebook laws I
just bought the apps but the moment like
right now that the CEO the co-ceos of
Instagram have left I don't know what's
gonna happen cuz the day I like the fact
that they're not Facebook well the thing
is that there has been a lot of Facebook
control exerted over it because the Wall
Street Journal has been reporting that a
lot of staffers were taken aback and
that they had to deal with a lot of
Facebook teams overriding what they have
done which and I think the CEOs have
left I mean I feel that they just were
they they a lot of it's like you know
that recently in the quarter results
call like Facebook instructed whatsapp
you have to make money you have to
figure out a way to make money and
whatsapp has been reluctant to monetize
and with ads in Instagram Instagram
wasn't the same story they do monetize
but they're not God like Facebook is
like the the crown jewel for gossip and
just terrible media it's like but I know
my parents love it but a hold to a
standard though yeah indeed they haven't
turned out to a standard I just had this
conversation with a couple of our fellow
influencer or friends if we go if I can
use that term we had a discussion last
night over a different so Michael Fisher
because he hates that well you know what
quick shout out to Trisha Hershberger
and Jessica Nazir II they were the two
that I was hanging out with because they
both they're both LA natives so
reminders they live in LA so we were
talking about the Instagram feeds and
one thing that they really enjoyed about
Instagram was that it was very Spartan
like you don't get inundated with all of
these different fees over on the sides
or any of these extra links it's just a
it's just all about the content and
Facebook has a huge problem when it
comes to throwing information in your
face and also that information may or
not actually be relevant to you because
let's put it this way on YouTube it's
very easy to know that if you want to
follow somebody if you want to know what
they're going to be posting you
subscribe to them but on Facebook you
have
to like them what does that mean you
have to hit the thumbs up like button
and all of a sudden you start getting
everything from them when maybe you
didn't want to I didn't subscribe to you
I just said that I liked you so well you
can like that but also you can follow
them or you and then you can change what
the feed shows you you can say like you
know stuff that only you're tagged in
and whatnot it's crazy the amount of
information and with the CEOs of
Instagram leaving a lot of the fears
like you said Jaime is that Facebook is
going to inject all of this uselessness
into what is probably the only darling
social media platform right now alright
just I can't wait to see what the
co-ceos come up with with next because
sadly instagram has asteroid snapchat I
don't know if sadly but they just have
they literally have and I I don't know
man I I like features like that are
coming out with Android Pi and with iOS
12 where you you get to see how much how
much time you spend on social media
probably the worst thing about Facebook
and it's the reason why I avoid it is
because Facebook knows exactly how to
keep me browsing their product they
don't care about you they care about you
spending time on their product because
this is the way they make money but they
don't care if you're productive or
unproductive if you're making money or
not they want to make money off of you
no matter what and probably Facebook is
the worst service to achieve that so if
this is the death of social media as we
know it because Facebook is going to
ruin Instagram fully then fine so be it
I think that it will actually help me be
more productive anyways you know that
that's just the way I see it it's just
it's it's dad Facebook is such a bad
service just you get to see how socially
awkward Mark Zuckerberg is thanks to his
product yeah well I mean that that's one
of the controversies that has happened
with this thing because we remember the
unsend controversy that they were
testing they were quote-unquote testing
an unsent feature for facebook Messenger
and a lot of Mark Zuckerberg old friends
kind of were scrolling around and know
saying hey these messages from this
thread have suddenly disappeared from
mark like why is that the case and it
took a lot of arm-twisting for Facebook
to realize that yeah we actually have
discussed this feature and blah blah
blah
this totally it's a completely unethical
service and I think it's proven in
politics and so many things you know and
what that's the thing like even even
just this past week there was a whole
segment of it I'm John Oliver show on
last week tonight about how Facebook has
actually and you know what I I'm
Filipino I date someone who's from the
Philippines Facebook is the free network
in the Philippines when you get a SIM
card from any one of the carriers there
it comes with Facebook free oh yeah yeah
actually so long as you don't browse
photos you don't pay for data exactly
yeah it's it's interesting what face
someone with someone with a borderline
dumb phone could look at Facebook for
free yeah and it's crazy you know and
that and that's how most people get
their news because they otherwise
they're paying for data and it's crazy
how Facebook has been able to insert
themselves in that regard I do want to
go back to one point that you made Jaime
that you're looking forward to what the
CEOs of Instagram are going to think of
next
because as it says in this first this
first article here for our topic they're
planning on taking some time off to
explore curiosity and creativity again
which is actually kind of the same thing
that the founder or rather co-founder of
whatsapp said when he departed the
Facebook board of directors as well
what's his name Jan koum says I he'll be
taking some time off to do things I
enjoy outside of technology oh man if
only we all had so much money for us to
be able to do that in our lives as well
Brandon well I use Facebook and
Instagram and Twitter so the big three
is yeah so funny last night I had dinner
at Jaime and then we were walking back
to the car and he was he was saying how
terrible Facebook is but then he said
but then he said but you know Instagram
I like Instagram and I'm like yeah
Instagram stories are so hot right now
it's like yeah you know it's cramps such
a happier place and then and then we
looked at each other and he was like oh
crap
Facebook owns Instagram yeah it's
surprised if we start seeing more
integration with stuff from Facebook
into because isn't that what kind of
whatsapp has been kind of dealing with
as well like it's it's still been able
to be the messaging app we all remember
but isn't Facebook slowly just side of
like making it their own making it
tentacles
I like whatsapp for what it is I just
there are certain things about whatsapp
that or not they're not perfect honestly
I wish I wish telegram were more popular
because I feel that it's the more
complete messenger service but you know
fair does it have video chat yet yeah
yeah whatsapp does what sense does
telling took a long walk no telegram I
don't know I haven't used it them a bit
nobody it's like the blackberry
messenger because I'm as I mentioned a
second ago that you know being Filipino
we know what Facebook has done to our
country in a certain extent so Lisa my
girlfriend and I we we tried to boycott
Facebook services was kind of hard to
because facebook Messenger she doesn't
have favorite data if we use video chat
it's the war yeah it's crazy
well one thing that I'm also worried
about too is virtual reality thanks to
oculus being on Facebook and we've been
talking about how virtual reality has
been evolving if only in just the
enterprise space because that's where a
lot of deployment can happen and there's
been talk about sexual harassment
training and a lot of these experiences
being done through VR to perhaps
increase empathy and to make it more
effective than previous efforts have
been to prevent sexual harassment and
there are there's been just the whole
general thought of you know how these
experience experiences are effective at
curing phobias that making people go
through certain experiences that they
might not have before and with all of
that like I'm wondering all right so
what's gonna happen with Facebook Kanak
ulis in the future because at this point
they're still on announce the front is
the product I mean they're on the first
floor of hardware but it's still a while
yet before we find you know certain apps
or a categorized or it's something that
can be
monetized and then exploited for
services and whatnot advertising Josh
really inflammatory comments they're
like exploited were you in the briefing
of the LG g5 inbox hello and I'm more
than sure that you were there I'm pretty
sure I was yes see do you remember the
VR approach from LG where it was like a
pair of sunglasses and then had a USB
port a USB C port where you would put
your phone on your pocket yep and then
it was just so small so practical mm-hmm
so I think that VR is not gonna take off
regardless of what companies do until
they come up with a solution that
practical that easy to carry there's a
great art piece that I encourage
everyone to see it's from my what's his
name Katie Matsuda and it's called
hyper-reality and it's just a whole
bunch of it's like the dystopian world
of what if this was our lives and
there's just a whole bunch of stuff lots
of loyalty programs
this woman's on a bus and there's a
people talking to her and it's just
crazy
so I encourage you to look at that I
can't wait so I can put in contact
lenses and experience another reality
and you know what's gonna happen we're
gonna be putting our contact lenses and
playing virtual ping-pong and then we're
to look off to the right there's a table
and there's gonna be a coca-cola bottle
we look off to the left and a Walgreens
store is gonna be there because
advertising we're just gonna keep
looking around and we're just going to
be seeing Kylie Jenner here's the pro
here's the thing I really wouldn't mind
so let's not talk about politics but I
guess even if I like capitalism
I guess I'm against the prospect of a
future like that because of the
capitalist need of companies to impress
their investors because what's the
problem that all these companies what do
these companies just come up with used
products to figure out ways to sell you
new things and so it just deters from
whatever enhanced experience you can
have because they have to sell you ads
because they need to make their
investors happy and so the problem is
that there's a lot of lack of ethics
because it's all about making a dime and
that
piss me off yeah I mean it was go-ahead
Britain yeah it's gonna say it's it's
always been like that
there's a book out there called
marketers around everything anytime
somebody has your attention whether it's
a billboard on the road or a commercial
on television or a YouTube pre-roll ad
or a magazine ad or you know newspaper
ad you know marketers have to find a way
to access people and and it's always
going to be that way it's not I don't
think it's like you know you made it
sound like it's evil or it's not that
it's evil it's just the purpose I so I
like the concept of certain companies
wanting to no longer be public companies
that they want to buy back and become
private companies because they're pissed
at the fact that there are a lot of
things that they want to do but their
board of directors doesn't allow them to
do it because it doesn't make investors
have short-term profits yeah that's it's
that's that's what I don't like it's
that whole concept that we have to do it
for the investors we have to do it for
the investors let's fire 30,000 people
because we're gonna let go for Hardware
the vision because we have to make the
investors happy how is that preferred
for society how is that better for
society you know so I'm not saying that
everything is bad I like the whole
concept of the stock market and being
able to invest and there's a purpose for
it it's just it's been prostituted into
making the investors happy at the
expense of humanity that's what pisses
and it all it never has always been
about that I mean there has been a lot
you mean you have you've heard the
phrase over and over again to enhance
shareholder value over and over again
for these public companies it hasn't
always been like that
and if you go all the way back into like
industrial times I mean again we talked
about Henry Ford and you know giving his
workers a decent wage so that he they
can afford the product that he's selling
which was the Model T's so they're
little but then but then even in those
times and let's move away from politics
but even in those times they needed to
get people employments showed in during
the times of the depression it's not
like let's figure out ways to not give
jobs it's to make the investors happy no
we have to give people jobs for them to
be able to consume you know that's just
the way it was yeah the bacchanal weekly
like your Thanksgiving dinner staying
away from politics staying away from
religion
yeah I encourage you to read the book
Upton from Upton Sinclair and the if
well that didn't generate the laughs
that I wanted but whatever also that is
reference to lie in this type of podcast
suggestion for all of you from American
public media the people who make
marketplace the business program at NPR
there's this thing called Martin make me
smart Mollywood great host formerly of
all the places New York Times CNET and
in Cairo's Don who's just awesome in
general and they talk about a lot of
this stuff so hey just the podcasters
gestured there we go and there's some
APM money in Jones's pocket not just
bringing it back to what we were saying
like you know you buy because I'm try to
remember who I had this conversation
with recently is that what our or maybe
it wasn't a conversation maybe I heard
this on a podcast also but the we used
to make money by providing goods and
services now goods and services are easy
to make because of automated processes
and now we make money by selling the
things that have already been created
and you know but the thing is there
still have to be hands that create those
things they get paid much less than the
people who sell the things that are
being created and it's it's crazy how
we've moved into this world now where
everything is at marketing and whatnot
because I was gonna make the comment
earlier I wish we could find a new way
of monetizing anything but it's always
going to be based upon marketing
something else that's that's the thing
so yep the only other alternative is
that you know Facebook and all these
other companies that are an ad platform
can charge you to use the service you
know that's the only alternative right I
mean Alice house can you mana no one is
gonna like that you imagine if all of
these free services free data services
in countries like the Philippines and
Indonesia all of a sudden said you have
to pay for it like like literally pay
for it you're paying for your phone
plant but then it's also $30 a month you
know the what's out there
wait a second you know what's gonna
happen what's gonna happen is that
you're gonna end up using only what you
need that's what's gonna happen true
when you put it when you put a when you
put a selectively wall up in front of
somebody they realize what it is they
prove they truly need yeah and there is
some merit to that but unfortunately
there's the other
shoe and again I'm not saying which
again to the whole politics of anything
or economics or whatnot but even if you
create that that makes users more
mindful they don't have the resources to
figure out what they need so they're
gonna oh my god have we achieved that
with this model all right so enough
Facebook before we get into cuz you know
what the world though yes things kind of
suck but you know what listen this
podcast would turn into nihilism at some
so let's let's turn to something a
little bit more light a little bit more
fun you know you could you could you
could take that with a grain of salt
because we are talking about Motorola
and finally three days ago Motorola
turns 90 I kind of like this logo that
they used here because they think it
adds in the infinity symbol of whatnot
oh yeah that that's that that's good
marketing but that's a Motorola that's
not a Lenovo thing that's a Motorola
thing right there that logo cuz I like
it I don't know it's a good it's a good
question I mean obviously we are we owe
a lot to the history of a company like
Motorola because of where we are now our
R&amp;amp;D in mobile like literally yeah we can
we can thank the iPhone all we want for
the modern smartphone but we have to
remember that none of that would have
been possible without Motorola yeah
indeed Startech what the heck is the
DynaTAC oh god that so the DynaTAC is
the original smartphone but the original
phone Zack Morris
exactly Morris phone right oh oh that's
what that was called I have a feeling
one day just literally gonna be called
the Zack Morris phone which is a
terrible thing I mean yes right DynaTAC
okay for our listeners and for our
viewers remember DynaTAC don't just
don't give Saved by the Bell to credit
DynaTAC a lot of our viewers and
listeners didn't watch Saved by the Bell
I mean that's true but yeah I have to
say this like my favorite like I was
even thinking it could it be possible
that I find it on eBay a star tech 70
8:60 mm-hmm oh my god dr. Martin Cooper
there you go yeah that was such a good
episode for Michael and I can't believe
that Michael was able to to get that
interview which actually actually after
that interview dr. Martin Cooper
followed me on Twitter that was great
that's my be Jules his way of telling me
to step my game up
there's the host book someone young
Michael Fisher still in plaid versa ball
pocket squares so I guess I guess as a
final like sort of notes for our that's
a weird way to put it because we're
talking about Motorola as a final
thought for Motorola as we end this show
why did what would you say is your
number one memory from this company
we've used a lot of everybody everybody
can start and let me be less cuz I have
a lot of history with them it's that's
as Brandon cuz Brandon you're you were
here not necessarily
uncharacteristically quiet on this but I
wanna make sure you chime in more man
yeah I definitely think it was the star
tech because it came in many colors it
had so many form factors and most of all
everyone had one cuz the price got low
and people had them in holsters and it
was just it was sexy I mean it was a
poster was so sexy because it was the
phone was backwards you would only see
nem at the front you could see like the
sparkle of the light of service in in
visible it was just the coolest thing
yeah Brendon I know that you have a bit
of a harder out today so if you need to
wave wave goodbye just make sure you do
so let us know when you're on your way
out
all right Jules any Motorola it's got to
be the Hasselblad camera right
unfortunately it's gonna be a little you
know recent but not as recent as the
Hasselblad and it's the original Moto X
which I have never owned but mostly just
for the fact that products and the
used their own ideas they had automaker
for God's sakes like that killer app so
that yeah 100% I was going to say the
Moto X because of the Moto maker as well
but since you said that I'm gonna bring
it back to the razor I actually have
some pretty fond memories of that phone
and if you look at a razor right now
like if you were to hold one in your
hands
does it not this doesn't feet it feels
different now like back when it was
first out it had the sleek form factor
and it was I click and it was nice and
sharp because a razor should be sharp
but when you look at it now it's like
it's kind of it's kind of chunky yeah
it's kind of chunky and tall like you
know but but my memories of having that
phone were so I miss flip phones I wish
we would get them back maybe foldable
screens will bring us back they're like
it's nice I mean it's all contemporary
though because you had candy bars back
then and there was a little there's a
good textured like like people underrate
texture in our smartphone usage it's
part of the reason why I actually really
like using pop sagas and even though I
could don't have one right now the whole
idea of me like holding it but then when
I'm done snap snap snap bring it down
like texture so that's what they that's
what a foldable phone did is like when
you were done you were done I don't
think a razor should be chewy yeah it's
it's it's funny because so Motorola is
not just in charge of innovation when it
comes to the smartphone but in the cell
phone business you know they started as
the the first company to build a radio a
car radio that's how they started that
was the first product they ever made so
they we had innovations there we had
innovations in two-way radios like the
way we would communicate in airports all
of us had motorola two way radios that's
how we communicated but I remember my
first phone was in Nokia but then
because the cell phone carrier most of
the cell phone carriers in Latin America
are owned by a company called millicom
for those of you that don't know
millicom is co-owned by Motorola so you
know that alone was that one of the main
reasons why there are so many Motorola
products being sold back in the day back
in the CDMA days
of the pinna of the cellphone and so my
god I literally had almost every
Motorola phone you could think of from
the Vulcan to the Vader to the StarTAC
to the time-poor to these names I was
the mold attack and you know so here's
the thing
like right now we praise Apple for
things like design like does anybody
remember the v60 one of the first metal
phones back in a day that moto v60 it
was the first one with a secondary
display they used this like liquid type
of LCD which was like greenish sort of a
tint of blue I remember my first text
message just happened on a motorola time
port and you know how they came up with
a waste of duty nine and everything like
all these were Motorola innovations guys
and then they came out with the razor
probably the coolest phone that I think
the Brandon took a break right now but I
wanted to get his chime on that there
was a phone that never does anybody
remember the Motorola Q as well because
Brandon has it right there and so just
think about how many phones were so
great for Motorola right before the
iPhone came in but probably my favorite
one that never happened Brandon do you
remember the MPX 220 didn't have a flip
screen or something so it was a pocket
PC that had a screen with two hinges and
so if you could open it vertically we
had a special hinge where you could open
it vertically and you could use it as a
dial pad to make a phone call as a flip
phone or you can open it horizontally
switching the hinge and now it had a
QWERTY keyboard that you can use for
typing it cancels that right they
cancelled that but you know Motorola
came up with these like daring designs
and that's really what I miss about them
the fact that they were just these
really cool products very thoughtful
products yeah that could completely got
diluted and the simplicity of the slab
that came with the iPhone like all those
companies from that era they didn't have
the capacitive touchscreen they were
going in a certain direction and the you
know there is a another different
direction when the iPhone came out and
and then even when the smart phones came
in like phone calls on a Motorola phone
continued to be better than anything out
there it's like using that's the problem
a lot of people don't know
what a now and what an analog phone
sounded like but they sounded like an
analog phone where you were literally
it's like if you had somebody till you
were talking with somebody like right
there like right in front of you
it was that good and that's how Motorola
phones still sound today you know it's I
missed those kinds of things I wish that
Motorola didn't end up the way it did
because I feel that it deserves more
limelight true
hopefully you maybe one day in the
future we're going to see that happen
but until then and on that note that is
going to be it for now I want everyone
