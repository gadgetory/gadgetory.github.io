comparisons and we got a lot of noise in
comments and messages to put the U 11 up
against LG's recent price cuts flashback
designs multimedia prowess and
innovative features this was one of the
toughest comparisons I've yet shot for
Pocket now so buckle up we've got a lot
of ground to cover to see which phone
might be worthy of your hard-earned cash
HTC u 11 vs. LG g6 it's go time
I always kick things off with design and
for the first time in a while I don't
have an easy win to deliver both
companies should be celebrated for
shaking things up neither the g6 nor the
U 11 resembles efforts from last year LG
has been experimenting significantly
eventually arriving on this tall skinny
slab HTC is walked away from machined
aluminum in favor of a mirror finish
rear that looks almost like liquid it's
one of the most slippery phones I've
ever held so use the snap on case or be
careful placing it on an uneven surface
it's the more daring design move so it
does showcase finger prints and micro
scratches more readily both
manufacturers deliver handsets which
stand out but LG eats out a win the
brushed robocop titanium rear the new
aspect ratio flush camera sensors and
the G sex feels a bit better assembled
on our review units cleaner transitions
from glass to metal looking at the tech
inside the hardware debate stresses
major differences in philosophy a more
flexible lifestyle handset versus a more
powerful focused flagship no camera
tricks no headphone jack and twice the
built-in storage the U 11 does benefit
from that Qualcomm 835 magic snappier
and lower power use we get a nifty
squeeze feature to fire up an app or
take a photo but that's hardly a
revolutionary new way to engage with
data and services over say a
customizable button LG takes the
opposite and more adorned approach dual
cameras built-in headphone jack and
better lifestyle durability though LG
has built the g6 around last year's
chipset affecting performance against
newer handsets the U 11 takes a win for
the extra storage in horsepower but a
smart phone klutz should probably be
looking at the G
6.now LCD - LCD the numbers sound more
impressive on the g6 but overall surface
area is nearly identical this taller
design delivers that area in a smaller
shell these two compete really well in
overall lifestyle use both the U 11 has
a higher maximum brightness and is less
temperamental about boosting that
brightness in daylight conditions more
content is currently available for
sixteen by nine screens but color
displays will be all the rage and LG is
ahead of the curve mainstays like
YouTube and Netflix are already well
supported but game scaling is still a
bit rough
I'm usually loath to award based on
potential but we're giving LG the win
for the more progressive hardware and
the story flip flops on software HTC
used to be the king of manufacturer
skins tweaking almost every aspect of
the UI but over the last two generations
this company has walked back the
severity of Sense style alterations
we're pretty close to stock with a few
minor additions HTC's major add-on is a
fairly benign software assistant this
little orb floats off to the side when
there's relevant information to share
with the user it's not trying to step on
Google assistance toes but it also
hasn't added much to my use over the
time I've had the U 11 LG strays farther
into manufacturer customizations some
for the benefit of the taller screen but
mostly maintaining some kind of unique
feel for their products one easy example
of where this works is adding a little
button for auto brightness instead of
forcing a user to go through the
settings however we detailed an example
of where manufacturer customizations can
fall apart in our g6 vs. 1 + 5
comparison how several apps failed to
properly report what was eating up my
storage I genuinely like a lot of LG's
additions but again we have to give the
software win to the U 11 and it's
simpler layout it's that simpler
software and more powerful chipset which
handily deliver the performance win for
the U 11 that really shouldn't shock
anyone in our audience last year's
chipset in the g6 is still a solid
option users likely won't notice much
difference recovering the basics UI
navigation or social media but 2017 is
proving to be another good year for
Qualcomm if app developers start pushing
the
boundaries on services or more graphics
intense fair you'll be buying a little
more future proofing on the U 11 and the
camera fight was really fun to compare
again for the wildly different
approaches we have real camera reviews
for both phones and if you want the full
scoop we highly recommend you check
those out for a ton of real-world
samples to boil this down each phone
strength is the other phones weakness
HTC delivers a better Auto shooter which
has consistently been LG's main weakness
and vice versa if you want near
professional manual controls LG is one
of the best options available on the
market today the one area where HTC
clearly has an advantage is with
low-light performance the larger sensor
and more even-handed sharpening should
produce better night images though we
often find ourselves fighting how bright
the camera app can push exposure yet for
HTC's excellent main camera features LG
slightly slower focusing system was
often less confused by busy backgrounds
and the second sensor is a wonderful
addition lending significant flexibility
to phone photography there's no clear
winner here a well focused streamlined
shooter a more flexible array of sensors
and controls and both with phenomenal
audio recording options they will appeal
to different audiences but you can't
really go wrong with either if you know
what you're in for
moving to audio speaker Tek is an easy
one for HTC bringing back the dual
earpiece and bottom firing speaker it's
not true stereo but it's more nuanced
than a single speaker
Oh
headphone comparison on the other hand
requires a bit more discussion the tests
we ran during our you 11 real audio
review looked a bit off so we grabbed a
second dongle and we reran our
benchmarks this improved some of the
noise and dynamic range numbers but
overall quality is still lower than the
g6 and playback is still truncated to
16-bit audio the amps are similar an
output which is one of the more
noticeable elements of a good headphone
jack regular everyday use mp3s users
won't be punished by this dongle but
this is not audiophile grade for folks
who already own nicer headphones another
problem though we faced more audio
gremlins on this new adapter our first
pass on the audio test delivered some
strange Distortion
HTC's main commitment to audio is
focused on the included earbuds the tech
is phenomenal for how HTC scans your
ears to customize output and the combo
of passive and active noise reduction is
terrifically implemented but we still
have concerns over proprietary audio
solutions sure this is USBC but these
don't play with any other USB see device
and if you lose one say while traveling
it's highly unlikely you could easily
track down a replacement LG solution on
the g6 isn't quite as techie cool but
the 3.5 millimeter jack is built-in and
it produces a higher quality output so
LG takes the headphone win looking at
run-time
neither phone proves to be a battery
champ in our media bench the u Elevens
newer processor is more power efficient
but the battery is also smaller so any
advantage there is effectively
neutralized and finally our recharge
test was also nearly identical the g6 is
technically charging faster the same
percentage of a larger battery but in
practical use these two are essentially
the same lastly it should also be
mentioned that HTC delivers a more
complete experience out of the box
snap-on clear case headphone adapter
headphones the u 11 kinda needs those
additions in my opinion so it's nice to
see them in the box so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us between the HTC
u 11 and the LG g 6 comparisons are
always more fun when you've got a close
fight the main takeaway to brands
battling bringing their a game and both
delivering fresh takes on foam design as
the guy who produces the camera reviews
rolling around in the dirt I'm a bigger
fan of the higher rated durability
certification and manual camera controls
I prefer the traditional headphone jack
and this screen aspect ratio is daring
LG is doing a very good job of
demonstrating what can be done with a
taller display however in this moment
phone to phone
HTC produces the better consumer
all-rounder the more powerful phone and
the
streamlined experience out of the box
and in the hand view 11 will likely
resonate with more general consumers
looking for something with a little
flash and something that gets out of the
way of their most used data and services
though there is a significant pricing
difference at the time this comparison
was shot the costs make sense and
compare well against each other
different philosophies for different
target consumers which phone would win
