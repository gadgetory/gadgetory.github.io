we're going to look at a hardware tour
of the t-mobile g1 also known as the
google android phone so here it is and
at the top is our speaker there's a
little LED light in there at the bottom
we have some buttons you see that so the
menu it's a little trackball here house
button a green phone button back arrow
button and a red phone button that also
ask as power button so you'll let down
to turn it on now these buttons are very
flesh so it's hard to feel them in dark
you can feel them but they're hard to
find now over here is little rubber flap
and that covers up the extended USB port
it's the same as all the other HTC
devices which is great because you can
use the adapters for audio little flap
is kind of annoying there's a microphone
hole over here is volume buttons up and
down the top is nothing around the back
or the other side there's a camera
button it does have a half press for
focus on a full press for photo capture
fact we see is speaker grill and a
camera lens that can be used as a mirror
you can see that there's our camera
now we also have a sliding keyboard you
see the screen kind of goes up and then
over a little hump you see there's an
attachment here that goes through this
arc as well as these little change there
now you hear that is quite loud which is
pretty annoying and then we have our
keyboard in focus
anyway that is pretty smooth too
a little hard to feel there is a slight
ridge on the F and J q so you can find
those so slight differentiation so you
can feel those with your thumbs very
small space bar we have a menu button
over here which is good brings up the
menu on the screen yeah and your own row
of number teeth backlight as well
now the other thing is where is the
microSD card turns out this little piece
of plastic right there it's very hard to
notice that if you fingernail in there
possibly there it is
one gig
comes with the device and what about the
battery
and so you gotta put your fingernail
under there this is it a flimsy little
back in there and here's our battery has
HTC innovation on it there it is and
this is where your SIM card goes that
comes out like that and difficult so
well
so that's g1 now let's compare it to
some other spices here is the Titan to
see it's a lot longer only a little bit
thinner much I'll
that's the same way
okay and here's the trio and W trio is
shorter still
very small bit finem in the trio if you
don't count the banana lip
trios a lot lighter and then the diamond
see the diamond is a lot smaller much
much thinner
so that's it for the hardware tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
