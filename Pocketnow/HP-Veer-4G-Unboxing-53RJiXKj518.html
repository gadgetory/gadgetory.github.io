pocketnow.com if you're tired of those
large form factor phones out there then
you probably really liked the palm pixi
and palm pixi plus both of these devices
have really small 2.6 inch displays with
a really nice keyboard on the front very
clicky by the way you can hear it
they're super thin super light super
tiny they slip into the pocket very
easily and a lot of people really like
this form vector while HP or palm
previously known as is back with the
veer which is their next version of the
pixie taking that really small sort of
form factor and bringing it to a
smartphone operating system in this case
the latest version of webOS why do they
call it the veer well palm and HP wanted
to quote veer away from these larger
form factors and come out with a device
that is tiny small in fact this is the
smallest smartphone that you can get and
in this video we're gonna unbox it let's
get to it
okay so before we get started let's take
a look at the box here see if we have
seen any interesting specs on the back
we see built in a GPS of course a 5
megapixel camera no front-facing camera
this is also HSPA+ compatible category
10 which means in theory you'll be able
to get maximum speeds a 14 point 4
megabits per second in practice if you
happen to have AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ in your area
you'll get probably about 6 megabits per
second down not as fast as t-mobile 4G
which is around 10 maybe 9 and Verizon
and Sprint which are up there at about
12 to 14 megabits per second depending
on how strong your connection is so
we've got a 800 megahertz processor in
the veer with 512 megabytes of RAM it's
SPECT a lot higher than the original
pixie and pixie Plus which should lead
to a really nice experience again the
latest version of webOS here with the
stackable cards so let's slide it out
and rough side down here and here's what
it looks like obviously it looks very
much like a shrunken down Palm Pre - and
we've got a pre here to show you take
off the cover here is the device it is
super tiny and we're going to compare it
to other devices in a second to show you
how tiny it is and in the box we've
actually got an interesting accessory to
talk about now because the veer is so
tiny it does not have a charging port it
does not have a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack kind of kind of depressing in a way
but it's you gotta think about it like
as different so so if you look around
the device as you can see you don't see
any of that any ports no 3.5 millimeter
jack and no charging port we see this
and this is the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack you must attach this piece which
attaches with a magnet and then you've
got your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the hard thing of the difficult thing
about this is that this pops off sort of
easily well if you twist it a little bit
so if you're at the gym and you you
accidentally tug on the wire for the HPV
R you're probably going to unplug the
headset with that magnetic part but if
you're charging it's not that big of a
deal you're probably letting it alone on
the desk or the floor or wherever you
charge and this is what the charging
cable looks like so just like three
five millimeter headphone jack magnets
suck it in you pull it off and so not a
big deal a lot of people are complaining
about this but that's that's the
trade-off you get a small device but
they had to remove a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the charging port
okay so let's take a look around the
device here just a quick look and we've
got a a palm
esque quick button to turn the device
into silent mode which is always handy
to have we've got a power button here
five megapixel camera on the back
there's the speaker this phone is so
small and my hands are kind of smallish
so it really doesn't show you how some
all this devices look at it next to the
HP or that actually it's the palm you
have to draw the line in the sand when
Polly became HP the pre two so you can
see that you could probably fit not two
but one and a half veer on the the Palm
Pre to Palm Pre - as a larger display
here of 3.1 inches and it's got a faster
processor one gigahertz for the same
amount of RAM 512 so a little bit slower
here in terms of the the clock speed of
the processor but it should be pretty
fast pretty well optimized for webOS and
let's see if we can remove the back
battery cover just to see what that's
like I'm assuming that you pop it off
here this device is so cute umm yeah
we've got to look into that to figure
out how to do that soft touch plastic on
the back and make it makes it havin a
nice in hand feel and of course they did
away with the front-facing keyboard here
now we've got a slide up keyboard and
let's see how the size of the keys
compared to the pre 2 so let's get a
little bit closer and the keys are
definitely smaller let's let's see if
they're as clicky yes they are as clicky
as the pixi people will be rejoicing
about that across the interwebs so very
cute spring-assisted slider nice looking
device extremely small this is a cool
phone to have if you're tired of those
big devices out there that take up a
large amount of space in your pocket or
whatever got a lot more coverage coming
up on the HP veer 4G we're going to run
speed tests talk about the software talk
about how fast it is compared to
previous webOS devices
and determine whether this device is too
small or just the right size to be super
pocket-friendly if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
