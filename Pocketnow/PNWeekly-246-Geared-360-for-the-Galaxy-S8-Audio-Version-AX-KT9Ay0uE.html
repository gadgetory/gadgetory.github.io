brought to you by mara a I technology
has changed the way we run thanks to
smartphones now even casual runners can
map their roots create pumpup playlists
and track their progress however taking
advantage of all of these technologies
has always meant stopping to look at
your phone which means losing motion and
momentum and that's about to change
because now there's Mara a hands-free
running assistant that uses voice
recognition and the microphone in your
ear buds to help you optimize your runs
you can tell her what kind of run you'd
like to do last questions about your
speed pace or location or have her play
albums and playlists from your music
library Mara can also tell you how
you're doing in comparison to your past
runs or warn you about changes in the
weather like if it's about to rain
should leave interactive regrets by
noting all of your hot spots and rough
legs each time you run you can connect
Mara to Amazon Alexa enabled devices and
ask her about lifetime statistics and
records you've said while you get ready
for your next run visit Mara day I to
download your free virtual running
assistant today and we thank them for
supporting the pocket now weekly now
Before we jump into the show you may
have noticed that we've uploaded two
different versions of this podcast one
with video one without featuring Jules
hi May Ricky from gsmarena and myself
because we were so excited to get our
hands on a new gear 360 we thought it
would be fun to shoot a whole podcast
sitting around the camera so you could
feel like you were really in the middle
of our discussion now there's no video
for this version of the podcast as it
turns out that 360 degree video is kind
of a terrible way to watch people having
a long-form discussion when they're all
circling the camera you're looking
around like crazy but if you're that
kind of masochist who really wants to
see what the gear 360 can do in mediocre
lighting you're more than welcome to
click the link in the description below
this video and now let's get on with the
show so folks we're trying something
experimental this week for the podcast
in light of the excitement over the
Samsung unpacked event we are in New
York City it's this is an after dark
episode where we're on probably a few
too many alcoholic beverages and a few
too many cups of coffee to present you
with an entertaining
wrap-ups commentary on what we we what
we got to see today galaxy SI galaxy SI
+ samsung gear 360 what am i missing me
updated here we are updated gear VR all
right yeah within the club I don't
really how much in the gear VR was
updated kids like they said the Cure PDR
controller it was unfit than you've
blown right so we're still support
always out there was at six which is
nice but you know but but again I mean
maybe maybe that one was a little more
of a modest update no I just kind of
catching up to daydream there but I so
we're going to try this as we're going
to be talking about these products we're
using one of these products to produce
this video and hopefully this works
otherwise you're just going to be seeing
an audio version of the podcast Stefan
knives I'm not entirely sure we're
charged and ready for episode 246 you
know I'm not even going to get into I
don't even know if this episode's
sponsored so if it's sponsored I'm
positive authors who might have
contributed money to this rolling train
fire Ragueneau a good idea to look up
why rolling green fire can we please
specify this time I'm feeling good yeah
it is one what time is it it's 120 a
tweezer and eastern daylight time am
Bigelow but I really like the running
joke today has been a app so it's 120 am
three more hours and it'll be surprised
and so we're we're going to jump in and
kind of share our reactions I think
there's a lot to talk about here even
though some of this was a lot of this
was sort of confirmation you know the
idea that we knew a lot of this stuff
going into the event obviously on one
Carlos bag now senior editor pocket now
joined as always plucky podcast producer
mr. Jules wang so far joined by demand
the myth the legend uh mr. I'm going to
butcher your lesson via quit you guys
Ricky via class from gsmarena and of
course you never get mine right hi may
Rivera from pocket now that was so high
may underscore rivera and that's hi de
rivera
that's who he is so now I want to jump
right in um obviously i think the videos
that are going to be hittin the hardest
for all of us I mean the content that I
think most of our fans and most of our
audience have been most excited about
galaxy SI in Ricky I want to start with
you we were having a lot of
conversations about no form factor
design and for what we do with Samsung
going into the note 7 this looks like
it's an interesting evolution over what
Samsung achieved at the end of last year
obviously that's been absent from the
market what do you think about that
translation do you think that they've
updated it enough do you feel like this
is a little too conservative samsung or
do you think that this is going to wow
people when they see it I think angle I
mean maybe arguably to some of media
people it didn't really well them but to
the public I'm sure that many more
people will be wowed it's definitely an
evolution from it up seven because the
note said one was a buildup on the s7 no
7 and was that symmetrical design ideas
right yeah let's put then but note the
s8 and s8 let's just takes it to a new
level with that near bezel is design of
the screen itself and and then just no
knocking off the non edge model
altogether right it was just as a
domestic letter develop edges flat model
so it's just become the standard for
Samson now so it's a new page in the
book for your samsung literally cuz it
baby oh I don't know where my book
accident oh it wasn't going to be right
how you donated it to charity okay no
I'm going to because you know where and
on the article deal I'm going to steal
an amazing job here because we're Apple
would charge you hundreds of dollars to
learn about the design process of their
dads it samsung just gives it to you for
free they're giving out of types of
Embree but we're not sure if they're
going to sell out to the filigree like
next week i'm looking up on ebay to see
if any of these are moving what do you
come in here you're going to see if a
coin you're gonna be on ebay but i mean
like for how much you know and so so I
like in talking about design and form
factor because i know you hi mate you've
been you've been a really big fan of the
LG G six all right and so I know when we
started talking about screen sizes this
is like a big problem is now we need to
find a new way to talk about
screen size because when you change the
aspect ratio you can't just say the
diagonal 5.7 inch diagonal on the g6 is
not the same as a 5.7 inch diagon to be
20 so that slight difference going from
sa to g6 are you still going to be do
you think you're still going to be in
the same ballpark I mean that that
impression that that you are really on
board l Jesus this year do you think
that Samsung is going to be able to kind
of follow in their footsteps or do you
think that that size increased is still
going to push them out I think it's the
future I well we we've experienced it
with the t6 and the cool thing is
everybody saw that right yeah it was I
don't know we're talking about to the
audio broadcast what did not have known
lovely 60 video is such a head trip
trying to figure out where this thing
going on so I'm kind of so I'm kind of
mixed over the concept of I do love the
ideal of larger displays on smaller warm
crackers we've been sharing our
adoration of phones like the g2 exactly
like watching companies like really try
and maximize are you actually I feel
that's the way to go the problem is that
companies are doing an amazing job when
it comes to hardware both LG and Samsung
from what we saw today from oh we've
tested with a g6 it feels really cool to
use either of these phones yeah I can't
even say obviously I'm a bigger fan of
the way LG is doing it because i don't
like curved displays mainly because of
palm rejection right obviously this
wasn't final software so we're not
really sure if Samsung has addressed
that I assume they have well but I had
issues with the s7 edge and even just
trying to poke around the camera app at
the show floor today in holding the but
I'm really nervous either the sm event
so yeah when I was doing um when I
because I got to spend a day with the SN
an inch before i sent it to you at some
video shooting from that and that would
have some issues how I was holding the
phone at the camera and so I'm even more
nervous I never got to do the note 7 if
I don't know if the symmetrical design
would have messed me up one I just I
need to hold on to something for three
or four really aggressive days of
shooting photos and videos and rolling
around in the dirt and that was that
maybe
afraid that's why there is
disappointment again I like the approach
of LG because you know LG proves they
don't need a curved display to provide
ergonomics mm-hmm that's that's what
they prove there's just no way around it
you know you've got a grippy you've got
a gritty trim got an amazing back that's
depending on the color you choose there
are no fingerprints to deal with right
um but again it just you know you don't
have this sort of this quasi ergonomic
concept of less curved display in order
to provide organ arm if you don't need
them where's the proof that you don't
and should hands back to me because
there's actually script that I have to
do the question of the question is is it
the most convenient going to 18 x 9 or
18.5 by nine now we can ever to say is
that it's to buy one I I got my guys
crapping the comment because like I
still was like it put it here by one
displaying right no no it's 18 45 54 to
46 to won 18 x 95 no it's taking but no
I name is the height of the screen level
80 pixels tall I totally wrote that
wrong somewhere yeah I really pulled
everything off gsmarena but the thing is
the question is whether company is going
to address the software part yeah
because I you know Apple is the least
efficient when it comes to design yeah
but their software reach ability is
something that I used all the time on
the iphone 7 plus I had I use it all the
time so much trouble trying to trigger
the edge features on the essays because
yeah that little one little pad on the
side of the home screen and you know it
goes kept okay one end let's come on get
out well I didn't show the action on
camera so I've got two video clips of
the edge features being out and they're
only there because I did it by accident
and then I within a rolling video
anyways like I fry me this shot anyway
idea I couldn't really forgot there were
at controls that's been since the s6
edge like I don't think it's brought
anything you're the table anything else
yeah but five ergonomics well we're
still on a topic like I found it very
comfortable to hold it's amazing that
we're still talking about you know the
Speights the facts that were how about
different a courage that we have five
point a five point eight inch screen I'm
holding in my hand made it's just i but
it feels comfortable I gotta hold it and
it's comfortable six more inches the FA
plus yeah I never thought that would be
a manageable and manageable size but yes
it's here it's real and you know I mean
cut to the b roll baby I love is I was
going to say anything 360 video I might
be able to like I think on this wall
over here able to like sneak in a few
little video clips and we'll see how
that goes um it's a different story
music so because in following up on what
you said about software I think that's
my biggest concern with this form factor
change is we only see these companies
sort of dipping their toes into
maximizing that screen real estate
otherwise it's just a really tall screen
you know LG's got the camera features
you can do the side-by-side square
shooting and Samsung has the mtm incomes
and I videos free trade they've got the
navigation trade you know I just I asked
myself this all the time and I try to be
as polite as possible but I'm like do
they actually use these products before
you launch though any have you ever have
you ever tried walking you know going
like crazy on a metro station right at a
subway trying to find your like when I
went into a gate at the airport its
nautical today that i learned that
google maps had a way to zoom in and
zoom out with the one pressure on finger
I had no clue so imagine all those
crimes when i'm dragging right the my
laptop and gear and everything in the
stroller and i literally have to stop
yeah i have to stop and find where I'm
going because sadly the software is not
up
for me to be able to do it with one hand
totally the only problem the only
product i can do that with is the least
efficient of the mall the iphone 7 plus
0 because it reachability because i was
i was for a second era was gonna squeal
he said you know the iphone SE know
which is the perfect one thumb i'm here
to figure it's one of those things where
again i feel that companies need to
please do that it's either apple owns
the patent for each ability well i mean
other companies have done things like
screen shrink like Samsung actually has
look what I like about Samsung's Skreet
were trouble like a triple flip yeah
different book try the triple click
which I didn't try you know the problem
of the triple click because I enabled it
yesterday as I am is reactivating the s7
edge for you know the comparison and
everything and I was like okay so it's
back here it's great it's just triple
click is kind of complex oh yeah this is
one of those things where why do I like
the feature on the iphone so what it's
just a double class there's a double
touch yeah it just slides down and it
works way more consistently the thing i
think about the samsung knows because
you know we all make jokes about my
stumpy thumb um is that you Michael
can't reach across the iphone 7 plus a
great the full width of this right now
whereas if I can trigger screen samsung
I know I actually do have a one once I'm
interface there um Ricky what do you
think about some of the people that have
been criticizing potential missteps like
I have concerns about the thin edges
being able to hold on to the phone but I
don't think that's a misstep but then
you try and reach up to something like
the fingerprint sensor and if you're
right-handed I don't know that there's a
way to hit that without like smudging up
your camera sensor welcome I'm not going
to interrupt you but I really want to
talk about that really awkward it is is
really awkward ennis to i would say i
have average size pants I don't have
like a mom don't have some small by hand
but it's just even that the x8 you know
trying to reach that is like oh I have
to move like my finger up like half an
inch more
natural and if those si+ forget it yeah
he even talked even higher up so I don't
feel comfortable with the whole floor
button foolish because now we have to
fix B button that we have to trigger
it's right below the volume control on
the left side and you know how did you
figure out which ones which if you're
trying to reach into your pocket and you
know do that like okay if you're trying
to care in a rush it's it's small its
tiny to just little divot and you know
if you're you know what you might not be
able to tell what you're touchin well I
think it definitely it it what's funny
is I think this is the first time in a
long time that Samsung fans are going to
have to relearn some muscle memory we've
got a bunch of people that are
complaining air comment about losing a
home button I know I don't even think
it's it's it's what customers really do
I think it's what Samsung is trying to
do i don't i don't think that there is a
there is a more obvious approach to
killing the fingerprint scanner right
what Samsung just did right now we r SE
I mean we can't very clear let me just
probably you tell me this what is the
design look any better with that button
there I really looks again like they
went for symmetry and I did that one it
rings what even it's red even submit
evil I mean I look at it and it looks
like if something is looking at you with
one eye up at the other way I'm
like okay like if you were trying to
follow the mazda symmetry of the smile
on the modhri and the reason why that
car sold so much i'm sorry but you
really screwed it on this is on his
phone it's not for symmetry it looks
terrible it is there to be like listen
the buttons there and you even notice in
the demo when they're playing the whole
demo during the presentation right you
notice that the model but but it's
actually a mock-up drawing yeah the
model has to re handle the phone to be
able to press the thing
so this is like you want a fingerprint
scanner fight for it because we've got
something cooler which is the iris
scanner and facial recognition and okay
I can I segue into these things oh wait
Jules legal assembly at the shoulder I
working double daughters like uh yeah
well I remember si si plus I I did the
video on that and one comical wait oh we
know why the iris scanner didn't work on
the page ah I'm racist racism I love it
pretty um oh yeah it was back to the
display especially sidetracking couple
segments here is the on our group chat
someone was like look someone to the mat
and they were like what what equivalents
ice cream what a 69 video look like on
this 18.5 whatever admit r i9 display
and the s8 comes out to like 5.19
something would you have a 5.2 inch
screen oh yeah I know you can get it it
was really close at eight plus it is
like a 5.5 inch just like iphone buy
something right so someone like it was
funny because they put a link in it was
like an Excel now for the curvature and
well no there was a loss if you if you
take away the curving size because you
know the corners of the screen curveball
to the law of thermodynamic he remove
that if you hold the black bars of the
69 video yeah yeah what you would be
left with is about the same size as the
current s7 and s7 edge but so basically
what they did was extended the screen
added the black wires and then they can
say oh look it's a five point eight inch
means to 620 which crime I'm not sure
what we're talking what we're going to
talk about in terms of people going to
apps and be able to crop the video link
to fill in the hole streams what that
means for consumer you know confirm two
more videos I don't know I what's over
example when I when I got the d6 one of
the things one of the things that I
noticed first was ok so it's cool you
gave me a taller display but if you
notice like I'm trying to remember what
phone it was where the display got
taller but it wasn't
got taller they just got rid of the
discoverer of the navigation buttons
yeah and so all that real estate that
you gain was actually the nav the
software navigation button that there
are right i think was the Galaxy Nexus
something like that it was an old phone
from back in the day right and so we get
that same effect here where you do get a
larger display but you will take some of
that real estate with navigation well
don't we think that's that's why it's an
18.5 as opposed to entertain by nine
because that 80 pixels is sort of being
eaten up by the software control the
videos remember the software controls
are not permanent they go away whenever
you don't need monster I just wish that
these companies were were like all right
what why don't we figure out this like
the pillar boxing is not going away
anytime soon right you know I understand
that software can scale towards smart
toward smartphones but video is not
going to scale anytime soon consumer
cameras are not going to scale anytime
so so here's YouTube is not going to
change welcome you YouTube is a very is
a very precious case for them right now
where I actually think that Samsung and
LG age is in the same boat I mean we
shouldn't be throwing this on on samsung
right now where I think those two
companies will probably find an ally is
with Amazon and Netflix because if
you're doing film rips you can go and
tell the app when there's letterboxing
you can fill more of this screen in an
8900 18.5 by nine yeah aspect ratio
display and you won't have pillar boxing
even though the video file is probably
16 by 9 with letterboxing and you can
just get rid of that black space the
YouTube problem is going to be from so
many people who have been shooting 16 by
9 video and where it fills the screens
of our phones and it's not just so it's
not just YouTube is what what we used to
create YouTube video ad by night I mean
I'm give me one camera that can chew an
18 x mine samsung nx1 and haha I mean
that was off the top of my head and
melted mdlz be 20
the lcg six endless you fix no no I'm
talking about a consumer camera that
when we use I mean well I mean that
that's what let's see this is why I was
I was so concerned going through some of
the software stuff was Samsung has
probably the best take on the market for
you I for polishing up the UI especially
when we're looking at things like
cleaning up androids ability to split
screen apps yes because I cheat the
woman who's going for the demo with me
she's just flying like sliding a video
up here i'm going down to a text
messaging app i'm moving these things
back and all this in pre-production song
and all of the preferential software and
she's just fine and it looks so cool it
looks whereas when we were trying to do
the same thing with the g6 it's a little
bit more cumbersome and it doesn't
handle some of those transitions as well
um but then you flip it over and you
look at something like I'm not saying
you can't do it I'm just saying I don't
think you can manipulate the g6 as
fluidly and with the same exacting
control I over how you can video files
back and forth scream train come back up
pop up the key hours but it has
everything to do with you I animation
more than it has to do with capability I
blow I mean those things go hand in hand
though I mean so I'm gonna tell what
it's like for as much as I'm with you on
liking the LG g2x I think we both agree
it needs a software up okay it's simple
let me guess you can tell this PR I love
I was actually happier with the
pre-production oh is it final you can
have those representatives do drills you
know every day no no I like I get triple
anyone I totally get your bike wait but
listen to the flip side of that is like
why i opened up the samsung camera app
and it shoots a 4 by 3 photo which is
not using any of the delay it's all
empty black space and the fun thing that
they have to show me isn't something
which takes advantage of the hardware is
we can do snapchat style stickers now if
we can put little bunny ears on you at a
little doggy nose just like snapchat
you're like you know that's cool but if
i wanted to do that I'm like I would
just go to snatch you know the moments
when they gave me that time I'm like do
you really understand the fact that the
people that are going to be buying this
phone
snapchat yeah the people that can pay
for this one I really buy are not going
to be on snapchat but anyways that
that's you know going back I get your
point and I i feel that companies i feel
that LG did a really good job in trying
to box their user interface in a way big
advantage of the to buy one yeah good
samsung could do a little more work but
i feel that in general if we're going to
adopt 18.5 by 918 by 9i think companies
need to do more work oh and again just
I'm serious companies the phone is
beautiful both phones are beautiful but
I actually need for you guys to come to
New York City it's right out there as an
engine backdrop tonight and i will i
will give you the new york city metro
challenge i will give you one of your
phones and i will ask you to please
operate these phones yeah under the
ergonomics that you say you offer what
we taught in a real-life scenario at for
a potential pocket knife challenge like
we have a series we would have a series
of tasks that we would have to complete
around like LA or New York and you're
like the more we thought about it
there's there's no phone that could
succeed even own a test that we ended
the I oh I see but job is like the
closest what I thought it was like with
the señor like an old blacken and again
i am not saying that i'm not saying that
this is not the future i'm saying that
please I mean I hate to praise an apple
I don't want to they're designed the
iphone 7 plus is you know the the g6 and
and the s8 prove that the the iphone 7
plus is terribly the humongous wasted
space it's a humongous Lee badly
designer am I allowed to say that or
that copyrighted by mkbhd this really a
wasted sorry buddy much too much are
those two little too much space line
mess up not enough stuff that other side
of the state thing
and so I you know again going back to
the top again is it the future yes are
the are the products very yet from a
software perspective like no and not
even close mainly going back to the
topic of four by three photos yeah four
by three photos and that's the standard
for my three is the standard the temple
it makes the most sense when you're
making the image sensor to maximize the
sensor to the lens well but but it's
that it's the fact that it's the 35
millimeter yeah I mean for my dream to
buy three yes very much the 35
millimeter shake shake film film shake
and it's been that way for many years
and I don't think it's going to go away
anytime soon expert the industry will
not catch up to this I think if it does
it'll probably will probably go to
square sensors but then you crop because
if you think about it but swear makes
the most sense for digital yes because
it would perfectly fit a circular lens
yeah that spectacles and get us where
Charlie that's not a terrible notion it
won't just had a high quality version of
it not examine of it but no I tell me i
feel that softwares which needed I
prefer lately particularly with the
essay you know I know you had a good
experience when I came to to flying I I
had a great experience with the phone
and everything that was the basic
scenario of a hands-on yeah where we
play with what they say that they offer
those displays are amazing oh I needed
knocked it out of the park in terms of
design they even knocked it out of the
park all terms of the design there's
just no way around that I mean that
orchid grey phone but I you know I
filled I don't know for how long and
never did I use the chamois to clean it
up I'm never did I use this champion
that was like when I was student with
the g6 is like oh I mean I can kinda see
fingerprints but this isn't terrible
like we think I finally figured it out
yes I know any dollars on their phones
apparently with the whole metallic multi
with liquor Lou is this grey and like a
little bit of a pattern and you don't
have to worry about so I've been over
before before we add before we wrap
with the the galaxy phones because I
want to get some of their other
announcements and then just some of the
other software features they talk about
um Ricky I think we're already starting
to hear that bubbling of like the more
spec oriented members of our audiences
that are like well yeah it's going to
get back welcome a 35 or the new X and
O's chipset so it's gonna be a powerful
but we're still talking four gigabytes
of RAM we're still talking a 12
megapixel camera we're still talking you
know some some of these designs of
batteries three thousand million power
battery in a 35 hundred million of our
batteries are we worried that because of
Samsung's response to the note 7 that
some of those we take it for granted
that Samsung's all be going to be
pushing the envelope on techie stuff
that some of this might be a little too
conservative for samsung fans out there
Wilda hat that aside the techie stuff
because X the Samsung right there and
everything in the kitchen sink kind of
confidence day well in so all this set
is we have a 10 nanometer project is I'm
not saying what processor would I think
our both processors broke hello so build
a well gsmarena says it's the Snapdragon
83 did you insisted on GSM Cara Maria
Rodolfo's out there if you haven't
checked out gsmarena they're a terrific
resource for getting us back on your
favorite phone um just so you know this
is the dua believe every has weekly
hahaha and we are not to put their
vengeance and marina we show de sousa
rosella from what I understand how is
that most of the world is going to be
getting the x announced and that select
markets and especially any market that
has to play with cdma is going to be
getting the balkan chipset right but
that across the board we're seeing that
yields on that 10 nanometer process that
they're still not getting the numbers of
completed chipsets up to the kinds of
yield they would want to mass-produce
these phones so there were rumors that
like Samsung might hold the phone for a
couple extra weeks that turned out not
to be true it's going to ship april
twenty first of all they're they're just
going to split play the scar city game
you know oh we're tard out and yet are
already going to be you know are they
sorry pushback from of like a March yeah
mom right is it doesn't sound familiar
to what a pretty company does I mean
well and I think this is like I think
it's 61 in half a dozen another I think
they legitimately are responding to
market concerns customer concerns over
the note 7 and I think that plays into a
narrative that they can create scary to
be at so many job site but I'm sorry
just just to get back to that question
because I'm kind of curious what your
thoughts are we we exist with audience
members that really do pay attention to
that kind of stuff I mean the visceral
debate and I'm sure you guys have to see
it to the visceral debates between you
know like the six gigabytes of RAM on a
one plus 3t version of the pixel and
they both have falkham a 21 and this
one's obviously superior Oh with that
screen resolutions terrible the camera
is this throw more Moore's law here's my
take on that if Samsung updated all of
that they have to lock themselves next
year who write so they have to save
something to upgrade yeah and like isn't
that what we used to q's Apple up but
that's what they do and that's what
Samsung does love now I couldn't cook
and with this yearly cycle of a new
phone coming out every year right there
has to be some kind of plan absolution
for the previous model yeah so at the
next model you know if he told her come
out every two years and if they did come
on over two years we would probably see
a significant spec bump but I guess you
could compare that to apples yeah the
major Elise's yeah because the other
ones are refreshes yeah so in that sense
then that makes sense but imagine it
apple released iphone 6 and iphone 7
right and then I phone 8 i'm every two
years and that's beside the point yeah
it's just that it was just that you know
the companies that have to save
something for next year so this is what
I think Samsung might be a victim of
their own success is because look at
what we've gone through with Samsung
from the s4 to the s5 significant
changes enhanced water resistance
terrible design as 52 s6 we lose some
features we gained much better design s6
s7 we keeps the awesome design get some
of those teachers bag and where could
they
oh so now we're here I mean I kind of
understand why he made a talking point
which description right but now I like I
kind of feel like our audiences are
getting hit too this is an iterative
update this is a major update you know
and so when you look at something like
the essay and some of the people that
have been leaving comments on our videos
this feels this even though the screen
is something radical the phone itself
still feels kind of conservative there's
no doubt the s7 edge was a beautiful
phone as well and I would you still use
it I still have the years my personal is
personal place yeah and I'm using just a
gut rot at seven flat edition took on
the table right now so oh you know how
much better can they get you know like
think about it now x 9 what are they
gonna do yeah with that oh wait a
display in various play six gigabytes of
ram whatever make it fly I'm going to
have wings I pop out of the olive oil on
it how funny would that be like you can
take your nine hundred dollar phone and
it's a drone Joe out the body of a
throne you just clip little propellers
into the corner and the front and back
cameras will be your selector that is
copyright jewels wall Sam you gonna say
that it goes pick about him I just when
you beat me to the copyright law for
that is best plug how about you take the
cover it I'll take trademarks drums on
BAM punch that in ICU right there yeah
us a way you don't want to be Elisha
gray in that deal and I want to be
Alexander Graham Bell you don't want
that situation I don't really in a
situation where you know you want to
watch yourself to get I wish that these
companies I don't know that I wish that
these companies would successfully pull
an apple when it comes to eliminating
the concept of the need of
specifications and being able to pull a
product that regardless of their
hardware positions is great enough to
deliver for years I mean today we were
at a bar no today we were at the noodle
place and the girl sitting down is rough
iphone for us yeah we were on the train
yeah you're like Wheatley I'm sure and
anyone who's watching or listening this
probably does the same thing like it
used to be i would judge people like by
what car they drove i mean that judge
them but you would kind of try and get a
sense of what their personality was like
oh you guys now he's probably a jerk oh
that's actually really like audi that's
why i'm picking on out there oh so we're
we sing on the drain and this girl just
pulled out a pristine yellow iphone 5c
in the pink dot case the other god like
it looked like it could have been
brandon brand new and yes I always
wanted to go over and like shake her
hand I mean like you're still using
essentially an iphone 5 yeah well done I
mean look at ariel a terrible iphone 5
is a terrible iphone 5 but but it's like
if that's really all you needed to get
what you have to get done there's like
well done like a nursery hundred dollars
but her whatever she spent you know I
feel like that like Samsung as long as
well as than a you know a lot of other
tech companies go through this bubble
where it's inflating constantly and
every year you know like just so we
talking over spec race customers
eventually you start getting bored of
this they're gonna start getting bored
as they look home is the same you know
what else can they do were they going to
have nine streams that are like this
long you know so but eventually
customers are gonna start looking at
something else that's going to be like
constant mental be dating do we think
that big speed could eventually be some
kind of solution to that like if we're
having smarter interactions with our
phones then maybe people care more about
what software services can do I mean if
Samsung's preparedness is an indication
it didn't think that at all they're not
earlier but it makes me dizzy voice is
not available oh my god in English 60 oh
it's available in Korean known as big so
big he is this hey Bixby capture this
and send it to this okay have you have
you ever managed the amount of steps it
takes you to take a screenshot and share
just a lot a lot of steps no snap
or on a galaxy it's if it's a galaxy
yeah cuz I thought Hannity say yes but
ok i will share buns right on this yes
but then it automatically creates an
icon on your notification tree just
slide down its share you choose food one
right now share it doesn't stay or do
you know it's just the concept of bixby
is cool it's just how is it any better
you know it'll it'll help you you point
your calendar you know we go back to
that concept where i'm at flatiron for
example they use that example yeah they
use the example of being a flat iron and
I get there and Bixley is automatically
going to suggest restaurants then I'm
like you know because these companies
the thing about IOT and the thing about
sorry no I don't people the thing about
me it's really I for example you saw it
with the HTC Quebec sense companion yeah
it is literally a product to sell you
something I mean way to Amazon's big
it's literally the whole concept of you
going to the htc's a lengthy and it's
full of sponsored content yeah like II
just charge me seven hundred fifty
dollars for this phone and you want to
sell me ask and so here's the problem
can you guarantee that the suggestions
that you're going to receive from that
service right are really the better ones
or are really the ones that pay these
companies to be in the ad that's the
problem that's what I love about google
and even then Google will have their
sponsored content at the top right but
you still get the result that you early
the results that you were looking for
whereas we can't control what these
companies are doing yeah you know we
really can't at least the problem is
that these companies want to become they
want to figure out ways to monetize from
different areas because their job is
simply to look good by shareholders yeah
and sadly that is not necessarily what
consumers need there there there it's a
it's a solution in search of a problem I
I feel that it is it's I i I'm like I
don't agree with you I would take it one
step further it's like I don't feel that
it's even a solution in search of a
problem I think this is just
their monetization or surprise are there
creating problems to create solutions
all right i mean like I've been watching
manufacturers you seem a little hulton
catch fire that can't dance okay it's a
show about like people in the making
computers in the 80s okay and one of the
things they come up with is like someone
accidentally creates the world's first
computer virus and it instantly spawns a
business right because you create the
sickness you can sell the curator of
words and so I kind of feel me like your
point like I don't think it's nefarious
in that I don't think anything in
capitalism is more realistic or a
moralistic when we're talking about just
we want to generate income for our
shareholders good work this is a
business tactic that they're employing
um now what I prefer to not do business
that way I would prefer not to and I
think going back to some of the things
you're saying I think that's where Apple
has I like a business moral high ground
in how they treat their customer data
where the product is the iphone not the
consumers have similar to the iphone not
many children so I don't know an i play
with vicks be a little it's pretty much
google it tries to be blue now it trying
to get treated you know I really feel
like I'm allow my half of an bixi review
done yeah freakin I would say I guess
hey uh miss be like good friends
references to Cindy community and say
hey Bixby you have to hit the big speed
but another day I have to push the
Amazon Alexa laughter automate not gonna
take your type for everything I would
you let me go I want to message drew you
know hey I it's funny it's finally made
its funny when they give us these
presentations about a yeah I'm serious
for our galaxy s a book review what I'm
what I'm most skeptical about is
actually playing with quickly yeah as I
was with the Google assistant when it
came for the way it came for because
this is the problem with with your
average youtube commenter they will be
like it me now pay attention you
any anything that's not anything that's
pro apple everybody in the conference
hates everything that's against google
or android or samsung or whatever
everybody in YouTube hates and so here's
the thing you know I'm doing my review
I'm doing the comparison of the pixel
with the iphone 7 and I'm like okay so
you're telling me that this is the
google assistant you named it an
assistant that's the name you gave it
what does my assistant do it helps me do
things okay right now the only the only
assistant and theory that's capable of
so many maneuver or actually doing
things for me at the time of that
comparison brent was series the Google
assistant is still in diapers in getting
third-party developers to actually
connect with us and you can actually
booked a table with opentable or get
tickets with Fandango or whatever and so
so long as the service isn't capable of
that all we can do is set an alarm
that's behind you do something and that
is pretty much it and so I'm like is it
really assisting me with something that
is not and you know at this moment there
is only one reason when i use the google
assistant it's when I get in my car and
I'm like take me home and because it
knows it knows right where it is yeah or
could give me give me driving directions
that I said miss that is literally all I
do I don't use it for anything else and
so the problem bixby is that the fact
that it's contextually aware the fact
that it knows what it sees on the
display does it really solve something
for the user does it really do something
this this is where I mean to play double
that me did I agree with you I have a
place to play devil's advocate um and
this is where I feel like even google
has made a tremendously serious misstep
in how they've been talking about Google
now Google assistant um especially this
weird move from google now to google
assistant at which as far as most people
are concerned is kind of the same thing
it just has a prettier interface they
just don't talk to each other yeah and
so that's really
whole it's like messaging androidland
right now only transitioned right
forever but that's a whole different
comic Sosa just like this notion hear
that bixby being a software layer on top
of Android created by Samsung
contextually aware it knows what's on
your screen it can look up what's what's
in front of your camera can it can sort
things out more organically
hypothetically hypothetically because if
that's their claim we have yet to be
able to set that claim um they're also
just selling its potential because a big
part of what they're saying is that
eventually developers will be on board
eventually it's going to accrue enough
data about you yeah to be better making
these recommendations waiting so it's um
and I need to do that and until one I
kind of feel it's my role you're getting
to play with all these gadgets to inform
people what these things do now today
yes and that's really I feel like where
we stopped at this is what you're
spending your money on oh but what about
these other things that are coming to
the I thought they won't come from when
right now this a bone they might come
they might not come but right now today
this is what it does we'll do a video is
it comes it comes and maybe we won't and
sadly from at least my experience
particularly with Google is they
announced what things it can do in
google i/o they launched it with their
with their launch product and then we
don't get to see anything until the
following year young they're selling you
another con yep and and whether or not
we can even pressure developers and
manufacturers to develop updates for the
phones that are currently out on the
market but to your point gut bixby a big
point of your review is it's like grow
them out or it's like Google yeah yeah
so what consumer is ever going to go
back when bixby gets that hot update get
two ton of new features who no one
that's bad be too late by then but I've
identity will have forgot about exactly
I like so the same thing is
that happened with Google assistant and
I really feel me personally there is no
evidence to support my assertion near
that the main reason we have a google
assistant was for google to add some of
these features if they had just dumped
it into google now no one would have
noticed but by rebranding it well now
we've got people talking about this new
piece this new piece of software that
lives in a low and is a part of the
pixel and does these new download what
is this but there's little room there
what did anything you need to share
document on out now but what the wait a
second do so it was yourself dating like
let me understand this your review roads
for a living let me understand how can
you survive in the life of a low when
you can't walk we can't have your
account on a different phone that I did
it it was asleep or that you know I
would like to be able to send my wife a
text message through a computer with the
only people i had on a low when i first
came out or other youtubers or other
like technica chambers widow whisper
it's our job to testes I'd our job to
switch phones everybody every other day
yeah and reconfirming the phone number
in multiple times with reconfirming a
phone number every time I wanna let me
to Alice not fun and you lose all your
chat is not even cloudy so so so again I
think Google has a humongous problem in
their execution strategy right now
because I mean look at everything that
we've talked about Google now Google
assistant Google a low their meds a
problem with messaging we're talking
about a new feature has to wait for the
newest version of Android the only poem
is going to get that in a timely fashion
is the next Nexus / pixel and then two
years later Google is already announcing
a competitor to the product that they
announced a year for which is only then
just making it to a samsung yeah okay so
anybody remember the launch time frame
of the pixel lost having there was
October 21 first ships okay months
November December January February
margel out to be six months it's about
to these six months and
how many companies are rocking android
senate dot one with the battery out
tonight not any kind of thing i was a
bracelet right now i can make only 11
plus what there is sony has that heaven
won so be over the only company the only
other company that's rockin 7 dot one
right now is 1 plus but computer
something oh my only cares about what
I'm i honest to god well but I mean
we're not so sort of trying to me don't
care about sorry the point the point
being is my god it's a disaster yeah
it's literally a disaster so I mean when
people get frustrated we're talking
about like things that Apple does well
it's because I would like to see some of
these companies start executing with
their products in the way that Apple can
sort of drive their own market I kind of
want to wrap up real quick because we
we've been sitting here for a while now
we've gone through a couple rolls on to
this is the or 360 s um this thing this
thing runs really well I'm hoping this
video is going to come out looking
looking halfway decent for 360 degree
video sound buy pre-owned it didn't
start to Overton at 40 minutes it's just
under 40 minutes so that's just
something to be aware of if you're
running really long you may be getting a
faster memory card memory card near my
house but also it's also set to 4k a
week oh yeah no I mean like its end of
shooting super high-resolution video
from two cameras sensors in a tiny
little body i'm not i'm not saying like
that's a deal breaker don't I to be
aware because I think if people are
looking at this as an action camera I
mean like you know when we did our drive
back from Vegas we ran for two hours on
a boat but it was the memory card but I
am a time and I absolutely great think
that'll help and then I so I had a plug
to charge so it was charging while it
was it it's fine I think it's nice but
we've all had a chance to play at least
a little bit with the gears 360 is the
redesigned the newest version of their
360 degree camera and just just real
quick i mean like Ricky's let me start
off with you um what are your thoughts I
mean
they don't have the little handle tripod
anymore the overall form factor is a
little bit smaller so I like that it's a
bit more discreet its significance well
actually I have the other one in my bag
all right over here but yeah I do like
that it's got a handle which they can
put over your battery they don't know
how to slide out battery yeah that's
right and well I think that means the
sphere bigger like to have the
engineering on that was it I thought I
saw it up there a funny part there I'm
gonna walk around everybody 60-degree
videos an exciting room I probably know
your area hard on it back oh they keep
my cell phone I wrestle I don't think I
brought it bring it I coulda sworn you
had it like in the kitchen gear as we
were no know how to figure out the yeah
go on no I mean I thought you had your
old one oh na na na na mad river to show
up all over 50 school dependent I did
not bring but football but we've got a
great okay it's not the one time I think
the runtime is adequate considering what
it is that we've been running this thing
through for so long but um the way that
it pairs with phones that are not
Samsung so this is this is still
pre-release we're running on a beta app
I mean I've got to connect it to a
galaxy a7 you're using a seven energy
but it requires Samsung's accessories
protocol with a white list of only
Samsung devices and eventually it's
going to get support for the iphone but
i feel like in a peripheral or an
accessory that can connect to an android
device this is an opportunity for
samsung to reach out to people who are
using other phones where instead I feel
like they're using it as an accessory
lock in walled garden right kind of
thing they're playing an apple I'm sorry
I hired it's like they're trying to
force the brand ecosystem lifestyle of
Galaxy devices but I'm not going to hold
it against them but they're genius i
mean it's their product idea they could
do whatever they want and it'll hold you
in a verse why but no this is the
frustration of reviewing I mean is used
more time with the year s 3 frontier and
when I when I did just sort of the
initial first look last review I really
wanted to see like they advertise that
it works with other devices it was kind
of hamstrung they trying to get it set
up and I'm disappointed to see a camera
system kind of fall into the same trap
you know I think that Samsung is just
playing it as what it is these are like
iphone cases and iphone accessories you
know these are they want they don't want
to show they want to tell people that
they don't want to share it but they
really want to lock people into their
ecosystem yeah it's literally you know I
think Stephen Elop set at best it's a
war of ecosystems yeah it's no longer a
walk products and if they open up their
products to other ecosystems it just
makes it stucks giving people a reason
to remain locked into the samsung world
so it makes sense well I guess like I i
guess the concern I have there is the
one idea would be this could potentially
dilute our market for samsung devices so
someone might own a galaxy phone get
this galaxy camera and then not be
afraid to buy another galaxy phone the
camera works with an HTC or it works
with an LG but my feeling is even like
looking what we saw from the note 7
debacle no one went out and got LG's no
one could have got HTC's they went from
a note 7 it predominantly to a galaxy s7
edge or not seven they still have it or
you have a review about I just kept up
so I feel like they stand to pick up
more people who were on competing
devices then they stand to lose by
trying to be restricted with their
ecosystem yes but that's that that
that's a good example of hey but I don't
think Sampson was expecting that and
then and I'm pretty sure they weren't
planning I thought I don't even
calibrating more cuts
is there anything i don't i don't think
samsung i think that this was the
perfect time for samsung to realize just
how loyal a customer base they do have
yeah wherever they do which is great
it's awesome the thing about it is you
know regardless they are trying to build
an ecosystem why launch Bigsby why
create the whole concept of decks that
we haven't talked about all right why do
I create all these things just think
about it just go back to Apple why the
w1 chip why is it only practical to pair
of these ear pods and and beats
headphones with iphones right Billy
we're not saying they don't work with
other product they do it's just a
nightmare to how to work with other
products online because they they are
not in the business of selling
headphones Samsung is not in the
business of selling 360-degree cameras
they're in the business of selling you
how much money do you think they make
out of an accessory well but that's also
part of it if you're making a product
and you're putting it out there and
you're not making money on it then I
think you've done a bad job I I think
this is not just some sort of flight of
fancy this is a fun little add-on this
is a fun little ad junk that helps flesh
out a part of the ecosystem this is
gonna be too expensive for it to be to
some sort of whimsy purchase so there
are companies out there legitimately
making their nut on making really
competitive mobile 360 degree camera
systems are going to be playing with a
Kodak we're going to be doing a review
on the ins get into the air 360 all of
these things nikon has won an ipod is a
camera company they are making a camera
solution and some samsung is walking
into a market which HTC fail that yeah
i'm not bugging out think about it i
remember what google launched froyo with
turn-by-turn navigation on google maps
yeah how long it took her google maps to
reach the iphone with this functionality
listen you know best this is the weather
plane was Google Maps making money if
you think about it I dunno if companies
that actually pay to be able to use them
make systems of google gps tracking
companies but Google head you know
Google actually did not start charging
for the usage of maps until like three
years ago think about how long Google
Maps has existed yeah so it wasn't
really a project to make money in the
beginning right but it was an immense
logging nobody can imagine navigate
around of York City but I've good the
main I what I'm getting at is google
product is that Samsung's product is
hardware Samsung is not a services
company they kind of think so so I just
I just think this is backwards I think
it's backwards if they're saying like
we're going to try and lock people into
the ecosystem with accessories so that
they'll buy more phones and I think
their land to buy to some more phones
every company is all that you have data
in 40 lakhs you want to take it in and
then they want to put it into something
whether that be four where would that be
four other proprio I don't disagree with
that but looking at Samsung's financial
sheet looking at their orderlies however
much money they're making on data
information and services paled in
comparison to the quarters that they
represent with positive growth on
smartphone sales and that if they have
an accessories division and their
accessories division is losing money or
they're not making money on it then
they're making crappy choice because
buzzer goes off reading about its money
on again the girls Everest feelings and
they've got the are they don't have the
result they've got the RNG they've got
the potential and they want to create an
experience they want to create an
experience of owning Samsung products
again Google Maps did not make money
initially for google but it locks people
into using google services I get that
these these businesses are not going to
make money initially how many companies
start a facebook I mean how many
companies started as venture capital
funding these companies were not but
we're not gonna have made by a moment
we're talking about it'll pop up
tablished yellow you can't see this
product that for one smartphone selling
company on the plan and you said its
smartphones selling they're not in the
business of selling really and make oh
but they've been in the camera market
for a year what is the narrative cam
they are often I said outlet camera
companies killed of the fish in math
that they did no I know they killed
their DSLR division but I'm not saying
that that was the only camera system
that they ever made they were making
their own camera sensors they were
making their own pointin truth they were
making their own other things and again
period work but but again if if this is
indicative of Samsung performance and
we're making fun of the NX line dying
and we're making fun of their point and
shoot cameras dying and we're making fun
of their smartphone phone sensor cameras
dying then we've already written the
death knell for the 360 well the day I
did the data to show their way this in
terms of what about Samsung's of that
and being for camera we're trying to
find logic / why the company is making
the experience of using their product
compatible with other products so trashy
the set C in the beginning it's their
product they can do with it whatever
they want and in turn saying that what
they want to do with it is to kill it I
Orton had the chance to flourish I could
enjoy watching people who watch this
podcast what I need you all to do who is
well now that's it for this podcast is
almost over I need you to watch it all
over again while live streaming you
watching it is a reaction video so that
tools can watch you watch a 360 degree
come here baby birth twirl okay keep it
swirly folks hashtag oh my god really
you let me know getting getting away
from getting away though because I do
actually just really quick and I want to
get back to you of getting away from
just like the company philosophy and my
gripe about this interoperability just
what do you think about 360 I mean you
you probably shot more video than I have
I did that one little woggie thing in
the middle of times n times square yeah
um what are your thoughts because you've
got to spend a lot more time with the
older 360 than I did I did and I if I'm
honest this is kind of a step backwards
for one reason oh do tell because
because the full of this bulb here of
the camera
is much smaller than the other one which
was probably like like that much bigger
right here so it means that the cameras
are pushed out further okay so holding
the little tripod legs underneath which
works in ER um you don't see your head
as much but with this grippy thing and
this big report button you see your
thumb in the frame right all the time so
get a selfie stick if you're going to
use this so yeah you know design-wise
I'm not impressed because of that reason
that your hands in it be ergonomic good
yeah this is here you're not exactly the
ergonomics and another thing of complete
isn't from the design of the new 260 is
cool is gauging how much 360 content is
being consumed is it a growing thing it
are people exponentially right now our
people increasingly watching more 360
video or to just something that's novel
it be that they use with their in bumble
gear gear VR that they don't runs after
two weeks yeah or their their LG friends
use it for two weeks I like what my
daydream was used for exactly 15 minutes
until I was afraid that it was going to
explode on my face it was all I've been
then I stopped yeah so so I mean like
because because I I try to find novel
things to do with technology and I I
respect the content creation that's
going up on YouTube yes and I actually
do have I started one of the bigger 360
degree photo and video a clubs not clubs
what's that word I its name like 42 43
in the morning and I can't think of on
google+ you have our community community
today and so it's got all of like 200
numbers of people that are out there
like basically just pimping their own
360 videos and stuff and and again I
don't think we've gotten beyond you know
when film was first invented you would
go to a movie theater to watch a static
shot of a
train rolling by the camera and that was
the most amazing thing people have ever
seen let me ask you a simple question a
simple question what if some of you were
to where you be willing to pay seven
hundred dollars for a pair of shoes that
would be obsolete the following year
well I mean obviously know maybe if
you're like okay so that I think that
Apple is it's so ironic and it's so
stupid but it's so true the software
update concept then Apple plays is
probably their most genius move into
becoming a lifestyle brand genius pun
intended yes because if you think about
it they never think they offer you a
product right that will receive up every
you know the same dated an update
launches you will receive your update
that same day I'm even at that product
is four years old but so it literally
becomes like that awesome winter jacket
that you just don't want to get rid of
her those boots that you love yeah I
mean yeah it's been something that we've
been we've been very concerned with an
Android land because of phones that
seemed to lose support very quickly or
they're not getting updated in a timely
fashion I just means there's something
also to the psychology of a certain type
of consumer so if you ask me what I
spend seven hundred dollars on a pair of
shoes that are only going to last one
season and we're talking about seasons
in terms of life fashion and style you
know like it was anything my wife would
turn up her nose at a Louis Vuitton
purse knowing that it's going to go out
of fashion very quickly and that it's
you know it's a two-thousand-dollar
purse but obviously the market can
sustain consumers who need to be a part
of that kind of brand exercise right
okay and I think Apple has gotten
closest to turning a tech company into
something that's appealing to that kind
of consumer and I think they're gonna
they're going to double down on that
premium market with whatever they
release this year I'll tell you this
much I mean one of the main reasons
where I you know I have specific brands
that I used I don't use the amount of
brand loyalty I use them because I know
that those shirts and those jeans are
going to last spring runners that's
that's that I'm back in a pair of 501
that's the EMA 568 sec receiver and I'll
but we ain genes they have leading to
you Martha the whip aah jewel but you
know I feel that that this is a
transition that come I mean why is it
think about it if you have if you have
to compare Samson design for the past
two years yeah pretty much three
generations vs apple design for three
generation what what company is doing a
better job when it comes in other
Samsung and yet so why is it that people
cannot relate to Samsung as a as a bank
of japan through innovator as know as
well actually that's the problem is as a
saturated triggered as people relate to
a part of the way why doesn't it happen
you know I feel that these companies
need to work more in you know doing the
mazda effect i mean one of the major
things that must have been around 20
years ago was that they started with the
focus of their building cars that people
that will last people way beyond their
five years or of you folks i mean i
think i mean i agree with you i think
that is a big component of creating
brand loyalty but i think that's
something that were more apt to care
about rather than some of the marketing
messaging which i think gets people more
emotional about these purchases cuz we
can all sit down and rationally say like
if you spend four hundred dollars on a
premium mid-ranger and eight hundred
dollars on a flagship are you really
getting four hundred dollars more phone
and we can have that rational discussion
and get people and a lot of people that
enjoy our content will have that
rational discussion but there's a person
out there who wants to feel good about
buying air quotes the bestest and that's
coming with a price tag and that's what
i think google actually made the better
play at the end of last year with the
pixel there's nothing about that think
they don't leave a bully they would have
made in a pretty phone book that's it so
let me but look at what happened like
the mo
successful sales exercise that Google
has ever done there's nothing about the
pixel that really is different than
having called it another nexus yeah it's
it's evolution over the Nexus line with
a couple color options and a price tag
to match other premium players and
suddenly they were taken far more
seriously as a consumer solution yeah so
Samsung I think still has the right
conversation as being the alt brand yeah
but I don't know I mean to your point I
don't know what can transition them into
mainstream and I don't know that any
Android company can really i think i
think there exists a winner and an
underdog and that's about as much as
most North American consumers want to
entertain and then you can have other
people that are for more counterculture
the LG fan the HIV fans the fall wave
bands but they exist on the fringes and
if you try and get into like a TV news
room like we were you know you you ran
into my buddy rich yeah really and like
I've had conversations with his other
reporters and they don't care about
anything but Apple and because they know
their metrics are only going to be moved
by stories about Apple yeah in a local
news and if you think about it okay I
feel that these companies need to do a
better job in addressing their consumers
as the whole experience which we're
going back so they'll come bringing them
into the fold so a little too what does
that will do okay the most common thing
I'll give you a particular example of
you know where I'm from and I'll do
that's the most common thing that I see
from any person that owns a galaxy is a
smash display why why why okay supported
is it no no no it's not just getting
some air do you know how much replacing
up this a samsung Display cost oh ho
words you so pretty much the frame of
the phone is for display yeah it's 250
bucks just that that portion alone so
people you know if I but what happens if
you break an iphone display right now it
will cost you a hundred bucks if you
want the original an apple store yeah so
I'm not it's just the total cost of
ownership of a product you know because
obviously we live in a bubble as in
geeks and as reviewers we live in a
bubble
remember last time any of us breathless
but spent money on smack and I'm sitting
on four cones right we are really we're
really you know however you believe the
worst case to judge but if you look at
the average consumer those other eight
friends that we have that aren't
Trekkies not the two friends that we
have that are those other eight people
there are some that are focused on the
brand and you know it's hit to have this
and everybody has one and I'm going to
have it but then there is another very
big chunk of people that just want they
just see it as a total cost of ownership
right how much am I going to spend where
am I going to get the best support how
you know and probably they will jump
they will try and many of them live with
a galaxy s4 oh yeah we will get back
back and so then what I think is so
interesting is that how this narrative
has almost completely reversed when it
comes to save the Chinese market yeah
where Apple doesn't have that reputation
they don't have that total cost of
ownership when they are priced enix
exceeding contrarian prices we covered a
story recently where shares in the
smartphone market in China that apple's
share is diminishing it's in that
there's sort of is being built up like
they're still selling well with like
refurbs of two year old phones but that
their overall chunk of the pie is
getting smaller and smaller and it's no
big surprise and you've got home players
like Huawei and elbow and jemmye and VTE
that are making those that look just as
good and almost my physical and we know
we know how companies do business in
China if it's a Chinese company versus
an outsider on that for those local
consumers I think they genuinely are
significantly better buys and if they're
sensitive body that you can also see
level for practice business but I don't
know so Ricky why do you hate China so
much excuse i sealed you remember when
we said now i feel that making a pretty
phone is not the only stuff of companies
need to make in order to gain
brand loyal so the net I mean I think
and to kind of put a bowl on is because
I do want to move on to view of the
other thing we're going to say about
this blue glass but let's to put a bow
on on that idea before Ricky has to say
um that's I mean I think a lot of
companies have missed I think motorola
falls into this there's cool and there's
more stylish design that's not what
makes a lifestyle brand you know if you
buy an expensive watch it's about being
a part of a club and is I'm something
exclusive and also knowing that it's a
premium product and that maybe it's an
heirloom and you can pass it down to
your kids and their becomes this whole
universe or any like driving a classic
car there's there's a language and that
there's there's something that's a
collector's idea behind that and so it's
about building out an infrastructure
which I don't think you can do in this
day and age if you don't have some
presents on the ground and you can't
count on carrier stores know to do that
for you but whatever one of those
constricting the shop spruce just
because they don't want to focus on now
we've generated phones with cutting or
walk oh yeah if you're keeping keeping
inventory what and when you know that
like if you go into a verizon or an AT&amp;amp;T
store that those reps are probably
getting bigger spliffs on accessories
than the phone sales look it's it's like
Samsung and Apple and then and then
something over there so tired Ricky I
don't call them up so back to what you
guys are saying about lifestyle but and
like this house it was like a lifestyle
brand and how you know this phone has is
trying to go with it samsung did
something that I really like last year
with the note 7 they had their like
collections they had like explore create
yeah and like all the other one it was
like act beat I can be active so ideally
like the workout with the icon
headphones that had the hard way better
than another watch the state was part of
that and then like you know they have
these I think for collection and I
really like that because it really made
samsung look like you know if he doesn't
like them more like a variety and I'm
like oh my stuff yeah but I but this you
to kind of step backwards when you know
the only thing that they were talking
about like working together was smart
home with
a lot of people still aren't really on
board with this we're supposed to glue
together your life and make sure that
what actually that wasn't kind of a good
point is to switch over night and the
means like throat right back to you
Ricky about um I I'm concerned
personally and not a lot of people will
share my concerns but that when we start
talking about like dr AR and now when
we're starting to throw around iot is
this hit buzz term that this is the
potential to become the next 3d TV that
consumers are getting burned out on
first generation products which don't
really do what the companies advertise
the cool factor oh man you can plug this
in and it just connects to your Wi-Fi on
it's so easy now you can control your
lights when your way your home that's
and maybe that's about it I mean I'm
busy lling with like web-connected
webcam that do not do wasn't advertised
they so do um so it only takes one or
two experiences like that summer
consumer to say old as I OT is BS and
it's not cheap and it's not mean it's
not cheap to make that mistake cheap and
the level of fragmentation is insane so
now aren't we me Emily do okay so i was
about to put like a judgment on this map
was the wrong way to phrase this
question like in Ricky tell me why I'm
right oh so in my concerns give you in
my face and especially for consumer
facing because that's what's really
driving if we're going to have this cool
stuff you have to happen to them well I
mean everyone's talking about 5g back
whole you know supported this with oh
you know so your learner's three places
like it's 215 in the morning and I don't
know about sleepovers are they revived a
backhaul so
I'm definitely indicative of that
subculture um I completely looking love
the trainer so we've got samsung hyping
bixby which is the software layers on
top of the galaxy SI it's going to be
eventually some kind of smart assistant
ad on adjunct the evolution of ads voice
whatever we want to call it to hinge
their only lifestyle umbrella service as
a part of a piece of software which
isn't finished we couldn't play with
today i feel is maybe setting consumers
up to get burned out on something that
doesn't even exist yet so any like a
part of this is like look at the
terrible experiment that we have for
this and people are looking around this
conversation and it's probably not going
to work this is not something that we're
going to do a lot of productive podcast
but that's also what's so crazy about
360 is just like when we reinvented film
and we were watching trains rolling lies
like we need to rewrap our brains around
every aspect of video production for
what we're going to do with a field of
view that wraps all the way around and
so even just for this like I'm in the
middle of Times Square I'm shooting the
vlog first comment on that blog isn't oh
my god I can look all the way around
Times Square's man look at your weird
crab claw is holding the camera and you
just ain't one of the bullet you're like
I'm trying but there's no I me as an
ergonomic problem already Takata so a
360 video we still have to figure some
of those things out but will people be
patient enough to follow us on that
journey or are they going to pick up
their gear headset one to pick up their
LG friends camera one oh it's kind of
weird so now i'm done with the MN
360-degree video becomes the next 3d TV
technology or IOT buzz like for example
Julian and I are currently right at the
problem is stitching of this video yeah
but anyway I'll do the same like 360 the
idea of basic see video is such a new
concept for the film industry yeah I
would love to see content creators make
something really really creative at a
360 but watching it is not going to be
with VR
it's not the way to watch 360 I see it
as it has a really good potential but
everyone's just like paint pawning it
back and forth right now yeah so what I
would like to click we are I would love
to see is some kind of a 360 projector
where are you in with you and you want a
holiday that would be really good on
three like think of let it finish a 360
theater yeah where you're probably I
guess depending on how you would design
it it would be either a swiveling chair
and total yourself or let's share with
swivel as part of the physical
production images that would be mines
alone yeah but that's what on anyone
you're no no i mean i agree i mean i
think it's the holodeck ideas i don't
want to have something wrapped in my
face like daydream runs too hot I
totally want I don't want to like have
to hold a phone for any longer or
narrative yeah cuz I was just going to
get obnoxious you think there's no
civilian arses yeah said it could help
but that your frontline for the all
right I think that LG LG came up with a
good solution when they drop it which
was their 360 headset didn't have to
snap a phone onto it was hidden like la
gomera it was a plug-in and these were
simple glasses that you put on when you
took off I wish that LG would have
continued with the concept because my
biggest problems we r is the whole thing
like snap up connect heroin act a little
hold up activate user interface tryst
not gonna connect put it on my face oh
crap it's heavy oh that's a lotta con
remove here for another call from the
head let me shift it around so I can get
some headphones in here too until it's
just the experience there's no other way
to reconsider them coming from
cumbersome it is totally cumbersome well
in and it's awesome I mean I would
really love to see the Taj Mahal I mean
I would you know I would be totally in
favor of using VR in things like
discovering new places as organic things
experiencing things that I think that
360 video is not for everything 350
video is not for humans it's for crowd
it's work but complain as i type or that
you like our thing is we're not looking
at what with 350 degrees of fun but all
in all I was like a crouching a regular
a lot of spaces pitch down a little
camera on the floor human dirt we have
this desert you know whatever 20 ish
degrees of you and that's what we're
boarded and we're not really usually
can't so fulfilled but here's the thing
i mean like you play video games rate
yeah well video games are 360 degree
videos secondly what were you reviewing
122 degrees of it at top right and while
you're doing even less of that at a time
when you're watching a 360 degree video
yeah i think i think of that as a shoe
that she was designed to go one
direction she didn't have like the user
like sounded not to directional i feel
like this metaphor it is way are three
in the morning so you're still here the
thing about so like back away from five
in the morn at your point to something
about like 360-degree video isn't for
everything and i agree with that notion
but one of the most important thing that
I think we need to look at just like
with 3d for films I feel 3d can be an
invaluable storytelling device when it's
not used by last generations filmmakers
because they work in 2d ideas shallow
depth of field to highlight your subject
a certain style of editing which doesn't
work for 3d in 3d I want to explore the
depth of the frame i want that diorama
effect i don't want something just
poking me in the eye from the screen I
need sub hard four layers on top of this
palette oh when winter birds when we're
looking at this like I feel something
like immersive AR video vr video a 360
degree video for the next generation of
filmmakers there are some simple ideas
that need to be thrown away in film you
highlight certain scenes through editing
if you cut the world away from someone
you're
the emotion in 360 degree video that is
extremely jarring because the whole
point of 360 degree video that you're
exploring of you all around you and then
it cut radically pulled you out of that
so it's much much better for longer form
exploration of the topic of an idea of a
space of a locale so that we don't it
automatically just that one idea i'm
giving it fundamentally changes years of
common knowledge when it comes to
editing and that's before we start
working with audio manager i'm working
with lightning heart working without
everything else even tell against the
idea foliated a program before they are
a little bit look at it look at this
from this respective fill the film
industry you've worked in it is there's
a lot of genius behind it there is a lot
of genius behind creating emotion from
people within acting within simple
things like the way color graded like
the way of scene is colored or the way
things are lit or the music that's being
put in the back down I mean all of these
should go into column with 360 video at
this moment is that it's very raw very
there is literally mill control and so
I'll give you the example of leverage
watching this podcast yeah that person
is going to decide which way they want
to watch yeah unless they're using a 360
headset which is not comfortable to wear
for more than an hour then we talked for
longer than we thought it's one of those
things where I feel that these are the
growing pains that each technology has
to go through smartphones went through
it there were times where you know right
now so I completely agree with you there
that we need to see those growing pains
is why I've been so critical of the way
that 3d is used yeah because i love your
point yet you look at something like
toilet everyone and 2483 and 3d has this
one beautiful scene where two characters
are just sort of profit desk but they
use that 3d depth to make it feel like
there's a gulf that's insurmountable
between these two characters yeah
that contributed to the storytelling it
wasn't just there's a depth effect water
water there was a reason and a purpose
why you wanted to create that feeling
that sensation and that you could pull
them apart and this is a metaphor it was
a metaphor using this technology so what
do we have like that in 360 we don't
need to relearn these lessons we just
need to look to the video game industry
if you pick up a game like half-life two
episode two it's one of the most
cinematic games of my entire game
playing career especially when you get
to the strider battle at the end and you
have a town that you need to protect and
you need to get into a car filmmakers
need to seed the idea of we have control
over exactly what you're going to look
like look at but that doesn't mean that
we still can't tell an immersive story
and this is where I feel like video
games and film will actually find some
kind of meeting of the minds because
video games already figured that out in
half-life if you don't want the
exposition you can walk away from the
characters talking and go look at
anything else that you want to look at
you are never stuck in a cutscene yeah
so in 360 degree video I still need to
be able to tell a narrative but if the
audience member wants to look at
something else like if the items member
wants to look at this wall right now and
I wouldn't blame them but they could go
and do that and so that's what i mean is
like those metaphors or that idea the
common knowledge of how we tell a story
or how we edit needs to be thrown out
but we don't need to reinvent the wheel
we don't need to start from scratch we
could already be adapting successes from
other media to bring that into this art
form so start working with us now but to
your point who's asking for it what's
the audience for adam who wants to
consume a piece of media like that and i
kinda feel we have a chicken and egg
problem through a market for it like
that's my main question and i feel like
there is no good answer to that because
if we had that content i think people
would really be interested in consuming
it but if people are instantly really
interested in consuming it then no
keeping like a cutlet right now right
now what we have is the capability and
the raw capable and then we have the
rocket ability it's the compliment
because we bedded video for a living the
complexity of editing something like
this as a maintenance I'm happy for
putting this Hajus know how long does it
take for a game like Apple has to be
created your welders through but I mean
they're not not any much longer than go
meet your film exactly but what I'm
saying is you you have three years to
create that experience where you have a
team of people that are brainstorming
over the best way to address this from a
user perspective compared to just raw
360 video just because the camera is
capable and we've got one and we've got
a couple I feel again the solution
exists and it'll find its problem at
some point just like many things you
know i right i feel it i feel i love i
love you know I I do commend companies
like Samsung mainly because this is the
company that's proven that whatever are
in the idea they had they published yeah
I mean they don't hold much back they
don't poke they don't want Leslie I got
the galaxy knows an example yeah I mean
think about it before the gear 360 what
was the smallest 360 camera before that
was a collection of six GoPros exactly
they solve the problem the porn industry
is loving it and that I don't understand
at all because you know what I've always
wanted in my adult carnal fiction is the
ability to look away from Jackson but
that's what I've always thought was
lacking from and you know I'm not know
we should probably over to wrap this up
so another episode of the pocket mount
weekly has come and gone in the most
tragic way possible in that we have no
idea what this is going to look like as
a finished product but just like jeweled
