everybody before I get into the intro
Jules is a bit out of commission today
which means that I had to take care of
all the logistics leading up to the life
so I apologize for the delay in the show
and hopefully everything kind of goes
pretty smoothly this is one of my first
times I using hangouts on air being at
the helm of it but yeah in any case
let's go ahead and pop into the script
for today the weekly is supported by the
Oregon State University eCampus do you
want to take the fast track to your
career in computing you can earn your
computer science degree 100% online from
Oregon State and tap into unlimited
career possibilities in any field
learn more at eCampus dot oregon state
dot edu slash now alright hello
everybody and welcome to the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers on this day the eighth of
March 2019 now I have been talking over
the last couple of episodes two or three
episodes about changing the format up of
the podcast a little bit we are trying
to go to a more structured format where
we talk about one main topic and maybe
one two three depending on how much talk
how many talking points we actually get
out of the first topic but today we're
doing that for sure so the show today is
actually going to be a little bit
shorter than you might be used to it's
gonna be just under an hour maybe around
45 minutes but the other reason why that
is the case is because well as you can
see it is just me in the booth right now
Jules is not here Jaime is not here
Brandon's not here so I called upon a
good friend of ours thundery
at bored at work over there thank you so
much for coming on and thank you for
kind of being the only one I was
available for today no problem you
caught me in between running the video
and doing some tests so I might just
scoot up for about 10 seconds because
I'm doing a I kept my as well to use the
video now it's a wireless power sorry
wireless charging 2.0 versus fast
charging with Galaxy devices hmm yeah
I've been meaning to take a look at like
the wireless charging on stuff because I
actually have that 20 watt Xiaomi
charger and I've been wanting to test
that thing out too
wireless charging is still I just came
across I'm sorry we're gonna we're gonna
take this very casually today ever since
since it's just me and Anna bong here
today aren't me and thunder here so um
did you see on Instagram and Facebook
recently there's this huge pad that you
stick to the bottom of a table you know
it's large like it's a it's it looks big
it looks like a almost like half of a
curling the thing they use in curling
okay so what you do is you paste it on
the bottom of pretty much any surface
and because it's so large and it and it
emits the Qi wireless charging probably
more than you would want it can make any
table any surface a wireless charging
mat how much I did not swipe up on that
IG story oh I hardly ever do and they're
getting bad by the way anybody out there
you can let me know in the in the live
chat I am looking at the live shop but
also in the comments down below how
ridiculous is it getting that IG stories
are starting to get like click Beatty
where they go all the way up to them
actually using the product so you know
what it's about and then it cuts away
you only got 15 seconds I I haven't
really seen that much edgy stories for
me it's I've bought like some comic book
t-shirts from there i sword these
sneaker laces that you told me but that
I saw or I saw in there as well and I
just fitted my first person he goes with
them so I'm gonna try them out today
but yeah I mean yeah cool but anyway
let's let's get back to topic before
people crucify us I think I know and
before I forget of course I am your host
I'm Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody
alright so today we're going to talk a
little bit like okay part of the reason
why I wanted to make sure the
conversation started off kind of casual
and a little bit light is because we are
going to somewhat somewhat address one
of the big stories that happened this
past week I was talking to I was talking
to my girlfriend Lisa she's all
obviously over in the Philippines and
when one of the random times that we
were just sort of chilling out just
talking on video chat she said oh
there's a hallway press conference and I
was like I don't remember there being
any announcements that were meant to be
this week I don't remember any products
or anything like that going on we just
we obviously were just at
Mobile World Congress looking at the
made X looking at the mate book X Pro
the 2019 edition so there are some
exciting stuff coming out their
catalogue but as it turns out on that
particular day we were talking was
basically announcing that they were
going to be suing the US government now
I always keep from talking about like
deep political things I don't feel
equipped to really give much perspective
on this I do have an opinion on it that
I'll talk about a little bit later but
yeah yeah I was thinking maybe you have
some insight on it that you wanted to
sort of share before we get into our
main topic for today so my my podcast
that I used to have you know for a while
called the weekly we always talked about
you know a lot of tech news in tech
topic topics like this
which is something I want to go back to
at some point when it comes to this
there was a very interesting case you
know on the one hand you do have a lot
of people will say that look a lot of
Chinese companies tend to you know steal
us products patents things like that and
while we might be one of those companies
you know again nothing is proven the US
government has come out and said why we
should not be I'm summarizing here
basically like you know why we devices
should be so used by your government
personnel because of spyware they could
hack into your systems you should not
use Huawei telecom devices for either 4G
or 5g because they also make antenna and
things like that
the flipside is is that the US
government has not shown us any proof
they just no one has shown any proof
that this is truly accurate the case and
I'll get to my own personal thoughts in
a second and then you also have the fact
that you know they've not shown us that
as proof and then when it comes to you
the whole idea of 5g and dominance the
two biggest five key players in the
world are Qualcomm US company and then
there's also Huawei right so even though
Qualcomm has done a lot to send 5g
stand-ins the NAG make me made that
Qualcomm wants to basically make sure
that they have
the largest control over 5g and taking
the current administration's stance on
trade war with China so you add all
those things together
it may look one-sided from from optics
side of view for outside the US it looks
like okay
this is what the administration is
trying to do from a business perspective
from a US business it's like look
Chinese companies tend to steal our
stuff so this makes a lot of sense now
from a personal perspective why we
devices have been great and they they've
improved over the years they've had some
really good partnerships we see in the
the p20 that make 20 now we're gonna be
talking about the meet 30 you know in a
few yeah
yeah people to meet P 30 and the May 30
later on this year the the question here
is that like in terms of saying spying
on your on you on your content let's
just be very factual if you want to be
factual about that we know that Facebook
Google spy on us on a regular basis
we do know that for a fact that if you
and this is something that Fox News
actually did the test on if you take two
phones no Sims one phone they actually
turn the put on airplane mode and the
second phone they just left it as is but
there was no sim the GPS locator was
able to track point to point your
location as they drove around town
that's of how how much data you is
taking off your phones we've heard and
it all evidence of people talking about
the fact that they talked about a
certain product and next minute they
seize on their Facebook or Instagram
feeds so these are also American
companies by the way let's just put it
that way right ya know when it comes to
mobile phones it's it's it's a certain
degree like our privacy is just not
there I'm not sure if II it's everything
they take was just some certain things I
just look at it as like I would I would
like to see what that evidence is so
that I can make my mind now in terms of
why we're suing this is the route that
while we have some has to make their
their CFO I believe was CTO CFO no see I
see this here phone was the one that was
did you kind of arrested in Canada yes
indeed changing in Canada
there's a whole the whole legal dispute
going on there there's a lot of murky
water going around it feels the same way
it feels like a grander scale of that
whole core calm apple battle you know
that's that's two companies a lot of
things and Apple will tell you one thing
of saying hey Qualcomm says if you pay
more and the Qualcomm is like no you're
using our patents just pay you agreed to
the fees anyway right you know that kind
of thing in this case here you have the
case where you know the US companies are
saying hey you're stealing our patents
and Y was like why are we being punished
it's not us and we make good stuff and
you're afraid that we are number two in
the market hmm well I mean just it's
it's it's odd because obviously I I deal
mostly in like the consumer tech space
so it's about the user experience of
somebody that would might that might
want to buy these products from a
particular company I've I've not quite
been the kind of person where if I hear
like sort of bad news about one side of
any particular company or any particular
entity that I just kind of boycott them
altogether and that certainly has not
been the case for Huawei because we were
discussing this right before I hit live
on the show that the consumer products
they've been they have been the darlings
of the last year or two like just on a
hardware software perspective for the
end-user experience they have been one
of the best experiences you could have
in smartphones today and also even in
laptops I'm using a maple gex Pro right
now so my my whole thought here is that
perhaps 30 we don't even know yet
because the US does the the people in
the US have not even given the data or
given the proof that actual spying is
happening but even then the spying would
be happening at a very high level
because yes there might be a few of
those fears that Huawei has some power
in the infrastructure in the general
communication infrastructure that's
something that should be looked into
sure but it's one of those things where
I know
AT&amp;amp;T logs my calls
I know Facebook logs a lot of my data I
know that Amazon knows everything that I
purchased and is trying to create a
profile on me all of the products that
we would use no matter if it's from
Samsung Huawei Amazon whatever the case
may be they all monitor us on some sort
of level that is kind of
deemed normal now like no one really
speaks up about it unless the data is
used for something truly nefarious and
we can prove that neither have been
proven yet neither I've been proven that
while we are actually data mining and it
has also not been proven if and if that
has been happening what they're using
the data for so like on the consumer
level I personally still think that the
products are great and that's what we're
going to focus on as tech reviewers and
tech youtubers and tech journalists and
whatnot we will dive I did want to make
sure that we dove into this just a
little bit just to make it clear to
everyone we're not overlooking this this
issue we're not ignoring it it is in our
minds but remember that we deal with
products and as of right now all we is
making some pretty incredible products
so it's kind of that's kind of my
thought there I mean are you still using
your may 20 Pro in that no it's not a
daily driver anymore just because I'm on
the galaxy bend right now yeah so but I
mean it was my it was always my second
device for a while I my my peach when he
was peach when he probes my second
device after my Galaxy S nine I'm more
of a galaxy user Samsung pay has me
hooked and a bunch of other features but
the my second device was always the p20
glass a was a p20 and the may 20 in that
in that order gotcha okay yeah I'm
looking in the chest right now
Steve Desroches DeRosa's we would have
known a long time ago if Huawei was
spying on us I kind of feel the same way
I mean our intelligence agencies in the
US are supposed to be the top in the
world so if there was truly something
really bad happening then they probably
would've said something
Matt have Verma yes they know everything
but people don't care unless the data is
actually stolen that's kind of my point
that you know if data is stolen used for
truly nefarious purposes that actually
cause harm to people isn't that the
whole Google thing it's like Google
obviously like tracks us everything that
we do but don't do harm I mean I mean
the thing about it is that these this
you're right don't do harm and just to
quickly summarize it and I'll just give
you some perspective Google shutdown
Google Plus last year not because he was
dying or dead
because there was a data breach and they
didn't tell us until they were shutting
it down
just remember that Equifax basically
lost all our information in terms of
credit scores right which is more
important than all your social media
crap yeah that's true
and what happened nothing happened to
them so you put in any perspective those
again are US companies I'm not saying
that a company like while we can't do
damage with the kind of information or
to be failed like you said the high
level spine you're looking at is people
who are in higher levels of governments
who you you would want to spy on or
executives or you know things like that
that's that's that's the kind of level
that you want to get into not the
everyday person but when it comes to you
everyday individuals companies like
Equifax companies like Google companies
like Facebook companies like Amazon I
mean literally it's funny because it
looks like Apple and Microsoft are just
not in that mix because they don't they
don't collect data for those purposes
especially Microsoft hasn't even kind of
gone away from that completely you know
in that sense so just just to put in
perspective that's where it you know you
got a look at the t's knives but I think
also this is a big fight for while we're
for Europe because yes they've lost the
USD know that Australia has kind of
kicked them out as well
Europe is the big bastion in okay if we
can still keep that with fine because
the next big bastion for growth is
Africa and they're very China has been
pushing in there for a long time now and
why we'll probably find it it easy a
path to go and say look you know
countries countries in Africa which are
you know the developing country you know
for you to leapfrog
that's where 5g goes faster than
anywhere else in the u.s. you have to
add on to correct infrastructure and
Europe is the same thing if you go to
Africa you can say hey look you know
what look you guys don't even have the
infrastructure you have a very small
infrastructure we can help build our
five before you BAM boom before you know
it you've got places that are you know
remote having five gene you're going I
don't have 5g here in in Detroit or in
Brooklyn like what's going on yeah that
is that is the number one could fall
with 5g right now all the conversations
that we have
at most people who might be looking at
it or most people who are not even aware
of all of the talker on 5g are not going
to be the ones who experience five gene
so much much later it's it's that's
pretty much the long and short of the
the 5g conundrum one one final question
on this I just kind of came to mind do
you think that this serves as a good
example as to why Chinese companies have
such a hard time getting into the u.s.
because we have a lot of people in our
comment sections and I do want to make
sure that we address anything that our
commenters and our audience members
might be saying in our videos because I
have been getting I I've been getting
into Huawei and show me stuff recently
and there are people out there who say
like why are you covering this like in
the turn in the sense of Huawei they are
literally banned from the US and in
terms of Xiaomi they don't bring any of
their products to the US do you think
that this is kind of an example as to
why that phenomenon happens I mean I
wouldn't say so I mean like most my
users haven't actually asked me why am i
covering this let's be on let's just
look let's look at it practically yes
they are banding years you can still buy
them it's really not that hard to buy a
while we phone go to Amazon that's it
so I think the thing is because the US
consumer is also used to certain buying
style they've been trained that you must
go through carriers you must go through
t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and then Apple is kind of
broken it away a little bit where you
say I can go directly to Apple and buy
and Samsung is trying to do the same
thing especially with the massive
pre-orders they had Oh for the my alarm
is going off weekend here but so
American users are used to buying a
certain way as opposed to just say hey I
wasn't gonna buy my phone directly from
Amazon if what we can do a deal with
Amazon to have that have a financing
option through Amazon I guarantee you
you see enough taking sales from there
and people will be able to buy because
you'll be seeing all our video it was
Amazon does a you know a financing plan
where you can pay $30 a month for a
phone on Amazon or like all the phones
that Amazon sells Amazon could put it
that way as long as why we get into that
mix
uptick in sales yeah fair enough right
back yeah go for it
all right so while while he's doing that
we actually already put in about 15 to
20 minutes on the on the podcast so why
don't we do this I'm gonna go ahead and
go into it just a short break we're
going to chicken with in a bong when we
get back and why don't we go in and pay
a couple bills and give everyone a
little bit of a break after the the
heavy the heavy talk there huh 93% mmm
two hours for what a fast Regine 2.0
okay on the galaxy s 10 II okay there's
one be sure that I cover a couple of
things here before we move forward with
our main topics I just wish that I could
it's hard like trying trying to have so
many different windows open on just a
laptop
it makes it tough hey guys sort through
everything all right here we go the
pocket not weekly is supported by the
brave browser it's ad free and fast plus
it blocks all trackers and allows you to
use the internet without being watched
or followed it uses less data but also
gives you ways to give back to your
favorite publishers like pocket now or
xda-developers by earning ba t tokens
bat tokens available for most platforms
including android iOS and windows head
on over it's a pocketnow.com slash brave
for more info oddly enough that was a
very pertinent ad read for what we just
talked about and by the way in among
your or your video is frozen really yeah
you're know deliver you're you're in the
middle you're in the middle of what
seems like a salient point but your
friends know it's okey there we go there
we go good stuff okay all right cool so
I want to do a little bit of a check-in
I mean especially since it's just you
and you and me here we're just kind of
kicking it for today since I'm taking on
the podcast for for today the live
aspect that is how has your s 10 bin
like I
everyone's putting up their reviews I
actually just put out a video today
using this as my main camera for an
entire day and the entire video was
filmed on the s10 plus so yeah if you're
interested in that go check it out
but yeah how's it been for you that
stent is fantastic I've seen a couple of
people who have had issues at least I'll
say half of the people have issues of
the fingerprint sensor for the STM plus
I know Detroit Borg posted that he said
he didn't like the fingerprint sensor
I've had no issues with mine I had like
an initial issue where not an issue a
lot people say you have to you know you
don't have you have to tap you have to
press longer the trick here's a trick
I'll tell you was try go ahead and remap
no remap assign the same finger twice oh
really
yeah huh assigned the same finger twice
and it should it should actually do a
better job right now so I don't have my
s10 with me I usually do a camera review
with my buddy who is a professional
photographer so I gave him the camera of
the phone for a week and we should have
that video either Monday or Tuesday
where he gets to play around with it and
use it as a professional photographer
and not just you know people like me and
you but I'll be using the s10 II and the
Yi's great it's small its compact I
would show you but the ease over there
aren't doing its thing test it out but
its smallest compact and one of the
biggest things with the s10 is the punch
hole and the punch hole wallpapers that
are covered oh my god I was just about
to say so what is yours right now
because I actually had to make my own I
don't know how to make one yet but I I
would like to do a cyclops punch hole
wallpaper like his eyes are the punch
hole
yeah the visor visor Cyclops I would
like to do that as a wallpaper the
problem is a lot of people's wallpapers
are not up to my standard in terms of
resolution I oh I can't see oh
that's Mega Man X hanging from the punch
hole I have to make that myself I am NOT
making it available yet I need to do my
full review on this first where I'm
gonna actually like kind of reveal it in
that video but yeah I I looked at a
bunch of the other ones at first I was
using the Darth Vader one yeah that was
a good one but I use that as sort of a
template and then I tried to like
because the thing is like if you if you
were not to put this white line around
the punch hole it wouldn't that make
sense it just looks like he's floating
and yes phase so I had to add that
little like white line there but yeah
that's I don't know how how do you
license something like this like I feel
like all of the wallpaper people who
like created them there's no way like
everyone's just going to steal it and
copy it and you know I mean I'm I like
to throw up anime and comic book
wallpapers so for me they have to fit
the cat I can't be just anything like I
said I'd like to do Cyclops I would like
to do either Cyclops but I've seen
somebody do Cyclops blasting to the
poncho yes problem the problem with that
do is that to make it correct you've got
to do the blast effect around the punch
hole hmm so the person has had it where
he shoots diagonally across the poncho
whether it's the you know the double or
the single but what you should have is
around the punch hole is the blast
effect so it's basically the plunge hole
is diverting the blast around it my
Cyclops is trying to destroy it right
you know I mean this is that this is the
the greatest yet nerdiest conversation
we've ever had on the show but that's
the thing like I can't believe a credit
to the the fan base the users of the s10
plus who are adopting it early that they
made something that I was scoffing it
I was scoffing at this whole punch for
the longest time and and all of a sudden
all of you out there made it fun that's
so cool that that actually happened man
so yeah I'll make this probably my
review of this is probably gonna come
out I think you learn Monday or Tuesday
so it's on that day that I'll make the
wallpaper available one of our one of
our commenters right now says can you
even license a wallpaper of a
copyrighted character you're absolutely
right what I'm saying is like you want
credit right like I made this
so I don't know in any case I think that
that should do it for the s10 stuff I
just wanted to do a quick check in there
because everyone's content is coming out
right now I'm sure Jaime has his s10
plus review ready to go pretty soon um
my review is I don't do it over here
anymore I do 30 days so two weeks from
now since I've already used it for two
weeks will be my because then I get my
full camera stuff from my photographer
and and also updates and all that kind
of stuff as well make sense um all right
cool but you're also using the SNe and
lord knows I think that's I think that
might be the most sought-after one for
most look seriously the s10 II as a
device is is this year's winner this is
I mean I I will is okay so I I like the
device but for me it's a little too
small I've got massive hands so using it
and I realize when I when I start typing
I realize how small the phone is with me
but when but just using your one-handed
and going through apps and stuff like
that like that it's it's a phone that
will fit for most people the 10 plus is
really you know my own speed in terms of
place
plus the price seen deal that they had
with the pre-order roof yeah yeah to
bring back to bring back an old point I
would make about handling on a phone and
I bet the SME is gonna be sublime
that's an old term I used to use all the
time all right cool but the thing is you
already given the snd a crown I mean we
still have phones that are coming out a
little bit later this year and one of
the ones that is slated for the end of
this month we're gonna talk about the
Huawei P 30 and the p30 pro so I mean
topic for today um okay Oh still got
another okay I'll just I'll just recap
some of the stuff that happens so while
we were all at MWC we actually started
to see some leaks come out and one of
them in particular came from Digital
Trends now nobody knew if this was
absolutely the final design if this was
real it was clearly a prototype device
because you could see on the back of the
phone and I I do encourage everyone to
take a look at all of the stories
regarding the p30 and the p30 pro over
at pocketnow.com you can see over on the
rear that there was a little like the
word there it didn't say wah way it
hardly even said like a--
i mean we are expecting that the leica
we'll be there because they're going to
work with Holly on the cameras once
again but what we had that was VOC the
devices codename so that was going to be
the case there but what you could see
over on the back there is also that all
of the cameras are still in a line so it
seems like the p30 is going to have a
design style that's very similar to the
p20 in the p20 Pro both of which were
very much well-regarded we all really
enjoyed the p21 they came out so the
whole idea here
first of all specifications are yet to
be revealed but we're expecting it to
have the Kira 980 or anything even maybe
an update from it's potentially but the
Karin idea was what was in the may 20
Pro so there is there haven't been
confirmations from people in Huawei that
the camera supposed to have a four
camera set up on the rear but this first
this first leaked from Digital Trends
showed that it was still looking like a
three camera setup now that we have a
bunch of these phones coming out of that
I have three on the back two on the
front five cameras we have the i/o did
you you picked up the Nokia 9p review
right yeah so got that five cameras on
the back um huh obviously we have oh
yeah
- back at home though um with the p30
p30 pro linking back on the experience
you had with the p20 and the fact that
it brought in that three cameras set up
it had was it the p20 pro that decided
to do away with the monochrome sensor by
then no it was a mate that's it was
amazing so it still had the monochrome
sensor which I mean while we did a
really good job using ended up creating
fantastic stills photography you get a
lot of the thing about monochrome
sensors people don't understand is that
you get more information from monochrome
sensor than a color sensor because the
color sensor is looking for just the
three specific colors and combinations
of all the monochrome sensor basically
it's akin to recording on grayscale
almost you know you're getting just the
raw information and you can edit from
there so it applies a lot more to to
what you're doing but I think this
device is gonna have four senses I think
what they showed them was the p33 okay
so that's not the thing to like even
Samsung did that with their
whether s10 line there's more than two
variants which i think is hilarious like
you get the sm+ the s2 end yes then II
in this case is gonna be Pete 30 p 30
pro and then we also got another rumor
over the last couple of weeks that
there's going to be a P 30 light so it's
like so many having variants of these
phones that's that's akin to what they
did last year they had the P 20 light as
well the light versions of their phones
are really not seen dear I'll put it
this way if it's similar to what they
did last year I was just skip it it's
not the only person who's done like
properly is Samsung so far right now
with the e he doesn't feel like a light
even though it is a light if you want to
call it that right the p20 light last
year was something that I looked at and
I was like that's okay but I think I
think the fourth camera is the tof
sensor and I've seen some rumors where
this is that's a 5 megapixel
time-of-flight sensor in there so that
all should help a little bit I don't
know how it's gonna help with that
periscopic zoom ok so there you go so
the here here here come the other two
rumors and then we'll kind of expound
upon this I whether or not we're really
into this because as excited as we might
be for any upcoming Huawei device
because they do they do put a lot into
their phones especially in the hardware
sense if you look at these renders and
unfortunate I don't have OBS setup to
actually show you the render size so
that's why I said please head on over to
pocketnow.com take a look at these
renders there was a render that showed
that it's a three camera setup but then
right under the flash over on the side
there's like a tiny little sensor and I
believe that's what you mean by the tof
camera that's probably what it is and
like are we are we just trying to mash
in as many between nokia and now p30 pro
what or are we just trying to mash as
many cameras into a phone as as humanly
possible see I think this is the right
approach I'm not I'm not the biggest fan
of pixels approach with software
don't get me wrong it does a really good
job but it only does that certain things
well bouquet mode on there looks good
but it's not natural if you use a DSLR
there's such a natural smoothness to it
which is why I like the demo of the
Nokia except Nokia now has to fix their
software with updates
it's the Deb is just not where it should
be but when you think about it to
actually get all the information you
want on a smartphone camera you know
ultra white is like ultra is not what
you don't need ultra high but right is
now an additional luxury that makes a
lot of sense
mm smartphone because if you think about
a standard DSL you know what's a good
you you know this better than I do but
what's a good standard lens is somebody
could buy but if I get myself sony a
6400 I just want one lens that covers a
wide gap you can always get that one
lens that covers a wide gamut of look I
used the the Tamron 23:28 275
you know 28 to 75 that covers a whole
range I can get my bouquet I can get
some really sharp shots you know I can
move in a little closer to close but
that covers a range which one single
lens can't do which is why a lot of
companies use software so there's a
reason why you have this these camera
setups now all I needed
but the time-of-flight sensor is great
for depth advantage as well it really
does a good job in measuring the depth
so which is why Samsung has a time of
flight on the 5g version of the galaxy
galaxy as 10 plus and that does boquete
recording mm-hmm video you know so yeah
we have to see and I think that's what
while weenies looking at I think that
time of flight might aid into that
periscopic zoom because they tease that
with their teaser clip you know it's
easy to send out every shot was like
Eiffel Tower
zooming when that big on center Monument
in Paris it was assuming everything was
not a arc they are yeah so so with that
in mind you know that I think that goes
a long way we'll see how that effects in
the video as well hopefully Wow his
videos improved this year because last
year was it was not right right like I
liked it but it but you know now that
I've now that we've obviously you know
what 20/20 being hindsight at the time
it seems pretty great stabilization was
good and
the rendering was was decent it may not
have been the most detailed video but it
was vivid and it was nice and colorful
that being said after having used this
for my for my photo day video I mean
we're hopefully it's going to be able to
match it or even surpass it so that's
the tof and you're right hopefully the
tof is going to help with at the very
least maybe like bouquet video which is
kind of kind of becoming a trend um
because while we did sort of bring it
out first with the may 20 pro and then
with the more recent LG v LG v 50 think
you and the g8 think you they also have
video bouquet as well so maybe the tof
will help with that um how does this
hardware look to you then because
they're just so many holes on the back
like it's becoming less of a really good
looking phone and more of a utilitarian
tool that's how I feel at least because
when you put that tiny load to you off
camera in there it's like you just had
to find a way to put it in there yeah I
mean it's it's alright it still looks
like the p30 to me I wish it was a
little bit flush in terms of this 9 I
don't think it changed as much my thing
is the front of the smartphone you know
is it gonna be a dimple notch are they
going and they're going punch hole
because they can't do punch Oh cuz the
own honor and honor has a punch all in
there what are they doing with that you
know it's gonna be interesting this year
because you know the big guys are going
a certain way and I think if I'm not
mistaken I'm trying to look for the
front image of this device for the p30
and it looks like it's a dimple on there
yeah look yeah so think about it this
way the big guys samsung has a poncho
and wow he has a dimple right still some
kind of Sickler on screen notch then you
know Apple and oneplus aka the cheaper
brands if you will in terms of pricing
are going in pop up cameras that's where
the 1 plus 7 I mean are we gonna be at
so how does this play into effect with
guys like you know wha way with the p30
and also again is that front facing
camera improved that's one of the things
that sound
you know um and this is a video series
I'm going to be doing with David
we keep joking about it but we are gonna
do it because it's the how well I don't
know we don't have a name for it yeah
how well does a front-facing camera for
any phone any of the big ones handle
both taking photo of both someone who
he's as dark as me and has lighted to
him at the same time because we've
always had this problem where the camera
has to decide who do I focus on and if I
mean David looks like a vampire and if
you focus on Avery I look like darkness
you have joked about this and I think
it's great but I think that is a great a
great video series that you should try
doing Grandia the Galaxy phones do have
auto HDR on the front so hopefully it
will help oh no it does help they
actually did an update which fixes mine
was a little way to off for a little bit
so I didn't post any photos but I took
one yesterday and it was fixed and
unchanging and facture just love beauty
mode like for me I look ashy I look like
I like I look completely ashy all around
so then look Amy when I turn it off
things that I want to see while we fix
you know the red camera they've done a
really good job with your red cameras
the periscope zoom looks pretty cool for
me is that front-facing camera it's not
that I take selfies a lot but there's so
many people who do right and if you're
my son is if you if you were given a
phone that had a great front-facing
camera and you could do some really
great stuff with it wouldn't you do it
more like cuz no I
yeah the 4k recording on the front of
any of the phone even the nokia has it
even even though the nokia 9p review
does 4k video recording using the front
camera that alone makes me want to vlog
with it more so like you know if you
have the tools then you're gonna do it
more yeah um I'm gonna talk about that
zoom for a little bit so 10x optical
zoom using like what basically amounts
to a very tiny telescope on the back of
your phone did you see the Oppo
announcement or whether they were sort
of expounding upon it yeah it was like
it's a periscope yeah like and we're not
talking about the the dead live
streaming platform we're talking about
an actual like periscope like where
light refraction actually happened so
that you can get farther into a shot
I don't even know if what I said is
correct it's probably not I don't get I
don't fully understand this but the
reason why I'm still kind of incredulous
about it is because my main question to
everybody and I want to see this in the
live chat make sure make sure you answer
this question there so we can respond to
it do you use
telephoto at all to begin with you know
like I don't know about you eat like are
you of zoom user whatsoever no but
here's the thing it all depends away
like I I'd like to use you now sometimes
I go up to my rooftop and I've got a
I've got a view of Manhattan I can see
all the way from one World Trade Center
to about 90 98 maybe 90 90 90 to 100
stream so that's a massive view of the
sea and it's a great landscape but
sometimes whenever you take a photo with
a regular any phone doesn't matter it's
just flat you can't see the buildings
are all like almost unusable
everything in front looks fine but you
know the city landscape looks flat but
that's what my eye can see I can see the
detail of the city so I have to zoom in
to get at least a crop of that shot and
then it just gets murky now if I could
do that the only food we could probably
do that well enough but can't process it
now is the Lumia 1020 because he just
basically condensed the pixels together
you could zoom in into the shot and
still look good
hello hello hello
some
happened okay I guess it's just me I
will continue the conversation Betty oh
no I'm here yeah I was I was I was like
wait you just froze yeah yeah I'm back
that was weird
nothing happened it just happen oh what
happened like I just I don't know I was
even clicking anything I wasn't doing
anything
yeah now your voice sounds deeper to you
that's the funny thing
really Oh like no this fighter is like
it just happened it just just caught off
you know what yeah we got like five to
ten minutes left in this we're gonna let
it go why don't we why don't we just
continue but yeah you were saying you
have a view of Manhattan but yeah so so
I would like to take a shot of that end
still looks good but I do agree it's not
something you use a lot but if it's good
enough then macro shots become much
better that's the thing though like
macro shots though a lot of telephoto
zooms that I find even in phones like
this they have a minimum focusing
distance so they just aren't able to do
macro photography which is really
disappointing because you wouldn't you
would you would assume which is why I
used to I used ultra light though
exactly so you guys know why then you
get really really close close but if you
can do it use a periscope on the regular
camera then you should be able to go in
at normal distance and zoom in mmm fair
enough
I just think I had a video that I never
ended up releasing where I just sat down
and I spoke about the oboe 10x zoom and
I just I literally was just saying like
who would actually use a 10x zoom and it
was funny because when we were in when
we were in that that hands-on area
people were taking pictures of people
from way across the room which made me
think like 10x zoom is like the stalker
phone like it's that it's the it's the
creeper lens the Safari lens of
smartphones which is fine but I don't
know it's just I don't personally have
me I personally don't have any actual
use case scenarios for it personally I
just oh yeah my my test seemed to just
go down the wayside the Batman
we died on my camera and so but it's
it's not like 95% it's like at the point
where I'm like you know it's okay got a
couple of people first of all yes I am I
am Joshua Barry White for gara right now
this is the one thing that I wanted to
say real quick there's where is it one
person here was saying how the zoom is
good for like stadium events maybe
concert events which is good yes I agree
with that you'll you'll be able to zoom
right into whoever you're watching cardi
B or whatever and that's fine but how
often do you actually go to a concert
how often do you actually you know it's
not what's gonna be one of those
situations that make you buy a phone
that have a 10x it's just happen let's
let's see when it gets here you might I
be you might look at it and say look oh
this is nice like I've got the ability
to stand here and capture that yeah and
10 is gonna be way better than 2 because
yeah one of our homies from whoo buddy
gizmo who Baron when he he had a great
little demonstration during one of the
events that he and I were attending he
was like too acceptable zoom is is a lie
like it's alive for most applications
because if I'm here and I hit 2x I take
a picture it's the same thing as me
taking one step for laugh yeah it's
ridiculous oh that one's good yeah let
me lock it on you that way everyone can
see that that one's good that one's that
one's actually really good I going on
tangents I have a deep voice and we're
going on tangents Oh a couple of our
people in the live chat we're asking
that they accidentally had the camera
locked on you so they didn't get to see
my wallpaper so whom that is literally
Mega Man X hanging from the punch hole
shooting today I thought about flipping
it horizontally but I figured you know
what it's kind of cool day's shooting
off-screen okay so that'll pretty much
covered for the p30 there was one more
thing that I wanted to cover with the
peak of wahwee in particular
just not just the p30 would you have
been had like just I want to get your
reactions because you were not at MWC
not personally at least but you saw all
of the stuff going on you even did a
great video that hit trending on YouTube
so congratulations to you sir they are
fake here I appreciate it
regarding the Galaxy fold up against the
mate X and now we have some sort of
report here that CEO Richard you said
that they had several different ideas
for the foldable and one of them was
actually very akin to the Galaxy fold
how happy are you that they did not go
that route and went to meet X anyway I'm
happy they went made X on that route I
think like so I haven't felt it so I
know I may have spent the most amount of
time with the made X in terms of people
that I know because Daniel went stem to
BC for us and then he said he got too
touchy for like 20 seconds so my thing
is my thing is the fold crease and also
hand the ability of that so with the
with the the galaxy fold the galaxy fold
has only one two floors two floors that
I know they can't change now because
they're launching pretty soon in April
that front display is just too small you
might yeah it is yeah Emily it only it
only fits three lines worth of
homescreen and then the camera inside
why didn't you just do a punch hole
inside instead okay when you open her up
she's got that weird like cut out like
this yeah that is it that is a Google
official cut out methodology though but
yeah I want to developer settings you
can actually get that why didn't you
just go with the punch hole instead that
would have been so much better even if
it's just a single punch hole camera if
you see look from our reaction we really
cool be nice it's actually nice in that
on that landscape I like that because
the weight folds and it's sizing even
though it's thick it's just definitely
thicker than they made X it fits into
like a breast pocket you can put into
your jeans pocket and if you destroy the
front display
doesn't matter you can always open it up
and still use it right you know that's
the thing V so it's not gonna have a
case it's gonna have one of those you
know clip cases for it that's what
you're gonna be used with the fold the
main X on the other hand is is beautiful
looks super sci-fi and looks like oh I'm
gonna break this thing that's that's the
first thing that comes to mind because
yes it's got a really sturdy lock and
like from all indications it's solid but
flipping it that way I feel like I just
feel like it's going to lose more of its
integrity over time as opposed to the
fold and the fold once we get to like a
phone 2 or fold 3 it's gonna be thinner
we're gonna have a bigger display in the
front where you will spend a lot of time
on the front display anyway mmm because
that's that's what I envisioned with
most tablets is that I will spend that's
right I see tablets most foldables I
will spend most of my time using this
front display yeah and then eventually I
will go ahead and use the Eye of Sauron
and open it up and go to something else
but I've been waiting too much fun with
these a hole-punch wallpaper again I
love it yeah I'm uh I I agree like
that's that's a use case scenario that
again in a video that I entered of never
putting out where I just talked about
the galaxy fold and what use case
scenarios there are I mean obviously my
favorite one would be open up a game
open up the phone
have some fun play in that game even put
it down on a table and then use a game
controller that's probably the most
ideal but yeah you're right the even
even Richard you himself CEO of Huawei
said I feel like having two screens of
front screen and a back screen simply
just makes the phone too heavy so we
have too many screens on the device it's
just going to make it so that the phone
is heavier because there's more bits
going on but there's also it's it's
heavier in terms of usage you actually
have to cater your own habits to what is
there so at least in this case you are
able in the case of the made X you are
able to use the phone as just a simple
which one's this no a nice terminator
you are able to use the phone it's just
like a traditional smartphone and then
you don't have any compromises
whatsoever the way the galaxy folds out
side screen has and then you open it up
and also on you have a tablet you can
just like watch watch me
I agree and disagree because you look
the thing about is that you you you're
gonna it's gonna break faster I
guarantee you yeah that's the problem
it's not the matter of fact that you can
use you as a smartphone is the fact that
if you don't lock it into that lock
mechanism and hit the button you're
gonna have it half way out half way in
and somebody's gonna break it the galaxy
fold to me just kind of feels like it
feels like a book right now and and I
get it we don't have the right materials
yet fully for us to just be flipping
around screens left and right and not
bother or care like it just doesn't
exist at this point there's no Gorilla
Glass ten variants that will Bend and
fold in ways that we should so I think
right now it makes a lot of sense yeah
some people will say look you know
there's all the argument you know the
video I put up a lot of people's like
folding walls are useless it's not I
disagree I think foldables are the final
future where our smartphones will be
this current design language of
smartphones this is the extension of it
because at the end of the day buying an
iPad or buying the tablet is just it's
just it's just like an extension of your
current operating system now think about
it this way if you had a Galaxy Note
sized device that opens up with either
fall so it went from six inches to 10
inches now I have a 10 inch display and
then I can put it down and and use it to
edit video whoever I want I have my full
mobile workstation which literally goes
from from this size to this size right
boom done I go home like that's that's
literally it
you know 10 inches is the right size
eventually for tablet right Apple has
proven that with even a nine point seven
inch iPad all the way you know you know
in that time they've sold a lot of those
but we know very well that we're coming
to a point where we don't want to carry
too much stuff we want thinner laptops
we want devices that do we know more for
so I think this is where it falls into
it
I would I would even argue that what
users are going to want
after this whole foldable craze sort of
levels out a little bit is a return to
practicality because I don't really know
anybody who actually finds more use case
scenarios from a screen that is simply
bigger unless there is something like
multitasking or dual screen or dual
window stuff that's happening but if
you're just looking at it as oh it's a
bigger screen there's actually not a
whole lot that's gonna add to your life
just because the screen is twice as big
or three times as big or anything like
that I think while you make a point that
the iPad pro does a good job of proving
that tablets are still a viable piece of
tech I don't think that tablets as a
whole make it make it make it clear why
you would use something that big so
that's the reason why I think foldables
are super niche they're very they're
awesome don't get me wrong they're
awesome but as far as practicality is
concerned I still not convinced see I
disagree trust me I think when you have
a foldable and in not this year's
version maybe next year or 2013
I'm sorry not 2013 23:32 yes sir 2021
you realize how good it is and I think
Microsoft is the one that will prove for
the Bulls the right way the problem with
all the Bulls is not it's not the screen
size the screen size to me makes the
most amount of sense the practical
nature of having a larger screen size
means you can expand from working from
normal to more work or entertainment on
a larger scale oh no I agree I can't
really agree what I'm saying is that
it's just an extension of an experience
you've already had yeah another original
screen but that's still very key I fly a
lot we watch movies of this I had the
tablet in my bag but I don't want to get
out of my backpack mm-hmm yeah that's
fair it's it's a very simple thing but
it this is what like if you think about
how Apple built is its recognition right
you know the iPhone was popular not
because it was a phone because it was an
mp3 player as well you know and and you
could brow and it was a mini-computer
and you had all those three things but
why grab them that's the same thing and
if you look at me from that perspective
is that the foldable now allows me to do
you know I think of Dex and thinking how
like how you can actually have it if you
fold it out you can actually super cute
or Dex like experience on the foldable
sides and that's what I'm saying like I
just don't want a bigger screen for the
sake of a bigger screen I actually want
that screen to be used to full extent
and if boy yes would be the case like
that would be amazing
but that's depends on the manufacturer I
develop yeah yes that's the thing but
also again gaming even mobile gaming I
mean think about the idea that with the
fold I can actually have controls here
even with fortnight I don't have to have
my hands on the same screen I am
shooting at now it's on the top screen
and I can just keep playing that to me
is will make me play more mobile games
than anything else oh yeah I think I can
I can I can get behind that if my main
use case is is gaming yeah so I think
those are the things that come to play
and then when you look at it from the
business side of things right you know
you're able to look at powerpoints much
better spreadsheets you know even if
you're using it in in a workspace where
you now have bility to access more
information and actually handle that
information because you can do so much
more with it now because because the
thing about real estate is that once you
have real estate it says I can do more
the reason why we're used to this is
because this is the real estate we're
told we could use there's literally so
once you expand it you can do more which
is why you know you know Lumia fusion on
the iPad pro right not that you can't
use luma fusion on the iPhone just the
experience of using it on an iPad is
much better just because you've got a
larger real estate to edit as much as we
all love to edit videos we know very
well you will have a better time with a
desktop and a larger display to edit
your video yeah that's true you can do
the same thing on a laptop that's 11
inches but but the desktop with that
large so it's the same thing when you
now have a bigger scheme so think about
it this way with the galaxy full
in affordable devising in three years
you can literally uh you can literally
vlog all your stuff open it up and edit
clean because you've got more space to
do all that work hmm
and like I said I completely agree with
that it's just that the the actual
fundamental infrastructure in apps and
software doesn't do that yet so you kind
of hit it on the nail already earlier is
that this first generation of foldables
may not be for me until we actually we
actually cater our usage to it and it
evolved to a place where we have all of
these capabilities yeah I have no doubt
that we'll get there it's just right now
I'm not convinced with the current
foldables as cool as they are oh yeah I
think I think we did it like the two of
us went ahead and got close to an hour
on a podcast just the two of us so thank
you so much for that
all right cool well on that note that is
it for the weekly I wonder if some
people in the chat I still say are still
saying typically voice sounds weird it
does I apologize I haven't no idea that
has been a problem that I've tackled
before but I never knew I never know
what the actual is so like quick
solution is other than to just reconnect
everything and obviously I'm not gonna
do it on the show in any case I hope
