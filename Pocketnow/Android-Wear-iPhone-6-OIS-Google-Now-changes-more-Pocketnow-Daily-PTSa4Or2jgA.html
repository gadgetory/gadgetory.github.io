announcing Android wear today iphone 6
rumors point to Apple considering
optical image stabilization and we get
the possible launch dates for the HTC
One m8 and stores I'm high knowing that
I and all we need now is the Microsoft
SmartWatch with the beautiful Metro UI
right this is parking out daily let's
try to lay off with some official news
as Apple has just launched the ipad 4
and the iphone 5c with 8 gigabytes no i
did not get these products wrong this is
the ipad for the one we already saw that
they discontinued well the company has
decided to retire the ipad 2 and now
their entry-level tablet is the ipad 4
but retina display so yeah that option
is available you can also consider
getting the iphone 5c with a gigabytes
and certain european countries for 60
euros less even though i don't know what
people can do with 8 gigabytes and
speaking of apple we get some more
rumors of the iphone 6 apparently Apple
is considering this company to provide
optical image stabilization for their
next-generation iphone and this is very
interesting as we know that Apple is
considering a point 22 inch thick iphone
6 so we wonder how good that sensor must
be in order to fit inside that thin
chassis as we know that's not really
possible with current sensors obviously
we do know that no gift for example let
go of the company that provided optical
image stabilization for lumia 920
apparently they found some better
technology so hey you never know what we
could be getting hopefully this is the
case as Apple does need to bring this to
the next iPhone now let's talk about the
all new HTC One as we are geared up for
the March twenty fifth event and even
though we're expecting for the phone to
actually launch in retail stores by
mid-april carphone warehouse is assuring
everybody that the phone will be ready
on March 25th which is really
interesting could it be that HTC's
planning to do that whole new album from
Beyonce thing where you get the phone
that same day just like we got her new
album will see that will be interesting
now sorry about Google as the company is
apparently working on this new feature
for google now that is kind of creepy
first of all
it seems that somehow Google now we'll
be able to detect who you're with and it
actually be able to tailor reminders
depending on who you're with again we
still don't know how google is planning
to do this especially if you're not
using a phone that's you know using
google now or the other person who
you're with so it's gonna be really
interesting to see what we're getting
here as I don't want Google to know
certain people i'm with and finally for
the very hot news of the day speaking of
that whole Beyonce's new album guys
Google just launched Android wear out of
the blue this morning they just came out
and launched their whole operating
system you know the variant of Android
for wearables with an SDK just about
everything and we even get products we
get the Moto 360 which is our gorgeous
and we also get this LG G watch which is
expected to be the name and apparently
this LG G watch will be the first one
and this whole SmartWatch project is
focused on Google now who will now will
be powering these smart watches with
alerts even though you're not asking for
them which is one of the coolest
features of google now and it does make
sense in a wearable but that leads you
to the question of the day after seeing
the links in the description and the
videos from google with all the details
of what you can expect from Android wear
what do you think about smartwatches now
are you getting the Moto 360 or the LG G
watch in my particular case the Moto 360
is a given that thing is gorgeous and I
don't know what's gonna happen with
pebble and the gear lineup and
everything but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
