is overthrowing the s9 on pre-orders but
can't quite reach the note 8 we get some
leaked information for upcoming Apple
watch series 4 and new Siri updates and
Huawei has some new colors prepared for
the p20 probe very soon I'm high metal
Iveta and definitely the jokes yesterday
on the recap were hilarious
make sure you watch that video this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals obviously we're close
to new iPhones we've just got a new
Galaxy Note so of course there are deals
right now for those of you in the market
for Galaxy devices Sprint currently has
flash sales for the Galaxy s8 but if you
want to make that compelling iPhone 10
devices are currently as part of that
flash sale there are a ton of conditions
but it just reminds me of how important
it is for you guys to consider that
right now is probably the best time to
resell your current iPhone and probably
get the most amount of money for those
of you wanting to upgrade to any of
these deals from Sprint or for you to
get the new iPhone whenever it comes out
SWAPO has got some great options you can
learn more about that in the description
now for those of you that have been
dealing with lag issues on your Google
pixel to excel I am actually one of them
and apparently I'm not alone and you are
not alone it has been discovered and the
google has actually sort of responded
that they are working on it but the most
important part is that apparently there
are three reasons why your phone has
issues and one of these could actually
lead for you to get a replacement and
given the scuffs that I've got on my
phone I'm actually gonna work on that
you can learn more about that in the
description as well and for those of you
wanting to buy the Huawei P 20 pro I
might recommend that you wait not
necessarily for the mate 20 pro that's
being rumored but because we hear that
at Aoife we're gonna get new color
options for the P 20 Pro the colors look
rather interesting according to the
rumors it seems this is gonna get really
good I cannot tell you enough how much I
love the camera on this phone color
options are already great with Twilight
but I'm willing to see more and for
those of you that want to buy yourself
an Apple watch definitely way for the
new units we've heard soon
of all the possible changes that are
coming with these updates now we hear
that we've got six models coming and six
models could always be just different
variants you know for stainless steel
whatever edition variant and the
aluminum that we usually get in two
different sizes so I think that's going
to be the case let us know in the
comments what you would like to see from
these Apple watches aside from the
rumors that we've already covered and
finally the most interesting news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note
9 particularly because according to
sources this phone has completely smoked
the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus when it came
to pre-orders from 30 to 50 percent
higher rates of three orders when
compared to the s9 and s9 plus but the
interesting part is that apparently it
hasn't still gotten as good as the
no-date it is still 20% below the Galaxy
Note 8 so in today's question I'm rather
curious what do you think has made the
Galaxy Note 9 more special than the SI
9s 9 + and why hasn't it been more
special in the node 8 in my case I think
it has everything to do with the fact
that we were deprived from note units
with the note 7 issue and so we all
wanted to get the note 8 and we did and
the note 9 has some changes but probably
not significant enough let us know in
the comments what you think friends
