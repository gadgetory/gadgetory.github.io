pocket now calm and this is a look at
touchflo 3d 2.5 build 1920 this is the
version of touchflo 3d that will be on
the HTC hd2 which is the first windows
mobile device to have a capacitive
display the changes in 1920 may have
actually been present in 1991 we did the
video but we just didn't notice certain
things so let's take a look at some new
things that you may have not have seen
yet if you follow us on YouTube the
first thing we're going to take a look
at is the weather demo so if we tap on
this item here we get to see all these
beautiful animations that you get now on
the home screen this is dragged up or
down to preview the weather condition so
here is showers and it's a little bit
laggy on the 528 megahertz processor on
the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two but imagine it being
much much faster on a snapdragon 1
gigahertz processor on the HTC hd2 so we
continue to flick through and see all of
the different 8 animations that you can
get on your main screen that fill up the
whole screen this one's pretty cool the
AB the windy animation and here's six
partly cloudy with Thunder cold snowy
and finally thunderstorms now what
you'll notice is that touchflo 3d 2.5
build 9 teen 20 doesn't work at all in
landscape because it's not intended for
a device that can have a landscape
display when you slide out the keyboard
so things kind of get really weird when
you slide out the keyboard and go into
landscape so let's go back and take a
look at what else is new in this for in
this build something else that's new and
it's kind of subtle it's not that big of
a deal is the splash screen for opera
browser and now has HTC's new slogan
quietly brilliant and the splash screen
when you turn on the device also says
this too instead of HTC innovation or
what it was previously so we can get out
of this
if we go into weather typically they
give you seven different locations by
default but the problem with the seven
locations that in order to delete them
you have to go through one at a time and
you have to flick through and go to menu
remove menu remove but now there's a
quicker and easier way to do this so if
we go to menu and we go to remove
location we can actually just check off
all the ones that we don't want in one
swoop so that we don't have to go one by
one and remove the locations so now we
only have three keeps things a little
bit cleaner of course we have the new
Twitter client which hasn't changed much
since since build 1919 that we saw you
in the previous video it works very well
if we go into settings there's a lot of
things that have gone much deeper than
we saw before for example if we go into
sound and display we can dial down very
nicely into the notification sounds for
all of the different notifications that
your device may have so new email
message we can turn it on or turn it off
we can tap on the item to the left and
actually determine which specific sounds
you want for that sound for that alert
so we can tap on this we can turn on the
vibration click done and you can do that
for all of these things miss call
voicemail new SMS or reminder also you
may have noticed back here new is pocket
mode increase ring volume when in pocket
or bag that's really cool not sure how
the device knows that it's in your
pocket also this is new this is a
feature that we knew is coming to the
hd2 quiet ring on pickups so when the
phone rings and you pick the device and
it senses movement it will quiet the
ringer because the idea is that you
already know that someone is calling the
ringer should kind of get a little bit
quieter so that you don't disturb people
around you and the other things around
here are sort of sort of basic over here
in data services we have a one screen
management of all of your social network
so we can log into Facebook Twitter or
YouTube all from this one screen also
kind of interesting if we go into
wireless control which will show you the
connection manager we now have a button
for mobile Wi-Fi router so if you tap on
this button it will start broadcasting a
signal kind of like the verizon mifi or
the sprint mifi so that
you're taking your hsdpa connection and
beaming it out to laptops or netbooks or
a computer around you to have that Wi-Fi
connection and there are some settings
with this I haven't actually gotten into
work yet but it says it's running and if
you click on the Help button it'll kind
of explain exactly how this works a
Wi-Fi router program like this was
released on XDA developers for all
devices but they've spur stood up nicely
for this particular version of touchflo
3d so I'm going to click OK and stop the
Wi-Fi router from going and finally
there's one more change that we've
noticed in this version of touchflo 3d
2.5 build 1920 if we go to the file
explorer the scroll bars have gotten a
lot thinner so if we go to a really long
screen like Windows you don't get that
really thick scroll bar that you get in
windows mobile 6.5 on the tix up a lot
of screen space so here we have a much
much thinner version of the scroll bar
it's not as easier to grab but the HTC
hd2 will have a lot of integration with
touch so it really won't matter that you
have to you know get out your stylus and
position it on the on the tiny little
scroll bar it's just sort of an
indicator of where you are in a long
list so that was a quick look at
touchflo 3d 2.5 build in 1920 a lot of
new incremental changes that makes
touchflo 3d go even deeper than it was
before and we keep seeing it go deeper
and deeper although there are times when
you get into the windows mobile
interface kind of in a jarring way for
example if we go to keyboard sliding
sound we are taken into the windows
mobile interface and it's kind of a big
disconnect to go from the nice elegance
of touchflo 3d to the ugly look also
knowing this rom one final thing we
can't actually get it to work but if you
click on car kit mode you can see the
na'vi panel starts to load and that is
sort of that full screen beautiful
navigation display that you can have on
hd2 with the optional car kit so
hopefully future roms will be able to
show that off so we can show it on video
on our youtube channel so be sure to

that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
