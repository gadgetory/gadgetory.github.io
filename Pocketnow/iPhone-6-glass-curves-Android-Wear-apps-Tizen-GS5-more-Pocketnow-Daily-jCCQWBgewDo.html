gets leaked with some curves the first
third-party Android where applications
reach google play and a samsung already
working on a tyson based galaxy s5 I'm
hi Mary that and as July begins and the
summer is also on its way make sure your
hydration options include a beer label
this is pocket out daily let's begin
today with the official news as Samsung
has just announced its galaxy s5 mini
though for those of you that were
expecting Samson to follow the Sony
trend with a smaller flagship this is a
mid-tier phone it's just a smaller
version of the galaxy s5 only in design
but then again we get a much smaller
display at 720p and we get the usual
bells and whistles look to the
description for details on
specifications it should launch in
Russia very soon and then worldwide
those of you that thought that Android
wear applications would take some time
as the products have just been launched
well think again we've got two
application is the google play store
already even though these are basic
calculator applications and a compass
it's great to see that the community has
begun porting applications these are
currently basic one of the things that
worries us is that these are not
compatible around the displays so it be
that fragmentation is going to be an
issue with Android wear eventually we'll
see about that very interesting rumor
has just emerged from Samsung and Tizen
those of you thought that Samsung Z was
the only option we get think again as
the company is apparently already
shipping some test units of the galaxy
s5 running Tizen name though we can't
predict if this will be a unique device
that will be launched only in Korea or
other specific places it's interesting
to the assembling is already testing its
proprietary operating system for
apparently samarkand let's see how that
goes as a how many galaxy s5s are we
going to get a very interesting article
was published today regarding all the
efforts that Apple is currently pushing
to make Siri better we know that Apple
hired people from amazon a 9 and also
people from Microsoft but even more
interesting we know that new ones is the
service of powers Siri and as it turns
out after some rumors that Samson was
going to buy new ones Apple has been
hiring employees from new ones directly
apparently there
working on building something in a house
to make Siri more reliable and faster
hopefully this will pull the beta tag
off Syria ventually as it's been in beta
for longer than gmail was and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
as we are just a couple of months away
from the launch of the iphone 6 we get
the first leaked photographs of the
display but i'm talking about the screen
the screen glass for both black and
white it's being compared against the
iphone 5 and that's being compared
against itself and we do see that the
facetime cameras move we do see that
it's significantly bigger but even more
interesting it's got some curves but not
the curves that we were expecting as up
if you all remember the HTC Sensation
where the glass was Curt that the edges
apparently this is going to be the case
it's just going to be curved at the
edges and not really something that many
of us were expecting which leads me to
the question of the day how important
our curve this place for you and
particularly on the future our iPhone
because in my particular case it does
proved to be cool and devices like the
5.5 inch model that's coming but then
again it's proven to be a gimmick for me
but leave us a comment down below is
that an important factor for you on your
future smartphone even though we still
wouldn't buy the LG G flex and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
