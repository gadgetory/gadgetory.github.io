brought to you by deep brand one Carlos
bag now here for pocket now we've
already produced a real audio review on
the galaxy si but there was one thing we
neglected to talk about in that video
and that was the performance on the
included earbuds Samsung is really
promoting their acquisition of harman
the company that also owns the AKG brand
and included in the box with every
galaxy s8 is a pair of these AKG earbuds
getting right down to brass tacks these
don't give off the nicest first
impression a majority of the material
along the driver tasting is plastic kind
of rubbery boots there's a little bit
more of a sport focus in my opinion and
when you compare them against some of
the other premium offerings like the
earbuds included with LG V series phones
they just don't look that nice and that
inexpensive or sporty feel continues
down into the cabling itself just below
the earbuds we've got kind of rubbery
cabling and on the left ear channel
we've got a lightweight plasticky
microphone and control lobe but then
where the two cable channels meet it
then transfers over into a nylon woven
it feels a bit more rugged a bit more
durable and I kind of wish this woven
casing this woven shielding extended all
the way up to the boots of the earbuds
but there is some interesting function
to this form these are inner aural
earbuds and Samsung includes different
sized rubber tips we've seen that before
for different sized ears to go inside
your ear canal but this lump of plastic
that runs just behind the ear tip
actually does a really good job of
resting inside this little scoop in my
ear it's the exact same place you would
fit a pair of ear pods from Apple but
those are all the aesthetics how do
these things sound and in a word good in
two words very good in more words let's
chat this is a very high quality
offering to include in the purchase
price of a phone you can expect very
colorful playback very full bass very
bright highs I am a little concerned
that the mids can get stomped on
depending on what kind of music you like
to listen to you're listening to club
tracks hip hop EDM these things are
going to serve you very well listening
to some classic rock or some jazz though
you know music where you don't have that
artificial creation of low frequency
sound I feel we lose some of the
distinctiveness of certain instruments
especially when we're talking about
car distortion or the vibrato from
stringed instruments it's in those
musical genres where the highs can feel
a little artificially bright they never
really became piercing or shrill at the
volumes that I listen to but again your
personal preferences and how you listen
to music we might press over into
unpleasant territory and just because
I'm not prescient I can see some of the
comments down below this video that
maybe I'm being a little too hard on
these earbuds or maybe I'm being too
nitpicky this is actually a good thing
for Samsung
we have earbuds in the box with the
Galaxy s8 that are deserving of that
kind of scrutiny my personal preference
I like the earbud that we got with the
lgb 20 the B&amp;amp;O earbuds a little bit
better than I like these AKG earbuds
from Samsung but if we're talking
overall quality these two compete really
well and for people who are listening to
music almost exclusively from mobile
devices like smartphones this becomes a
really interesting value add on
proposition and most markets around the
world the smaller Galaxy s8 not the si+
that I have here is going to be around
100 to 150 dollars more expensive than a
phone like the LG G 6 but the LG G 6
does not include earbuds in the box the
AKG earbuds that come with the galaxy s
8 get me really close to the bno earbuds
I own and these retail for around 100 to
150 dollars buying a new smartphone and
you want a high quality headset to go
with it well that's 150 dollars you
don't need to spend and without throwing
too much shade it's just a nice step
from Samsung to include accessories in
the box which are monster ibly better
than what their competitors might be
including with their smartphones did you
know that the average cloud weighs 1.1
million pounds we'd like to thank our
sponsor D brand for reminding us that if
all the fluffy looking clouds in the
world fell on us at once we probably
wouldn't have a society and we certainly
wouldn't have the galaxy s 8 it's only
rated for ip68
this bizarre ad in all of our Samsung
Galaxy S a coverage is brought to you by
B brand check them out in the link below
got to give Samsung the thumbs up here
this was a very happy surprise this was
a great pair of earbuds to include in
the box if you're shopping the Galaxy s8
I think you're going to be very happy
with these things being included in the
price of the phone as always folks
thanks so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for more Galla
cs8 coverage we've got reviews in
comparisons we're going to be digging
deep into camera and audio tech we
already have the real audio review on
the phone published you know the phone

gadget guy on Instagram and Twitter and
