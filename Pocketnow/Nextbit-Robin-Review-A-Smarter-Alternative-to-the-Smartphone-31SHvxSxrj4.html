smartphone the next bit Robin should be
in your crosshairs it's being built as
the cloud first smartphone that makes
running out of space history but does it
live up to its revolutionary claims I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and we
spent seven days finding out join me for
our video review of the next bit robin
back at CES in Las Vegas next bit told
us it wanted to strike a different chord
with the Robbins design and well mission
accomplished the casing is a study in
right angles a black or white pillar
capped with mint colored bands a top and
bottom breaking up all those right
angles are circular accents that make
the Robin a little more approachable
more friendly the primary camera and
flash the selfie shooter and proximity
sensor the tiny raised dimples of volume
controls the fingerprint sensor is
rounded off to embedded within the power
standby key on the right edge next bits
done some interesting stuff with lights
here as well the notification LED sits
on the bottom edge alongside the type-c
USB port while a separate set of four
activity LEDs anchor the cloud logo on
the back side as with all bold designs
the Robin won't be for everyone the
sharp edges are little tough on tender
palms the fingerprint scanner is pretty
small those who like edge to edge
screens will be disappointed here too
the Robin's 5.2 inch full HD display
sits within a kind of picture-in-picture
double bezel and the IPS panel itself is
nothing special with somewhat low
saturation and poor off angle visibility
the downsides of the design aren't
enough to take away from it's refreshing
novelty though the Robin is a sidekick
guaranteed to turn heads and next bits
bold moves extend to the software as
well custom third-party UI built atop
Android marshmallow the launcher is very
cool it's got a soft aesthetic that's
consistent from the macaroni like soft
keys to the soothing sound effects that
come pre-loaded it's a bit like iOS and
that there's no app drawer instead apps
appear directly on the lawn
as they're installed and while you can
put your apps in folders and arrange
them in any order you like
you can't put widgets alongside them as
on other Android phones instead there's
a dedicated widget layer which you
access through a pinch gesture or a long
press of the multitasking key it's not
our favorite implementation but it does
serve to make it very easy to see which
apps you have installed on the phone and
which ones are currently taking a little
break up in the cloud and that's really
the Robins raison d'Ãªtre managing the
phones 25 gigs of user accessible
storage is very simple because you don't
manage it you just fill up the phone
with as many apps photos and videos as
you want and when the Robin detects it
has less than 1.5 gigs left it starts
offloading apps and photos to your 100
gig reservoir in next bits AWS cloud and
it's not doing it randomly either
it's offloading the apps and photos you
access the least based on what it's
learned about your usage to get an app
back from the cloud you just tap on it
to redownload it and it comes back with
all your data so in the case of lift for
example you don't need to login again as
for photos even when they're archived a
screen resolution copy stays on the
phone so you can see it in the gallery
if you want to take a closer look Robin
will go fetch the full res version as
soon as you pinch to zoom the Robin
currently doesn't back up videos but
according to next bit that'll change
toward the second half of the year all
this works surprisingly well but we did
run into a few hiccups one day we
stopped getting notifications on our
paired pebble and we quickly realized
the Robin had archived our pebble app to
make room fortunately there's a simple
fix for that you can pin any app you
want to prevent it from being archived
another minor thing the phone tends to
randomly move apps around the home
screen when it archives them which is
annoying there's a bit of a delay in
certain corners of the OS like the app
lists that keep track of what's archived
and what's pinned and for some reason
the uber app won't run on our device it
crashes on startup every
speaking of things that don't work
exactly the way they should the robin
packs a 13 megapixel camera a sensor
from samsung and while the hardware
seems capable enough the software isn't
where it needs to be the robbins
viewfinder is well laid out with a few
handy manual controls but it's also slow
to launch slow to focus and slow to
capture on the bright side it's
certainly possible to get some
nice-looking if somewhat noisy photos
out of this phone and we were pleasantly
surprised by its performance in less
than ideal lighting but thanks to the
lag the process of taking those photos
isn't much fun at all and selfie shots
with the 5 megapixel front-facing camera
have so much grain well they look like
they've got a filter on them or
something the good news is that next bit
knows it has work to do on the camera
which also includes fixing a bug with
video stabilization that's why we didn't
test video much the company is
anticipating that Robin's first
system-wide software update will land in
April and if you don't want to wait
there's more good news the Robin comes
with an unlocked bootloader open source
drivers and possibly the most forgiving
warranty in existence tinker away
you've got next bits blessing to load
any custom ROM you want the phone is
still covered even if you brick it we've
spent the past 7 days on t-mobile us
seeing how the phone performs between
Greater Boston New York City and Rural
Long Island during that time voice calls
on our end have been clear and crisp the
colors were able to hear the sound of
auto traffic at one point while we walk
down a busy city sidewalk the Robins
powered by a Snapdragon 808 made it to
three gigs of ram enough to run graphics
heavy games like asphalt 8 though like
most 808 powered phones it does get
pretty warm under a load the
front-facing speakers make Netflix
binges really enjoyable they don't pack
the sheer amplitude to the Moto X and
they're not quite as dynamic as the HTC
One but they're better than the vast
majority of smart phone speakers
and finally while the Robin is capable
of quick charging via a special
one-and-a-half amp wall wart you won't
find that charger included in the box
next but assumes that you probably have
a wall charger of your own left over
from a previous phone so only a charging
cable comes with the Robin the $10 quick
charger might be a worthwhile investment
if you're planning on anything close to
heavy use because the Robins battery is
by no means a road warrior on our best
day we managed about three and a half
hours of screen on time over 12 hours of
moderate use when I first went hands-on
with the next bit Robin I worried that
it was a one-trick pony
phone that relied too heavily on one
killer feature to stand out after a week
of usage I still think that's true but I
also think I severely underestimated
just how killer that one feature is
having a phone that effectively never
runs out of storage is really really
cool and the fact that it achieves that
while remaining very simple to operate
is even more impressive if you didn't
get in early with the Kickstarter
campaign the Robin will run you $399
unlocked it's not the cheapest
smartphone around given its camera
shortcomings it's certainly not a device
I'd recommend to everyone but on the
cusp of yet another wave of minor
iteration from some of the big players
the Robin is a refreshing alternative to
the modern smartphone that solves one of
the most common smartphone frustrations
attention mobile industry more like this
please
to see what kind of competition the next
bit Robin is going up against see our
related reviews here on YouTube and stay
tuned to pocket now as we tackle MWC
2016 in Barcelona starting February 21
until next time this has been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
reminding you to only pin the stuff you
need archived all the rest thanks for
watching everyone we'll see you on the
flip side of the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
