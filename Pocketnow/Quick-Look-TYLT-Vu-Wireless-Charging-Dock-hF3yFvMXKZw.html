that just blend into the desktop
landscape with low-profile unassuming
form factors and we're used to seeing
others built almost invisibly into other
products what we're not used to seeing
is a wireless charger built to stand out
on its own aesthetically but that's just
what you get with the new view wireless
charging cradle from tilt the company
sent us a demo unit to sample so let's
check it out
tilt is no stranger to bold visual
choices its website boasts some of the
most interesting accessory designs we've
ever seen the company worked with San
francisco-based New Deal design firm to
create a product that looks interesting
even in the package but which also
delivers some real practical advantages
over other wireless chargers the views
angled structure and protruding shelf
make placing your chi compatible phone
easier than finding the sweet spot on a
flat charging plate and it also props
your phone up at a more convenient angle
for seeing incoming notifications and
watching media and so on but there's
also another advantage hidden under the
surface there are three charging coils
here that means you don't have to hunt
for the perfect zone you just drop your
phone on in any orientation and it gets
to charging it's not as precise as the
magnetic locking of the now years old
palm touchstone technology but it
doesn't really have to be as long as
your phone is anywhere on the view it'll
charge and an LED indicator down below
lets you know you've hit the mark
according to tilts website the
kickstarter-funded view is going into
full production starting June 28th and
shipping August 5th the official
unveiling is slated for CES 2014 our
demo unit is the black version but blue
red and green are also available the
view will work with any Qi compliant
phone and it's currently offered for $49
and up depending on which Kickstarter
funding option you select in a world of
low profile qi chargers it's nice to see
a company going out of its way to stand
out and doing so in a way that offers
practical benefits if you've got an eye
for style and a smartphone that is or it
can be made XI compatible the view
definitely deserves a look visit the
company's website at the link in the
description and follow PocketNow on
social media and subscribe here on
YouTube so you don't miss future
coverage on smartphones tablets and
mobile accessories of all kinds
thanks to tilt for the
review unit and thank you for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
