available and it's time to get it out of
the box I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket
now and this is our unboxing of the
Apple iPad Mini with Retina display so
we woke up to a surprise this morning
Apple unexpectedly released the ipad
mini with retina display and of course
we went out and bought one and we are
about to do an unboxing see what's
inside the box probably guess what's
already in there but not to waste too
much of your time let's just go ahead
and break on in this is as you can see
here on the back of the box 16 gigabyte
model we got the Wi-Fi only it does come
in LTE and comes in up to 128 gigabytes
so it'll be either 16 32 64 128
gigabytes it has like the iPad air it
has 1 gigabyte of RAM and it also has
the a7 chipset inside same clock speed
if we're not mistaken which is actually
one min 100 megahertz faster than the
iphone 5s it's clocked at one point 4
gigahertz alright so we get the top off
the box and of course inside we have the
tablet itself very small thin light just
like the last one we'll set that to the
side some reading material designed by
Apple in California nothing too special
in here just some papers with some
information like how did I get started
and all of that warranty information
this is your lightning cable nothing
special there and of course your AC
power adapter so the power block
seriously nothing surprising or
impressive they're just pretty standard
contents inside the box so let's plug
that away to the side really quickly and
take a look at the tablet it is actually
very thin very light I'm not sure
exactly how it compares in size and
weight to last year's model I think it's
pretty similar it's 331 grams which is
about a hundred grams lighter than the
ipad air so it's it's pretty light but I
don't think for the size it's not that
big of a difference get the plastic off
and take a look around the hardware
we have the 5 megapixel camera here on
the back you know standard stuff here on
the Silver Edition your volume rocker
and your mute switch power button on the
top right corner as well as your dual
mics on the back edge 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack your dual speakers on the
bottom edge and of course your lightning
port on the front you have your 7.9 inch
display and we're going to power this
thing on while we wait but this is a 7.9
inch display at 2048 x 1536 pixels
making 324 pixels per inch so it's a
very dense display and we're going to do
some comparisons with other like sized
tablets with similarly high res displays
like the Nexus 7 that might be the first
comparison we do so stay tuned for that
we're not going to go through the setup
process here but uh this is the ipad
mini with retina display we're going to
be reviewing it and comparing it to all
sorts of tablet so stay tuned for that
and we will see you next time that's
