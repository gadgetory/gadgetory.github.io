for 2017 but both approach the market in
a very different way from the Lincoln
Center in New York City I am
highlighting another pocket now and this
is Samsung Galaxy s8 plus vs. iPhone 7
plus brought to you by D brand into the
foot show for comparison folks as the
galaxy s 8 plus is not a final unit but
after that let's deal with some of the
basics those devices support the named
plus but only the iPhone fills the role
of being a larger device with added
features whereas the Galaxy S a plus is
really just a larger variant of the
galaxy s 8 and that is one of pretty
much just three areas where the iPhone
wins anything in this comparison the
Samsung Galaxy S 8 plus is clearly more
futuristic in its design and also more
efficient and ergonomic the new 18 point
5 by 9 aspect ratio allows the SI plus
to support a much larger exploring 2
inch display on a body that's just a
hair taller than the iPhone 7 plus
though much narrower obviously that quad
HD plus panel on the SI is also more
pixel dense than the 1080p pen on the
iPhone this AMOLED display on the galaxy
is more vibrant in addition to also
bringing support for new technologies
like HDR we've all waste our time and
internals given the different mentality
of the iPhone but in the things that
really matter the galaxy s h plus starts
at 64 gigs of storage that's expandable
where the iPhone starts at 32 gigs at
the same price and if you want more
you'll have to pay for more only the
galaxy sports wireless charging and only
the Galaxy supports the new Dex hub that
allows you to turn this phone into a
computer the galaxy also has a bevy of
biometric security options ranging from
the fingerprint scanner and iris scanner
and even facial recognition where the
iPhone 7 plus just test touch ID that's
it the second area where the iPhone 7
plus when something is with its stereo
speakers but Samsung swings back heavily
with a headphone jack and a pair of AKG
headphones bundled in the box
and we can not wait to year with Samsung
is bringing in with its partnership with
Harman software approach is another
thing where we won't waste any time as
it really is a matter of taste I
actually like both user interfaces what
is important is Samsung's next attempt
at AI with Bigsby and the option for the
Google assistant if you don't end up
liking it but this is actually going to
be a tough one that we'd rather compare
later as Siri is very robust with the
latest changes of iOS 10 and then the
third spot where we could give some
point to the iPhone is the fact that we
have a dual camera setup where I
honestly wonder why Samsung is not
bringing dual cameras here I'm not
really a fan of the telephoto lens when
it comes to the iPhone but it's always
great to have that separate option for
more lossless zoom where Samsung has
really decided to play it safe with last
year's camera even though it was a
really great camera last year let's just
have that clear overall it's really too
early to call one product better than
the other this will require one of our
full comparisons but so far it is really
clear that Samsung has come up with one
of the most futuristic products of the
year while Apple's choice to iterate
another year might cost it a lot of
popularity once the Samsung Galaxy S 8
plus reaches the market did you know
that if there are 23 people in a room
there's a 50% chance that two of them
share a birthday we'd like to thank our
sponsor D brand for reminding us that
the next time your mom forgets your
birthday
chances are she forgot someone else is
