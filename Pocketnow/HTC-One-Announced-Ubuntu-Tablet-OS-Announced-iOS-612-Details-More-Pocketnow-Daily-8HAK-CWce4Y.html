bundle tablet operating system also gets
official an iOS 6.1 point2 gets released
with bug fixes I'm hi meri behna and you
can bet I'm getting that HTC One and
silver and this is out daily
aside from the obvious HTC launched
canonical also launched their tablet
version of ubuntu and it was running on
the Nexus 10 and it was running really
well everything looked great the
operating system has a lot of compelling
features like for example the fact that
you can launch phone applications on the
tablet operating system but different
from what the way the iPad does it here
you don't really need to blow taps they
actually sideload at the right you can
still continue using tablet applications
at the left kind of Jeanne's have you
asked me there is a lot of great things
coming to this ubuntu operating system
and we'll keep you posted when it
reaches the Nexus 10 aside from other
Nexus devices and iOS 6.1 point2 was
launched but interesting enough it does
seem that Apple did not address all of
the bugs that were detected on the
system family for example the exchange
calendar sync problem was fixed but then
again it does seem that Apple has not
fixed the lock screen issue or at least
we haven't received confirmation on that
and we haven't actually been able to try
it just yet but so far the scene that
iOS 6.1 point2 is just the step into
another version that will come out later
and just for the record it does seem
that it doesn't hinder evasion one bit
you could still jailbreak your device
but unconfirmed let us know in the
comments down below now let's continue
talking about Apple the motherboard for
the iphone 5s or iphone 6 whatever it's
going to be called has just been leaked
and apparently we will be getting a new
a7 chip not an a7x or anything like that
most likely that will be for the next
iPad but what's cool about this
processor is that aside from the fact
that it's obviously much faster than the
current one it also brings twice the ram
this time we will be getting two
gigabytes it's still not clear as to
when we will be getting the next iPhone
some people are speculating WWDC in June
but we'd like to think that I'll
probably have it in the fall we'll keep
you posted now I'm sure you've noticed
we have a ton of microsoft surface pro
videos courtesy of Adam Lane but the
coolest one just aired right now and he
shows us how to run BlueStacks on his
windows 8 pro system which is obviously
the surface pro and you'll notice that
he can run pretty much any
android app on his system and it runs
quite well I believe that blue stack is
probably one of the most genius features
that has come to Windows 8 but
interesting enough it hasn't reached
Windows RT so hit the link to the
description and follow all the
instructions to get it loaded on your
surface pro or Windows 8 system and
finally for the hot news of the day HTC
has just official IDEs their HTC One for
the United States and Europe coming up
soon this device is beautiful it's
probably one of the most beautiful
devices we've seen on any operating
system out there great design made fully
of aluminum and black white and yes
there is a red version also out there
though we don't know if that device will
be released at the same time but it's
got great specs of 1080p display and
it's also got this ultrapixel camera
which is actually 24 megapixel sensors
agency was boasting a lot about the fact
that it's not about megapixels and it
just makes you wonder if they're right
because recently I mean retina displays
are pretty much the common thing now
with tablets and it just begs to wonder
if these photos will look great on
retina display tablets or computers but
that leads me to the question of the day
are you waiting for the HTC One do you
want to get one I mean to be honest with
you everybody in pocket now surprises a
beautiful phone and i want- silver but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think of the device and if you want
an earlier a scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world machine follow us on pocket now
calm and subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Violetta thanks for watching see you
