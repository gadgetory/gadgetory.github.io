the team has just returned from Las
Vegas and even though we were expecting
more from this show just like pretty
much every time we go to Vegas we get
that same feeling of less mobile more
everything else obviously there were
some products that we did like from the
show so I'm hi meri beta this is pocket
now these are the top five devices that
we actually like that CES 2014 number
five is the ZTE nubia 5 and no you're
not in the wrong video this is actually
a phone that we did like and you know
it's interesting the whole team is
surprised that we actually like the ZTE
phone for the first time and the reason
why is because even though the new bf5
wasn't a bad phone it wasn't a great
phone and what they did was pretty much
fix everything we didn't like about the
new ef5 we get a better camera optical
image stabilization great photo quality
we also get an interesting new why
that's really unique we get a Snapdragon
processor a great display so stay tuned
the Nubia 5s hopefully will be an
interesting phone for 2014 and hopefully
it will come to the United States number
four is the Sony Xperia z1 compact for
the longest time we have wanted a phone
that is not gigantic and enhanced
blackship specifications and we finally
get at the z1 compact as this phone and
hopefully it will come to the United
States very soon it brings pretty much
everything that we see on the z1 but it
improves the display and the whole
viewing angle thing we get a waterproof
phone Sony's UI is really interesting
they're doing a great job with software
updates and this is just pointing to be
one of the great bones of 2014 let's
just hope their implementation is good
let's just hope they do have more than
one carrier if at least one that picks
up this phone because it will be really
interesting to match this up against the
iphone being the other non jumbo phone
with interesting specs number three are
Samsung tablets for the first time ever
for the first time ever we're actually
saying that we like Samsung tablets and
yeah the design wasn't really inspired
at all but we do like that bow leather
stitching at the back because of this
feel good in the hand we do like how
light these tablets are we do like the
options of tablets that we get and we do
love the fact that all these tablets
have great resolution displays that 8.4
inch tablet as an amazing
k display that it doesn't really need so
it's really great to see that finally an
oem is figuring out what we want for
tablets at least when it comes to the
display when it comes to the way we want
it to feel in the hand and again even
though these aren't the greatest tablets
in the world there's stuff in the right
direction next up we have to see how
well they perform number two is not
really a device but more actually
something that still deserves praise
it's samsung's new UI and again you are
not in the wrong video we've hated
TouchWiz for the longest of times and
finally we can say that there is a
TouchWiz that we actually like the
reason why is because we always complain
about the fact that tablets are just
bloated smartphones and Sampson finally
figured out a way to take advantage of
that whole display with multi window
support with that whole ambience thing
in the home screen with the hole cards
thing whatever you want to call it
floating windows everything Samsung has
just given tablets what they deserve
they deserve more than just a couple of
app icons on the display they don't have
to behave like smartphones and this is
something that we've Dokdo EMS for the
longest time so it's great to see that
finally one company does it differently
and that finally they're doing it
without copying anybody else you could
say that it does look like Windows and
it kind of does I just feel that it's
better because it's not just so stale so
stay tuned we do want to see that new UI
coming to future Samsung phones and
tablets and hopefully they can figure
out how to make it to not bog down the
device as well and the top number one
device that we'd like for CES 2014 was
the pebble steel we were expecting a lot
of wearables at CES 2014 and we ended up
with a lot of mock-ups that were trashy
and bad and just not working they were
markups again not really devices pebble
was the only company that really brought
us something compelling that pebble
steel is actually a fashion statement
the reason why it took me so long to buy
the pebble originally was because it
looked like a toy but this one really
looks like the watch that any
businessmen would like to buy and even
though some people find it a little
expensive at two hundred fifty dollars i
find it to be compelling honestly i
think that it's a good price point for
the extra functionality that you get and
for the price that you would pay for a
real fashionable watch i think that it's
adequately priced but again that's just
my opinion but anyways that leads me to
the question of this top five which was
your favorite device from CES 2014 again
my particular case the pebble steel
is the only device that I saw at this
event that I am willing to buy like now
and I will buy it but leave us a comment
down below what do you think that's it
for our top 5 thank you very much for
