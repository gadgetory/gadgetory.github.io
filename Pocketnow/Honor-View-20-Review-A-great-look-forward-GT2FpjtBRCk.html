time recently especially in terms of
design the notch has been one of the
most polarizing features in recent
memory but I can applaud the fact that
it made phone companies get creative
that we might see the fade of returning
form factors like sliders and motorized
parts all too soon from their ashes come
the next trend in full screen displays
the whole punch our first daily driver
look at this comes from honor and I have
to admit I don't hate it this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody
let's explore some of the trends we're
expecting in 2019 via this year's first
phone to combine them into one device
the honour view 20 don't worry I haven't
neglected the new 48 megapixel Sony
sensor which appears first in the view
20 spoiler alert I am seriously
impressed with it and I can't wait to
see what phones do with it later on it's
just one example of how honor has pulled
a number of great tricks out of their
bag to create a snapshot of what smart
phones could look like in this new year
all right let's get back to the screen
this full HD plus IPS display might not
have the resolution of top-tier
flagships but it is tuned very well for
colors and brightness it is also about
as bezel-less as it gets making a 6
point 4 inch display feel really easy to
maneuver in one hand that was achieved
by doing away with chins and notches
instead onder have put their
front-facing camera in a tiny little
hole in the corner now originally I was
afraid that it would be too big or too
close to the back button in many Android
applications but thankfully that's not
the case
it is nestled just perfectly inside of
the notification bar making it easy to
blend in if you change the nacho setting
you know what I got used to it way
faster than I ever did with any big
knotch
it's just like a tiny black spot in the
corner I have yet to run into any games
or any media that are truly affected by
it there are a couple of things missing
in the screen overall though aside from
more resolution it doesn't have an
always-on display which I now have come
to rely upon and though I applaud honor
for packing in some of the future trends
into the view 20 the fingerprint reader
is still in a classic rear position this
is not a huge deal it's just another
detail that puts this phone behind some
of its competitors that back looks great
though thanks to AV pattern backing that
comes in a few different colors but
always shines vividly its
glossy feel again a big classic with
that fingerprint reader where it is and
honestly it was always kind of cool to
have the word honor sprawled somewhere
on the back after a year that saw
returns of crazy colors and gradient
designs honored as well to continue that
design fun and all of that without
sacrificing too much after all there's
even a headphone jack
even though popping out the SIM tray
doesn't reveal a place for an SD card
there can be 128 or 256 gigabytes of
on-board storage which is great for all
of the media and games that you might
install on here and with up to 8
gigabytes of RAM on top of the Kirin 980
there's no shortage of power and
performance in the view xx and in my
usage the battery did not get more than
maybe about four hours of screen on time
but at the very least you can charge
this thing out pretty quickly using the
included fast charger you know if only
the software we're as accessible as the
rest of the phone
magic OS as it is called is very similar
to emui since honor and huawei have a
close relationship plenty of options do
allow for customization you can bring
back the app drawer if you wish you can
change up the navigation methods and you
can theme the interface to your delight
but in the end I imagine that many users
will put a different launcher on here to
make it look and feel a bit cleaner or
at least a little more familiar now what
might be familiar to users is the camera
experience which borrows pretty heavily
from the hawawa relationship by having a
similar app similar stabilization
capabilities and it also adds in things
like the night mode like many other
parts of this phone there is some new
new that has been injected in this case
powerful sensors for both the main and
front cameras even then this new 40
megapixel Sony CMOS sensor gets helped
along by a time-of-flight camera that
uses 3d depth sensing the main use for
this is in the portrait mode which has
done well in my testing to find the
subject and separate it from the
background
unfortunately this and other modes
cannot use the full potential of the 48
megapixel sensor as they default mainly
to 12 megapixels for final pictures and
the thing is when you go into the main
application into the auto mode this is
also the default for the general picture
taking experience the thing is that
those 12 megapixel pictures are achieved
by pixel binning this new sensor is
tuned to combine the pixels two by two
not only to ensure high detail in the
lower resolution pictures but also to
help with low-light shooting you know I
gotta say it seems to do it pretty well
pictures turned out really detailed even
in this
tiny basement arcade where I was getting
my butt handed to me in Street Fighter
and killer instinct it is in these
situations that the night mode can also
come in handy
using multiple frames and long exposures
to create one well expose an even dot
photo and like with its Huawei
counterparts the night mode can be used
in pretty much any situation for very
high dynamic range photos but that same
stabilization magic is actually used in
a new mode made for the 48 megapixel
sensor the AI ultra clarity mode to
ensure top-quality this mode uses
similar methods as the night mode to
take multiple photos and combine them
for a slightly higher dynamic range
super detailed picture now this is not a
replacement for the night mode however
as the app does tell you that you have
to have good lighting on the subject in
this mode really you're just choosing
when you want a bit of assistance by the
AI and the processing the level of
detail between this the regular 48
megapixel setting where it doesn't do
multi frame and the over sampled pixel
binned 12 megapixel pictures are kind of
similar that is to say they look pretty
damn great this is a great first foray
for the new 48 megapixel sensor by Sony
and a great job by honor in being the
first to put it to good use you know I
might even try to make some canvas
prints out of the best 48 megapixel
shots that I take on this phone just to
take advantage of that detail otherwise
it is just going to be a waste on social
media networks that would downsample it
to health plenty other forms of fun are
available in the camera app like 4k
video recording slow-motion and even
beauty modes that now include a body
slimming feature as horrific as they
might sound to some of you I barely even
touched upon the AI enhancements in the
auto mode which basically just adds
saturation and maybe a little bit of
contrast to over 1500 different scenes
and scenarios built into the NPU AR lens
modes can bring some fun to the already
detailed selfies due to the 25 megapixel
front shooter now this is a level of
silliness that you don't really get in
phones usually hitting Western markets
so it's nice that honor is not
neglecting them with the view 20 okay
clearly this is a phone with a mixed
identity the screen is full HD but it
has the new punch hole design the view
20 looks and feels really sleek but it
achieves it by not changing up the rear
fingerprint sensor or doing away with
even the headphone jack
it has such great specifications but
then it is priced lower than much of the
competition to ensure that the price
makes sense some of the aspects of the
view 20 might seem a little dated but
sprinkled among honors best phone yet
our future trends that show the
company's forward thinking and you know
what I got to say if this is a snapshot
of what we can look forward to in 2019
smartphones I'm actually pretty excited
about what is yet to come as always
thank you very much for watching and
hope you enjoyed this review of the on

description down below for more
information about this after all right
around the time that this video is being
released the actual phone is being
announced
so more info can be available over at
pocketnow.com you can also follow what
I'm up to and I might actually do a
little bit of a vlog where I take a look
at the canvas prints from the 40
megapixel photos that I take with this
over at my channel youtube.com slash
Tresor Vergara where I also do my own
format of review called who is this for
so you can follow both of us both of
these channels rather all over social
media you can find me at JV tech T and
of course pocket now is at pocket now
