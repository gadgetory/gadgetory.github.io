pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of
Palm Treo Pro now you've got to admit
that the trio Pro is a really good
looking device it's covered in this
glossy black finish it's very sleek it's
relatively thin it looks good I agree
with that and one of the problems is
that because of all of this shininess I
think they use too much plastic with
this it's a very lightweight device and
because of that it just feels a little
bit cheap so that may be a correct that
I have and you do not have the screen is
2.5 inches across and it's 320 by 320
and this is higher resolution that
you'll then you'll find on the other
palm treo devices such as the 750 or the
700 W or the 700 W X it's the same
resolution that you will find on the 800
W which is that sprint trio that was
released recently for the business user
going down below we have a few buttons
we do not have soft key buttons so
you'll have to tap with your thumb on
the screen to activate soft keys we have
a start button here calendar email and
ok and sometimes that closes the
application on the left and the right we
have really interesting looking call
start and call end keys I kind of like
them out here they're out of the way the
d-pad is really fantastic it's got a
really good ledge if you can see that
that will allow you to feel for it when
you're using it one-handed I really like
that as compared to something like the
HTC touch pro which is really difficult
if not impossible to feel for if you're
not looking right at the device in the
center where it says palm that's where
you press ok to select it's a nice big
button that has a good response to it
let's take a look at this keyboard the
keyboard is larger than it is on the
Centro but it is still quite small and
it feels really cheap if I slide my
fingers along the buttons I can feel
them move slightly as I pass them which
makes it feel a little low quality I'll
have to use this for a little while
longer to give you a full verdict on the
keyboard but so far I'm not terribly
impressed okay over on the back which is
a fingerprint magnet is the 2 megapixel
camera and let me slide off the back
it's a little bit tricky here and
there's not much on the back except for
the soft reset hole which is really
awkwardly placed behind the battery and
behind the stylus it's right there
bad place for the soft reset hole
okay over on the left side we have a
volume up and down rocker which is kind
of made out of Chrome but of course it's
plastic to the right of that is the
camera button so you hold that down
through a few seconds to activate the
camera then once inside the camera
application you press it down to take
the picture over on the bottom we have
micro USB which is really weird the only
other device that I know of I'm sure
there are others that if micro USB is
the Motorola q9h it's it's interesting
this is an HTC made device and usually
HTC devices come with ext USB which is
kind of like a proprietary mini USB
hybrid anyhow that's kind of annoying
because my existing chargers won't work
with this device we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack excuse me
which is a welcomed addition a lot of
phones don't have the have this nowadays
and to the right of that is a microphone
over to the right we stopped to see the
stylus which is a non collapsible stylus
that I like it's a it's small and it's
dirty and it feels good it's not
magnetic like the HTC touch Pro and
touch diamond but that's okay going over
to the right we have a Wi-Fi button
which will turn on and off Wi-Fi and on
the top we have a quick way to turn off
all of the sounds on the device which is
good all the pomp trios have had this
it's a great feature and over here we
have a on/off button if you hold it down
it will turn the phone into flight mode
which again this is a quick and easy way
to turn off all of the radios if you're
going onto an airplane and not have to
dig through a bunch of menus and before
I sign off I just want to call your
attention to this screen saver here
right now it says the time and the date
though if you have a missed call or a
miss SMS or a missed email it will also
display this this is really cool because
usually when you have a have to check
for a notification you actually have to
turn on your device which is quite
annoying it uses a battery life this way
you can just take the phone out of your
pocket without turning it on and see if
you have any missed calls and you can
proceed to turn on the phone if you do
or anything like that
and as a final note I just want to
mention that this screen is a pretty bad
screen outside it's completely washed
out it looks like it has a white and
milky film on it actually really hard to
see and even at maximum brightness and
you'll see this in the next
the color contrast and the quality is
just not good unfortunately this is not
a good screen and on that note that's it
for the hardware tour of the Palm Treo
Pro I'll be back with software coming up
soon so look out for that that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
