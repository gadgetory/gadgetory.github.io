pocket now calm and this is the unboxing
video for the eatin
a fish be 900 the v 900 is Eaton's
highest and windows mobile device that's
ever made it basically looks like an HTC
Touch like so but it has a vga screen it
has an antenna that allows you to get
over-the-air TV broadcast which is
pretty cool and it also is one of the
fastest processors to be in a windows
mobile device I think it's clocking at
533 megahertz it's a it's a samsung
processor so without further ado let's
get to the unboxing wow that was a
really good tape job alright we finally
have the device here watch live TV on
the go unfortunately I don't think in
North America we're going to be able to
watch watch live TV on the go and let's
read what we have on the side here
supports dvb-t for watching TV on the
move high-resolution VGA display for
optimal viewing of movie or TV content
finger friendly touch screen and 3d
interface that must mean that the v 900
has a kind of touchflo 3d competing user
experience high speed hsdpa this this
has UMTS 850 so you can get 3g on this
device in the US which is great super
responsive gps with surf star 3 3.2
megapixel autofocus camera and it has
windows mobile 6.1 which is good news
that it has the latest so let's get into
the box here
so they place the device right in the
front and we'll take a look at the
device in a minute let's see what else
we get in the Box looks like video out
cables I didn't know that this did video
out but I'm glad that it includes the
cables unlike the HTC touch pro which
makes you go out and buy the cable if
you want to have the TV out we have a
case and I want to see if this is
actually a leather case um I don't think
it's a leather case it smells like kind
of a plastic charger using mini USB
excellent we love to see mini USB and
not a proprietary connector that looks
like we have some stereo headphones here
pretty basic although they're actually
if you look closely there in ear in-ear
headphones that's kind of unique a sync
cable here and we have a stylist and a
battery it looks like an extra stylus
always welcomed although it's
collapsible we don't like collapsible
stylus styli the battery is huge it's a
1530 milliamp hours that's quite sizable
so we should get a lot of battery life
out of this if it's optimized properly
we have some software and we have a
getting started video or getting started
guide i should say that just kind of
gives you a diagram of the device all
right let's so let's get to the device
OIC comes out here if you've ever
unboxed a touch flow device such as the
HTC touch this will look familiar to you
they kind of took this from HTC that
shows you where to press on the screen
to get the the kind of 3d cube to show
up so I'm going to take off this screen
cover here and I think you can hear by
the tone of my voice that I'm not
terribly impressed with this device it
kind of looks like an HTC touch but it's
a lot less elegant it feels plasticky
it's got a metallic finish to it that's
kind of blue and sparkly which is which
is kind of nice I like that it's got a
d-pad here that has an interesting it's
very sensitive I don't know if I like
that let's compare it to other devices
to see how it how it shapes up so I just
put it up to the HTC touch and it's a
little bit thicker than the HTC touch
although it has vga screen and has more
features so that kind of makes sense
let's see next to the HTC touch pro it's
actually about the same size a little
bit wider definitely thinner and I like
the flush touch screen that's that's
definitely a plus Eaton's other devices
didn't have a flush touch screen so next
to the 18t tilt
so perhaps I shouldn't judge a book by
it's cover as they say I'm sure the
eating Blowfish has a lot of interesting
tricks that we're going to be testing
over the next few days I can't wait wait
to see this BG a screen and to see the
the TV capability I'm looking for the
antenna I think it may be over here yeah
take a look at this here is the antenna
for the TV yeah so a lot more to come on
the e10 v nine hundred it's not the most
attractive device as you can see but it
is definitely a capable device that
hopefully lives up to to all of its
functionality so a lot more to come on
eat NV 900 if you like what you see
