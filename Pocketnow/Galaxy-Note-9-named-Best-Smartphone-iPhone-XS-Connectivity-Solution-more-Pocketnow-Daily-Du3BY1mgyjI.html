being dubbed as the best smartphone of
2018 Instagram co-founders are both
leaving the company which leaves us to
wonder over its future and for those of
you having connectivity issues on the
new iPhones apparently there is a simple
fix
I'm Jaime Rivera and all jokes aside I I
don't know man this fall this rain it's
just making New York weird and we've got
a crazy season of phones coming up this
is foggy now daily the official news
today are in existence one more time
instead we've got famous tipster Evan
blast showing as what to expect for the
LGB 40 apparently this is an AT&amp;amp;T
variant that doesn't have a carrier logo
which is great I'm glad that LG is
finally doing this and it's also great
that there won't be a variation or at
least I hope because we have the g7 and
then they'll be 35 for AT&amp;amp;T and I don't
know what the case will be but
definitely of three cameras at the back
that's interesting now let's continue
with the batch of rumours of the pixel 3
and pixel 3 Excel we have leaked images
of the possible fast wireless charger it
seems it's a way to stand your phone up
and charge it and this proves that
there's wireless charging coming and
also Google accessories I wonder if it
will be announced at the event I hope
it's a lot faster than everything we
have out there right now because
currently wireless charging isn't that
great now it's one of the spotlight or
to my favorite social media application
that might not be anymore
as a both Instagram co-founders have
just confirmed they're leaving the
company meaning Facebook the owners of
Instagram after 6 years and according to
them they're leaving because it's time
for the next chapter and one of the
major reasons why Instagram has not
become a gossip central like Facebook
has become is mainly because the
co-founders you know stuck to the roots
and they continued making Instagram
great and now I'm really concerned over
the future but we'll see now for those
of you that are having issues with your
iPhone 10s and 10's of Mac's when it
comes to connectivity according to a
certain walk around I mean you could
reset your network settings and like
forever on iPhones apparently that is
the solution that is being reckoned
by people that have figured it out I
haven't tried it on my phone because
it's currently charging because the
battery life is actually not that great
and I presume that has a lot to do with
the terrible Network performance just
like in the case of the iPhone 7 I'll
let you know and finally the most
interesting news today is that we've got
publications already confirming which is
the best smartphone of 2018 and they're
confirming it in late September where we
have devices like the pixels coming up
but yeah we have Consumer Reports
chiming in saying the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 is the best it's got the best
durability the best display the best
editions with the s-pen etc etc they're
literally calling it the best phone of
2018 and well let me know in the
comments what do you think do you think
that this is the best phone of 2018 or
which one would be your favorite in my
case I have to agree with Consumer
Reports in that so far the Galaxy Note 9
is the best phone I just don't know
what's gonna happen when we get devices
like the May 20 Pro and the one plus 60
etc so comparisons are gonna be really
hot going forward leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news early or follow us on pocket

our channels English and Spanish for
