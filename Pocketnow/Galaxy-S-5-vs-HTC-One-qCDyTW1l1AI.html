unpacked event in new york city and
while Anton and hi mayor chickened out
the galaxy s5 as it relates to the
galaxy s4 we thought we'd give you a
quick look at how it compares the HTC
One now we should make the point that
the one is about to be obsoleted by its
immediate sequel but just so that people
who currently carry a one can see
because the new one is probably going to
look a whole lot like this whenever the
leaks are accurate which we think they
are this is how they compare
side-by-side there's that Samsung new
glam look with the textured back don't
let it fool you it is still
polycarbonate but it does feel a lot
better than the hyper glaze just not the
not the aluminum of the HTC One see very
very clear design q differences here
let's take a look at thickness visually
they look roughly on par HTC is using
some tricks as it usually does on the
edges to make the device appear thinner
than it is Samsung engaging in no such
obfuscation just have a look at the
devices side-by-side with power on the
screens this is a 4.7 inch display on
the left hand side and it's slcd 3 of
course 5.1 inch super amoled on the
right so the colors are really popping
we're also running stock Android over
here and this is a good opportunity to
show you just how different TouchWiz
remains from from stock android of
course Samsung hasn't actually used the
term touch waves in a very long time but
it is their custom UI it's just as heavy
as ever but as you can see heavy does
not always have to mean full of lag very
very very responsive even on this demo
unit of course we've been the only ones
to touch this today so we'll have to
spend more time with the galaxy s5 to
see how responsive it is here's that new
multitasking view and similar but not
identical to the stock Android
background on the back side we see the
effects a year have had Samsung's 16
megapixel camera with its new rapid
focus selectable focus after the shot
and so on laying waste on this next
sheet should they 4 megapixel ultrapixel
shooter of the HTC One course real world
design the student real word performance
you have no idea how that's going to go
we certainly have no idea how they will
do how it will do when paired up against
the HTC One the all new HTC One but
we're fairly certain the new HTC One
does not have a heart rate scanner and
so we're going to tentatively give
points to Samsung on that one flipping
back around folks once again just a very
very quick look for those who have not
had a look at the HTC one next to the
galaxy s5 that's what we're playing with
and more coming from
york michael fisher with adam lane
behind the camera stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
