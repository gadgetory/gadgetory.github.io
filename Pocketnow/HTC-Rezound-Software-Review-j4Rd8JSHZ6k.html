nada calm and this is the software
review of the HTC Rezound with Beats
Audio for verizon so let's get to it the
HTC Rezound is running Android 2.3
Gingerbread along with sense 3.5 so here
we can maybe sense interface that HTC
has created and we have some pretty neat
integrations with some of the widgets
and whatnot so if we go back to our home
we can also go through some of the
widgets let me just a tap and hold we
can go to some of the widgets here so we
can do all the HTC widgets and we can
even download other ones we have
bookmarks and all these other widgets to
choose from footprints which allows you
to geotag your photos and all the other
great stuff so we can of course have
some of these widgets so we can just go
back home and if i double tap the home
button again i can rearrange my home
screens and also add and delete number
of screens here it looks these or just
got a message so if i go into the
applications we can use some of the
software that comes standard on the HTC
Rezound and it does include a quite a
bit of proprietary software from verizon
we have amazon kindle which we probably
all seen before we have backup assistant
which worked with verizon we can back up
somewhere information let's go back we
have the blockbuster app which allows
you to download and view movies directly
on your HTC Rezound we have google books
very calculator with a sense user
interface change here so we just go back
home and let's see we have the calendar
the camera the cameras works okay it's
not the best camera in the world one
thing about HTC cameras is the colors
change if you can see this right now I'm
just taking a picture of a white
background there you can see it on here
and it looks kind of pink so the colors
are a little distorted on the camera so
will you can view with the rest of the
photos on the final review coming up
next let's see we have our download
information or downloads here let's just
go back we have facebook footprints a
friend stream which allows you to stream
facebook and twitter messages directly
on your resound so we just go back we
have a couple of full version games we
have hot pursuit and let's golf too and
we probably all seen those before so
we'll just skip through those
we have our mail so this is where you
can set up a different mail account with
any one of these services here so we
just go back if you have mobile
tethering you can use the mobile hotspot
and we can just click ok and then we can
set up our mobile hotspot and this is a
4G device it does run pretty quickly on
a rather strong connection if you're
able to access the 4g at network speeds
we have my verizon mobile which allows
you to view some of your information
back up directly to the verizon account
so you can view some of your information
on here we have NFL mobile which allows
you to get some of the NFL information
so we just click agree here and you will
need to have access through the verizon
my profile or whatever Polaris Office is
a full office application which allows
you to view and create documents and
office projects from your HTC Rezound so
I can create a document or an Excel
workbook so let us click cancel and just
go back we have scan which is a QR code
scanner and it's kind of odd that they
put one on a device and there's so many
different apps that you can i download
directly from the android market leave
our settings are setup assistant we have
slacker radio which is an internet
streaming radio application just some
other apps that i put on here we have
let's see task manager which works
pretty well so we can view all the
active tasks and we can kill them off
we'd like so we just go back V CAST
music allows you to download music
directly from the verizon service we
also can download videos with me cast
and videos video surf we have visual
voicemail we have voice recorder voice
search the Google service we also have a
verizon's navigator which is a paid for
service and we also have the watch
application which allows you to download
and view movies directly from your
resound one other interesting thing is
we can rearrange these by going here
let's say I want to view all my frequent
applications I can also view all of my
downloaded applications that i've
downloaded myself or updated and one
annoying tab is that we have verizon
wireless so this gives us some of the
verizon wireless proprietary
applications if we want to find those
really quickly so we can go through some
of the live wallpapers that are included
on this device so we can go to the live
wallpapers that the HTC Rezound comes
with so we can add view some slide shows
and some other graphics that we've seen
other HTC and android devices in the
past so there's nothing to phenomenal it
looks as though they're all pretty
generic we don't get anything too
special now even though that the HTC
Rezound does come with the Beats Audio
headset one interesting thing that is
lacking is an FM player even though this
device is able to access the FM radio
stations so we don't have an FM player
even in the music application it only
plays the music that's stored internally
or on the SD card so this has been a
software review of the HTC Rezound and
if you like our videos make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below stay tuned for the
final review coming up next and in case
you missed it you can check out the
hardware review video right here i'll
post a link and i'll also post a link to
the unboxing video right about here
