my last video i showed you the IMDb app
for android not because i like IMDB
particularly but because of the app
because of the way it was designed in
the way that it worked the way that it
was logical and the way that it just
flowed through all of the information
let's face it IMDb has a lot of
information to present to you well in
this video what I'd like to do is carry
on that same theme and show you another
app that does things just really really
well this one's the USA Today app again
not a fan of the content itself but the
app really bears showing to you so let's
go take a look ok this is the USA Today
app and as you can see it carries over
from the IMDb app the multi navigation
model if you will we've got tabs across
the top four headlines scores weather
pictures and snapshots down underneath
that we have categories under an
information bar this information bars
where the branding takes place USA Today
here on the IMDb app that was up at the
top and kind of eating up screen real
estate I mean let's face it these
screens are small enough already so
efficient use of that space is great
you'll notice when I go over here to
scores I still have this USA Today brand
but I have scores right next to it on
whether at USA Today whether so I'm
utilizing more of this bar but I'm still
carrying my branding across so that's a
very good thing in my opinion of course
if you your opinion varies leave
comments to this video and to this
article to let not only myself but
Android app developers know so that they
can build better and more user friendly
apps apps in a more elegant and just
function intuitively and well so that's
it back to the app here let's go over to
top news we go into top news and you'll
notice that the color coding of this bar
underneath changed top news is kind of a
dark navy blue news is a lighter blue
money is green I wonder why that is
sports is red life is
kind of a burgundy so each one of these
sections is color-coded very nice to
know at a glance you can tell exactly
where you are at a tap now you can go
right into the article and then you've
got your typical scrolling which is very
good go back and you can scroll up and
down so really nice to get there let's
go over to weather and I'll show you
what I like here right now I'm in the
national weather maps i can scroll this
down and see my current location with
the forecast very nicely animated very
easy to scroll and this has one more
navigation technique I guess is the best
word for it that I'd like to show you
we're looking at new york's weather but
you see these three little dots down
here i can scroll over and the dots
change position so i know what screen
i'm on I know where I am in relation to
the other data so i can go through my
tabs i can go through my sub menus I can
go through my slider or my accordion
panels and I can even go side to side
and it's all very intuitive and very
quick and very fluid I'm not a fan of
USA Today the newspaper but I really am
a fan of this app but I'd like to know
your opinion what do you think did they
do a good job do you like how it looks
does it function well I'm isn't
intuitive to you developers do you think
that you could do something like this in
your app if you've got an app out there
or if you don't yet and you've watched
this video and think you can improve
your app or can improve what your app
would have been based on the information
included here we would love to see what
you've done before and after screenshots
would be great or if you can even reply
with a video showing the old version of
your app and the new version after
you've taken these UI elements to heart
then built them into your app we'd love
to see that kind of stuff I'm going to
request that everybody viewing this
comment on this video about what they
like and don't like about current
android apps this one in particular so
that you developers can take that
message from your user base to heart and
build better apps because the better
your app is the more likely it is we're
going to download it and keep it on our
phones the more likely we are to spend
to buy that app and the more likely we
are to tap on ads inside that app so
it's a win-win for everybody so that
having been said if you like this video
and would like to see more give it a
thumbs up if you like this type of video
or into smartphones that all subscribe
to our channel then if you want to
contribute to the conversation rather
than just be a casual observer please
comment below so again for pocketnow.com
