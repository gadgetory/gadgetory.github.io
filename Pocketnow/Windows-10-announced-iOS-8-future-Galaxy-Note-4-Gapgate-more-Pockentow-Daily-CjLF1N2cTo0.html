platform to rule them all evidence
begins to emerge on what to expect for
iOS 8 in the future and Samsung responds
to gap gate on the node foreign says
it's all right I'm hi Mary meta and make
sure you reserve that credit card holder
that you always wanted which can also
make phone calls this is parking out
daily let's begin today with what's
official as Samsung has already
responded to the claims of gap gate we
talked about it yesterday you know how
the glass and the aluminum are so
separated on some Galaxy Note 4 units
that you can actually stand a credit
card between them and according to
Sampson this does not affect the
functionality of the galaxy note 4 in
any way and this does not show any sort
of bad manufacturing processes from the
company and said sexually but sort of
what they said which makes me wonder if
you agree with that because I certainly
do now let's talk about Apple and
specifically iOS 8.1 beta was just got
seeded to developers we still don't have
any details on what we're getting here
but the one we do know is that it does
bring support for touch ID on the iPad
making the rumors of an iPad being
launched in october with touch ID to be
more credible but in addition to that we
hear about iOS 8.2 and 8.3 and it seems
that where we're getting here support
for apple pay which is great and we also
seem to be getting split screen options
for the ipad as well on either one of
these updates in addition to support for
the Apple watch this should happen later
this year let's see what we get let's
move the spotlight over to HTC and
specifically the HTC One max we should
be getting this phone soon as we already
have the mini and the regular iterations
of the One m8 and apparently one of the
coolest features of this phone is that
it won't be so big force claim that it
won't be a 5.9 inch display phone this
time we're getting a 5.5 inch display
phone fully we get a better fingerprint
scanner and better options let's see
what HTC brings to the table hopefully
in October now let's talk about Google's
future Nexus smartphone we've been w at
the Nexus 6 though we're still not sure
that's the name we get more rumors that
the previous name that we talked about
nexus X because of its similarity to the
Moto X are probably not going to happen
apparently it will be called a nexus 6
because the 5.9 inch display this match
this though we do believe that this will
just be a big
moto X not sure we're getting to
smartphones a moto x and a bigger
chassis and the next is extra Nexus 6
but the timing tell and finally for the
very hot news of the day we get Windows
10 announced by Microsoft today no not
windows 9 Windows 10 which makes you
wonder since we're currently on OS 10
and what even makes it more interesting
is the fact that this is one platform to
rule them all one store one platform to
work on every form factor meaning that
your computer your tablet and your
smartphone would be running Windows 10
which reminds me of the iphone launch
remember iphone runs OS 10 there are so
many similarities here between Apple and
Microsoft right now but there are some
significant changes Windows 10 starting
with the fact that you get the old you I
mixed with the new UI meaning you do get
the Metro tiles but these are part of
the UI you don't get a separate UI which
is amazing this is great there's
probably believe Microsoft should have
done it from the beginning in addition
to the fact that these you eyes will be
ported to tablets and will be ported to
phones in addition to the store as well
there is so much to expect from Windows
10 starting with the timeline we don't
really know when we're getting it since
Microsoft is terrible on this but news
are still developing at the time of the
recording of this video Microsoft was
still announcing it so let's see what
Stephen discovers in the future with
more news to come but that leads me to
the question of the day what do you
think about Windows 10 do you think that
Microsoft is going in the right
direction because in my case I do
believe so I do believe that I do like
what I see with Windows 10 but leave us
a comment down below what are your
thoughts friends you know the drill if
he wanted it was earlier before this
video is photo shoot follow us on
talking out our common structure channel
as well it also follow me on Twitter
hina underscore any better please give
this video thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am high metal you better thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
