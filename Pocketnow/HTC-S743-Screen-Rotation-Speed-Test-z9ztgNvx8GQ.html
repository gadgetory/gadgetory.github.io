pocket now calm and this is a screen
rotation speed test of the HTC s 743
compared to the HTC touch pro and the
sony ericsson xperia x1 now i'm doing
this test because if you remember in the
early days of windows mobile devices
like the titan and the titan to the
screens would rotate way too slowly so
you slide open the keyboard but by the
time that you got to the keyboard open
the screen hadn't finished rotating yet
and it would be really annoying would
slow you down things like that these
newer devices have faster screen
rotations thankfully but there's still
not instant so let's see how the s7 43
non-touchscreen device compares to these
two devices in screen rotation and let's
start with the touch pro now we both
have we have both of these devices set
on the program's menu so it's kind of on
an even keel here and let's see what we
can do ok touch pro is faster there
touch pro faster touch pro is definitely
faster than the s7 43 let's take a look
at how it compares to the xperia x1
xperia x1 is definitely faster than the
s7 43 this is actually one of the
complaints that i had with the s7 43 is
its screen rotation speed if you check
out the review on pocket now calm i
mention this it's not that slow but it's
about a second too slow to the point
where when you're over to the keyboard
the screen hasn't finished rotating yet
and you really can't do anything so
that's it for the screen rotation speed
test on the htcs 743 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
