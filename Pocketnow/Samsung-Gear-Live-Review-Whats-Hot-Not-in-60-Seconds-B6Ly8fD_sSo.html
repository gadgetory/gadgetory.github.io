Samsung gear live is much more than just
a rebuilt gear - the question is is it
the Android wear watch you want to buy
the answer ahead in pocket now is 60
second SmartWatch review starting right
now so here's the hot with subtle metal
accents and a classic yet
water-resistant design there are
definitely uglier smartwatches on the
market than the gear live and it's Super
AMOLED display as one of the sharpest
you can find it supports all kinds of
notifications already has some great
third-party apps of all stripes and you
can talk to it to control your
smartphone without even taking it out of
your pocket but don't try to do too much
with it Android wear is definitely a
first generation product with pronounced
shortcomings like speech dictation
issues and an unintuitive interface that
can be frustrating to navigate plus the
battery lasts only a day or so between
charges the display isn't easily seen in
sunlight and some reports indicate that
Samsung's charger
breaks easily the Samsung gear live is a
good looking device that can do much
more than most other smartwatches but in
a still nascent field that's not saying
much
and Android wear will need to take some
big strides before we can earnestly
recommend it at least on this hardware
for more time and more detail on the
Samsung gear live check out our full
video review of this device here on
