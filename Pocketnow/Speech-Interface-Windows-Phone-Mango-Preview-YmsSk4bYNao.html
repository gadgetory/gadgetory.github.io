pocketnow.com and we are going to take a
quick look well maybe a closer look at
the speech interface on windows phone
mango let's check it out first off one
of the really good changes for windows
on mangoes that you can now use the
speech interface with a Bluetooth
headset previously you could only use
the call command with Bluetooth all the
other commands you had to do through the
speaker through the microphone on the
device so that was kind of pain so here
it is you hold down the start button and
the first time you do it you're going to
get this little help window this is what
can I say subsequent ones will go
straight to the listening mode so this
is just a quick little hint as to what
kind of commands you can use here so
let's try open open table starting open
table so that's a app launching
interface let's go back and there's a
little ? here this will give you more
information about what you can say so
here's the call command you can do all
this call voicemail redial is good
command to have and also nice thing is
call Alex on speakerphone so you can go
straight to speakerphone if you want
there here's fine this is going to do
bean searches so we can try that open
will open different types of apps on
your phone so you can just say the name
of the app open such and such and even
go to settings the text command is
really good so this is something you can
really easily do from your bluetooth
headset if you want to text somebody
here's some more options
while you're on a call you can call
another person or press numbers the
other cool features are saving speed
dial and turn call forwarding on and off
so let's try a couple of these find find
what you're looking for with Bing try
saying find coffee in Seattle if you
want to write to his area I got another
phone over here so let's use some
interactive speech interface stuff here
text Adam
Adam for some point or Adam lean Adam
lean texting not only say your message
how are you doing how are you doing you
can say send more try again send
so that should send a text message to
the other phone message from 14 0 42 190
979 you can say read it or ignore read
it how are you doing you can say reply
call or I'm done call calling and 14 0
for 2 19 09 79 now we'll be able to hear
the caller ID so it's telling me who's
calling it's pretty nice so there's our
Colin texting with no hands hands-free
completely there the messaging also
works if you're receiving instant
messages from facebook or windows live
messenger so those will show up the same
way and ask you if you want to read them
so that's pretty nice let's show a
couple other features find it wither
searching for weather
and there's our weather that's pretty
good find movies searching for movies
there we go straight to the movies
pretty good but it doesn't actually tell
me doesn't talk back and tell me what
the movies are one that so there are
still a few things missing from the
speech interface we don't have any way
to set a destination in the maps program
for navigation we don't have any way to
control the media player like we did
back in Windows Mobile 2003 or it could
save play stones oh and the music will
start playing so there's other things
missing is the calendar integration I
can tax ask it what my next appointment
is that feature is still not there again
something when does mobile 2003 could do
but the instant messaging one is really
nice so they're trying to make up for it
anyway that's a good look at your speech
interface on windows phone mango pretty
nice hope you enjoyed this video give us
a thumbs up if you did that's it for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
