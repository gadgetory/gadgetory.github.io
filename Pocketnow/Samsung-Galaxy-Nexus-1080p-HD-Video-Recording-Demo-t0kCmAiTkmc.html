and i'm showing off the 1080p recording
capabilities of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
the GSM hspa+ version so again we find
ourselves out in my front yard showing
off some flowers we do flowers for those
of you who don't know because they are
fairly high detail and fairly high
contrast so you can kind of see some of
the capabilities of the camera now I
mentioned that this is 1080p the default
on the camera is 720p so you can just go
in and increase the resolution there so
there's some details here on this little
tree we've got out there so overall
pretty good the the image is fairly
stable from what I'm looking at there's
no image stabilization feature like
we've seen with the droid razr and
hopefully we won't have any problems
with that it's a little bit of a cloudy
day today so we've got overcast let's
come on out and get some motion going on
look up there at the the mountains now
I'm not doing anything on the phone I'm
not touching the screen to focus i'm
just showing everything will do some
quick motion side to side here see how
that works overall I'm pretty impressed
of course now we're turning this over to
you it is your turn to do homework that
homework is let us know in the comments
down below what you thought of the video
quality the picture quality I if it was
blurry if you notice anything that you
didn't like and of course the audio
quality as well it had good audio or not
again holding this about 10 inches away
from my face and just recording audio
straight like that so let us know your
thoughts in the comments if you like
seeing these demonstration videos I
guess is the best word for it please
give us a big thumbs up and let us know
that you like that and want to continue
to see them for the rest of the videos
about the unboxing first boot and
whatnot of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus you
don't want to make sure that you
subscribe to the video channel so you
don't miss out on those four pocket no
showing off the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus 1080p HD recording
capabilities I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
