different tablet in my hands but no it's
not an Apple tablet and I can tell you
it looks as good as an Apple tablet I'm
Anthony Knight
I'm a behind the camera this is
PocketNow and we are looking at the
Nokia and one
so this tablet has been basically
launched at the end of last year but we
have just now gotten the opportunity for
a hands-on and we are glad because this
is one hell of a tablet from the
internals the software and the bill then
let's start with the bill looking around
the tablet itself it is pure aluminium
and glass and you can feel the
sturdiness and also the premium quality
and finish of the materials yes does it
look like an Apple iPad absolutely but
there are just so many ways you can
build a tablet where else can you put
the camera maybe you can put it on the
other side but the key takeaway here and
not yet stressed this is the quality of
the materials and the finish from the
centering of the ports and of the holes
to the precision drilled holes
everything speaks premium about it
except for the price tag it's on sale
for about 250 dollars in China and it
will eventually come to the US and
Europe but there are no specific plans
being shared with us at the moment quick
rundown of specs we are looking at a 7.9
inch screen with a so-called quote
retina resolution of 2048 by 1536
underneath the glass we've got an Intel
processor and Atom processor which is a
quad-core cpu running at 243 gigahertz
two gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of storage
front-facing camera is one of five
megapixels and turning it towards the
back we've got an 8 megapixel shooter
put out the flash because you barely
need the flash when you're shooting
pictures with your tablet if you still
do that now the main takeaway of this
tablet software wise is that it's
running Android 5.0 lollipop with
Nokia's own z launcher on top of it and
what's really cool about the Nokia Z
launcher is that it learns from you it
learns from your use it scenarios so for
instance if you are used to checking
your Facebook in the morning and sending
emails in the evening the Z launcher
will make sure that your Facebook icon
is right there in the morning whenever
you usually use it and your email
application is
in the evening if it's not there you can
always scribble search for instance s
for applications which start with s or
you can just go for a and it will
instantly recognize and filter the
search searches through your contact
searches through your applications it
doesn't go as deep as emails it just
brings you the most commonly search for
things right underneath your fingertips
if you don't want a scribble search you
can always go to the app tray swipe to
your right from this part right here and
this is where all your as the old
applications are residing including the
shortcut for your settings and since
we're here we can go inside and see how
close this doc this is let's go into the
about tablet and there we go it's 5.0
point 2 so it's the latest version of
Android and it's running on a tablet out
of the box we're waiting for us tablet
to hit our labs as soon as possible we
can't promise you an ETA because we are
really trying hard to get this one we
like it and you know what forget about
the fact that it looks like an iPad it
looks more like an iPhone 6 and we're
not kidding this has been Anton Dina
you've been watching with Heine behind a
camera a quick look at the show floor in
barcelona of the nokia and one sabbath
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up thank you very much for
watching until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
