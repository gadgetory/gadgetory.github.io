pocketnow.com and this is a video
showing the new ROM for the samsung
omnia the j1 rom to be exact before we
showed the g4 ROM which had some
improvements but I think the j1 ROM adds
a lot of things that we really missed so
let me show you those now
in terms of widgets we have one new
widget which is the profile widget so
quite simply from here you can turn on
vibrate turns sound off volume on
unfortunately we still don't have the
really useful widgets that we want like
stocks a next appointment and everything
like that let's go into the Start menu
and take a look at that settings and
take a look at something ok finally we
flicked scrolling on the Samsung omnia
which is really important because the
omnia doesn't even have a stylus that
comes on the device so if we flick our
finger we get the iPhone kind of like
flick scrolling and it makes a little
ticking sound the scrolling is pretty
good it's not perfect but it's it's
definitely a welcomed addition that we
really missed in in previous updates of
the omnia something else that has been
added or actually put back is the
vibration feedback in the keyboard so
I'm going to open up word mobile and
obviously you can't see this but every
time I tap on a key now I get a little
bit of a buzz which is good because it
really helps you know when you've hit a
key all right let's go to the settings
now I'm going to show you what they did
with screen rotation so if we go to
system and motion sensor of course the
omnia has a built-in accelerometer so if
you rotate to the the device it will
rotate the screen anywhere in the
operating system not just Opera Mobile
or photos like some other HTC devices
and what they've added in this rom is
the ability to change the animation the
rotation animation and we get a lot of
choices here so if I change it to twist
let's see what that looks like pretty
cool right get a little twist there and
let's see what else we have twist
let's do super spin
okay so that one's way too busy for most
people it'll probably make you a little
seasick but let's see what zoom in out
one looks like yeah that's a good one to
have it's nice and quick and it's nice
and easy its pleasant on the eyes and
yet it doesn't make you dizzy so that's
it for the update on the Samsung omnia
ROM j-1 be sure to check out that
download if you have the omnia or if
you're buying me omnia make sure your
device has the j1 ROM because it adds
some things that are much needed in the
omnia so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
