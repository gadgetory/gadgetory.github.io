fully-featured keyboard accessory for
Nokia's Lumia 2520 the company's
official power keyboard is finally here
it brings solid build quality and more
utility to Nokia's Windows RT tablet but
is it worth the hundred and fifty dollar
premium over the tablets base price
let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our video review of the nokia
power keyboard for the Lumia 2520 the
first thing you'll probably notice about
the power keyboard when you take it out
of the box is how beefy the hardware is
the 2520 isn't a slight tablet at 615
grams and the power keyboard almost
doubles that mass if you're used to
toting ultrabooks or naked tablets
carrying the 2520 with the keyboard
attachment is likely to feel far more
substantial but there's a few reasons
for the casings extra bulk a 15 watt
hour battery hides under the soft touch
material providing the tablet with a
power reserve windows will pull power
from the case battery first switching to
the tablets onboard power only once the
keyboard is depleted over our four day
test period we found the added power
kept us working for more than a full day
of even heavy use it's very very handy
the case also features a pair of USB 2.0
ports making up for the 25 20 s lack of
a built in option and allowing for
everything from jump drive transfers to
wired mouse usage to charging and
syncing a smart phone what about the
keyboard portion of the power keyboard
well in short it's excellent once you
get used to the condensed spacing typing
is a pleasure thanks to the surprisingly
deep travel and solid mechanical
response of the keys and shortcuts for
everything from screen brightness to
volume to the various edge gestures
means you can manipulate windows pretty
easily using just the keyboard in fact
we use the power keyboard to write the
script for this video the trackpad is
built into the casing beneath the space
bar on the portion of the keyboard that
magnetically snaps shut when closed as a
result the trackpads a little further
away from the keys than we would like
and it's also a smallish trackpad with
even smaller button areas making it
to use on the whole it would also be
nice if the keyboard folded in a manner
that allowed you to use it in anything
other than desktop configuration like
the surface does with its touch and type
covers and speaking of the surface if
Microsoft could squeeze a backlight into
its new generation touch cover we're
sure nokia could have managed it with
the power keyboard especially given the
extra battery power here since Nokia
chose not to do that though this is not
a great solution for typing in the dark
despite these shortcomings we think the
power keyboard is a very compelling
accessory road warriors will appreciate
the solid magnetic lock-in and the added
battery power while those who want to
protect their tablets without
sacrificing aesthetics will find a lot
to like in the power keyboards Stark
boardroom looks at 149 it's definitely
on the pricey side but for anyone
looking to maximize the potential of the
Lumia 2520 we'd say it's money well
spent
