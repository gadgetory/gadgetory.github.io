have no practical use by today's
standards other than a piece of
nostalgia for yesteryear fortunately
Android is more resilient than that I'm
Joel evite for pocket now this is going
hands-on with the t-mobile g1 and
putting to rest once and for all android
fragmentation really doesn't matter one
of the things we use our handheld
devices for social networking as you can
see here facebook works although the
layout is somewhat different the speed
isn't all that great and it's a little
bit different of a user experience in
what you've come to recognize and expect
if you're looking for a Twitter client
you're not going to find one there is no
official Twitter client that supports
android 1.6 however HootSuite is
available and it consumes both Facebook
and Twitter information if you're
looking for other social networks
Google+ is missing as is Pinterest and
Instagram as well however some of the
others like Instagram have some more
generic third-party versions that will
you tie into their service if you're
looking for a note-taking app you can
give up your Google keep but Evernote
Evernote works just fine of course what
a smartphone is really for is making
phone calls so as you can see the dialer
looks a little bit old but it's still
the dialer it still works it still
functions it still makes and receives
phone calls very very well of course you
also have your contacts you have text
messaging you have calendar you've got
all the stuff that you need and all of
that works today the same as it did way
back when this was introduced so there
you go we took a look at some of the
things that you could and some of the
things you couldn't do with your HTC
dream or t-mobile g1 as you can tell
there are a lot of things that you can
still do even though it's android 1.6
even though it is a very very low
powered device as far as specifications
go that'll do it for now thanks very
much for watching if you like what you
saw please give the video a thumbs up
and share it with your friends on all
social networks we're there we'd love to
see you there 24 pocket now showing off
nostalgic devices like the HTC g1 I'm
Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
