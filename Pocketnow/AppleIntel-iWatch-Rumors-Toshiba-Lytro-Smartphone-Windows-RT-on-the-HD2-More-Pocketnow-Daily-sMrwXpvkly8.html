a watch if she were working on bringing
a hydro technology to mobile cameras and
wait what windows are tools put it to
the HTC hd2 I might never be better and
just like Bruce Willis there aren't just
some phones that die hard this is
PocketNow daily that's right the new
batch of rumors have Apple working on an
iWatch which comes in a sense of ironies
since they pretty much ditched the only
ipod that could actually ever be one as
a watch now the interesting part of
these news is when you add Intel into
the mix because well you really know
that their mobile processors have really
not shined at all but you never know
what can happen when you join these two
companies together to see what they can
come up with so we'll keep you posted
now when it comes to some real
innovation so Sheba seems to be working
on bringing Lytro technology to mobile
phone cameras and for those of you that
don't know the light roll camera is
famous for allowing you to take a photo
right now and eventually coming back to
the photograph in the future and
selectively focusing different parts of
the shot and making as many copies of
that photograph as you want with
different focus points it's really
genius the low-light roll captain hasn't
really been important in the market just
yet but just think about it think about
your smartphone camera taking a photo
now and then wanting to focus on
something different in the future I
think it's kind of genius let's see if
it happens eventually yes we've got some
more rumors of the Sony Odin and Sony
Yuga devices with some photographs of
the devices side-by-side now if you look
at the photograph one looks pretty much
bigger than the other but they're
actually the same phone with the same
specs including a 1080p display and
apparently the only difference is that
these devices will be launched at
different markets now Sony has run out
of the alphabet and we are hoping that
they come up with something good this
time apparently these devices will be
launched to CES 2013 and we will be
there alive to cover everything so stay
tuned and as I started the show it is
true there are some devices that are
just hard to kill such as the case of
the HTC hd2 that's been ported to run
everything but I OS even though I'm sure
there's somebody out there that's
already figured that one out
it's now being shown in images running
Windows RT just think about it a device
that's older than
a new tablet operating system and that
begs the question I mean how many of you
are actually still using an HTC hd2 I
think that's the hardest part of the
news and finally for the usual news of
the day Google has just announced their
top number one applications of the year
in the Google Play Store and ironically
some of these applications weren't
really 2012 applications but still most
likely chosen because of how popular
they are so just the case of Evernote
pocket and other applications the list
is quite big so follow the links in the
description for details but that leads
me to the question of the day if you had
to pick just one application from the
Google Play Store just one which would
be your favorite application the ones
you love the most in my particular case
Swift key 3 is worth every single penny
I would buy it twice if I had to leave
us a comment down below which is your
favorite application and if you want an
Ellie or scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
well make sure you follow us on
our comm please give this video a thumbs
up if you like what you saw I'm high
memory better thanks for watching see
you tomorrow
for a computer are pretty much a tablet
if you could have sit there a little bit
more alright
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
