watch so she were working on bringing a
hydro technology to mobile cameras and
wait what windows are two is put it to
the HTC hd2 I'm hi Mary vetta and just
like Bruce Willis there aren't just some
phones that die hard this is poking out
daily that's right the new batch of
rumors have apple working on an iWatch
which comes in a sense of irony since
they pretty much ditch the only ipod
that could actually ever be one as a
watch now the interesting part of these
news is when you add Intel into the mix
because well you really know that their
mobile processors have really not shined
at all but you never know what can
happen when you join these two companies
together to see what they can come up
with so we'll keep you posted now when
it comes to some real innovation so
Sheba seems to be working on bringing
lytro technology to mobile phone cameras
and for those of you that don't know the
Lytro camera is famous for allowing you
to take a photo right now and eventually
coming back to the photograph in the
future and selectively focusing
different parts of the shot and making
as many copies of that photograph as you
want with different focus points it's
really genius though electrochem hasn't
really been important in the market just
yet but just think about it think about
your smartphone camera taking a photo
now and then wanting to focus on
something different in the future I
think it's kind of genius let's see if
it happens eventually yes we've got some
more rumors of the Sony Odin and Sony
yuga devices with some photographs of
the devices side by side now if you look
at the photograph one looks pretty much
bigger than the other but they're
actually the same phone with the same
specs including a 1080p display and
apparently the only difference is that
these devices will be launched at
different markets now sony has run out
of the alphabet and we are hoping that
they come up with something good this
time apparently these devices will be
launched to CES 2013 and we will be
there live to cover everything so stay
tuned and as I started the show it is
true there are some devices that are
just hard to kill such as the case of
the HTC hd2 that's been ported to run
everything but iOS even though I'm sure
there's somebody out there that's
already figured that one out it's now
being shown in images running Windows RT
just think about it a device that's
older than
running a new tablet operating system
and that begs the question I mean how
many of you are actually still using an
HTC hd2 I think that's the hardest part
of the news and finally for the usual
news of the day google has just
announced their top number one
applications of the year in the Google
Play Store and ironically some of these
applications weren't really 2012
applications but still most likely
chosen because of how popular they are
so just the case I've ever known pocket
and other applications the list is quite
big so follow links in the description
for details but that leads me to the
question of the day if you had to pick
just one application from the google
play store just one which would be your
favorite application the ones you love
the most in my particular case swiftkey
3 is worth every single penny I would
buy it twice if I had to leave us a
comment down below which is your
favorite application and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
well make sure you follow was on
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
better thanks for watching see you
tomorrow
for a computer are pretty much a tablet
if you could sit there a little bit more
all right
