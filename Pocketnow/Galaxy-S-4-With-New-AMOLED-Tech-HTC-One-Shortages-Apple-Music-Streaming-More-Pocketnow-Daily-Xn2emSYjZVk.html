display technology HTC One shortages are
predicted on launch day and Apple wants
to pay half as much for competing
against Pandora I'm hina iveta and
repeat after me thank God it's Friday
this is pocket out daily so one of the
greatest things about galaxy s products
is their Super AMOLED technology which
is actually made by samsung and what it
does is actually bring deep blacks on
this place because this is actually
pixels that are being turned off
dynamically on the man as you move
around the display it's really cool
technology but apparently Samsung is
completely changing the game with the
galaxy s4 we've got teasers of well
they're working on apparently new ways
to power this display in order to become
even more power efficient than the Super
AMOLED that we already know but there's
a lot of technical jargon I'm not going
to go into so make sure you hit the
links in the description for the full
details on what's going on and speaking
of Samsung new rumors have a company and
even Apple working on wireless
technology for their next smartphones
and just remember this in the case of
Apple it is not going to happen they're
so stuck up in their design language
that they will not deter the purity of
their next-generation iphone with
wireless charging but in the case of
Samsung it does make all the sense in
the world sammy's actually weird it's
weird that this company has been pretty
much the last one to adopt it even
though Michael Fisher taught us how to
get wireless charging on the galaxy s4
it would be cool to get this out of the
box so stay tuned we will keep you
posted on March 14th let's continue
talking about Apple for those of you
that remember Apple is actually working
on a streaming service to compete with
Pandora in order to bring you music that
you don't necessarily have to buy you
buy a subscription service and that's it
but for those of you that don't know how
this math works well pandora pays for
everyone under songs that you stream
they pay twelve cents the record labels
but apparently apple says that it's too
much money they want to pay half as that
they want to pay only six cents for
every 100 songs that are streamed and
for those of you that wonder why Apple
would want to do this well it doesn't
make sense for them to get a special
treatment this company pretty much saved
the record labels and the times of
Napster back when the ipod was launched
but still i mean go to fifty percent
let's hope that apple brings their
service soon but you know the way things
work
usually happens by the fall with their
music events so stay tuned now it's
clear that every single one of us in the
tech world is skeptical about that
ultrapixel camera on the HTC One and the
reason why is because for mega pixels is
4 megapixels I mean what's the point of
something special there but we have news
that'll make you even hate it more the
reason why is because apparently HTC
will run into some shortages on launch
day and not being able to meet the man's
with the HTC One because apparently the
new ultrapixel camera is a problem to
manufacture and what will keep you
posted on how that goes whenever the
device is launched we still don't have a
clear saying on what this will be but we
have seen some photos of this
magnificent ultrapixel camera and it's
not that great and finally for the
annoying news of the day AT&amp;amp;T apparently
doesn't really get why we want to unlock
phones we know that the White House is
working on the wireless freedom act but
AT&amp;amp;T has just published a statement that
says that it's really not necessary for
you to unlock your phone because well
you can just ask nicely after a couple
of days in a TMT and you can get your
phone unlocked but obviously you have to
be on a contract and AT&amp;amp;T that's really
not the reason why we want to unlock a
phone we want to unlock it because you
probably have a cool phone that we want
on t-mobile or that we want overseas so
that leads you to the question of the
day will you ever unlock a phone to stay
on AT&amp;amp;T you know unlocking phones is not
free so obviously would you ever pay for
cash in order to continue using that
same phone on the same service well
leave us a comment down below in my
particular case I want to unlock phones
to use them outside the United States so
leave us a comment of course as always
if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tell the world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com and
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary Lana
