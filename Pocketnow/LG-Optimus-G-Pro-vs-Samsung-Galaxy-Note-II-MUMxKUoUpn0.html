now Michael behind the camera and today
we're comparing the LG optimus g pro
with the samsung galaxy note 2 probably
close competitors in the future we have
5.5 inch displays both our left and the
right but the LG optimus g pro features
a 1080p display versus the 720p display
in the samsung galaxy note now in terms
of raw horsepower the LG optimus g pro
features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
quad-core processor clocking in at 1.7
gigahertz well we have a Exynos
processor quad-core still running at one
point six on the samsung galaxy note now
another difference between those is the
camera which i'll flip to the back
you'll see a 13 megapixel camera with
the LG optimus g pro but only an 8
megapixel camera on the samsung galaxy
note 2 but however the note 2 has an
edge it has the s pen which is right
here on the LG optimus g pro you will
have to use your finger as the pen once
you activate humano and you write on the
screen arrays and just go nuts with
taking notes now in terms of build
quality both of these feel the same in
the hand they are plastic both obviously
we have a brushed aluminum type of
finish on the Galaxy Note 2 we have the
same plastic it feels like the hyper
blaze plastic of course hyper glazing is
exam something but they feel exactly the
same in the hand we have the nexus or
like squares here going in the
background and in terms of donuts you
can see that they're approximately the
same as we've quite exactly the same
height I'm going to be cool just going
to turn them to their side so you can
see that they are exactly the same
thickness do however the Galaxy Note 2
is this much wider than the Samsung then
the I'm sorry LG optimus g pro which
accounts for approximately two to three
millimeters launching now let's take a
look at a couple of software differences
so while on the LG optimus g pro you can
basically activate the cuse live feature
to have several applications on top of
each other it's basically this one on
top of a layer on the background the
Galaxy Note 2 has multi window support
which is
I believe a little bit cooler because
you can drag to different applications
and have it split display it's on the
same display size between any two
applications inch are supported the Q my
slide feature on the lg optimus G only
supports the couple of applications like
the included messaging applications
email applications internet calculator
and so on so another difference is that
the samsung galaxy note 2 has a
removable battery right here the optimus
g pro well you can peel the cover off to
access the back to insert the microSD
card you cannot remove the battery
however the battery is 130 140 million
powers it's let's say the same as the
one on the Galaxy Note 2 so it will
basically come down to the fact that the
video welcome processor might or might
not be more power efficient than
Samsung's Exynos processor so this was a
quick look at the samsung galaxy note 2
versus the LG optimus g pro i'm anton
front pocket now we have micro behind
the camera thank you very much for
watching and stay tuned for more
coverage from barcelona mwc 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
