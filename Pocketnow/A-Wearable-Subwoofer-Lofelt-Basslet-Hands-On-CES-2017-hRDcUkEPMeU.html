we playing with today because you guys
sent us a little information but I
actually wanted to be surprised wild and
amazed viable you have to offer here
cool so we're local berlin-based
start-up and we build the base level the
base was basically nowhere was simple
you know you listen to music on
headphones
and you can feel the bass and the music
directly in your body okay so what's
actually being what's actually in here
that's creating this is like some sort
of haptic pad or it's basically a
miniaturized stuff mover so it's
something called a vibrotactile actuator
correcting that creates vibration but
it's very different to the vibration
that you know from a smartphone right
phone only has like one frequency
vibration that goes on origin whereas
our tech is much more like a speaking
fee of different reasons you know much
more a wider dynamic range got range and
also frequency actually all right so can
we try it outside okay cool now I'm
right-handed is that gonna mess me up am
I getting like I'm an absolutely I'll be
able to like eat or anything like that
afterwards maybe that wasn't a part of
the awesome I need music preference
actually do you have any um have any
like jazz I have some acoustic music on
here okay surprise me let me see what
you got right on top of something else
Roenick first and then we research over
to Eric so there are two buttons on here
you can increase or decrease the
intensity however you like it
and otherwise just relax and enjoy the
music oh that's cool
and that's like really it's got a really
sharp attack - exactly yeah now that's
really sick
so so this system is going through this
is a cable that's attached and this is
sending a signal wirelessly to here so
we decided to go for an analog solution
for anything that blocks into a head
without me because that way it's
compatible with everything like rice
thank you for the music or like maybe
Sony Walkman if you wanted to well
except for the iPhone channel which
doesn't have a headphone jack so that's
our adapter right I mean this is this is
kind of helping to create that subtle
sense of like when you go to a club and
you'd stand in front of the subs there
and blow out your hearings a lot safer
also let's actually to recreate that web
experience but it's a similar it talks
to the same sense busy right if you go
to club you feel the music in your body
and it's kind of simple so obviously you
know a lot of people ask so how do you
charge it there's no USB or anything on
it we have the true volume buttons we
design it in a way that you can use the
true volume buttons as charging contacts
oh cool so it just snaps to the sender
you plug your microUSB to the sender
then you charge both devices
that's cool respectful and so because of
this water resistance its platform so
called IP forty-fourth
okay be nice emerge Abul by a buddy's
like ticket yeah I am nything and and
what's the the battery life on a rubble
normally used from experience now it's
about 10 to 12 hours actually Wow if you
crank up to maximum intensity is going
to be more like 6 to 7 4 stars launching
on 37th everytime US and UK and it's
going to sell for 199 to 499 including
shipping actually Kim can you fire up
something else
sure so here's an acoustic track just to
give you a little more detail on like
this is a Patti Smith song who I like
that
because it really is like I mean because
with the electronic everything was so
tight and so precise that the attack on
that was really interesting here it's
really interesting what you're doing
with decay where they're like they have
that bass combo yeah as your associative
so the background actually being my man
my bass player so for me you know the
instrument is very tactile yeah I'm
straying you feeling and when we built
that technology we really wanted to
match the accuracy to the real thing
yeah all the string in your hand and you
feel the vibration no that's cool and so
I mean being an analog nut I like
getting back into my vinyl collection
everything I'm really excited about this
process what was the thinking in going
with this kind of a cabled solution over
trying to utilize like bluetooth like
bluetooth has become the big I phone 7
no headphone jack everybody's talking
about Bluetooth headphones right now was
this like a fidelity issue that you
wanted to transfer that kind of a signal
also I mean in the beginning you know we
talk to a lot of music fans and we've
done we think that the real music fans
are of course like early adopters yeah
and so we just talked to them and said
hey you know what's your platform
whether you listen to music what are
your headphones look like and actually
everyone was listening with cable
headphones
and they also the other thing they said
is wow this is amazing but I want it I
don't want to only hook it up to my
phone I want to use it with my
Playstation or whatever as the white is
possible yeah and blue to this great but
the headphone jack still you know
despite Apple is still the most
widespread standard air audio and then
in the future will also work on
supporting other standards well and you
don't have to worry about the MacBook is
the macbook still has a headphone jack
so you're good there
excellent you want you got to try it
real quick on the 35 so it's it's nice
and vocal ishes a little inside joke in
the office who sometimes took that both
baseless and see which one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
