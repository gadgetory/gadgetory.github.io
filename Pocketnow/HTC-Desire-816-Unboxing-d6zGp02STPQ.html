it has a much more palatable price I'm
Joe Levi with PocketNow and let's unbox
the htc desire 816 let's go ahead and
unbox this and cut through the
shrink-wrap here and we will discard
that and set it off to the side from
here a little shake and the top it comes
right off inside that we've got a very
simple pull tab pull the device out of
course we're going to set that aside
while we look at the guts of the Box
simple lift off we've got some stickers
there for I don't know what a whole
bunch of other manuals documentation
stuff that is good information that we
usually don't follow but you know it's
there for us anyway nice micro USB cable
we've got some basic headphones these
are not the earbud style let me go ahead
and open this up this so you can see it
these are the old-fashioned kind that
had a big grille on them some people
like those more than the new buds that
you have but nice flat cable which I
really really like a lot because they
are much less prone to tangle so if you
don't like tangled head buds that's what
you got and then of course we've got a
nice USB charger this one of course does
not have us-style prongs because this is
not a u.s. style device but that's okay
go ahead and put those to the side and
get to what we're really interested in
the desire 816 now first of all this
thing is huge this is I would call it a
phablet even though it's only got a five
and a half inch screen let's go ahead
and get this off before we do that
though it's got some little places over
here where it tells us where all of our
fun stuff is so we've got our access
doors over on the side so good to know
go ahead and slide this out and
unfortunately there is no screen
protector on this so we're not going to
do it
he'll reveal like Michael Fisher would
normally do but there we go first thing
you're going to notice about this is a
different headphone or speaker grills
still has boom sound up front but much
different these aren't the laser drilled
holes that you see on the HTC One m8 but
they are still very nice they're very
pronounced got a nice camera up front
HTC branding down at the bottom over on
the side our power and volume up and
volume down we're on the top we've got a
speaker headphone jack
moving around nothing on this side
except for our big access door which
we'll get to in a minute
USB kind of off set down on the bottom
interesting there and then the back very
slick very shiny I'm already getting
fingerprints on it it's kind of
interesting because this is matte and
kind of grippy and this is glossy and
kind of slippery but you know it still
looks kind of fun and that's about it so
no replaceable battery on this so we're
not going to go and open the inside but
let's look inside this slot so inside
this we have a nano SIM we have a micro
SD and we have a blocked-off slot that's
because this phone has an option if your
manufacturer if you're a carrier rather
wants you can have a dual SIM and that
would go right in there but since this
is a universal design for those who have
that option and those who don't
in our case ours doesn't have that extra
slot so we can't do anything with it but
it's there so they don't have to have a
different tool out
I'm going to head off to my local
t-mobile store and pick up a nano-sim
and I get this thing all going and start
using it so I can let you know how it is
