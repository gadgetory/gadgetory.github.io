com i want to show you a windows phone 7
app that i really like called local
concerts so let's check it out here we
go says I like plus myspace that's a
team effort we're loading it and here we
are says it's fetching new events at the
top little dots are going by but we've
got some here already so we're on the
popular tab and we got some concerts
showing us some concerts that are
happening soon we can scroll down here
see if there's anybody we like oh
actually these are old ones cached
that's these are that happened already
it's still updating then so we'll go
wait a minute for it to get some new
concerts well here's some that are going
to happen soon
okay let's see what this says you got
search settings are today let's see what
settings does here's your location you
can choose a radius of distance and here
turn on your location services and
change your location there let's go to
all we can see some there and this one
this next tab is real cool this is my
artists so what this does is it's
looking at my music library that is on
the phone you know songs that i
downloaded off a zune or synced from the
pc and it's looking at the artists and
it says Florence and the Machine this is
you know an album that I downloaded it
says they're plain November first at
terminal 5 so I could go see them you
know playing concert here's the option I
can map it more shows at this venue if I
like this location I can see what else
is playing there you can find tickets or
share it tell a friend let's try and map
it and wait there we go so that brings
up a big map multi touching is a little
laggy here but that shows me where the
concert is going to happen so that is a
really cool little feature here whoops I
back too many times anyway that's pretty
much it for the local concerts app but
no pretty useful really cool little
program that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
