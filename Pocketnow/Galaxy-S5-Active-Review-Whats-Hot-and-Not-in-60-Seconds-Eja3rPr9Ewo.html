cladding and beefy bumpers but how tough
is Samsung's Galaxy s5 active and should
you spend your money on it we'll find
out what's hot and what's not in pocket
now 62nd smartphone review starting
right now let's start with what's hot
the s5 active is what you get when you
stick a galaxy s5 in weight-training
milspec durability and immersion
protection and almost no compromising
specs all you're losing are the
fingerprint scanner and high-speed USB
port otherwise it's as powerful as the
galaxy s5 with a big bright screen and a
great camera in daylight here's what's
not hot
that camera stinks in low-light and the
phone's way bigger and bulkier than the
standard s5 that'd be worth it if it was
as rugged as advertised but we're not
sure it is
we jarred our sim loose and fluttered
and destroyed a review unit just by
using it the way Samsung says we should
finally the upshot it's priced the same
as the galaxy s5 which itself carries
the same water resistance and Gorilla
Glass 3 display protection the active
may very well take damage better in the
long term but that's far from guaranteed
get the active if you're really clumsy
really tough or really want people to
think you're really tough otherwise the
regular s5 is just as good for seven
more minutes on the galaxy s5 active
