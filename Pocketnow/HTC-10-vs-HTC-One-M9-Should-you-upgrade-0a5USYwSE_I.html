differences from year to year will get
finer and finer for HTC fans on the one
m9 has enough change to warrant an
upgrade to the HTC 10 I'm Juan Carlos
bag now for Pocket now and we're going
to see if this is a worthy one-year
upgrade so much of HTC's focus for 2016
seems to be righting the wrongs of the
past the 10 represents a company
buckling down and delivering on all of
the fronts where we expect them to excel
looking at the build and design the m9
featured a 5-inch 1080p display while
the HTC 10 moves us to a 5.2 inch quad
HD screen this increase was balanced
against losing the larger front speakers
on the m9 the 10 only grows about two
millimeters taller and wider while the
m9 remains 1/2 millimeter thicker pretty
much all the way around each phone the
10 improves on its predecessor the sharp
rim running around the sides is gone the
sharp bottom edge is gone the hardware
buttons are not only better defined but
also have a more satisfying click to
their operation the 10 is another
iteration of this design language
improved since the 1m 7 yet this somehow
feels like a more impressive jump than
what we saw moving from the m8 to the m9
we do see a little feature swap losing
the IR blaster from the m9 means we can
no longer use our phones as universal
remotes but we do gain a terrific
fingerprint sensor unlocking the 10 via
this hardware home button is much
handier than the lift up phone and
double tap screen function which has
always personally bugged me on HTC s
what if I want to turn on my screen
while my phone is flat on my desk HTC
and speaking of screens while we move up
to a higher resolution display we seem
to do so with no impact on performance
that we can find many in our comments
will debate the merits of having a
higher pixel density beyond 1080p in the
screen size but it doesn't seem to come
with any appreciable downside and it
will improve the experience for those
wanting to play around with some VR
applications in real world use both
screens are bright enough to handle
outdoor situations to my eye the 10
looks to be ever so slightly brighter
than the m9 but the differences here are
slight and neither phone will unseat as
am some AMOLED display in direct sun
looking at software HTC Sense skin is
back again
it's a sleek clean UI bringing some of
the feel of stock Android while
including extra organization options to
elements like the app drawer folks
moving from the m9 to the ten will find
a familiar interface the major change in
software this year seeing HTC whittled
down a few of the apps that used to
provide which would compete with Google
services
there's no gallery app for example
picture and video duties are handled by
Google Photos performance is another
happy improvement in short bursts the
Qualcomm 810 in the m9 is snappy and
powerful but even after some software
updates this chip still runs hot
literally reaching temperatures which
could be uncomfortable in pants pockets
multitasking situations in prolonged you
suffered lags and stutters which are now
absent in the HTC 10 brevity benefits
gaming on the m9 but even after a single
mission in implosion the phone is
already warm to the touch and we see a
lot more stuttering and dropped frames
in future fight than on the HTC 10
moving to photography HTC keeps most of
what we liked about the m9 s camera app
and does so without ever completely
removing you from your composition
window while we keep the great manual
photo controls we lose the
post-processing options for controlling
saturation contrast and sharpness when
creating a JPEG output from the ten is
generally better all around you lose
some resolution to gain back those ultra
pixels but it's a fair compromise for
better low-light performance and
smoother video
we'd be remiss if we didn't also say
that selfie performance is better -
thanks to optical image stabilization on
that front shooter the one area where
the m9 still scores a solid victories on
speaker playback
HTC split treble based solution on the
10 is novel and produces a nicely
nuanced sound but media sounds fuller
clearer and louder on the m9
headphone playback is very similar in
that HTC continues to offer one of the
best built-in amps available on any
mobile device what does seem to have
changed is how aggressive boom sound
software alters the audio you listen to
looking at a sound file with a sliding
sine wave the original file has very
even tapers but with boom sound engaged
on the m9 we can see how much this
software augments some frequencies of
sound over others the 10 also juices
this sound but not as severely the m9
processor runs hot
even during fairly lightweight tasks and
that has a noticeable impact on battery
life the 10 also benefits by having a
slightly larger battery built in a 3000
milliamp hour cell over the m9 s 2,850
milliamp hour cell running our media
tasks streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi at 50% brightness the HTC 10
drains 6% of its battery while the 1
year old m9 drained 11% we have to
temper these results by the relative
ages of each phone but the 10 is simply
a more efficient device and we can
hypothesize it will age better over time
the 10 also powers up faster than the
phone of replaces benefiting from
Qualcomm quick charge 3 standard 30
minutes on a fast charger will result in
over a 40% charge the m9 only tops off
around 28% in the same amount of time so
let's wrap this up where does this leave
us between the HTC One m9 versus the HTC
10 as mentioned in many of the
comparisons we produce year-to-year
upgrades are tricky recommendations
often we see refinement but not a
substantially better device moving from
the m9 to the 10 is evolution not
revolution but so much of this phone has
been refined and improved design
performance cameras battery life more
than any other phone released in 2016 so
far for folks on last year's HTC
flagship the HTC 10 has quite a bit to
offer on a one-year upgrade as always
