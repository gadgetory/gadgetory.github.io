us in sales the LTE iPad Mini prepares
for shipping an AT&amp;amp;T thinks twice about
facetime over cellular I'm hi Mary Vera
happy i barely use FaceTime anyways and
this is parking now daily that's right
if you had any questions on which is the
best-selling smartphone at the moment
well we just got a little hint the
galaxy s3 has now d thrown the iphone 4s
from its title selling 18 million units
in just one quarter when compared to the
16 million units sold by the iphone 4s
now the interesting point here is wide
and compare this to the iphone 5 being
these are the two flagship smartphones
from each company but it still is to
prove that the galaxy s3 is more than
just a smartphone that was released in
may of this year now those of you
pre-ordered the ipad mini and therefore
glt variant on day one aka me and a
whole lot of other people but we just
got a notification that the device will
be ready to ship in the next five
business days and should arrive on our
doorstep on november 21st now talk about
a really slow way to get the device
because we have no options to get faster
shipping but at least the device is now
ready for shipping and that also hints
that you could probably make a line on
november 21st and still get the device
anyways now verizon is just announced
their pre-orders for their windows phone
8 line i'm starting tomorrow and
shipping as early as thanksgiving you
can now get the Nokia Lumia 820 to
purchase a hundred dollars after a
two-year contract and the HTC windows
phone 8x for two hundred dollars now
talk about a little late in the game and
compared to AT&amp;amp;T but it's so much better
than what sprint that doesn't get any
and if you hadn't had enough Angry Birds
already um anyone interrupt me here what
Romeo has just launched their new
version called angry birds star wars the
public in almost every platform this
time even though you get different
theatrics it looks kind of better than
the past iterations you get the same
slingshot you get the kill the same pigs
only this time they're dressed as clones
anyways and finally for them sort of
okay news ATT has just pulled back from
a couple of lawsuits by changing their
minds on facetime over cellular data
networks but as always there's a catch
it only works on 4G LTE our iphones
meaning that's only the iphone 5 on any
data plan
and then if you have an iPhone 4s for
example it will only work if you have a
shared data plan that leads me to the
question of the day how often do you
face time anyways in my particular case
I got used to using skype after waiting
four years for facetime to work this way
so leave us a comment down below do you
need it and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocket now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks
