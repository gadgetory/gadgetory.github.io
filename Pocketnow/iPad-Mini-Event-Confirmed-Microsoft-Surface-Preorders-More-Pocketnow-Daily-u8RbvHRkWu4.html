Microsoft Surface pre-orders begin and
the asuste padfone 2 gets released I'm
high metal ivetta already confused with
so many tablets in the market and this
is parking out daily
that's right Microsoft has just begun
pre-orders for the windows RT surface
tablet and the price points are quite
compelling starting at just 499 for the
32 gigabyte model compare that to the
current generation iPad starting at 16
gigs now that does not include the touch
cover and it's just really hard to tell
you if it's worth it to pre-order the
surface tablet or not because nobody has
ever given it some hands-on time nobody
has ever tried it out to see if it's
good if it feels well if it weighs well
nobody knows anything about this tablet
so if you're on the ropes trying to
decide if you want to surface have it or
not stay tuned we pre-ordered hours that
it should arrive on October 26 for a
full review and remember the assu spat
phone that we had some hands-on time or
were at Barcelona that's the phone that
turns into a tablet when you dock it
well version to what's already out even
though you pretty much didn't see
version 1 and this time the design is
really cool it's got some much better
specs in version one had it's currently
available only in Taiwan but it should
reach these shores by the holiday season
so stay tuned now even though the wards
verizon a Nokia Lumia haven't really
mixed in the past recent rumors already
have a Lumia 920 burien coming to
verizon though we don't know if it will
have the same colors we don't have any
dates but the interesting note is that
apparently the verizon lumee a9 whatever
we'll have more megapixels in its camera
than the current generation Lumia 920 it
should be launched very soon so we'll
keep you posted on that one now the
samsung achieves smart pc and smart pc
pro made a lot of headlines over at
Aoife in berlin that's completely
understandable the tablets were
beautiful if you're on the market for a
Windows 8 tablet the smart pc pro is
already available for pre-order but it
will cost you 1,200 bucks now the smart
pc which costs over 650 to 750 bucks
with a keyboard will be available soon
no details yet but we will keep an eye
out and finally for the expected news of
the day Apple is just send out press
invites for their october twenty third
event and according to the invitation
they've got a little more to show us
that's q4 ipad mini now talk about a way
for Apple to remove the spotlight
completely from the Microsoft pre-orders
of the service tablet and that leads me
to the question of the day what are your
predictions for the ipad mini that's to
come on october 23rd will definitely
prepare our top 5 predictions for the
video but leave us a comment
who knows we might include those in our
video now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet will make sure you
follow us on park intercom please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm hi Mary ivetta thanks for
