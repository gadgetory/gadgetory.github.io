road to a new fingerprint scanner is
closed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7
continues to extend to other retailers
according to recent studies the iPhone 7
really sucks in battery life
I'm Jaime Rivera and before we dive into
Google News on a separate video we
decided to do the daily early with
everything else this is PocketNow daily
the official news today's start with
xiaomi for those of you in the market
for a new Xiaomi product in the United
States the company actually did not
start with phones or tablets they
started with a new set top box the me
box which is a $69 apparatus that will
provide you 4k video capabilities the
price tag is really compelling we cannot
wait to give it a try other official
news continue with the retail
availability of the samsung galaxy note
7 obviously that was recalled it's a
retailers a long time to get it back and
now in addition to Verizon and Sprint
t-mobile has just jumped the bandwagon
you can now also get a brand new Galaxy
Note so don t mobile hopefully it's not
going to be prone to anything this time
the spotlight over to a very interesting
study that revealed something that we
pretty much already knew there was a
comparison between the HTC 10 the galaxy
s7 the LG g5 and the iPhone 7 and the
iPhone 7 ended up being last in battery
life performance both for phone calls
and for data capabilities and I'm just
wondering why is this a surprise the
iPhone has always been terrible in
battery life especially the small
variant and obviously the HTC 10 came
out on top compared to every other phone
than the LG g5 which pretty much not
many people care about and then the
galaxy s7 that's right there interesting
between the HTC 10 and the galaxy s7
given the fact that the power packs are
the same at least in size you can learn
more than links in the description let's
talk about another very interesting
Apple watch prediction as Alister
already claiming that the Apple watch
will not sell more this quarter when
compared to last quarter and you have to
remember Apple is very interesting about
the way they're good handling these
numbers they're not releasing Apple
watch figures separately they're just
adding it to the other category what you
foods the Apple TV and everything else
that's a terrible practice from Apple
but then again it's still legal point
being is that apparently the Apple watch
even with the series too has not sold
more than the first generation Apple
watch on launch why because of the
terrible price tag apparently even the
series one Apple watch won't be able to
nail it mainly because of the lack of
features oh well and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
the iPhone 8 because those rumors
already began and the embedded
fingerprint scanner on the display the
move was already started with the iPhone
7 with that touch ID button being forced
touch and apparently the patents now
claimed that Apple is moving towards the
fact that the fingerprint scanner will
be a better display now the pen says
that in most parts of the display it
doesn't really say that all we wonder
exactly where it won't be included
obviously the top makes a lot of sense
but yeah apparently this is the feature
of the iPhone the abettor display and
apparently the analysts are already
claiming that we are getting a glass on
glass stainless steel design just like
we got with the iPhone 4 that will be
rather interesting but it leads me to
the question of the day do you think
that the move to a broader fingerprint
scanner is smarter than going with the
iris scanner as Samsung is doing because
in my case I wish that Apple did both
mainly because Samsung is implementation
of the iris scanner is genius but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes you'd want to get the news
earlier before the videos filmed well
