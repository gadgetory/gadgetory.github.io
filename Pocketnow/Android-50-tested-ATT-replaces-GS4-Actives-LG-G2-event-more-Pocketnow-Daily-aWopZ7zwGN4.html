already be on the test bench AT&amp;amp;T will
allow one replacement of your water
damage galaxy s4 active and Apple will
buy back your fake charger due to
electrocution complaints I'm high memory
metal and it seems that electrocution is
the new thing and smartphones lately
this is PocketNow daily let's just lay
off with the hot news for those of you
waiting for the blue variant of the HTC
One we finally get some press render so
it's only a matter of time probably
Aoife and Berlin and for those of you
that were doubting about the HTC one max
leaked photos that we saw yesterday
we've got some more photos and this time
it's being compared to this 4-inch
Motorola phone and yeah that one max is
big really big now let's talk about
Apple first of all developers have now
received iOS 7 beta 5 which some confirm
is much faster and more stable than it
was before I can't really tell the
difference but on the other hand well
Apple has now issued a new USB wall
adapter takeback program for any of you
that have a fake wall charger or a third
party wall charger and want to swap it
it'll cost you ten dollars at any apple
store and they'll give you a new genuine
apple wall adapter for the fake one that
you have and well it's kind of cool to
have this this is after all the
electrocution complaints that happens in
China which were only two so can you
imagine all those fake Chinese iPhones
getting electrocuted as well hurry up
speed of product replacements after all
the controversy of these samsung galaxy
s4 actives drowning instead of actually
withstanding their active abilities to
be waterproof well AT&amp;amp;T has now
confirmed that they will be replacing
your galaxy s4 active one time if you
can prove that the device was not
damaged in any other way that's not
water damage so for those of you that
have that problem right now
yup now an interesting leak from the
chromium project reveals that there is
this developer that's currently testing
a version of Android that starts with a
K and for those of you that know builds
of Android start with the letter of the
version of Android that's currently out
so it's j for jelly bean and tay would
be key lime pie so yes key lime pie is
currently on the test bench and effects
to wonder I me and it's currently being
tested on a nexus 4 and the Nexus 7
could it be that whenever we get the
future generation Nexus will also get
the fusion version of Android stay tuned
