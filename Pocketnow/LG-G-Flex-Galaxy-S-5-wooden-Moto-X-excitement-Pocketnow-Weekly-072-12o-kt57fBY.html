thankful for this week we're busier than
ever our YouTube channel just passed
500,000 subscribers and we're deep in
the planning stages for the new years
technology shows but more importantly
we're all still in the business of
reporting on mobile tech and that's
something we all feel pretty lucky about
I think so we'll talk what's happening
in the mobile tech world will fill you
in on some of the fun stuff coming down
the pipe and we'll take questions from
your listener male on episode 07 two of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
audio podcast where we discuss
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and joining me on this black
friday podcast our voice is familiar to
our loyal listeners from the eastern
time zone chief news editor Stephen
shank is giving up the start of his
Friday night to be with a Steven good
evening sir oh is it very well sir and
thank you for being here at this hour
and from some hours in the near future
somewhere in the goateed expense of utah
android guy Joe Levi is with us as well
gobble gobble to you brother yes what
can I say no no jos√© living in the past
isn't he Joe is in the the future well
he's I mean you know hit four o'clock
yeah right his four o'clock I mean our
four o'clock is the past yes Steven but
Joe's four o'clock is our six o'clock
right sure yeah it's unfortunate this is
the the podcast and nothing more
visually based or we could run that gift
from scanners of the games head
exploding cuz that's true here for me
right now I know we've been ridiculously
busy and that's part of the reason we're
recording on a Friday night we have BF
news is what i have in the rundown which
means oh right black friday which is
today i think we ran a bunch of black
friday stories today so as little secret
listeners I asked Steven shank to put
together the rundown for today and I've
been so busy today that I actually
haven't gone through the rundown so this
is going to be a like a nice surprise to
me and
something I was rag on who is it guys
Taylor for right for not reading the
rundown and so Stephen will be talking
us through the news and while we
mentioned Taylor Martin i texted him at
the start of his vacation to ask if he
wanted to come on the air for this
podcast because we were going to try and
record it on Wednesday and I was
actually like I just sent him a text and
then i'm reading the the pocket now
backlog and Taylor Martin wrote a piece
called do you disconnect for the
holidays where he basically spends the
first 500 words talking about how like
guys I'm burned out and I'm shutting
down i'm leaving ain't really good bye
and I'm like oh so I send in this
follow-up text like two minutes later
I'm like oh just read your piece never
mind bro enjoy your vacation so
important to disconnect from from from
everything every so often so we're
hoping he's having a good time but you
know Thanksgiving is the day that a lot
of families sit down and talk about
politics or talk about religion right
and my family we sit down and we talked
about what phone everybody's got really
so so you gonna let you know acting for
the holidays we are uber connected for
the holidays it's so true it's it's it's
a trap like it but it was fun i had the
g flex with me at my girlfriend's
relatives house and it was a ball we had
a wonderful thanksgiving but i love
talking about that phone so much that i
had no trouble spending my my turkey day
mainly talking about the g flex that we
we missed you today on the park and i'll
live when we had questions about the g
flex oh did you were there were you both
on the pocket I lab this morning chance
absolutely yes Fat Joe and I are
practically running the sites in a media
component today it's bizarre and and
everyone involved in it except for us is
like unaware of that so not pointing any
fingers at Tony and Michael but you know
whatever hmmmm taking this place down
from the inside that's right is there
speaking of the of the g flex is there
there's two flex news on the rundown as
I saw right uh yes I believe so ok so we
didn't even make it to that but oh there
is oh good well you fill us in on that
in a second I want to say I want to have
a confession to make I have been the REE
were recording the show so late part of
the reason is because I have spent the
day this doesn't even feel right to say
guys abusing the g flex and I mean like
physically beating up on the phone and
this hasn't been fun now I thought you
were going to do the the scratch test
he's talking about bending it and well
we were worried yeah we weren't because
my marques brownlee our friend mkbhd did
a really good video on this and if good
listeners if you haven't seen it you
should go watch it join the two million
who've already watched it because I
think like CBS picked it up or something
but like it's now standing video but
what we wanted to do was like take it
okay so we'll test the self-healing
component will test the flexing but we
want to kind of use it in real-world
circumstances and you're right Steven we
were not going to do that because we
were just borrowing the unit from negri
but some things happened where we we
ended up buying it from from negri and
in other words Michael broke it broke
another one that one and then yeah no no
actually thankfully that didn't happen
we bought it because of some stuff I
can't talk about which is the same
reason a review is push back a little
bit but it's all good stuff no worries
knock bad news at all great news but the
thing is we ended up deciding we wanted
to do a stress test a torture test so
that's what I've spent the afternoon
doing III it just hasn't felt I mean
I've dropped the thing on the concrete
um that's like a kick back to the the
durable phones the rugged phones that we
tested a while back are you doing that
kind of stuff to it no you know and not
really i I'm doing all the stuff to it
that I don't like watching like I don't
like I don't like phone durability porn
I don't like drop tests I think it all
just so it makes me feel so bad and it
makes me feel really bad especially when
it's a phone that I really like so
anyway we didn't test it to destruction
that video will be up tonight it may be
up it'll be up shortly after the podcast
so it goes live so if for some reason
listeners you are recovering from black
friday and you are listening to this
podcast and you want something to watch
that video will be up tonight and you
can enjoy seeing how the g flex holds up
to being you know flexed
here's what's the the screen cover
material on this is it very flexible
glass when they go with plastic yeah I
think and I haven't been able to get
confirmation on that and that's one of
the many questions which should be
cleared up next week I think it's
plastic the display is plastic OLED
right so it's not a display covering
right but we know it's we assume it's
not gorilla glass because grills doesn't
flex like that no but I know Kourtney
does make some really really flexible
was a dragon glass or is it dragon trail
ask something should be like monkey
class because you know monkeys and
gorillas and flexibility banana phones
there you know it all goes together but
the g flex is still intact we didn't
test it to destruction or anything it's
sitting right here next to me i'm still
very very i really like this phone a lot
oh my god so let's get to the run and we
have G flex things to talk about Steven
why don't you kick us off on the news my
voice I'm tired of my voice at this
point so enjoy a lousy huge thank you
thank you I will recline momentarily
take us away Steven so the first thing
we heard this week about the g flex was
regarding LG's plans for a follow-up now
we know samsung had this awesome chart
at their panelist a thing a while back
showing were they seeing this technology
going over the next couple years from
his phones that are curved to bending
and everything in between so this rumor
suggests that the sequel to the g flex
whoever ends up being called could
arrive about the same time that the
first one loves this year so we're
looking at in october early november
somewhere and there and just like
Samsung's roadmap it's against that LG
will be pushing the limits of this
flexible technology and the sequel to
the g flex might bend about 90 degrees
so we wouldn't hold a NAPA to be
flexible so you've got Nick you could
hold it like a c-shape or something bend
it to your face what I don't like
unfolded to put it in your pocket or
something you wouldn't know it 90
degrees solo el ya nour el no I know
what that is but I would like him but
you don't want to leave it at a
90-degree thing is how are you gonna
carry her
round what you gonna do mount it on your
you know like the throat yeah will it
come with it with the rhythm like a
choker necklace and get two of them you
can make a bracelet yeah it just all
there was SmartWatch LG Smart Watch
reflections you heard it here first um
well okay so this is cool so I thought
that maybe given the fact that we were
hearing rumors about the G flex 2
already I thought that maybe this would
be something that would be coming out
and like five months but I'm glad to
hear you yeah I'm glad to hear that this
is just uh we're already there already
thinking about the next phone in the
line on the next cycle because this
thing hasn't even hit anywhere outside
of south korea yet so well that's the
second part then I didn't get the post
about this this afternoon but I saw on
the feed somewhere there's talk about an
international launch of the bone
happening sometime next month well what
do you know about that that's in time
for the holidays that would be really
really rare hmm I hope that's true
because i want to buy one of these now i
have a big problem because Steven do you
know why you know what I do but there
are two that I want very badly now i
want the g flex from us for myself but
what else do I want for myself that's
also in the rundown I die I very much
doubt it's the next thing in the rundown
because that would just be too
convenient oh you want that wouldn't ya
I sure do yeah I don't think it's ever
gonna get here whatever what's the bad
news story say what does it say it says
never ever it'll be available by the
holidays and the holidays of never ever
stop people to get this thing in time
when night residents it's going to have
this ship within a couple weeks from the
end zone and you know I mean that's been
part of the value proposition on the
Moto X from the start right is uh just
like shipping within four days so I can
only imagine they will apply that to
this as well one would hope yeah what do
we know what the price is gonna do there
unless they've really been misleading us
and you're dropping the red herring it's
going to be an extra 50 I mean that's
what it says in the code behind the site
okay so looking for the ones it down 350
for the cheapest one off contract so
which sounds an awful lot like some
other
own that cost 350 off-contract doesn't
it hey oh wait in is that truly what it
is I know the price got knocked down but
it is that of what it is I was trying to
price it because these black friday
deals I was compiling the other day
there's an awesome one coming up on
cyber monday for Motorola's offering 150
bucks off any Moto X you could say whoa
wait it offering that off even unlocked
without a contract yeah yeah and so
fascinating um so take that and buy a
moto G you like I'm just gonna try I'm
on moto maker right now trying to build
my own and it's making me log in and now
I just don't yeah that's something
wouldn't just give me the prices until I
actually put an order through very
annoying about that come on motorola
will tell you how much it costs after
you've already bought it yeah it comes
down to Nexus 5 levels still these
discounts factor what did you just do
Steven because all of a sudden the
podcast became very much quieter and
it's so much more pleasant did you flip
a switch I touched nothing Wow well then
the podcast gods are smiling on us and
we just won't talk about a new show or
something is easily know Joe remains
Joey I'm totally here shows not the
problem child with the karaoke
revolution revolution 2 i'm sorry right
yeah I'm sorry I didn't mean to malign
you you're right character resolution to
as I believe in a thing called love all
the importance of all right I didn't
mean to get us off track there so did
you did you right before I said my
stupid thing did you give it did you hit
us with a price or now ah i did not i
can't recall it it's like 350 ish after
ok so the wooden ones are fifty dollar
premium the developer wants five i
remember that the milk 15 fit well my
god which should just not exist yeah but
belapur phones are job if your phone is
to develop their phone you don't want
people to develop for it the end it's
not in the rundown but Motorola this
week also changed their developer phone
policy we're no longer voids the
warranty once you unlock a bit later
well that is good this an overload
overdue move that was that's a big duh
yeah yeah that was bound to happen
it should have happened ages ago
hopefully we will see some official word
on that soon i doubt motorola motorola
was really big on shooting a moto x 2
like everyone in the world when they
released the Moto X but I think that I
think that they're probably this is just
me talking I'd have done or know this
for sure I think they're probably pretty
happy with the press they got because I
can't find anyone in the media in a tech
media who doesn't really really like the
phone and so I really doubt we'll be
getting a wooden review unit but we will
ask do not worry we will ask pretty
pretty please yes Steven what'swhat's
what else is going on what's what's next
we gotta go oh yes speaking of words
between you HTC m8 so we've been talking
about this is gonna be the next big
flagship from HTC it's gonna be the two
or the 1.5 who knows but we heard a
little bit more about what to expect
from it and it kind of doesn't sound
that great I think they're gonna
pronounce it the mate the HTC mate oh
that would make it would be awesome I
don't know why but i would i would
forgive that more readily than i would
some other cutesy name and i got bored
in the mo tog motel oh the if you get
microsoft's new x bone console so i
thought of the space on this thing the
big disappointing one is mention of
another 4 megapixel camera which sounds
like the exact same ultrapixel them this
year that doesn't seem right to me I oh
no I they can't there's a commenter who
makes a really good point down here who
says like when the initial HTC One was
rumored the rumors had a carrying an s4
pro instead of 600 so it is not without
precedent that HTC might under promise
and over deliver here so I just can't
see them throwing a 4 megapixel camera
in there again the government was pretty
iffy I i guess this model number
invention does not look anything like
the format that HTC uses for some
devices so I'm I don't trust the
Providence of this particularly yeah
yeah well we'll see we're still we're
coming up on the point where these
rumors are going to start coming
faster and faster right because guys
when did the HTC one announcement
happened last year was at
january-february what does they fed you
worry them if you're wrong I'm gonna
sounds it was opposed to launch then it
take March but it was delayed till early
April yeah I was something somebody I
don't know Brennan and I covered the
thing in New York and I was if there was
a fun time but do you speaking of HTC
One Show you've got the one max did you
not I have the one max yes yes now wait
a sprint one man edition yes yeah now
have you been using it I have been
trying to use it now what does what does
that mean exactly I have been running
into issues is that the case is it a bad
unit er I don't know it's still inside
this nice pretty box that says fedex on
it you have to take it out of the box to
use it yeah there's your problem oh my
god I gotta boot it okay no I've I've
got a nice review rebuttal coming up on
this that we were hoping to have sooner
than later but now looks like later than
sooner just schedules and holidays and
Roger I read to that yeah well take that
thing out of the box at some point
because you're just you're gonna want to
enjoy yourself with it I don't know what
to tell you about it except that you
must use it to experience it and what
that experience is will be your own it
will be my own I've just noticed it ten
seconds to say nothing at all your
choice it is well that that really is
what everything we do every day comes
down to it is all about will tell you
the good the bad the ugly but it's up to
you to figure out what you want and for
you to try and use what you like cuz
your decision is yours and who are we to
second-guess doors and yours alone
specials that's who we are well what's
what's the story on I don't want to
leave a moto completely behind we had if
you want a moto G in the United States
you can get one now is that true yeah
surprise surprise what yes waiting until
next year but they're available now
through motorola amazon
just added them I think today or
yesterday you know I want one of these
so hard we did ask motorola for one they
did not opt to give us one so i but i
might just ask for one for christmas
from Santa I don't know probably get one
with the change at having your couch I
mean yeah prices are what 180 and 200
respectively for 8 and 16 gigs orders
shipping in under a week by December
second yet my goodness I mean it's this
kind of device that makes me wish I had
someone in my life who really needed a
phone right now they just get one of my
mom or something lender she's not going
to use it exactly like I wish I hadn't
already equipped to my parents with
smartphones cuz I'd be like oh man just
snap these are these are really because
it's like a high-yield gift right it's
like Christmas morning or a tonic or
whatever you're like unwrapping the
thing and it's like check out what I got
you and they're like holy crap it's an
awesome looking smart phone and they
have no idea that you only spend ice
cream money on it Shh so so speaking of
that Milo we're all talking like ballers
I'm sorry I love her all talking like
180 bucks is nothing like oh yeah I got
that yeah so my daughter has one of my
old I've Galaxy Nexus phones that she's
using as an actual phone now and she
loves it she thinks it's great but she
wants my wife's old Nexus 4 which has a
broken screen because you have a nexus 4
thing yeah if you have a nexus warn you
haven't broken the screen yet you will
yep um she's oh she's saving her
babysitting money to to send that back
to LG and fix it so for 168 bucks she
gets a nexus 4 well I'm gonna all this
gonna for money for the case that is a
rad deal dude well I a new nexus 4
relate to under box a couple months ago
let's shut up don't my daughter doesn't
listen to the podcast so she doesn't
know the point I'm making is I said hey
do you want to do that or do you want to
buy the Moto G for 180 and she was like
I don't know dad you're the android guy
what do I want to do and so she's
thinking of the the Moto G I
love it I want to know what we all want
to know what the results of this of this
are the results are her going out and
finding more people to babysit for so
there we go she's gotta grow her user
base or know her customer base her
customer base yes he so breaking news
the g flex which is in my hand now has
to default disfigured deformed spots on
its display at the center line the
display covering is intact it is not
warped but the display itself underneath
now has two spots that are about the
size of maybe a millimeter in diameter
totally circular and I do not believe
they were there before and you know this
distorted its coloration what do we know
when the display is on they are not in
evidence I'm going into Twitter perfect
white screen to verify this now I cannot
see them when the screen is on it is
only when the screen is off that I can
see these distortions which I assume
came from sitting on the phone
repeatedly the wrong way mm-hmm that's
that's disappointing same time same time
doesn't show up when the screen is on so
you're patiently had a scare with my
nexus 5 where thought i had a dead pixel
on it oh and I you know video app and
I'm pulling up all these different
videos and each of them has this run the
edge of the screen it looks like a
pixels missing and it's weird because
I'm thinking I shouldn't be able to see
individual pixels on a 1080p display and
sure I've ended up just being a software
artifact that for some reason blacked
out this time feels a lot of the screen
like five minutes I was sweating bullets
there God ya know that's scary i know it
remains dead pixels are like the most
irritating thing to try to explain to
people you're trying to return a phone
too but with the nexus is just would be
your 10 to send it back this is the last
thing go ahead see i did download an
awesome app designed to give me epilepsy
both trying to think still trying to fix
that pic i love those i think it's cool
of dev slick devise fat I've never
had a stuck pixel knock it knock on wood
I've never had a stuck pixel on one of
my devices out of the box lucky and I
look I would this last thing I'm going
to say about the g flex
and then we can stop talking about it I
promise we're gonna talk about song from
the what is it late eighties mid 90s if
you want every flex yeah yeah this oh we
are not going to type it's good
reference um this thing keeps trolling
me because that popped up and i keep
thinking I'm done with this video and
then I'm not like I had to go back and
reinsert something else so the flea the
vo track for this video is like going to
be a hodgepodge of like haphazardly
inserted audio clips now have to talk
about the screen thing but do you guys
know that it hit it refused to heal on
me for like an hour when I scratched it
up with a penny so like I scratch it up
with a penny I leave a big old scar on
the back I'm like you ain't you ain't
going to heal so I photograph at every
five minutes for like 40 minutes and
it's not healing I'm like okay whatever
I'm done you didn't he'll go over there
while I read about you and then like an
hour and a half later I'm putting the
video together I'm like okay I pick it
up I look at it just to kind of confirm
that that they're still there totally
gone the penny scratches have vanished
they didn't do it in the first 40
minutes but they did it sometime after
that but before the 90 minute mark so
this is going to be an adage for
children watched pot never boils they're
not gonna know what actually
water-efficient scratch smartphone does
not heal its own that's exactly right a
watched progress bar never cell phone
heal thyself yes ooh nice Joe ooh good
good title for a video who I might take
that and we could see if we could
license the reflex for the background
music yeah oh there be great alright
good we have an idea we got a show we
got a show all right we should record
this thing all right listen I'm taking
us off track let's stop talking about
that Steven what's next wait there was a
track no no I'm gem made that up okay
they're fools and oh yeah best news ever
is what's next really so one of these
companies behind a benchmark app and you
know we use lots of them in the past and
some of them we favored more than others
but the company behind 3dmark has
decided to do something about
these companies that I use the word
cheating it because I strongly believe
that's what it is but they're the ones
manipulating their phones so that they
perform better in benchmark apps than
they do for everything else and so
3dmark said you're going to do this and
they know they have in terms of service
for what devices have to do to qualify
for inclusion and it says you cannot
gain your results this way so rather
than put up with it they just delisted
so HTC one the one mini the note 3 and a
couple tablets I think are now bottom of
their lives I love it I absolutely love
this ya know black mark on them and it's
wow it's great because I mean you know
it's it's it's not it's irrespective of
brand it's just who has you know who has
been implicated in this sort of semi
scandal I love that it's it's cross
brand I love that there will probably be
more revelations in the future and that
somebody has finally come up and been
like you know what no you're not doing
this boom I would just love to see all
the other benchmarking companies and get
behind like a group effort here yes one
of them is doing its not going to have
the impact it needs to I think 3dmark
deserves a real awesome like round of
applause because that's that's really
really cool I mean Joe what do you think
you're the expert here what's your
opinion on in terms of benchmarking well
synthetic benchmarking is a flawed
concept to begin with everybody at some
point in their life is going to come to
that realization whether you already
have or whether that's something you
haven't quite reached yet trust me you
will and it's just understanding the way
it's all put together it tries and tries
and tries to create this real-world
scenario of tests that really doesn't
exist anywhere but it's the best thing
that we can do to get a watermark to
find out how this device is comparing
against some other device it tries to be
the equalizer and it's the best we have
that said I love using them because I
think they do a pretty good job at
representing that watermark by going in
and saying aha I know what you're doing
here I'm going to immediately ramp
everything up so that I score better
than everybody
outs because I'm already running it 100%
as soon as the appt fires up yeah that's
that's not the way you work on every
other app out there therefore it is
cheating there is no other way to look
at it then you are trying to game the
system and what what these guys did is
perfect says next time we run a review
guess what we're going to include 3dmark
as one of our scores and you're gonna
get a did not finish yeah dnf dragons a
rest yep I a big I don't use like 3d
mark by the way I'm 3 mark I don't like
benchmarks myself Joe you said it all
really much better than I could but I do
use 3d mark just to get an idea of
because you can see it as it's visually
running the the awesome like world it
has made up the animation you can see
how well the device is performing
there's a little frame rate monitor down
below but you can also see whether it's
stuttering or whatever is going on and
it's just a nice kind of it looks good
impression yeah and it's also really fun
to film like what should all the me get
downloads or something yeah there's like
cool space ships that are built around
like huge circular saws which you know
that's cool i'm into that so oh i love
3d mark and yeah keep using I'm glad
Stephen I again with Joe saying about
how these benchmarks like freedom arc
they're trying to give you a score
horrible and really over simplify it
black a lot of value I do think there's
something to be said for just these raw
computational things like how many you
know gigaflops can the process to do how
many triangles per second can the GPU
display yeah I think there is value to
having those because that gives simple
easily comparable hard numbers and those
are more difficult to gain teen yes yes
and as a software developer you know
than what I do in my other life that's
occupied all of my time this week
hideously don't let them hear that
though okay I agree with that entirely
there's nothing better than then
quantifiable numbers to take back to
somebody and say look this one is better
than that one and I have the numbers to
prove it the downside to that is the
interpretation of those numbers because
somebody who sees
this one is scoring this and that one is
scoring that and all of a sudden they
think it's somehow better than the other
it's got phone calls ring and sorry
about that guys it's it's not it's you
look at a benchmark score and you say
okay that's great and it it is in the
benchmark but nowhere else not outside
of the benchmark so real-world practical
stuff you know my my Nexus 5 is faster
than my nexus 4 is it twice as fast in
use probably not on the benchmarks if
possibly so yeah so you just have to use
it as a yes it's a relative mark of
which is faster and which is not but in
everyday practical use the stuff that
you do with it every day and that's
where Stephen is absolutely correct it's
a good reference mark but it's not
gospel it's a tool yes various very well
summed up and I think given the current
state of my own internal benchmark and
attention level I think it's time to
move on what do you guys shut up you
like that that was the most beautiful
thing ever was great beautiful I really
did like it it was good I want to know
about the galaxy s5 though yeah we heard
a little bit more about when this I
might be coming out because everyone was
talking about Samsung rush in this thing
to market they apparently are
dissatisfied with the galaxy s4 sales I
can't see why but so they always talk
about it coming out really really early
next year at least significantly earlier
than we've seen it much in the past
seriously earlier than then we'd expect
suspiciously some might say so yes so
what do we have claims that it could go
up for sale in February or march is that
correct yeah this uh if this particular
member didn't mention a launch
announcement previously we heard it
might happen in January this was just
talking about manufacturing and they say
that the the real heavy manufacturing
when exam so it's going to switch from
some you know early production runs
doing this and mass is going to happen
in January and then phone actually
becoming available stores februari
remarks
that would be very interesting i like
this spec rundown we're looking at here
a possible 64-bit Exynos chip which
isn't going to enjoy stop me if I'm
wrong is not going to make any
difference to the end user the same
three wrong oh damn it am I robbed um
let's let's come back to that because
that's all right that's yes then the
chip is going to be 64 bit that lets us
potentially have a lot of cool stuff
that we can get into in the meantime
talk about three gig of ram meantime
three gigs of ram the same ones we saw
on the Galaxy Note 3 and the source also
describes a 16 megapixel main camera
which I can believe and that's that
isocell one that's supposed to be coming
up next year did you say I so sell
isocell we heard about this new tech
from Samsung that's supposed to reduce
lead over between the individual pixels
so better saturation opens no that would
be quite lovely now I've never really
had a problem I don't think with
Samsung's saturation on their cameras in
fact I haven't had no problem with
Samsung's cameras it's good you should
look there's a sample a half of it I so
cell when I first wrote about it and
it's a subtle difference but if you look
in the really the highlights of the
image you can see that there's more
color must wait I so sell what a
confusing term given the photographic
term is 0 that's a very descriptive term
this is 0 on your ISO so yeah right
anyway all this is making me think of
the galaxy s4 zoom which is making me
well simultaneously feel strange and
slightly excited oh but separate from
this talk about the actual availability
of bone there's another rumor out today
suggesting we might not get optical
stabilization on the camera yeah yeah
you know I any phone needs OAS today for
me to be excited about its camera I i am
not loving it on the Nexus 5 I mean I
know it's not great on that cuz I'm
hardly even noticing it's a bet ya know
that wait for the update and they will
be half good the Nexus 5 is easily the
least impressive example of OAS I've
used so far I'm really looking forward
to that update but the battery is
interesting to me i love it stevens
phrasing hear reports of a way
two big four thousand million power
battery gotta be wrong you know it
doesn't have to be around that because
you know this I promise I'm breaking my
promise this LG G flex in my hand has a
3500 milliamp hour battery and this
phone doesn't seem like it we should
have a battery that big isn't that like
a sick seizure of the g flex yeah it's a
big fun I know but still so I could see
it happening you know the battery isn't
even that big though we've seen photos
of the curved battery from this unit in
a photo that is at tom's hardware and
now is that a curve battery or selects
know that it's curved not flexible it's
well I mean it's is flexible i mean i
don't know i sat on the thing so it must
be a little flexible it hasn't loaded
yet the question that i have there is we
saw flexible battery technology come up
before is this battery using that or is
that what we're going to see in the the
reflex going back to topic tough call I
don't know because I you know it takes
some real stones like it takes a lot of
skill to tear down a phone but it takes
a lot of skill and I think a degree of
foolishness to tear down a battery
because the last time I heard about
someone doing that like they ruined
their kitchen as blue green flames like
left from their phones to their seat
it's easy no I did was like Nick the bag
with a screwdriver like you pulled apart
the casing of the battery and nicked a
little bag inside and it exploded
lithium-ion batteries are not going to
mess with lithium owing knows yes yes so
anyway uh but yeah I was just curious
about that because you know that that
would then open the question is flexible
battery technology also somehow able to
fit in a whole bunch of extra milliamp
hours in there as compared to the the
rigid brothers or cousins you don't know
that we might have to watch that going
forward Oh are we getting so excited
over flexible batteries in the first
place they're not technologically that
far off from normal lithium polymer
batteries well because the flexible
battery and a flexible display means a
flexible device right right what's a
good enough we could be good at making
flexible batteries for years now there's
nothing to high-tech but there hasn't
been anything like to motive
yeah because the display can move so
it's like a check it out the batteries
in the wristband on this watch but the
screen is still flat it's like I don't
care go away yeah what I just gotta say
what look broke Joe we don't we got all
these cool things inside our phones we
got processors we got radios we got Ram
we got storage we got all this stuff and
we're seeing such huge leaps in
technology moving forward and good
freakin grief the 805 we're gonna have
ten down sad you don't say Machuca hurts
I Steve sixth step it's funny you make
the bag come on because what's that what
the bit stefan constantinescu tweeted
something last night like he was just
like i just read an article where
someone said that the snapdragon 805 has
10 gigahertz of processing power and i
was like oh wait a minute hold on and i
like hop over to pocket now I'm like out
Joe Joe your 10 was early and chica does
not it's only if there are only about
only if your 80s 80s era bummer on a
commercial doesn't that math work out
come on but though you're not saying it
has that much raw speed but you know if
you say you've gotta I was gonna do a
car now anyway it's too I stand by what
I said because you added up and it is my
wishes because it's a neo few alimony
orbit system let's move on before it
gets too hot too much in my members yeah
all right all right do we have something
to say there go ahead and finish this up
in Android Joe it's an exciting exciting
thing because look it's its battery
technology it's something new and
different and changing and it gives us
the possibility that we could have
finally that leap that same leap that
we've seen in processors and video and
RAM and storage finally making it over
to batteries and I hope we're not let
down by it but i think we probably will
be what we been ringing had a leap in
man cram speeds Ram capacity and we went
eons behind a hard drive and storage it
well I'm just saying look at look at all
these bits and pieces that we have
inside our device for getting faster ram
we're getting more RAM we're getting
faster buses yeah it's busted so much so
much best s talk going on right now uh
fun fact-- i'm going to ask Steven to
switch over to Apple because we have
some news to cover there and while he
does oh you bet the topic I thought you
were going to have a switch phone I'm
gonna ask Stephen a switch over due to
an all Apple ecosystem and then we'll be
back no no we're gonna switch topics
there and fun fact while you tell us the
first topic in the Apple rundown Steven
I'm going to surreptitiously but not
anymore now that I've told you about it
film these deformations on the phone
that I'm no longer talking about look at
that multi-tasking right here yeah we
like mute buttons Steven it says what s
first it's not now can I don't know it
sneaks away all the time use isn't
always yeah so I go make oatmeal for
minutes at a time I come back now go
ahead Steven um so I've been hearing a
lot of rumors about what to expect from
Apple next year and it's all very
interesting it sounds a lot like the
company's moving away from habits of the
past we could be getting new device
sizes more launches and rather just the
one ipad event and one iphone event and
we've been talking about you know but
sort of schedule we might see for these
and a lot of it's been looking to at
least something happening earlier on in
the year possibly a new 12 point nine
inch ipad coming out of the spring this
new rumor says not so fast and we might
be waiting until at least the second
half of the year and do you believe that
giant iPad story because i don't know if
i do ah i'm kind of thinking and I've
had a lot of people echoing this that
it's going to be more like what
Microsoft's doing with the surface pro
and this might be like a crossover mac
book / tablet thing haha work but I just
make sense with the side and it lends
itself to using a more traditional
mobile operating system it would make
some sense I just don't see Apple being
the one to do it it seems like something
that's so far out there it would be it
seems like almost as likely to me as
Apple coming out and saying hey guys
remember
a sous padfone well we're making a
better version of it you know it just
seems that unlikely seems like something
like a dream you'd have after having too
much indian food or something you know
yeah that's where I'm going for dinner
tomorrow nice we've been hearing about
Samsung working on a giant galaxy tab so
I mean if Apple forget to after that
came out we blame them all for copying
Samsung oh yeah that's true but I mean
come on you you expect something like
that from Samsung it's like if somebody
came out tomorrow and been like hey guys
you know Samsung's putting android in a
I don't know a car remote start to you
know keychain fob I'd be like yeah I
believe that okay whatever not Apple
anyway uh so that's that's interesting
what about the iWatch too because uh
it's more Ottoman also be delayed so
second half of the year well that
actually does make me sad because you
know i love my smart watches yeah i'd
rather than waiting to go right no me
too i understand what about the products
that are already on the shelves not the
smart watches the iphone i was gonna say
absolutely what are you talking about
they're gonna call it I pebble oh that
would be very sad oh did we did we post
a new story about pebbles availability
by the way Black Friday special I've
taken see a black friday special in one
of the swords it wasn't a very good one
whatever when I make it was just you get
like a free gift card with it yeah a
little pebble is available on Amazon
first of all an Amazon and you can get
the red one for the same price as you
can the black one uh and different
prices based on color y'all dude yes the
orange one was like 250 bucks on amazon
ooh yeah the black ones 140 whatever it
was like five bucks cheaper than regular
and it came with prime shipping so I
threw that out to all my people on
Twitter which by the way Michael Fisher
is still winning so everyone follow me
and unfollow him father Joe Levi no joke
on Twitter like having more followers is
winning because I have some arguments
you know I was just gonna say Stephen
Stephen i think is beating all of us
with the most followers per tweet i
think if your average is something like
a hundred followers every tweet well
let's uh so back to what I'm saying
bucks off today only directly from
pebble go get it now all right that's
that's exactly this rose looking for
okay somebody has it really good let's
move on the iphone 5s we would maybe we
can fill some orders now yeah
unsurprisingly I there the demand has
dropped or Apple has ramped up its
production line but it's finally making
enough iPhone 5s is to go around so if
you were looking for one earlier and
your local store only had a bunch of
fives and 5 c's try again because word
is now that by and large most of the
stock in apple physical stores are these
5s models I haven't heard if the color
availabilities gotten any better because
we know the gold was tough to come by
early on but with as many as we here are
on hand give it a shot Roger that all
right good news on the Apple front yeah
well now new news on the Apple for
anyway ISM and crossing by the way we
have another defector in my family from
the Apple camp to the Android camp
that's all I'm saying normally I would
if this were a different podcast i would
now use the opportunity to set off some
firecrackers and and use the sound board
to put in applause but uh you know you
know people people should just do what
they want that's what I think that's
what I'm saying and he didn't live baby
yeah you got a note 3 and it's gorgeous
and he loves it and he's huh oh no three
good time good device microsoft exec
says something what is it now on the run
down like sneak and I like singer those
segways on you wait is this an allusion
to a platform fusion plans that's right
cold platform usual scientists have
finally figured out how to do it cold
fusion I thought they dispelled that
they said it could not be done it do
microsoft is finding a way to do it time
I downlods embedded in the surface 3 all
you need is live tiles it's all you need
what is the story here actually
everybody needs to just know because I'm
reading this on the screen and you may
not know this because we're just talking
about it Fusion means the coming
together it's not
new super secret code work like I
thought it was so don't be confused like
me it's just that diffusion like you
said above those gaps no prob
capitalizing every word in the headline
so you can tell the difference ah yeah
platform fusion plant so what is it what
are they talking about they're talking
my bringing our tea together with
Windows Phone like we've been
speculating is that correct yeah we've
been talking about this for months and
months now microsoft hasn't been sitting
a lot you know giving us a lot of hard
information saying this is what we plan
to do by when so there's been a lot of
speculation going on we've heard rumors
about like when Windows Phone 8.1 comes
around in the spring how we might see
that start to get this process going by
combining of the the online stores for
RTE apps and Windows Phone 8 apps and
then eventually we get to a point where
we have you know they come together and
we had microsoft exec saying do I have a
quote from here her listen to her via in
here um no exact quote but the point is
that quote like it's acknowledging that
this is where we're headed that we're
not going to have three separate
platforms in the future for some point
we're getting down to it's just going to
be Microsoft is going to run on your
phone is going to run in your tablet
everyone in your laptop it will be the
same thing don't forget your game
console because we are getting some
traditional desktop II window app
capability to the xbox one as well so we
will have some fusion with the the set
top / game console that eventually will
I don't know yeah I mean this is
something we have been talking about for
quite a while too because you know this
was the kind of thing that I was using
to prop up the notion of Windows Phone
as a successful platform over a year ago
on this very podcast is we were talking
I think the surface was due to come out
we were waiting on windows 8 to come out
at that point we hadn't seen it and a
lot of people were saying like well what
you know how is this tile thing going to
land and I was like well you know I am
hopeful for it because I think there is
value in saying to someone hey if you
like this interface you can have it on
your phone on your tablet on your
desktop on your console you can have it
everywhere
if you want it that way I think that's
been a really bumpy road so far and I
don't think a lot of people are really
asking for it but it is still a valuable
thing that you can offer and now we're
seeing what yourself doing that with
their ad push they're saying I don't
know what exactly the slogan is but it's
essentially like same experience on
every platform yeah I think that's
pretty cool I mean that part that part
is cool yeah so you got three things
together you've got name recognition
which they came out of the box with for
everything but xbox Xbox is still xbox
right it's not windows box w fine
thankfully because if it had been I
don't think it would have sold as well
yeah I know but you've got all these
other platforms that all have windows in
their name and really from my peers
standpoint shouldn't because they are
not all windows they are are those
windowed absol windows phone no windows
I want to go there now and thankfully
because I don't like where the windows
on my smartphone so it's the future dude
but stop derailing me so so you have the
name that's that's contiguous across
three of the floor platforms you then
have the tiles that are contiguous
across three out of the four actually
all of four out of the floor lab yeah
yeah and next and this is really where
this whole strategy will pay off is when
you have appt synchronicity between
those four platforms you buy one app and
it runs in all four places and it looks
essentially the same across all four
it's not a separate code base it's just
a separate optimized display for that
we're not close to their weight but I
tell me if I'm making this up because
people were complaining about this
earlier we've talked about this before I
think that I went to buy asphalt 8 for
the Lumia 2520 the other day the tablet
and it told me I had already bought it
the only place i've bought asphalt 8 is
on the windows phone store as a Windows
Phone app and yet on a Windows RT device
I could download it for free because it
told me I had already purchased it yes
but is it the same app or is it just a
different version of the
for the different version of the same
title for a different platform I see
what you're saying so you're talking
about the same oh I ok ok yeah Michael
make sure didn't even know that that
worked that way well yeah that that you
have to do to get you to that next step
right now I should I want to make it
clear that i may have been high and
drunk i mean like this did happen but i
also may have bought asphalt 8 on like
the surface forever ago I really don't
think I did though it actually did
happen so any app developers out there
that want to sell somebody something
sell it to Michael he'll buy it and not
even I will definitely buy things twice
but I can't remember anything oh my god
well cool how many Smurf berries and I
by last night but no you get to a point
where I I have adopted this this
ecosystem and I just want my app to work
across everything it can do that today
on Android whether that's a smartphone a
phablet a tablet a tablet with a
keyboard I'm just missing that desktop
computer laptop computer type thing step
ya but the same app runs across all of
them one purchase one app it's the same
thing if I do that on Windows say I want
to run SimCity which runs on my Windows
computer on my tablet which is just a
screen and not a keyboard and big box
attached to it I can't do it because it
doesn't exist that code base is specific
to desktop windows and nowhere else wait
that's I thought the whole deal with all
right you're talking about desktop to
tablet I am not as well versed in that
area but at least there is that
synchronicity between Windows Phone and
Windows because that was a whole point
of releasing windows phone 8 was that so
they could share a code base right yeah
so at least there's there's that they're
getting there you know I just realized
that we have the old pocket now we
cleaver logo on our shows list Steven
what were you gonna say I don't know I
was like oh I'm sorry that you were
going out just make little explanations
to liven things up me too I do that too
well I look forward to seeing what's
going to come of this I think that
somebody posted a really interesting
thing on Twitter the other day if you
play
drinking game to the pocket now weekly
you probably take a drink every time I
say someone's we did something I can't
remember who but that is true there's
another one of those somebody said like
everyone who thinks that RT is going to
die in favor of Windows Phone is making
a mistake it's the other way around so
that's an interesting contention I don't
agree with that I would agree with you I
they're gonna they're gonna mess up
through yeah right they're gonna eat
each other and then they're gonna form
something fascinating and huge is cool
max yeah gross oh wow that was that was
nice it slipped in right and underneath
the radar there it'll break right out of
their chest and scream and run away and
grow so wait are we not talking about
aliens no but we could build ya later
talk about John heard all of this oh
dude John Hurt all of this is not
related relate to the Lumia 1520 but I
want to let everybody know if you're
waiting for our review on that you'll be
waiting a little while longer everything
kind of got turned on its head this week
and it really shows no sign of getting
back together properly so don't worry
we'll have that review out it's just
going to take us a bit I know we were
late already on it so we apologize for
that but circumstances beyond our
control and so on and so forth what is
the nokia normandy stephen chang that's
a very good question uh it looks like
it's going to be an Asha device which is
unfortunate because this name first came
to our attention a couple weeks back
when good old f leaks released a bunch
of code names normandy among them and
then a couple days later followed up
with a very cryptic tweet calling
normandy the missing link and so we read
while the speculation on what that could
possibly mean between what what my heart
was on it being like we were just
talking about some co2 crossover windows
RT windows phone 8 device but then a
render showed up this week and it is
very clearly an Asha device it's got
that Asha less than sign looking back
button on there I thought that was part
of efflux watermark for some reason no
no that's that's on there oh and it
matches up what we've seen from actual
devices in the past I me it looks decent
and that it's going to have a widescreen
display
a lot of the recent ones from novia have
been four by three so that's good and
it's sort of it's going to be where
Microsoft is leading us into we don't
know what's going to do with that
actually I acquired it as part of this
nokia deal and we remains to be seen if
it's going to be like an introduction to
Windows Phone if they're going to try to
make it look and feel a little more like
it to sort of get people into the
platform what doesn't make that much
sense for me because we already have
these entry-level devices like the the
520 or the 545 now it's unclear how it's
going to fit into Microsoft's line up
the important thing is it looks a lot
like Lumia devices they already started
that I think with the 501 they got those
bright colors like noumea things but now
you know the screen layout and
everything it's a cohesive design
language I think you you were on to
something Steven when you talked about
the relationship between ash and Windows
Phones Microsoft was kind of quoted as
as calling Asha and on-ramp to Windows
Phone yeah after the acquisition so
that's interesting I keep forgetting
that they got the IQ I I don't know why
but and yeah i was i was convinced that
this was something that nokia was gonna
retain hold on yeah sure yeah oh it's
just feature phones right right every
think it's because we're so used to
treating Asha like yeah I think you're
right but you were about to say
something I the 525 that's official and
we're excited about that why because
it's upgrade from the 520 the most
popular Windows Phone of all time
apparently it's a little more sand it
has I think double the ramp the 512 so
you're gonna have a yeah that's not just
a little yes that's quite a bit it's not
12 I have 512 megabytes of RAM in a
little worker yeah that's the thing I
think that that's a very significant
boost because the 512 megs of ram was a
big choke point for some apps to run
like some apps would not load right they
were restricted from loading on phones
with less than a gig of ram so I think
that's a really good move but in
exchange like the the price looks to be
it's a hundred ninety-nine bucks I mean
it's 100 others more than the 520 isn't
it yeah but this I mean that was the a
translation from singapore dollars we
don't know if that's what
to be everywhere okay it could be able
to lower your right it's a lot more to
ask and that really knocks it out of
this SuperDuper crazy affordable realm
and we're now competing with devices and
it might struggle with yeah so be in the
android guy we're going from an
inexpensive 512 ram based system to one
that's probably going to have a gig of
ram and Google is doing kind of the
opposite with their latest version of
Android optimizing it so that it will
run on as little as 512 megabyte exactly
it's the app is right right when it's
fun never needed the help really down it
at that those low ram counts it's the
other apps i don't think we have that
dewy on android what like an appt appt
minimum hardware requirements i'm sure
you can't asphalt feed on yeah exactly
like I wouldn't want to take a galaxy
ace and try and load like modern combat
on it you can run three frames per
minute on that bed alright exactly like
I've ever even run 3d mark on like what
on some some really low end I think I
tried to run it on one of the 01 of the
mid-range androids that I can't remember
anyway and it would just stutter through
its show and I'm like oh this is rough
so yeah I don't know if you uh how you
say have a leg to stand on Charlie I
just think it's interesting that we see
a migration from a low-end Windows Phone
up to one gig and we see Google going
the opposite direction so I'm wondering
if that well I was going to say if
that's going to eat into the the windows
phone user base but don't make don't
make the easy joke joke I just don't go
there I meant it without being humorous
I think that price though has to be
wrong because it's got a 512 megabytes
arandis as a component so we does not
cost Mia what's that cost about like
like 14 bucks yeah it's like a
ten-dollar chip versus a five dollars or
whatever right yeah then again I made
apple has no it doesn't have any blushes
about marking stuff up when they
when they double storage so maybe the
520 will remain as the super cheap
option this would guess p for people who
have the disposable incumbent another
hundred bucks doesn't really matter like
us learning around your money or moto
g's yeah yeah last piece in the puzzle
there is a is a tablet peace and I
understand it's not good news I have
actually read this with my maybe if you
can be distinct maybe if you would cool
off a little bit okay so i actually have
read this one so the issue that we have
here is there are reports that the
surface to and some surface pro 2 are
overheating and are exhibiting a very
interesting side effect of that and in
fact an unnecessary and potentially
unintended side effect once the
processor reaches a certain thermal
threshold the display will dim because
okay because why should reduce radiated
to reduce like radiated thermal stuff
from yet does the display create heat
when it's on right the quote in the
article says surface devices may dim the
screen as thermal temperatures rise from
extended nice temperatures as opposed to
non thermal temperature is high cpu
intensive activities like gaming in some
scenarios that this does not appear
necessary we're working on a tuning
update that will remove this unnecessary
dimming event I want that this is
necessary this is the most like flight
attendant he amazing ever remember
saying unnecessary words in their
closest exits may be behind you right
you can expect this update in an
upcoming windows update package in the
meantime allow the surface to cool down
for a minute or so in order to return
the screen to previous brightness levels
sure well this is really weird it is a
weird scent very odd phrasing it's like
it was translated or something yeah it's
kind of bizarre and I somebody trying to
hit a minimum word counters I don't know
no against slipping back into my weapon
to my software developed I was Stephen
Stephen was trying to say something from
its not acknowledging at all that this
overheating is
problem it's just that when the display
gets dim that's the issue it sounds like
they're ignoring the root cause here
well no it's not that there's an
overheating issue per se it's just
hating okay it's it's a sorry making
sure that happens when there's a
temperature related thermal event so so
exactly the dev would do like a quick
and dirty hack and let him know when the
hardware 22 hot that was left in the
code base by accident this is not seem
like a very user focused so this could
be something that's a leftover from some
other version of Windows or some other
version of a graphics driver or who
knows what I'm speaking from my previous
life as a system integrator Intel did
something interesting with their
processors that AMD did not do with
theirs back in the what pentium 4 and
earlier days when your system was
running very very hot of course the fan
would ramp up speed and it would get all
kinds of crazy noisy but to help from a
burning the processor out and physically
melting down Intel's would throttle the
processor they would run the thing
slower so it wouldn't put off as much
heat AMD on the other hand said screw it
you want me to run this fast I'm just
gonna burn myself a hole in the ground
if that's what you want me to do so
AMD's were faster than Intel's back then
because they did not thermally throttle
so when you run into a thermal case like
this a thermal issue there are some
things you can do you can run the
processor slower you can run the RAM
slower you can turn off the lights in
the display because they do put out heat
especially the old fashioned lights the
fluorescent lights instead of the other
LED answer these are LEDs right yeah so
it could be just a leftover format but
another thing that happens when systems
run really hot especially battery
powered ones they suck down power the
hotter it gets the more power it takes
more the more resistance there is yeah
exactly so they could be doing that to
say hey we don't want to suck down
and make the whole heating problem more
problematic so let's scale back
everything we can make 17 for brightness
Beijing resistance decrease with heat no
no cuz superconducting magnets yeah yeah
yeahs bridge arena it's all about the
ball bearings nowadays you know that's
right it's always been the case that is
educational I hope it gets fixed soon I
do not have a surface to so personally I
can only hope in absentia yeah and Jaime
sums it up really well he says if you
currently own either of these tablets
just make sure to keep an eye for this
problem and hopefully Microsoft won't be
so Microsoft when it comes to the speed
at which they deliver this update you
know I was wondering who wrote this
piece and then when i read that line i
was like oh oh it's a time apo that's
that's hiding I've ever bear oh by the
way if you're wondering where he is on
the podcast we've been trying to get him
on he's in the middle of some very
complicated stuff so he will be on as
soon as we can get him on the show but
he's been having some internet issues as
a result of an office move so office
relocation office relocation will put
you out of business unless you're Taylor
Martin in which case you go in a day and
then you film a video on the same day
and you know it shen you go on vacation
because you've earned us yeah i thought
his office was the coffee shop across
the street well that's one of his
officers yeah it's becoming one of my
office's I'm starting to work from the
dunkin donuts near my place cuz i'm
fancy guys Nancy SH man's I think we've
talked enough we've hit the hour mark I
think it's time that we heard from our
readers wouldn't you agree absolutely
yeah well good well at that straw poll
having come out three in favor 0 against
it's time for listener mail bong bong
bong bong bong yeah so Joe you have some
some letters that you've picked out why
don't you tell us what they are yes well
first of all thank you so much for these
letters I picked two and I could have
picked easily 10 times that so many
people asked Joe questions and listening
now I feel so bad because you're never
on so my question would be great for Joe
well and it they weren't just addressed
to me it was just really really good
question so we've got like some of the
best audience out there in the hole
world so sure do you guys are awesome
and you're very patient with our
listener mail habits in particular
because if we heard it all before we
don't always have time for it but thank
you for sending them and we read every
piece guys we just can't get to all them
and we're sorry about that so without
further ado Joe who's the lucky first
person to be read today so the first one
that I'm gonna read comes to us from
jonathan michael he asks i would like to
ask your thoughts if the current
smartphone resolutions of 1080p is
enough no it's not enough is never
enough that's me right there it just
annoys me when OMS try to push higher
screen resolutions without improving
batteries yes it annoys us too I think
the current full HD 1080p is enough and
anything beyond that is just pointless
some OMS are in talks of a 4k display
inside a phone while that's nice I can
guarantee it will drain the battery in
the current 1500 to 3000 milliamp hour
lithium-ion batteries furthermore how
much I'm going to rephrase this how much
is a phone going to cost that uses a 4k
screen for case samsung tvs cost i think
there's a comma in there forty thousand
dollars and it's only for rich people
and saudi arabian princes mmm does it
mean a phone would cost 20 grand sign
Jonathan Michael so all right there's so
much in here and I've just to say I had
this conversation just last night and
end today and I keep having this
conversation like I gave remember that
phone we have been talking about a
little bit it's called the g flex and
yeah i mentioned once or twice I gave it
to my friend on the couch today Chris my
good friend Chris and I was like hey man
check this out and he's like I love it
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and I
was like turn on that display he's like
oh that's a beautiful panel I'm like
what do you what do you think the
resolution is on that it's like it is it
a 1080 and like what he was it look like
he's like well it looks like a 1080 like
nah man that's the 720p panel and he's
like not a layman like he's it really
into particularly Android devices he
owns a droid DNA so he knows what a
1080p panel looks like I think that if
you went up to people i said this last
week if you want to reveal on the
sidewalk it wouldn't be able to tell the
difference by and large between a 1080p
and 720p panel
not saying there is no difference but I
think most people couldn't tell the
difference I do not see the need for a
fork a panel on a phone gentlemen agree
or disagree with you thanks that's all
you got done gone you got more than that
no he's right porque I can't tell the
difference between 1080p on the Nexus 5
and the 720p nexus 4 I maybe I'm not
running the right apps to you know make
this difference clearer but it's the
same thing I could not care less or more
I could not care about pushing
resolution higher than it currently is
yeah me that I'm in the same boat what
about you Joe do you disagree I will be
the contrarian good we we ask this
question about 720p when we were
thinking that when we were just barely
getting 720p in the really really high
end phones and the question was brought
up what about 1080p do we need 1080p in
a smartphone will we ever get it will it
drain our batteries will it be hideous
and terrible will it make small children
cry and the answers to all of those were
yes we actually got 1080p in smartphones
yes there's a difference and it's
beautiful especially when we're talking
about phablet resolutions compared to
just regular smaller sized smartphone
resolutions does it eat up battery more
yeah it does they're just more pixels to
push and when we're talking about 4k
compared to 1080p that's like a whole
heck of a lot more pixels to push the
last point is to price is it going to
cost more initially yes it's going to
cost more but the bottom line is this
all comes down to not necessarily how
many peas but how many DP is and there
comes a point where you can't tell the
difference in the dots on the screen I
can see a difference between my nexus 4
and my Nexus 5 the nexus 5 screen looks
cleaner it looks sharper it looks better
am I going to see that on a 4k screen
probably not but my eyes are
significantly less detail oriented dense
a Brendan
men's eyes are and yeah different people
see things differently it's it's a
physical thing so some people are going
to like it and some people are not where
I think the big question is chipsets
like the 805 the Snapdragon 805
supporting 4k that's going to happen
especially as we get more and more
connectivity to two big screens because
once you're talking about a large screen
not just one that fits in your hand but
something that's mounted to a wall are
sitting on a desk that's where 4k is
really important and we're going to have
the ability to drive content from our
devices onto those screens and I think
that's where it's all going to go back
to my defense of 720p for a moment yeah
for me and this is will vary based on
who you are and where you get the media
you can soon from nearly everything that
I'm watching on my phone is in 720p and
I'm just not that much content available
1080p that I'm seeing out there and I'm
really particular about my video quality
and unless there's a very good reason
not to I want to display video in the
exact pixel by pixel size that the
source was I don't like it scaled at all
so even though the 1080p is a higher
resolution screen I'm uncomfortable
about the fact that it's 720p stuff
being scaled up to 1080p and this is
just going to be compounding we have 4k
screens and everything scaled up even
more I'd much rather have unless there
is a overwhelming availability of
content in that resolution I don't want
it on my phone when you're talking video
content when you're talking textual just
reading tasks and quality that
definitely needs a solution so that's
that's what I'm really looking forward
to well how can you say like I look at a
1080p panel now I've read books all the
time on my Kindle on tap on a 1080p
panel more often than not I i mean i
will bring my eyeball within millimeters
of the screen to see if i can see the
pixels in the seraphs of an F and I will
never be able to see if my eyes are only
going to get worse from here on out and
my eyes are excellent
can't see any freaking pixels it takes
is have to get the macro lens out of the
box slap it on to the camera and then
focus yeah you know I mean like I just
don't understand what this is going to
do for us I did say that Joe you're
right about one thing I did say the same
thing between 720 and 1080 P and then
when I got the droid DNA I was like wow
I can't exactly put it into words but
there's something there is something
there that would all right now I I just
don't know if that will happen with with
for with the jump to 4k I think that
manufacturers will be very shrewd and
they will include out-of-the-box
wallpapers that will take advantage of
the added resolution to make you say oh
my god truly this is beautiful but I
think if you were to load two devices up
side by side with the same graphics
package same resolution the same icon
iconography same layout and one in 720p
in the others 1080p I would almost put
money on it that regular people wouldn't
be able to tell the difference Jen's
people are going to be buying these
things based on specs and perpetuating
this notion that mine is bigger because
I have better specs on my phone and
that's just stupid I got more peas
exactly that's lame I think it's dumb so
let's take this back from today and 4k
and 1080p and put it into realistic
terms and that is the 1080p and 720p if
you have a smartphone that is 720p do
not discount it as being bad or not act
high enough it's still gorgeous
especially rain sub 5 inch displays yes
alright and even on a six inch display
if you curve it FYI there you go there
you go I'm such a shy old today you get
a bigger talent a 10 inch tablet may be
4k has a place but i wanna for four and
a half inch smartphone no very good
point we neglected to take display size
into account or not a tablet this could
make all the difference i completely
agree because then we are back to what
really matters and that is dots per inch
bingo so Steven did you select thank you
for the question by the way Jonathan
Michael thank you very much for writing
in and thank you Joe for leading the
dancer round on that whoo Steven did you
happen to pick a mail yet no and I've
been trying to read through somebody's
as we're talking here my
rain has awful reading and listening at
the same time of the castle right I can
multitask either but that being the case
why didn't Steven why don't you redouble
your efforts I will attempt to find my
own piece of listener mail to listen to
listeners normally as you know normally
we pick these out ahead of time but as
you also know it's been a busy week Joe
bring us to the second piece will you
please yes this one is from multi yes
like the island my question regards the
new host card emulation feature in
KitKat 4.4 if I understand it correctly
developers can now emulate whatever
smart card etc they want because the
scare part of the NFC chip which is
still only available to Google Wallet
not entirely true but we'll get to that
is not needed anymore do any of you guys
know what that means for security
matters my search brought up some
advices for developers to use the
Android sandbox but I have two major
concerns first I never came to
completely trust androids way of
restraining apps contrary to iOS a
sandbox system and second that would
really speak against routing one's
device right thanks for your input and
keep up the fantastic work greetings
from germany so do you guys want to take
a stab at that or do you want me to get
right into use multi i have nothing to
say about that so i will abstain Steven
sounds like he wants to say something
though I dabbled in some of the Google
developer pages when they announced the
speech you're looking at you know the
system calls used to access it doesn't
emulate every smart card it only it's
specifically tailored to these wireless
payment things is not going to plug it
into your directv box and anyway the
card on there um cool it would be cool
but I don't know about I think it was
getting to us how does this store the
card information because it used to be
the secure element on the kid was a
sequestered bit of hardware that apps on
your phone couldn't readily access it
can read information from it and so as a
result your payment information felt
very secure if this is being done in
software though that can't easily be the
case I don't know about the specifics of
how it's being stored I'm hoping that
it's nothing it's just like an encrypted
version on your
and even having that it's going to be
useless without the keys on the payment
server somewhere else Joe do you know
with any more specificity what's going
on from a high level yes and a lot of
this question focuses on low level so
let's keep it high and then we can dig
into it and go from there originally
when Google release NFC on their stuff
one of the main things they wanted to do
was include an NFC payment solution and
Google Wallet is that solution it has
met with varying level of success and
the one of the biggest things was what
would eventually become known as Isis
where those group of carriers that back
Isis which is a competing digital wallet
they did not want to give Google Wallet
or Google itself access to the secure
element which I like the way you put
that it's a sequestered piece of
hardware on the device that stored very
very secure keys for encryption and all
that fun stuff essentially think of it
as your credit card numbers stored on
your phone and it's stored in a special
place that's not what it is but that'll
give you kind of an idea they didn't
want to give up control of Isis and said
no you can't put Google Wallet on here
because there was only one thing you
could store in that that secure element
it was what it was and only one solution
could use it which meant if you install
Google Wallet you can't use Isis and
then the carriers aren't going to be the
middleman that are getting a bit of
every single payment that goes through
that and of course this is all about
being getting money it's sad but that's
the way business works sometimes so fast
forward a little bit Google Wallet did
its own thing Isis kind of came around
they're still struggling and then we saw
the 2013 Nexus 7 which oh my crimey it
has an NFC chip but not a secure element
and the sky is falling and why did they
do that and is Google Wallet doomed and
now we see Android 4.4 with KitKat and
this smart card emulation
host card emulation essentially what it
does is it takes out of this sequestered
component on the phone everything that
needs to happen to do the same thing
that that sequestered element on the
phone did so now you can have multiple
wallets multiple cards multiple whatever
right there that pulls from a very
tightly encrypted piece of software
rather than encrypted piece of hardware
which i think is actually a little bit
more secure but that's my opinion so now
you can do all of this and have multiple
cards multiple different things on there
you can have google wallet and Isis
running side by side if Isis use this
which eventually they probably will and
tada everything's beautiful and now you
can use your 2013 Nexus 7 as a Google
Wallet even though it doesn't have that
secure element that's that's a terribly
convenient thing to do no no it's not I
don't know why anyone would but that
goes back to what we had and it's no
longer a worry or a concern the one
major thing this email doesn't touch on
that this lets you do is it lets that
new element if you will the soft element
in there the the host card emulation be
on the other end of the payment rather
than just here I'm a card take my
information charge me this much money
now it can be the cash register I'll say
hi oh I'm now the checkout terminal and
you can tap your card on the back of me
oh it's like somewhere without a
hardware component without I'm gonna
swipe at home without a very white wall
and being significantly more secure so
at some point in the future we could end
up with small business solutions such
that you can have a Google powered and
you know an Android device a smartphone
as your cash register if you're like a
roadside flower cart or something like
that and people to have their phone to
yours even the sandwich stop that I go
to they check out on an iPad and yes
they have a card swiper on the side of
they got a card swiper yeah I know I
mean I those all the time without
without your just change their their
rates for things I think
they race them above little and I'm sure
people are turning this type of thing
set now that would be fascinating that
is a really comprehensive answer Joe
thank you this is why I'm on the show
last thing there is to to answer the
question about rooting ones device
because this is now a software feature
unless you're talking about decompiling
the the keys of what not inside Google
Wallet which theoretically one could do
I think this is going to be even more
secure than just somehow obtaining
access to a physical component on the
device because now you've got to be able
to get into the software I've always put
more trust in in software security than
hardware security and again that's my
opinion but I don't think that this will
sway anyone from routing their device
nor should it and if we look at the old
way of doing things where there was that
physical secure element in the device if
you went through and rooted you might
brick your secure element which i did on
a Galaxy Nexus and never be able to use
it again because you lost a liar yeah
it's a bad thing so this fixes that I
hope with dimension Isis is doing things
differently Isis is having fuse Isis you
have to get a new sim for your phone
that has the secure thing on that oh
that's stupid okay so that's still
hardware yeah and my wife just got one
of those for her nexus 4 we have not set
it up yet but we do have an Isis
compatible sim for it they did that
essentially because no one else was
including these that secure element in
the hardware of the device and it gives
them more control when it's inside the
sim I'm curious have you guys ordered
your google wallet cards yet I got mine
today didn't I haven't gotten mine yet
no I know no I don't need one I have
zero balance in my google play a game I
like hard to my wallet I don't I mean I
yeah I get that I like that Stephen I
did that that's basically the only
reason I'd rotor one like Taylor posted
an image of his on Instagram the other
day and I was like no I mean like the
whole thing I understand why it exists
i'm not obtuse but
I'm also a little stubborn in that nerdy
kind of way were you know we've all just
spent the last 15 minutes talking about
a mobile payment system that allows you
to pay for something using your
smartphone that's what interests me
that's cool like tapping my phone to
something and having magical invisible
money taken out of my phone and put into
another person's account so that I can
walk home with some gummy bears I mean
that's rad that was still one of my
favorite videos I made for pocket now is
that Google Wallet video its CBS I love
that yeah i mean that's fun to me I have
no interest in carrying around yet
another stupid plastic card to put in my
dumb leather wallet no no that's that's
just it you're missing the point I am I
am you you are so you can i'm seriously
ignoring the point and running away but
any water any card that you want that
supported big asterisk there in to your
google wallet now and utilize that as
your source of lending right so if you
have a card it's just but you know got a
plastic card i don't care about but if
you have four of those in your wallet
right now then I do now can replace them
with that one no no our only draws funds
from your google balance it doesn't take
money out of your credit cards that yeah
did what yeah i'll come back to that
because it's getting kind of weird the
way they're doing it they declined to me
twice today because i didn't have any
money in my account but it's tied to my
bank account which it's always
automatically debited before so I don't
know yeah that's a complicated with some
complicated ish but regardless if it
works that way if it doesn't work that
way I don't want another stupid plastic
card hanging around I want to pay for
things with my phone because phones are
way cooler than plastic cards yes my
thoughts the Digital side of that once
you can look at all the transactions on
your phone and have tracking and
budgeting and categorization all that
stuff and you can pay for stuff
someplace that doesn't have that smart
reader that you know they don't have the
NFC terminal there and you can get those
same features with a physical card that
they can swipe that's the bridge right
now it's a temporary bridge but that's
the right place I just want to walk into
places and just be like just charge it
to my account
just know me you'll use ibeacon and
Google Wallet will become irrelevant and
we'll just walk in and they'll give us
our stuff and we'll leave and what will
already be charged for you let's just
throw it the whole money thing we're
gonna go to a surplus based economy you
didn't look too much next-gen I have
indeed we're gonna get food replicators
is going to be great nobody's going to
pay for anything even in ten-forward I
have a question that is suited for well
suited for Joe a multi thank you again
for your question how you guys says
Joseph Fallon from Kildare Ireland a
long time listener from Ireland loved
the show you guys Rock thanks Joe
appreciate it here's my question folks
how come android is so mysterious about
system versus internal disk my note 2 0
keeps complaining about lack of system
disk disk space yet there's gigabytes
free on my internal SD is there some
sort of magical secret system partition
on the internal SD how does one clear
that sucker specifically many thanks in
advance yours sincerely Joe from kill
there I can't think of a more perfect
question for Joe Levi it's that's a big
question alright wait I want to ask you
Joe and ask you a favor we don't have
much time left I know you can condense
it a little bit i'm gonna keep you to
five minutes on this one if you're i
will do my absolute best what's even
what device visits again this is a
galaxy note 2 up to okay complaining
about a lack of system disk space yeah
there's gigabytes free and the internal
st joe go so there are several different
things at play here and let's try and
whack them out as quickly as possible
because i like using a weed whacker
quick as you read why is what goodness
soon as i said that i knew you were
going there yeah you have physical SD
cards that that is analogous to an
external storage right all right some
devices support them you can put them
into your phone you can use them most of
them you cannot install applications to
for various reasons we saw the big
differentiation there if you way back in
the gingerbread days if you installed an
app to your SD card you could not
utilize any widgets that it had because
they had to be on the inter against when
yeah I remember that so they kind of
took away the ability for you to do that
at all and now unless you've got an oem
who's enabled that stock Android will
not let you install an app to your SD
card you're just out of luck just so
ridiculous yes then to confuse things
anymore there are SD cards that are not
SD cards they are not removable they are
integrated into the system essentially
soldered onto the board a lot of the
same limitations exist there you know
not being able to install apps to them
and whatnot but because they are more
stable meaning they're not going to be
randomly removed at some point in time
there by having to put in a whole bunch
of code to watch for that and handle
those exceptions when they happen a lot
of OEMs will let you install there and
then you have internal storage so
there's the three types of storage right
there and we are essentially talking
about the the most recent to that i
mentioned internal storage and internal
SD okay now we got to talk about linux
and file partitions Jesus I know you
didn't know you were getting into this
one you asked this so I'm running out of
my final visit you are you are you have
these bins are responsible demons thank
you have 50 seconds to talk about Linux
great ok so these partitions you have
different segments of the disk that disk
in Linux doesn't have to be the same
physical media so you can set a
partition being here on your physical
memory and here on your internal SD card
and map them accordingly and everything
is fine that's what most OEM s have done
so your SD card is sitting over there
and it's just a pointer to that place
and you can install stuff to it and
store stuff to it and all kinds of cool
stuff the system partition that's
generally what you think about when
you've got a ROM or a system update it's
pushing the system the operating system
into that partition and that's where a
whole bunch of the stuff goes and it's
protected and it's got layers of
security around it so that you don't get
hacked and all kinds of stuff and it's
very special and you don't mess with it
except OEMs put a whole bunch of crap in
there that's where the blow where it
goes and the carrier stuff
everything yeah most of the time they're
putting it in there and then when you
get an over-the-air update say from the
Play Store a lot of times it's not
overriding the stuff that's in the
system partition it's just putting a new
point in there so you're wasting space
after updates it's a pain and I don't
like it and really the only way around
that is by routing and stripping out
what you don't want custom roms are your
salvation in that case and there's
really no pretty way to put it but
that's that's my master's thesis in five
minutes wow so basically the end point
is that in order to overcome this
inherent deficiency in modern Android
devices you need to install a custom rom
or at the very least route so that you
can go in and start modifying the
contents of that system partition it's
not an inherent deficiency it's an
efficient it's a problem that was
designed into the system it's a feature
of Linux that Android gets and it's a
very important feature but one that a
lot of OEM s don't fully understand
because they're driven by marketing
rather than driven by us geeks that's a
excellent way to put it up yeah Wow all
right well I will take your word for it
I just now for everyone who's gonna
comment on this or anyone's gonna write
in cuz I know I'm gonna get a whole
bunch yes i know i have five minutes
okay you had only five s that's a bit
it's not Joe's fault you must blame me
is you must blame me its much my fault
Joe thank you for confining it after
they're done Joseph Fallon thank you
very much for writing in thank you for
the awesome question I must confess I
understood only about 75% of Joe's
answer but I'll that means you're
improving shut up wow wow Friday night
burns Joe Levi on PocketNow nights just
thank you again Steven you will be
closing out the show with your piece of
listener mail I hope you picked a good
one I pick one it seems like a good one
this is like okay we have on keye TV
you're writing in saying hey guys really
enjoy your show it can't help but agree
with Taylor Taylor's thoughts on Windows
Phone 8 well yeah there's a small
guy so that's there you go what he's
wearing on the Hat yes keep up the good
work so thanks for that i nee rights
Samsung is such a huge phone
manufacturer I mean it won't be wrong to
say that Android got its first major
Bush due to this very company also only
Samsung has the audacity to go up
against apple head on then my question
is why can't they correct their software
update process I mean iphone 4 from 2011
gets iOS 7 in galaxy s3 from 2012 is
stuck on 4.1 point to Samsung needs to
correct its act and these afraid the
same might happen with us for when the
s5 comes out let's know what we think
about all this I'm Keith I think you're
being a little harsh on samsung here I
mean it's not getting updates out as
quickly as another Motorola maybe but
it's working on them we're seeing 4.3
going out for the galaxy s3 right now I
also have to realize Samsung makes a
crapload of different bones and I'm not
not just talking about you know separate
models like the galaxy s3 vs. the note 2
or something galaxy s3 alone you're
looking at like a dozen different
hardware variants there it takes a while
to put this software together and that's
not even considering the efforts you
have to go through with delivering these
updates to carriers having them yeah
I'll takes time so I he should be
cutting them a little bit of a break so
i can i can speak to that when it when i
first when I found out that this is the
one you picked Steven I was initially
disappointed cuz it seems like we talked
about this issue all the time but I have
some added insight to add i think so i'm
glad i know'd and when he did I was a
good thing Michaels on the podcast isn't
it oh man haven't missed one of these
ones I do I was speaking with a
manufacturer recently who gave some
insight into the process and this is
basically what happens when google
announces or releases a new version of
Android so when they Annette when google
announces it with very few exceptions
that's actually when the OEM gets the
software so it's it's not often that the
OEM gets early access to the software
when it's announced that's when they get
it except in the cases of google play
edition devices and even then
they can't use that software as a base
for their skins so it's not you know
they don't have as much had lead time as
you think the OEM then needs time to
work with the specific hardware make the
software work with specific hardware
then on top of that you've got the
carrier testing and the technical honing
and stuff and the carriers will also
charge the OEMs for testing fees so
anytime the the OEM wants to be like
okay the software is ready will you test
this they actually have to pay the
carrier to do that and so this operates
to make fewer updates overall a smarter
move financially and then there's just
this ridiculous number of skews to keep
up with to update all the different
carrier and region variants and internal
employees don't even start with their
kind of internal alpha and internal beta
testing until the four or six week mark
so you know this is a really big problem
obviously is a big sticking point for
consumers and I think consumers have
been conditioned to get skeptical
because sometimes the update will be
delayed so long that if it lands it's no
longer up to date and sometimes it just
never lands and that's when it's a real
big problem that's when I think these
OEMs are truly in the wrong but how long
those updates take to roll out also
depend on how intense the changes are
within the various Android versions so
there's so many variables at work here I
don't think you can really it's popular
to beat up on one manufacturer or
another in the comments but truth be
told they've all been excellent at one
point they've all been awful at one
point and I don't see that changing
anytime soon so well that's it's a good
run down right now one thing to include
in there is the way Apple does it Apple
has been able to through exclusivity
they've been able to negotiate with the
carrier's to essentially avoid a big
chunk of that by doing so they say if
you want to carry our device on your
network then this is the way you're
going to play games or that's okay we'll
just take our insanely popular product
somewhere else and you won't have it and
well then we can renegotiate when you
decide that you made a bad choice and
essentially that's the way it's done a
lot of people might think
that's heavy handed I agree but what the
carriers are doing by saying you want us
to test this and certify it for our
network you have to pay us that's
extortion you have to pay to get a
security update their it it it just
creates an environment where it dis
incentivizes the manufacturer from ever
releasing any updates for those devices
ever is it pronounced a disincentive I
was floored when I heard that almost
fell out of my chair I was like really
yeah so it literally is extortion I mean
they should be remembering all over that
yeah I don't know about that but I just
know that the disincentive is remarkable
it's like wow okay if you ever needed a
reason for why some updates just never
get pushed out it's like wow well we
could save X number of thousands of
dollars on testing fees if we just why
not do it and I'm sure that's you know
maybe this isn't as big a deal as we're
talking I mean that's that's peanuts
even to a struggling Oh am i but I don't
know what they charge and I thought
that's there's got to be a better way to
be doing things the way we are now I
mean I doesn't always look better than
that even I know we always look to or I
always look to comparisons to the pc
world but a new version of Linux comes
out it's not tested on every possible
hardware configuration Under the Sun
before its release it just it comes out
and you put it on your machine and it
works we need to be looking to a
smartphone update process that's very
similar it's right divorce the radio
code from the rest of this take the
carrier's out of the process altogether
so I will get right back to that but the
one thing the one point I want to make
before we go over there is apple and the
way they're doing it a lot of people
myself just a moment ago included said
Apple is doing it the right way but and
there is that big but I cannot lie so
you've you've got there you go that took
me as second yeah I was thinking you say
look joke this this is very very old
iphone just got iOS 7 no it didn't you
may think that that's iOS 7 and you may
think this is what iOS 7 is but it is a
very different version of iOS 7 4
that old iphone that it is for the brand
new one yeah there's a lot of features
in iOS 7 as far as the consumer is
concerned there are a lot of features
that aren't there there are a lot of
features that don't work the same way
there's a lot of stuff that just isn't
the same so even though they're calling
it iOS 7 even though it looks like iOS 7
it is very very different it's not the
one utopian update that everyone thinks
it is that that the you know that the
Apple fans are saying well my olden can
run iOS 7 but yours isn't running the
latest version no it's not it's running
a slimmed-down handicapped version of
the software but they don't want to tell
you that because that's the inconvenient
truth well I think they don't want to
talk about it because it's not really
relevant to the end user it looks like
it looks the same it basically functions
the same except it's really really slow
compared on newborns you say it just
look the same it looks very similar well
iOS 7 of 4s versus iOS 7 or 50 I theme
in iOS 7 verses 6 like you know yeah no
no no no I mean yeah so just keep that
in mind it's it's not apples to apples
pun very much intended there's some
difference there all right what's the
final point there my final point is
going to what Stephen said in battle
it's seven points that's exactly what
Google is doing they are decoupling
everything that they can from the
operating system that has to be pushed
through and over the air update Play
services and stuff in pulling it into
services pulling it into apps pulling it
into we're gonna see that Google
Experience launcher that'll hit the
market you guys watch and see it's it's
nice enough and easy enough to install
just from an APK and that's going to go
in the market and when that kind of
stuff starts happening more and more the
updates are going to happen through the
Play Store distribution channel rather
than through that whole carrier approval
testing yada yada it's going to become
less and less important about what
version of Android you're running and
what everything else looks like the
totality of the apps the core apps that
you're running so it's not the Linux
thing that Steven's talking about and I
agree with that but getting linux on
your computer even going from windows 7
windows 8 on your computer doesn't have
to go through the certification because
it's not coupled to that network that
wireless cellular network that they are
so freaked out about anybody realizing
how fragile it is or how robust it is if
it's fragile we're all going to freak
out and if it's really robust then we're
going to demand that it be cheaper
better faster so they're in a no-win
scenario with that they've got to
protect that through obscurity that's
why they have the control with the the
certifications for all the devices
Steven I was going to say I like drive
around with a Jacob's Ladder in the back
of my car just a mess with reception so
does you know then you'll like this way
off topic and I am finally finally
buying the parts that I need to modify
my old linksys wrt54g so that i can use
it with my ham radio license and send
that Wi-Fi signal 10 20 30 miles hey you
are a crazy person is that even legal
under part 15 of the FCC codes no
however seven which I can use with my
ham radio license absolutely I know
you're gonna be my Wi-Fi signal and then
you're gonna drive 40 miles just to see
if you can use it I'll see that's the
thing it don't you read it setups on the
other end to receive oh so true right
because your phone can't be the you need
an active partner in the communication
because your phone can broadcast 40
miles exactly so you get this really
cool parabolic dish and you can throw
the signal way out now that's the
downside to that I can't stream anything
over it like music or movies or anything
but I man I can moderate I that one has
a max capacity of 54 megabit per second
I believe and they're seeing realistic
throughputs in the 30s at 10 to 20 miles
that should be a weather report and like
from in the future we should get Wi-Fi
I'm baud rate forecasts
and Chicago we're seeing fruit put in
the 20s and low 30s exact it Rob morning
legacies however reaching an all-time
high we have definitely reached that
point heavenly eyes beautiful well
that's what makes pocket now what it is
we cover such a white rat wide swath and
as I was as you were speaking Joe just
now I was falling asleep yes I no no I
was wide awake but I was hefting my HP
TouchPad but surely sits in the corner
of my booth providing some nice
background elimination for my videos and
I was just remarking at how far we've
come in a very short time because that
thing as a piece and it's a tank and I
saw that my black friday deal roundup
amazon still sorta creative them
somewhere but oh wow idea yeah you
shouldn't buy one and it is anyway yeah
so it's just wonderful how far we've
come I'm quite thankful for the fact
that not only that we continue to come
very far very quickly and no mobile tech
but that we three and the other six
dudes on the team get to report on it
for a job because that's a lot of fun so
I'm very thankful for y'all and from
Madeira I forgot the most important
person on the team hood who the pocket
now reader / listener oh you're right
I'm very thankful for our excellent
listener base who sent us some wonderful
mail as they always do thank you
everyone who wrote in and once again
thank you for everyone who wrote in but
we didn't get to and if you like right
against you keep writing in what we will
get to everyone's mail it's the monkeys
riding on million typewriters it was a
special edition reader mail dude it's
we're overdue for one and I keep saying
it and I really want to do it but next
week is not the time i'll be travelling
and maybe the week after and then one
thing that I don't want to take I was
gonna say good I'm good man oh my hip my
old man a hip is starting to hurt me Jay
look around in the stretch well when we
go through night no no whoa i'm off to
edit a video for two hours after the
show
goal so but I don't want people to go
away thinking that we pick out like four
emails and that's all we do I spent
quite a bit of time looking at all the
emails and the ones that I picked there
were about six or eight different people
that asked variations of those yeah we
just oh emmalin de yeah so yeah we're if
your question has already been asked by
somebody else but we're going to cover
one that's all in together so just
because yours wasn't the one we read we
on the air we still read it and we still
factored that into our responses and so
I'm right back in a larger font make it
blink email yeah yeah definitely and and
do to keep them brief we always say it
but but please do keep them brief
because it takes a lot of air time for
us to read them not as much air time as
it takes to keep talking exactly no yeah
no I've had a great time this week guys
thank you very much and I think it's
time we all signed off and headed off to
our friday nights what do you think f oh
wait how does that song go I don't know
yeah that sounds lovely that's all right
