pocket now calm so what we've seen so
far windows mobile 6.5 in the sliding
panel a home screen interface and there
are several videos up on our YouTube
channel that shows you this it doesn't
look like we can customize the home
screen sliding panels that much we can't
move them around we can't turn some of
them off it's not very customizable but
as we're finding out from XDA developers
developers can actually take advantage
of this interface they can add plugins
that can change the skin so so when
windows mobile 6.5 devices come out
there probably will be a lot of new
stuff coming out for the home screen
from developers so let's take a look at
two such things the first thing is a new
skin i'm going to show you called pyro
and what it does is it changes how the
background looks it changes the edges
here so you get this little flame and
it's got a nice effect to it and all of
the icons are a little bit different
than what is found on the standard
windows mobile 6.5 interface if you're
to the start menu of course you see the
flame background there now also i've
downloaded a plug-in called fav people
and here it is right here and I've got
some fake numbers in here and what it
allows me to do is flip through the
different people it shows you a little
picture it shows you the person's name
and you can flick your finger before the
standard windows mobile 6.5 sliding
panel screen doesn't have anything like
this and I think it's a really
convenient addition there are some other
ones floating on xda-developers that do
weather and that sort of thing so we
have some nice plugins to look forward
to once the development community really
starts going at windows mobile 6.5 for
more windows mobile 6.5 videos be sure
to check out our youtube channel at
youtube com slash pocket nail video
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
