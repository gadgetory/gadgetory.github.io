doorsteps and benchmarks the heck out of
it they get some interesting leaks
regarding the Google Nexus 5x in the
Samsung Galaxy s7 testing reveals a
newer Snapdragon 820 processor I'm hi
mera neta and I'm happy you don't hear
the noise but given the fact that I do
like that motorcycle that just passed I
have to apologize this is fargin out
daily the official news today start with
the iphone 6s as even though the product
is not supposed to arrive at door steps
until Friday we've got consumers that
are already claiming that it has arrived
at door steps at least one of them
apparently it was ordered through AT&amp;amp;T
this was the rose gold variant and up
instead of showing it off to its friends
what the customer did was actually
benchmark the heck out of it we got full
details on the 2 gigs of ram in addition
to the fact that this iphone is
apparently faster than every other ipad
that apple owns or has produced so yeah
it seems to be a good product and
speaking of specifications those of you
curious as to the LG Nexus 5x for google
I hate those names but anyways it seems
that amazon in india has already leaked
specifications or at least claims to
have done so we've got a product that's
not necessarily what we would call
high-end for these standards but not
necessarily bad at all i've got a 1080p
display with this into a snapdragon 808
processor the whole nine yards with the
camera and even though we still can't
confirm if it does have expandable
storage apparently will start at 16 gigs
linksys return for full details on what
it'll apparently bring and let us know
in the comments what you think about
these specs and since we are talking
about Google of those of you that don't
like that name google nexus 6p from
huawei or whatever that final name will
be it seems that will be it as there are
some links of the retail packaging
apparently it does look like a bad
photoshop job by the way but it could
just be a renter of the retail packaging
and yet the p is apparently part of the
design and the final name of the product
so let's just see if it does happen in
the end because i'm sure google come up
with a better name and even though the
LG g4 has barely been in the market for
the last couple of months we already get
rumors of the LG g5 since yeah companies
begin working on these products early
apparently we get two things in these
room
number one a Snapdragon 820 which is
expected and the second is apparently a
20-megapixel custom-made camera we don't
know exactly what will be custom-made
about this camera but LG did an amazing
job with the g4 so we can't wait to see
what we get here and finally for the
very hot rumors of the day just like we
talked about the LG g5 let's talk about
the samsung galaxy s7 we've been
covering the rumors that samsung is
considering going back to a snapdragon
here and well we do know that the
Snapdragon 820 should be the processor
but it seems that Samsung is testing a
new Snapdragon 820 a dash B variant
that's different to the dash 8th
apparently everybody else is getting and
this product is significantly faster
than the current one which is incredibly
interesting given the fact that
Snapdragon a Chinese haven't really
launched on products just yet but yet
apparently this product will be faster
but we are not sure exactly how else
will this product be better than
whatever xnl Samsung is going to bring
to the table remember we're still far
away from this announcement so it does
lead me to the question of the day
whenever you're buying a product I want
to know is it important for you that
this product has a Snapdragon processor
or not in my case it did for the Galaxy
Note lineup because we did notice
significant differences the Snapdragon
processor was better on the note
variance from the note 4 in past when
compared to the X and O's but now it
seems that the exit nose is good enough
leave us a comment down below is it
important to you friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is so
mature you follow us on out up
