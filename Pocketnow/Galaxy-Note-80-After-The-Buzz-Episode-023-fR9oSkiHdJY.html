new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take another look at a tablet
that's fallen off the back of the buzz
bandwagon I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8.0 and this is episode 23 of after
the buzz it came we saw it went that's
how it felt to track the launch of the
Galaxy Note 8.0 which we first got
hands-on time with at MWC in Barcelona
before giving it the full review
treatment here in the States but then
the no tape just kind of dropped off our
radar not until Samsung informed us that
they had review units of the American
version did our ears prick up again and
we took delivery on our demo device here
a little while ago this is the AT&amp;amp;T
version so there's no earpiece up top
this no date is strictly a tablet let's
see how several weeks of use have
changed our perception of one of
Samsung's more portable stylus packing
tablets many folks fixate on the notates
similarity to samsung's new Galaxy s4
smartphone but the more we use it the
more we're convinced it more resembles
the s3 yes that may be splitting hairs
but it's true if you look closely enough
the note 8 is much more plasticky with
far fewer concessions to style than
devices from Samsung's 2013 lineup
paired with the almost retro styling of
super wide radius corners and this
inexplicable camera bulge around the
back the note 8 almost looks like a prop
from a 1950s sci-fi movie the super wide
bezels and glossy plastic haven't aged
too well alongside newer sleeker tablet
like the new Nexus 7 and even Samsung's
own Galaxy Tab 3.0 but on the whole the
hardware is comfortable it's a portable
reasonably attractive device to carry
around but so long as you're not
planning on putting it in any pockets
still it was tough to get around the low
resolution display when the Note 8
launched and the competition certainly
hasn't led up since then now the note
eights pixel density does beat out that
of Apple's iPad Mini which isn't having
any trouble selling like hotcakes so
odds are if you're any kind of normal
person this display will suit you just
fine it's a panel that pops with vibrant
color and if the greyish blacks and
slightly pixelated text edges don't
bother you you'll be good to go but it's
only gonna get more antic ated looking
as the competition keeps launching
higher res tablets so just bear that in
mind somewhat more irritating samsung's
insistence on maintaining a physical
home button and a protruding one at that
the note 8 is plenty portable and fits
nicely in a backpack but you'll want to
be sure to turn it off first because
otherwise the constant accidental
pressing of the home button will
activate s voice which by the way is
still just as terrible as ever or if
you've disabled s voice like you should
have the constant presses of the button
will drain your battery anyway by
constantly lighting up the screen we
don't see the need for a physical home
button on any tablet in 2013 but a
protruding one is just plain dumb the
thing that will counter all that for a
certain kind of customer is the thing
that makes a note a note the S Pen
Stylus that hides away down in the
corner the S pen's functionality runs
the gamut from the utterly useless to
the truly indispensable all of which
we've covered extensively before what's
nice though is that you can pretty
easily ignore the useless stuff focusing
on the nice additions like quick s note
memos or absent-minded sketches or even
the really simple stuff like airView
scrolling with the s-pen it's these
little details that sneak up on you
the stuff you start to miss when you're
using other tablets and it's these
little touches which continue to make
the Note 8 much more enjoyable to use
then
standard tablet but remember that's just
the s-pen we're talking about the
software is another story samsung's
touchwiz third-party UI was originally
conceived as a way to make early
versions of android more user-friendly
and more capable through added features
well the added features are certainly
here but the user friendliness isn't not
that the note 8 software is difficult to
use necessarily but given the leaps and
bounds stock Android UI has taken in
recent times it's hard to say that
TouchWiz with its pastel palette clumsy
borders and poor use of space is our
favorite environment to be in the number
row across the top of the keyboard is
nice but it's Auto correction is not
you'll want to replace it with another
keyboard we've also run into occasional
problems with miss targeted screen taps
in some applications though that seems
to have cleared up after some software
updates but unless you're in a modern
kind of mood and you want to get
elbow-deep and androids underpinnings
TouchWiz is a necessary evil if you want
some of Samsung's enhancements to the
tablet experience it's required to use
the s-pen at all and it's also the
reason the note 8 offers multi screen
multitasking this takes some getting
used to and it's not a streamlined as we
think it could be but being able to
browse the web and carry on a
conversation in hangouts or watch a
YouTube video while also browsing your
Twitter feed all without hitting the
home button is still pretty cool tablet
screens are big for a reason and Samsung
has this aspect covered fairly well
using the note 8 on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA network
over the course of a month has
reaffirmed the value of a data
connection on a tablet for us it's very
nice not to have to worry about being in
range of a Wi-Fi hotspot when you want
to browse on a bigger screen than your
smartphone though we might feel
differently if we were stuck paying the
bill for it also the hit on the battery
life that comes with that cellular radio
is definitely substantial you'll want to
turn it off when not in use the note 8
has LTE capability but our demo account
was only provisioned for 3G still our
tablet past data over the 3G connection
as well as any other device even
allowing for some video calling over
Google Hangouts in the middle of the f
noon the front camera does just fine for
video calls given the proper lighting in
the rear camera despite its pronounced
hump is just a 5-megapixel affair and it
produces results that are also okay in
the right lighting but say it with us
you shouldn't really rely on your tablet
to take good pictures of anything but
documents and business cards a note
tablet has ever really blown us away in
terms of audio but we expect this to be
an area of focus for manufacturers going
forward the note 8 should hold its own
for a while just based on sheer
amplitude it's pretty loud but it is
somewhat tinny as with many devices the
story of the Galaxy Note 8.0 continues
to be one of compromise the added
functionality of the s-pen and the
expanded feature said join with the
device's portability to make it a solid
buy for those looking for a little more
from their tablet but the low res screen
and clunky TouchWiz interface offset
those gains a little bit and those pills
are even tougher to swallow given the
note eighths price at 379 for the Wi-Fi
version and 399 on contract for AT&amp;amp;T S
4G variant this is not a cheap buy
particularly with the AT&amp;amp;T version you
better hope you get timely software
support over its lifetime considering
we're still running Android 4.1.2 on our
demo unit that's not exactly a safe bet
still the note 8 has aged fairly well
given all it brings to the table if
you're just looking for a generic
mid-sized Android tablet this isn't it
you can find that for much cheaper
elsewhere but if you think you're going
to get use out of its S Pen suite of
enhancements or you like the special
features like the IR transmitter or
multi screen multitasking the note 8
continues to offer a lot of bang so long
as you're willing to spend the bucks
