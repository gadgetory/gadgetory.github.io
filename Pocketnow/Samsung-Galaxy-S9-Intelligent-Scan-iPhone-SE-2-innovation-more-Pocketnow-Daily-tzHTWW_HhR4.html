Samsung Galaxy S 9 now offering an
intelligent scan I was 12 will
reportedly bring changes that you won't
be able to see at least not immediately
and guess what's Apple newest flop
that's right it rhymes with pod I'm
Jaime Rivera and I apologize for
forgetting to mention the price tag
yesterday Monday is usually do that to
me
this is pocket out daily let's begin
today with possible product flops as
well the home pod has been in pre-orders
for the past four days and usually Apple
sells out of products immediately or it
takes it about a couple of hours as it
turns out you can still order the home
pot today and have it be available on
February 9 so can I call this a flop
already Apple I think that thing is just
overpriced now let's talk about Google
as a the company's Rick coaster load
just confirmed that the whole
acquisition of part of HTC's employees
has now been finalized he welcomes the
new employees to Google and he commits
to bringing innovation over the next
coming years what innovation I still
don't know but my god if they come up
with more camera technology just like we
saw with the pixel that's gonna be crazy
and yes you can expect HTC to make more
smartphones as well now let's talk about
iOS 12 we've been waiting for a change
in the home screen for the past couple
of years I mean it's 10 years old and as
it turns out we've got some sources that
claim that we're not getting changes in
I was 12 apparently we're getting
security improvements in addition to
changes for efficiency that will deal
with the whole battery problems that
you're dealing with older iPhones it
seems that we're gonna have to wait
until 2019 for changes in the homescreen
but the problem is that the source is
the same one that got the whole Trump 5g
thing wrong so we'll see what happens
now let's talk about the iPhone se 2
we're not exactly sure when we're
getting this product but it seems that
the whole rumor of the three iPhones
that we've been talking about is not
necessarily what we're going to be
getting at some point this year
KJ's vinci quote just shined then on
this iPhone se - apparently Apple is
having a little
trouble being able to bring all the
technology it needs but the whole plan
is to shrink the iPhone 10 meaning
bringing the truth if camera sensor
bringing the super Retina display I
wonder if they're gonna bring a super
price tag to this phone as well as
that's what really makes the iPhone S II
you know popular but whatever the case
may be it seems that even wireless
charging is going to make the mix I
think this phone is gonna launch at WWDC
we'll see what we get and finally the
very hot news they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 we've got some very
credible sources claiming that the
company is working on something called
intelligent scan the whole idea is that
instead of just doing facial scanning
because we already have an iris scanner
on the phone it's going to actually use
both it makes sense now for there to be
asymmetrical bezels where the top bezel
is a little larger than the bottom one
because apparently the company is going
to bring technology it's actually going
to be more secure than Apple's face ID
you'll have facial recognition but in
addition to facial recognition the phone
is actually going to use the iris
scanner at the same time I find this to
be great but in today's question let us
know in the comments I mean we've heard
so many sob stories about how face ID
works even with people that don't look
like each other so when you trust
Samsung's approach more because in my
case I would I mean the iris scanner I
think is as secure as it gets
so that would be me I would trust it
