from the Samsung Galaxy as nine from one
of the most trusted sources more deals
of the Huawei made 10 Pro emerge and you
should move quick and Samsung might be
renaming the Galaxy S lineup in the near
future I'm Jaime Rivera and this is the
perfect example of globalization where I
record the video in one country
published on another but the video is
getting edited by my son somewhere else
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the Huawei Meg 10 pro I
highly recommend that you look at mass
drop it's currently $100 off but there's
a catch and it's not really in the price
it's just that you have to actually set
the phone in your cart and it's not
until you get there they get the
discount you can learn more about
everything in the description
I do recommend this phone now today we
get major news for the Google pixel 2
and pixel 2 XL mainly because we admire
everything that Google has done with
that visual core from the pixel it
definitely provides photography like
we've never seen and asked the security
patch that you'd get today this is
available for third-party applications
so yeah pixel owners it's about that
time now let's talk about the iPhone 5c
for all three of you that still have
that phone what - only - ok for all two
of you that still have the iPhone 5c and
actually for replacements in general we
already heard that Apple is dealing with
issues in the case of the iPhone 6s to
provide replacements so it's giving you
a higher tier phone in addition in the
case of the Phi C you get more storage
if you go replace it for whatever
problem you go complain about so yeah in
the description you get more detail now
let's talk about the samsung galaxy s 9
by now we have everything we need to
know but once rumors hit evan blast
that's when we know everything is
reliable so yeah we've got more League
renders in addition to color options
that look rather interesting it seems
that the Galaxy S 9 will be everything
the Galaxy s8 should have been which is
great but let us know in the comments
what you think about the recent renders
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
X and the reason why is because for
those of you waiting for that foldable
smartphone apparently that won't be the
case it seems that Samsung is planning
to rebrand the Galaxy S in the near
future to Galaxy X and they're gonna
figure out some sort of a branding for
their foldable smartphone why is the
company considering changing the name we
still don't know but the source is
apparently credible in today's question
let us know what do you think I mean do
you think that it should retain the
galaxy s name or should jump to galaxy X
in my case I don't really care I like
him regardless but leave us a comment
