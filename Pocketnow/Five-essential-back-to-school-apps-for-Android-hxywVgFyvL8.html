next couple of weeks and you want to
make the most of your Android device we
have just the thing for you I'm Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and here are
five essential back to school apps for
Android for many of you the new school
year is right around the corner unlike
when I was in high school in college
tablets and smartphones are common
everyday items which can greatly help
students in class as such we've composed
a list of five essential back to school
Android applications which will be
helpful for any and all students the
first one is one we use all the time
because who owns an actual scanner
anymore they're bulky require computer
software and aren't portable with genius
scan plus you don't need a scanner
simply use the camera on the back of
your Android device to take a picture of
a document using perspective correction
software and a black and white filter
the application can usually render a
picture of the document as well as a
scanner with the picture turned scanned
image you can append several different
pages to the same document or PDF and
you can save email or add your document
to a cloud account like Dropbox or drive
I've been using genius scan plus for the
last year or so to scan and return
signed documents and it's never let me
down so far genius can comes in both
free and paid options in google play
looking back i wish i'd been a little
more organized when I was in school
today I couldn't keep track of anything
I'm supposed to do without a task
manager while there are dozens of
options to choose from I've ultimately
settled with todoist for a few reasons
the ability to sort tasks into different
projects tag them and set priority
levels is irreplaceable but even more
important than that is the ability to
subscribe to your task list as a
calendar in google calendar todoist is
available or cost several different
platforms android iOS Chrome Firefox Mac
OS Windows Windows Phone outlook and it
even has a gmail plug-in to add tests
directly from emails the downside is
that many of todoist best features like
the ones I've listed here are part of
two doest premium service fortunately
it's quite affordable just twenty nine
dollars per year or roughly eight cents
per day note-taking is essential for any
student and there are literally
thousands of ways to take notes but
keeping them organized is just as
important as
taking the notes in the first place
there are countless ways to do this with
Android but my preferred method is
Evernote recently I've started storing
notes for everything in Evernote grocery
lists project files podcast notes
reminders shopping research etc it's an
awesome catch-all for notes and items of
all types you can organize your
different notes into notebooks and you
can lump those notebooks in two
different stacks with a notes you can
attach photos sound clips and various
file types from mobile you can also hand
write notes or you can jot notes onto a
piece of paper and like with genius can
capture the notes using the document
camera Evernote is free to use but for
more advanced features like the ability
to access offline notes share notes for
collaborating with friends keyword
search and one gigabyte of uploads per
month which is a lot of notes mind you
you will need to cough up $45 per year
or five dollars per month for your
research projects you'll need a way to
keep track of all the sites and pages
you visited you can simply drop them
into an Evernote notebook as bookmarks
or you could use a surface like pocket
when you find a site you want to come
back to later either from your desktop
or mobile simply save it to pocket this
will sink for viewing offline through
the pocket app you can also organize and
sort clippings using tags it's a very
simple vital tool and never go without
it's completely free to use but if you
pay five dollars per month or 45 per
year you get access to additional
features like permanent backup in case a
web page ever goes missing later on and
advanced search function and suggested
tags finally we all need help with
homework from time to time and brain lee
is your one-stop-shop for answers in
short brain lee is like a message board
where students can go and ask questions
about trouble they're having answering a
homework question other users can then
help them out by providing step-by-step
instructions or the entire solution you
aren't guaranteed an answer or help but
brain lee claims eighty percent of
questions asked or answered within ten
minutes those are pretty good odds when
all else fails the brain lee app is
entirely free to use did we miss a vital
school application want to suggest one
