improvements to audio quality Google
goes official on dates for google i/o
2016 and it seems that nokia is already
playing around with smartphone
prototypes I'm hi meri vana and the cool
thing about Tuesday's is when you start
enjoying them after some sleep have you
got it this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with Google as
the company has made its google i/o 2016
official you can expect the event to
happen from May eighteenth to the 20th
and these are great news we're not
exactly sure what to expect but we do
know that the latest version of Android
should be part of it even though at this
point only 1% of Android devices are
currently running marshmallow let's wait
for Android and huh other official news
come from t-mobile as the company CEO
John leisure just came on a record to
confirm that yes all it's big on
services are actually throttling the
quality of the video that you're
consuming for things like YouTube and
he's staying by that he's confirming
that the company doesn't plan to change
it that it's on the contrary you should
be thankful that t-mobile has technology
that will allow you to not spend so much
data because things like YouTube are not
on being on for example it's hard to
know if we like this obviously you can't
switch this off but then again hey it's
just the so odd that the company plans
to back something that's been so
unpopular lately every ilysm you that
are still aspiring for a nokia
smartphone in the future it seems that
that will happen sooner rather than
later as we've got the first leaked
images of a nokia smartphone that has
nokia branding looks identical to the
iphone and was built by Foxconn so these
things are possible but we do know that
no guess they'll have to wait for that
whole embargo to lift up for them to be
able to build phones though that is
coming very soon so stay tuned and for
those of you concerned about the future
of motorola one of lenovo's SVP s just
the confirm that the company is planning
to do something soon and by this soon we
mean that lenovo admits that their
branding for smartphones is not so good
they also admit that it will take years
for them to fully integrate
rolla into its product portfolio and
that the company is definitely using
Motorola's assets in order to improve
this we're not exactly sure when we will
be seeing more of a collaboration here
but just to give you an idea the Moto
360 sport doesn't save motorola anywhere
meaning this was something that's been
planned for some time so stay tuned as
we see what exactly this collaboration
will bring in the future and finally the
very hot news today are of a new apple
patent that we assume has to do with the
iphone 7 we hear the rumors that Apple
is planning to get rid of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and now we see
that this patent brings a higher
fidelity audio to the speakers of the
iphone and you can imagine the way
apples going to promote this they're
innovating with new better higher
fidelity audio on your phone as if you
can't already get that what certain
phones but then again this is Apple but
it does lead me to the question of the
day how much do you value the quality of
the speakers on your phone in my case I
do but it seems that the market doesn't
really do because things like boom sound
from HTC never became really popular
even though they should have it was a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends as always you know
the drill if he want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed
machine follow us on pocketnow.com is a
strep change of channel as well you can
follow me on twitter hi managers
quarterly that are on instagram at high
Meadow me better please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am high metal better thank you very much
for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
