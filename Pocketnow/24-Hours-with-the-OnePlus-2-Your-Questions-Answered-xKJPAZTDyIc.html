the oneplus 2 and removed that free
included screen protector thinking it
was part of the packaging yeah I'm kind
of a noob - oneplus phones but judging
from the comments so are many of you and
that's awesome because it means we can
all learn something together
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
these are a few of your oneplus two
questions answered the first question
we're hitting is the one that you asked
most often in the unboxing comments how
does dual SIM management work on the
oneplus 2 and it's actually pretty
straightforward you pop in to nano SIM
cards from your preferred GSM operators
here in the states that's AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile only know Verizon or Sprint and
when you power up the phone for the
first time the OS prompts you to choose
which SIM you want to use for what voice
calls SMS and cellular data the phone
seems to auto detect what Sims have been
inserted and then Auto downloads APNs
for a bunch of associated prepaid and
postpaid networks so you don't need to
program them yourself which is nice and
it always displays signal information
for both carriers up top you can also
switch settings on the fly if you run
out of data on one card or you're seeing
better reception on the other network or
whatever this is pre-release software so
is switching between networks sometimes
requires a restart to work properly and
the carrier string also doesn't display
the network affiliation properly even on
t-mobile on our unit it says AT&amp;amp;T but a
oneplus tells us a fix is on the way for
this number four does it overheat this
question has its roots in the oneplus 2
s Snapdragon 810 processor which
throttles its performance very quickly
under load and is generally not very
efficient but while a better design
processor is always a nice thing to have
the oneplus 2 hasn't shown any evidence
of handicap in the 24 hours I've been
using it does it heat up when playing
games for a long time sure just like
every other phone and the oneplus 2
doesn't get as hot as some other phones
running better processors this shouldn't
come as any surprise if you've seen our
HTC One m9 coverage that phone runs just
fine on the Snapdragon 810 and the
oneplus 2 seems to do the
same unless you're running repeated
benchmarks back-to-back for some reason
the 1+2 performance should do you fine
and neither the processor nor the
dual-sim setup seems to be impacting
battery in a negative way we got about
four and a half hours screen on time in
our first cycle of heavy use we'll see
if that holds up or not
number three dem optics the oneplus 2
uses an omni vision ovie 138 60 cents er
for its main camera and the viewfinder
heavily resembles the Google camera app
with its swiping controls from the left
you've also got HDR and beauty modes
along with one pluses clear image which
stitches 10 individual photos together
into a higher resolution shot we've only
done a day of shooting so we have no
conclusions yet but the oneplus 2 does
really shine an HDR it seems it doesn't
just brighten up the shadows it seems to
amp up the saturation and maybe the
temperature too for a warmer shot I'm
only seeing a slight improvement in the
clear image photos though and my first
impression of night shots is that
they're average maybe a little above
average but getting focus is tougher
which makes for a longer pocket to
picture delay speaking of you can
program a DoubleTap on any of the
hardware keys to launch the camera but
near as I can tell it won't do it when
the phone is locked and the on-screen
gesture of drawing a circle is clever
but also cumbersome number two there's a
big sliding switch on the side of this
phone to change the alert mode how
useful is it really well I've never been
the biggest fan of lollypops
notification settings that makes sense
but I don't use the priority mode ever
and it's been kind of cumbersome to set
the notification level and software the
switch solves one of those problems you
want to silence your oneplus 2 all you
have to do is slide it all the way to
the top and whether the screens on or
off your phone is muted I remember this
feature from Palm trio's from over a
decade ago so it's surprising it's taken
Android this long to catch up I kind of
wish the switch was reversed that's kind
of counterintuitive to flip it up for
silent and down for loud but that's a
minor complaint I'm really glad it's
here and I hope other manufacturers
follow suit soon by the way if you have
an Android wear watch and you want
override the switch selection without
taking your phone out yes you can still
do that
finally how's life on oxygen OS well
people who are currently on CyanogenMod
probably won't dig it as oxygen OS
doesn't carry over a lot of the cool
features that make cm so useful as a
newcomer to this build of Android I
really like the added attention to
customizability
in some ways it's like a preview build
of Android M with enhanced control of
app permissions and the system-wide
dark-themed available out of the box you
can also customize the accent color of
the OS and control what the notification
LED does unfortunately there's no way I
can find to trigger the notification
tray with one of those buttons but you
can use them to jump into the shelf by
default it just shows shortcuts to
recently used apps and frequent contacts
not so helpful poke around a little
though and you can modify it with pretty
much any widget you want they're smaller
on the shelf and not all of them fit
well but if you want a vertically
scrolling array of widgets hey here you
go
going into the review period I do have a
few concerns regarding what I've seen on
the oneplus 2 so far the fingerprint
scanner is really quick when it works
and when it doesn't work I'm not saying
it doesn't recognize my fingerprint
it just buzzes and does nothing and
fingerprints aside sometimes the button
itself doesn't do anything at all
whether it's waking up the phone or
closing an app I've reported this to
oneplus and I'm waiting to hear back
it's possible I have a bad unit but if
it's more widespread than hopefully this
issue will be fixed in the next software
update I'm also concerned about recharge
time the wide availability of quick
charge on other phones has spoiled me
I'm used to plugging in and getting half
a battery charge in half an hour the
oneplus 2 doesn't top up as fast and
while the reversibility of the type-c
USB cable is handy not being able to use
any other USB cables to charge this
phone is not remember it's only been a
day folks and we're still a ways away
from the first one plus two shipments
hitting customers in the US stay tuned
for our future features and full review
keeping in mind that we're working with
pre
software here all of this is subject to
change at a moment's notice
keep the questions pouring in folks make
sure you're subscribed and hit that
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
early impressions video we're at pocket
now on all the major social media feeds
pocketnow.com as well and as always I am
captain 2 phones on Twitter until next
time thanks for watching and have a good
one
Plus see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
