forging its own brave path might be
behind us from new york city it's
michael fisher and adam lane with pocket
now and we're going hands-on with the
new galaxy note5 so let me explain that
intro as samsung spent a lot of time
talking about the past today but its
future is decidedly different for the
past two years we've seen the design of
the galaxy note lines stand well apart
from its galaxy s counterparts the note
was something special and distinct this
year samsung brings it much more closely
in line with the non phablet flagships
while also making it thinner lighter
stronger and more refined that means a
chassis that looks and feels an awful
lot like a blown-up galaxy s6 with a
curved back cover for a deter organ aam
--ax and it is a very comfortable phone
to hold more so than any previous note
there's the 7000 series metal frame the
glass front and back plates and as many
feared the smallish 3000 milliamp hour
embedded battery and absence of microSD
expansion down to the bottom the s-pen
has gotten a new trick it now springs
out when you press it in which is a more
elegant ejector system than we've seen
on notes of the past the s-pen itself is
refined to still plastic but heavier
than before and augmented by a very
handy new feature you can write on the
screen right after you deploy it without
unlocking the phone for quick jobs that
are automatically saved when you replace
the pen that's probably the coolest new
s-pen and feature it's really really
innovative the hovering Air Command menu
has also been updated with a new look
and you can now capture entire lists in
single screen shots together a ton of
info
at a time and save it for later credit
where it's due this is useful stuff that
a lot of people are gonna like most of
the stuff we saw on the galaxy s6 edge+
is also here on the Note edge the two
are practically identical under the hood
that means samsung pay is here launching
august 20th and europe and september
28th in the US faster wireless charging
is also onboard capable of pushing the
phone from zero to full in two hours new
video stabilization and live-streaming
options in the camera 4 gigs of lpddr4
RAM and that 5.7 inch Super AMOLED
display at quad HD resolution the note 5
will be available in black white and
gold flavors with pre-orders opening
today and wide availability just a week
away in the US and Canada on August 21st
now while it's still very much a note
and therefore very exciting the close
similarity to the galaxy s6 edge+
might take away some of its sparkle for
some folks to find out if you're one of
them stay tuned for more a galaxy note 5
coverage in the week ahead at pocket now
be sure you subscribe to us on youtube
and on social media
till next time there's been Michael
Fisher and Adam Lane from the New York
City Galaxy unpacked launch event thanks
