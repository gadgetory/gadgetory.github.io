Google music this was something that not
only lets you buy music and play it on
your connected devices but it also lets
you upload your current music collection
into the cloud so you could stream and
listen to it also on your connected
devices what happens when your device
isn't connected isn't there an easy way
that you can get your music from the
cloud onto a storage device so you can
have it with you when you want it well
yes and no easy no is there a way yes
let me show you how so here's my Galaxy
Nexus it's running Android version 4.1.1
and this is the stock version of jelly
bean
I've got Google Play Music open right
here and you know what I want to be able
to save some of this stuff to my to my
device so how do I do that well let's
say I like AFI and look December
underground that sounds good
Prelude 12 21 thumbs up for that song
awesome how do I save this onto my
device so that I can play it back
whenever I don't have a network
connection what version of Google music
is this oh no it's hard because they
change it all the time so first thing we
do we gotta come in here and go to our
menu and we need to say that we want to
choose what on device music we want to
have so okay now we're in choosing mode
once you're in choosing mode hey look
I've got this little pin right here I
can push a pin on that and it will start
downloading that to my local device you
know what that's just a lot of
cumbersome stuff why can't I just say
hey you know what I want to save that
and come on Google let's make this a
little bit less difficult okay but even
still once I get this downloaded onto my
device if I have to wipe it's gone
meaning I have to download it again
because you know this is my song that I
uploaded to the Google music service I
can download it as iliyan times as many
times as I want I can stream
do whatever right so no problem there
but what if I really want to take this
and save it onto my SD card well okay
Galaxy Nexus no SD card which by the way
Google hello
serious come on give me a frickin SD
card anyway that's a rant for a
different video I suppose but for the
purpose of this video we're going to
pretend like there's an SD card in here
that we can save our music on to that
when we do a wipe or we upgrade to
another device we just have to pull that
card pop it in the new one we're done
and hey all of our musics there already
we don't have to resync it wouldn't that
be novel anyway
back from the rant so let's say I want
to to do just that let's go ahead and
play this Prelude 12 21 if you're not
from there wow what a completely amazing
song now the downside to doing this is
you do have to wait for it to download
all the way to your device so
essentially you've got to listen to it
you don't have to listen to it but
that's the best way to know if you've
already got it on there so this is a
short song I'm not going to have you
listen to all of it you know we don't
want to get copyright stuff involved
that's why I'm talking over most of it
so I'm gonna go ahead and pause listen
to this do a little bit of jamming out
on my own and when we come back I'll
tell you how to get this song on your SD
card great I just got done jamming out
to that wonderful song and now you
notice I'm done listening to it and I
can move on to step number two now you
do have to have root access which I do
have on this Noah is not unlocked but I
showed you how to get root access on
your very own Galaxy Nexus without
unlocking it in a previous video I'll
have a link to that video at the end of
this video how about that
so what we need to do is we need to fire
up a file explorer
no not Astro no not Lynda no it's got to
be something that supports root level
access so hey how about root explorer
it's available in the market costs about
4 bucks go ahead and open that up and
once this is open you can see it's been
granted Super User permissions because
I'm rooted thumbs up for rooted and now
I can go into all kinds of stuff
let's drive first into the data folder
and inside that there's another data
folder I don't know why there's data
inside data don't ask me and the next
thing that we want to go to is come
Google Android music so we're going to
scroll down here umm you Google Android
blah blah blah music I'm going to open
that up from there we're going to go
into the cache that's where it saves
everything inside that now we have a
whole bunch of other stuff and music
that's where we want to go now you can
look at your dates here this I believe
is it nope Shakespeare's sister sorry
guys so let's go ahead and back out of
that let's find another October 11th is
it this one nope that's not it either is
it this one not yet is it this one no so
it's really kind of a you know just pick
and choose where did it go that one's
from August so that's obviously not it
maybe it's this last one and it is I
don't know what rhyme or reason they
have to organizing it the way that they
do the file names are chronological but
the dates are not so good luck but this
is very obviously the song that I want
of course it's named 3463 mp3 I knew
that no I didn't so that's the one that
we want all we have to do now is select
this guy rename it move it wherever
we're good to go so I'm going to copy
that
and we're going to come back up here and
go wherever I want now because this is
rude I can go anywhere so let's come
down here to my SD card which isn't a
real SD card but you know we like to
pretend and I'm going to put this in my
downloads folder okay so right here
we'll paste that there we go see if we
can rename it and I'm just going to name
this AF I Prelude I can't even spell
today guys Prelude
one two two one and I know there's a
dash in there but good enough now I've
got that file it's an mp3 file and I can
go ahead open it up and play it wherever
I want now is this easy No
is this something you're going to do to
copy your entire music collection down
from your Google account to your device
no for that there's a desktop manager
that you can put on your desktop PC
download all of your music to your new
computer you know whatever you want to
do from there this is just a way that
you can say hey I really like that song
I wish I had it on my local device and I
wish I could put it over on my SD card
so I could take it with me when I get a
new device or when I wipe this one and
start fresh again
so not a very fast way to do it but an
absolute foolproof way to do it until
they change something and make it not
foolproof anymore but there you go what
do you think let us know your thoughts
and comments down below
over at pocketnow.com of course and I'll
let us know was all this worth while
learning do you like knowing where it's
storing all of your your music and do
you like the fact that you've got to
have a root File Explorer and a rooted
phone to be able to get at it seems like
an awful lot to me and Google could just
make things real simple by letting us
long press and you know save this to my
external sd card that's just me and Who
am I for PocketNow showing off some
roundabout hacky tricks I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
