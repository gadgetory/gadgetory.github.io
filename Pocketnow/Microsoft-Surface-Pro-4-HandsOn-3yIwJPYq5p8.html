pro 3 users recommend the surface pro 3
so Microsoft poured its soul into making
another tablet that can replace your
laptop and it's calling it a powerhouse
of performance and portability for
Pocket now I'm Michael Fisher with Adam
Lane behind the camera this is a first
look at the surface pro 4 at first
glance the surface pro 4 isn't
substantially different from the surface
pro 3 but there are significant
improvements here the screen size has
grown from twelve to twelve point three
inches and 267 PPI from 216 and that's
all bezel management Microsoft did it
without changing the overall size of the
device the display uses a combination of
Gorilla Glass 4 less than a half
millimeter thick and 1.1 millimetre
backlight unit to make for the thinnest
optical stack ever which was necessary
to fit into the new 8.4 millimeter
chassis and down from 9.1 millimetres on
last year's surface pro combined with
the new surface pen Microsoft is
claiming that the surface pro 4 offers
the best pen and touch experience you've
ever felt the new pen carries an eraser
with an integrated button single click
for OneNote double click for screen
clipping press and hold for Cortana and
it attaches to the surface magnetically
it registers over a thousand levels of
pressure sensitivity up from 256 last
year and it'll last a full year of
battery life something new and
especially interesting here is the Pens
exchangeable tips you can switch
textures from ballpoint pen to felt tip
2 pencil and most in between microsoft
says 50% of people using the surface pro
3 use the pen so it's important that the
company gets this aspect right more
impressive than the pen is the new type
cover which Microsoft touts as its
thinnest lightest and strongest yet the
new scissor switch keys have been
separated and given a pitch of 19
millimeters and they're backed up by a
new glass trackpad 40% larger than its
predecessor there's also a fingerprint
scanner alongside on some models if
you're using the type cover with the
surface pro 3 if you're using it with
the new pro
for you don't need a fingerprint scanner
because windows hello is here to
identify you by your eyeballs Microsoft
says the surface pro 4 is 30% faster
than the pro 3 it replaces and 50%
faster than its direct competition the
Apple MacBook Air it tops out at one
terabyte of storage and 16 gigs of ram
with an Intel Core i7 processor driving
the Windows 10 experience 2000
individual parts make up the hardware
itself and it feels every inch like it
the surface pro 4 will become available
for pre-order starting October 7th it'll
go on sale officially on October 26th
for a starting price of 899 dollars this
is just an early hands-on from the
Windows 10 devices event in New York
City folks stay tuned to pocket now for
further coverage on the new surface
product new Lumias the new band
everything else Microsoft is showing off
today until next time this has been
