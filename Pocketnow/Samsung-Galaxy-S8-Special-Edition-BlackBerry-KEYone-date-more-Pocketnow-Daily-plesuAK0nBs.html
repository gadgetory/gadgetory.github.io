Samsung Galaxy S in the works as a
special edition Google is working on
getting OEMs to work together when it
comes to patents and it seems that
blackberries key one might arrive
earlier than expected I'm Jaime meadow
Iveta and about the only thing that's
missing after this t-shirt is a Megazord
ripped apparel this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with
official news that actually became a
teaser for those of you that didn't know
the first cell phone call was actually
made today if you do the time zone map
and absolutely everything but the most
interesting part is that Motorola
published this video where it has
everything that the company has done for
mobile technology which the company did
the company invented the cell phone but
within that ad you will notice that the
Moto X 2017 has been teased I can't
really say that the phone is good
looking but at least we got a teaser we
can't wait to learn more a company that
is not really having a good time right
now is reportedly Lecco with God
Bloomberg publications and others saying
that the company is having trouble
paying its own employees and that makes
you wonder why perrolli this is only
happening in the United States Lia ko
told its employees that the reason why
this is happening is because the company
had a hard time getting money from China
to the United States which makes you
wonder if the United States division is
making any money and obviously with the
very meager lineup of products the
company is offering it makes a lot of
sense for it not to let's see what
happens hopefully things end up working
out how about if we move the spotlight
over to blackberry as a blackberry I'm
actually at the top of the list of
people that are waiting for your key one
I joined everybody that was disappointed
over the probable delays until late May
according to John Chen but we've got
some trusted sources and it's funny
because of the most trusted source being
John Chen says late May and this other
source says May 5th in the UK could it
be that what John Chen was talking about
was the United States whatever the case
may be I cannot wait to get my key one
thank you I thought about Google as the
company has just launched a new
initiative called taxin the whole
purpose of this is to bring peace when
it comes to pen licensing meaning that
if you're building an Android phone
and you're part of packs you will work
together with other OEMs and being able
to share these patents and make the
whole process easier obviously it avoids
litigation and pushes innovation and I
wish the techs would work on pretty much
everything not necessarily just Android
can't wait to see another initiative
like that and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy s8 I don't know if
any of you was disappointed over the
only four gigabytes of RAM in this phone
specifications obviously none of us have
ever tested a 10 nanometer processor so
it's really hard for us to say yes it's
enough or no it's not enough what we do
know is that apparently Samsung is
building a special edition of the galaxy
estate with 60 gigabytes of RAM which
makes all the sense in the world in this
year the only problem is it apparently
it'll launch in China we're not sure of
exclusively and that it will cost more
than a thousand dollars so the question
for today would be would you have a
problem paying more than a thousand
dollars for six gigabytes of RAM on the
Galaxy s8 honestly I would because
everybody else is going to pay a ton of
money for four gigs and I hope that
Samsung has figured out their software
up to the point where it merits that
amount of money but leave us a comment
down below we love to know what you
think friends you know the way it goes
