operating system and the trademark has
already been filed a new report claims
that Samsung is taking longer than
expected to fix the fold but we might
still see it somewhere in June and I'm
just announced the new processor
architecture at Computex which is more
powerful but it requires a couple more
things I'm hey Matt Rivera and
definitely I you know I feel that
today's Monday but I know it's not a lot
of news to cover this is probably out
daily brought to you by dashlane the
official new should I begin with deals
if you're in the market for a ton of IOT
stuff Google usually does a very good
job with them we've seen their whole
rebranding with nest and now their PO
hub which I love in addition to a home
mini and also that nest doorbell - hello
one you get all that for 279 which if
you do the math it's nearly four in ten
bucks all these products I actually do
recommend you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about Intel
my gut I thought this day would never
come I thought that by then pretty much
all competitors would eat up Intel but
that's not the case today
the ice-like processors are now official
even if we're gonna have to wait until
the end of year to see computers with
them and so isolate their first 10
nanometer processor even if it's got
some 14 nanometer elements and then even
if they said that they were gonna bring
Wi-Fi 6 and have it integrated in this
chip it's actually not necessarily that
way at the beginning and up to the point
where these processors don't really work
on that while they work on desktops but
they're not designed for that they're
designed for laptops and ultra portables
and well Intel thank you welcome to 2017
it's gonna be nice it's great to have
you on the ride now let's talk about arm
as a in addition to what we saw it
convey texts from Intel ARM processors
are the ones that are owning things
right now we've got the arm a77 being
announced and this a chip design pretty
much brings a couple of improvements up
to 20 percent more power it's a more
powerful chip the problem is it requires
more power as well from the phone's
battery which is rather interesting as
arm has been really good about having
their ARM processors be actually more
and more power efficient as the
architect
get smaller not the case here so I
wonder exactly what this chip is going
to be for or who's gonna take advantage
of it we hear Qualcomm mediatek other
companies will keep you posted that was
will the spotlight over to Samsung as
we've been covering new since Friday
over the fact that we want to know where
is the Galaxy fold one obviously we were
expecting a possible launch and the may
after all debacle that happened then we
heard June and apparently that is going
to be beyond samsung's deadline some
inside sources claim that the company is
being very secretive and that we could
be even waiting up until July if certain
things go the way they're pointing out
to be in you know what Samsung I would
rather you take your time and launch a
good product because I do believe in
this but still we would really love I
don't know a statement something to tell
people this is where we're at that'd be
great
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with Huawei yet again for two
things two separate news the first one
is a well tsmc is starting their
production of simon an ohmmeter chips
and within the customers of this chip we
hear that Huawei is one of them so even
with the whole ban and arm complying
with this ban TSMC is going to supply
this technology for Huawei with the
Karen 985 which we hear is going to be
the processor being built on this so
that's great it means that we will be
seeing more Huawei smartphones but the
question is what exactly are these
smartphones going to run and so we now
have a trademark for a brand new
operating system from Huawei called arc
arc OS as in I don't know if I should
call it Noah's Ark given everything
that's happening whatever the case may
be I mean let's let's dive into this
okay so Arco s what exactly would you
like this arc OS to do that would be
better than Android for example let us
know in the comments down below because
in my case
honestly it's always a breath of fresh
air to see something different but we've
seen Tizen we've seen sailfish we've
seen so many cases of operating systems
that have failed I feel it the most
important thing that the wall we can do
given the leverage of the size of their
market is to make it open source if they
launch an operating system and they open
source
to others that's gonna be a big deal
because it allows you know just running
Android apps but it allows a new
community to be spurred from this and
truly obviously run Android apps and
sure be more power efficient and learn
something or two from iOS in anything
but the grid of icons but that's just me
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion and folks I just
want to take a minute to tell you about
