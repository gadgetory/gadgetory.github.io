pocket now it's the second official day
of Aoife but we're essentially done
covering the big stuff as you know if
you've seen all of our previous coverage
of the videos but we're stopping by HTC
some of our favorite people to see here
at Eva and the HTC One which normally
comes in aluminum which we've covered
rather extensively now comes in a
variety of other cover colors and we're
gonna give you a look at those let's
check them out so as you can see with
the Red Baron here we're not looking at
anything too much terribly special
except for those toggles which we
haven't gotten on the American carrier
variants yet but we're running software
version 4.3 of Android with HTC one
release and something on top the real
story here is of course just the color
which on camera I'm a little worried
it's not going to read but this red is
just amazing I haven't seen it on
another device yet I know we gushed
about the HTC One guys and you know a
maybe your your gonna call BS in the
comments but really really really this
metallic finish on the red is unlike
anything on any phone we've seen the
closest they might come is to the liquid
s2 which we saw yesterday
but even then this is much more
brilliant this was exclusive to media
Mart here in Germany for a little bit
and sprit in the United States it's
exclusive to sprint your country might
have a different carrier deal on this
but if you can even get hands on one not
even saying to buy one you should check
this out in the store because it is
quite an interesting finish on a smart
phone
and that is just as true with the blue
variant here this one is the more recent
release
we saw this one announced just a few
days ago I believe it will be available
in Germany in the next couple months
it is available in other countries now I
believe and there are some exclusives
out there don't have much information on
that but so if you were thinking of
getting the original HTC one but you
were worried that maybe the color
selection was not up to your spec well
now you have a couple more options the
blue and red variant of the HTC one done
up in a style that I haven't seen on
other phones in a while if you want to
go shiny or you want to go red if you
want a little more of an aqua touch
closer to matte the blue is your call
just different colors the HTC One we're
going to see what else is new here as we
wind down from our eco coverage thank
you so much for watching and some of us
behind the camera stay tuned to pocket
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
