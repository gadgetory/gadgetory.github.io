Daniel Webster here from POC not calm
and this is the hardware tour of the
Motorola flip-out NV 511
so some preliminary specs the device is
67 by 67 millimeters in length and width
and 16.8 millimeters in depth it sports
a 720 megahertz Texas Instruments
processor and we also have 512 megabytes
of RAM and 512 megabytes of wrong and of
course all the included other hardware
like the digital compass accelerometer
and assisted GPS we start from the top
we have this Motorola emblem that's
etched underneath the glass capacitive
multi-touch screen we also have the
speaker here for the headset and a light
and proximity sensor the screen is a two
point eight inch QVGA resolution display
with a capacitive multi-touch glass
screen of course on the bottom we have
these capacitive buttons which light up
when you have a new to like new
notification if I turn on the device the
screen is using old technology if you
can see on the camera the display is
getting rather distorted this is an LCD
so it's a it's rather destroyed I don't
know why Motorola decided to use that
older technology on this device if we go
to this side I don't know which is
height is either top or bottom because
you can't really distinguish it we have
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as well
as our on and standby buttons on this
side the device we have our volume
rocker over here we just have a little
tab to take off the battery cover which
of course does come in multiple colors
and you can buy those through AT&amp;amp;T it
does come with the orange and black when
you purchase the device on this side we
have the micro USB port and this little
right thing right here this little
rubberized is a notification LED when
you chart winner when you are charging
the device on the back we have a mirror
for self-portraits and a 3.1 megapixel
camera with actually pretty well put
together digital zoom that is able to
zoom in rather well with this camera
take off the battery cover we have the
eleven hundred and thirty milliamp hour
battery we have our speakerphone
right here it's a it's actually pretty
powerful speaker I was surprised for
such a tiny phone over here we have our
32 gigabyte memory card is expandable to
32 it does come with a 2 gigabyte card
when you purchase the device and of
course our SIM slot so if we open up the
keyboard we have a full QWERTY keyboard
with numbers on the top as well as our
full Cordy and our space and directional
pad we also have our microphone so stay
tuned for the software tour coming up
next and in case you missed you can
click on the link right about here which
will take you to the unboxing of the
Motorola flip-out MB 511 if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also leave some comments down below
