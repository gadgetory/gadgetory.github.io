we are here in Berlin at the Samsung
Galaxy Note event and we are taking a
look at the samsung galaxy note 3 just
announced today and we're going to
compare it with the samsung galaxy note
2 probably many peoples go to phablet ok
so right from the beginning you can see
that the dimensions the physical
dimensions of these two phablets i hate
the word rabbits but we have to use it
are the same samsung however emphasized
on the fact that note 3 has a larger
spring that denotes you and which
session which is true 5.5 inches on the
note 2 verses five point seven inches on
the note for you and now under the hood
there's a lot of changes we have an
excellence for quad core processor on
the good ol galaxy note 2 vs. 2
processor options on the note 3
depending on the region if you're in an
LTE region you're going to MOS
definitely get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor clocked at 2.4 gigahertz or if
you are in a 3g area you're going to get
the Exynos 5 octa-core processor which
is really a dual quad-core processor
with two pairs of processors rolling in
fares in terms of memory the RAM amount
on the Neptune is two gigabytes while
free gigabytes exists on the note 3 and
that's pretty much it in terms of raw
hardware but if you flip it to the back
there's a considerable change and spec
bump in the camera we have an 8
megapixel camera here on the Google note
2 and a 13 megapixel camera on the note
3 plus some versions will be able to
deliver 4k video recording capabilities
and while we're here at the back we know
we complained about hyper glaze but now
I'm starting to miss it because this
phone right here even though this has
the flip cover s view cover I should say
it covers up the back but the back
behind the cover is also leather and you
can see the stitching right there it's
available in multiple colors and as
Michael mentioned and the hands on video
so if you like Piper glaze you will
probably miss it if not leather is the
new hyper ways getting back here there's
also a change and the new stylist and
I'm going to try to compare these two
and hopefully we can get a focus on it
the note 2 stylus the black one is
thicker Weldon l3 stylus is somewhat
more oval I'm not sure if you can get
you that on camera we have a more
triangle shape here on the black one
while this one is more oval it's also
more lightweight and it's easier to work
with Samsung emphasize it on the fact
that this is the key that unlocks your
tablet as far as software is concerned
this version here is the AT&amp;amp;T version
and unfortunately it's running Android
court at one or two but the notes free
will be shipping with Android for that
three out of the box which is the latest
version so that's a really really really
quick glance at the note 3 compared to
the note 2 will have much more on the
North know too well here in Berlin I've
been Anton thank you very much for
watching Michael picture behind the
camera thanks for recording stay tuned
to pocket now for more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
