apps out there and it's finally come to
Windows Phone I'm Michael Fisher this is
pocket now and this is a quick look at
pandora on Windows Phone 8 the windows
phone version of pandora was announced
just today by Microsoft who said they
are rewarding our patients and yes it
has been a long wait we're testing it on
on Nokia Lumia 920 here and the first
thing you notice when you fire up the
app is that the recent stations screen
is the first thing you land on and it is
arranged in a very Windows Phone style
arrangement there are these live tile
looking representations of your stations
that you've recently listened to tapping
on any one of them brings you into that
station and starts playing a random
track if you've used pandora on other
platforms this experience is much the
same you can tap on the menu expander
for additional options like sharing the
station sharing the track buying the
track on xbox music and so on a couple
features missing in here are lyrics
support and artist biographies or we
couldn't find them in this quick look
but we expect they'll come in a future
update another nice thing about the
recent stations list is you can long tap
on any of them to pin it directly to the
home screen so instead of just tapping
on the Pandora tile you can tap directly
on a station to start playback if you
have some favorite stations one of the
nice things about Windows Phone 8 also
you notice the doublewide pandora tile
up top we can adjust that in size but it
does provide a whole lot of pixels if
you do want the phone to display the
track information of the song you're
listening to swiping around the UI
you'll find all the traditional Pandora
elements you can search for particular
artists and start playback based on what
you found you can also just find a list
of genres stations and if you hop into
settings you can manage things like
fidelity parental controls and pandora
one status on our Nokia Lumia 920 here
we have confirmed that this is pandora
one for free pandora appearing to keep
their promise and providing us with
commercial free listening for a year and
that's us in terms of Windows Phone
users only definitely a very nice reward
for our patients in our short time with
the new app this morning we found
performance to be excellent on par with
many other professionally designed
Windows Phone apps responsiveness is
wonderful layout is intuitive and
playback sounds very good even over
cellular network pandora is free to
download but keep in mind the company's
recent announcement that it's going to
limit mobile listening to 40 hours per
month that shouldn't affect many of you
but you should keep it in mind if you're
obsessed with listening to mobile music
for more on pandora for windows phone 8
including its interaction with kids
corner and some other features we didn't
get to in this quick look download the
app yourself on the Windows Store and
stay tuned for more coverage like we say
pandora is available to download in the
Windows Store so if you have a Windows
Phone go get it also follow us at all
the usual places subscribe here on
youtube if you like the video and stay
tuned for more from pocket now i'm
