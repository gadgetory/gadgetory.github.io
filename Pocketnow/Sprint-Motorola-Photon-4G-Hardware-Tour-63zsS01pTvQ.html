pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look of the hardware on the
motorola photon 4g for sprint so sit
back relax and enjoy the show the fit
and finish on the motorola photon 4g is
very very solid this device feels really
good in the hand the rounded corners are
really nice it feels a little weighty it
doesn't feel like it's too lightweight
so it doesn't feel like you're going to
throw it someplace overall a great
device in the hand the only complaints
that I've run into our the finish up
here on this kind of chromed edge and
right here along this edge here as well
have taken some abuse to two other
objects in my pocket and have scratched
very easily the screen is stayed very
resilient considering that it's using
gorilla glass even with this little kind
of lifted edge here on the sides but
just some scraping here so just know
that if you put it in your you know if
you've pocket your device without it
being in a case in your front pants
pocket or otherwise where there might be
keys or a knife or other you know other
sharp objects just expect that the fit
and finish around the outside may get
damaged a little bit the dual core and
NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor 1 gigahertz is
very very snappy on this device I found
it to be work early and in for the
additional processing power you get a
lot of functionality of this now on the
home screens on the other hand and I
know that this was kind of mentioned in
the unboxing review that it seems slow I
find that it mostly has to do with the
number of widgets on the screen and
after we get through the software review
I'll take some of these often will
comment on the full review how fast the
home screen was in comparison we'll talk
more about it in the software review as
well as far as buttons and levers and
otherwise on the motorola photon 4g
you've got the fork passive buttons on
the front they're very responsive I'd
had no problems moving back and forth
between areas
or the speed there in there's a little
bit of animation that happens there but
really it works very very quickly on the
top is our power button which I had no
problems with using or having it cause
any issues for me on the side is the
volume button and the there textured a
little bit as I mentioned in the
unboxing review which is really nice
when you're trying to find the buttons
the action on these rockers is very
smooth and as a nice click the camera
button is that same textured feel but it
is only a single actuation meaning that
you press it down and the camera takes
the picture there is no half pressed for
focus when we'll come back to that in
just a minute and talk about the reason
why that's important outside of buttons
but more ports you have the USB and HDMI
ports on either side here and if you've
got other Motorola accessories such as
the car dock as long as you have the
adapter that fits this particular device
because the rounded corners it will work
fine in that device I used this
particular device on the motorola droid
3 from verizon i just use the adapter
for it at the car adapter that i had
even though that this came with a car
adapter as well the review unit did just
want to make sure that it was the
functionality would be the same there on
the back the kickstands is nice and
solid it has a little bit of a issue on
this side right here where it can get
tipped over pretty easily if you hit it
in the wrong spot but as far as setting
it up to act as an alarm clock it works
pretty well and for watching movies it
works pretty well as as far as I've been
able to find this stays magnetically
closed so it doesn't flop open when
you're happening in your pocket which is
fantastic the camera on the motorola
photon 4g is 8 megapixels it does 720p
recording and device itself can do 1080p
playback it's got dual flash
unfortunately
and we talked about this camera button
over here this team takes a long time to
focus the motorola photon 4g is like a
lot of its motorola siblings recently
that you press the button to take the
shot it does a focus and then finally
Titans takes a shot and they can take
just enough time that you either lose
the shot or the shot still comes out
blurry which is a little disappointing
video is a little better and we'll have
samples of both of those in our final
review one thing to note on this
comparison the droid 3 it does not
suffer from the kind of bluish tint that
the CMOS sensor or the sensor the camera
sensor in the droid 3 had suffered from
if you read our full review on that
front facing camera is just a standard
webcam great for items such as Skype or
otherwise which is nice now this is
Motorola's first 4g phone for sprint it
is also a world device it does have a
sim card in it unfortunately since it's
locked for domestic use only for outside
the United States does this work weren't
really able to be able to test that
functionality very well but it is a
world device let's just say that then at
16 gigs onboard memory it has a slot for
additional memory and using microSD up
to 32 gigs but it doesn't come with one
included which is a little bit of a
disappointment there but what can you
say battery life on the motorola fortune
is fantastic the qhd display with the
pin tile technology seems to just sip
the battery very very quietly unless you
have the 4g service turned on and then
it seems to through it pretty quickly
overall i found with phone calls and
average daily use i'm getting easily a
day or day and a half of power out of
this compared to my epic 4g which can
barely survive a day of course the 1700
milliamp hour battery does help with
that as far as speeds go on this device
as you can see here when we get into the
actual 4g area and get 12 and 1.6
10 and 1.6 up good speeds when it
switches over to 3g the speeds are as
one would expect for a 3g on the sprint
network and again with the 4g service
it's about the same as i found with
every other 4g device on sprint's
network speeds in the high range if
you're close to a tower if you must move
further and further away you either lose
the speeds completely or even if it's on
the map sometimes it won't give you a
signal such as nearby to my house it
shows that we have 4G service here but
unless you're standing in the middle of
the street two blocks away you can't
actually get signal that's pick and stay
and actually transmit data compared to
its sibling on the verizon network the
motorola photon 4g is slightly longer
than the droid 3 and a little bit wider
it's just a fraction on just a hair
thinner than the droid 3 it is
noticeably thinner to the epic 4g on
sprint here weight-wise it's a little
lighter than the droid 3 a little
heavier than the nexus s feels good in
the hand as we mentioned the beginning
so the weight it really isn't too much
of a factor at all I do like the 4.3
inch qhd display and my only complaint
with it is because of pintail technology
when you start zooming in on small and
so I look very close rather on small
text such as we see here and you start
scrolling up and down quickly you get a
lot of ghosting and up here in the like
in the battery meteor solid colors you
can see the pixelation very clearly
additionally the blacks aren't really as
black as they could be and that does
have a tendency to change the color when
you're looking at images on this phone
that's that the viewing angles on this
device are fantastic it's easily seen
from all angles and in the sunlight it
performs just like the droid 3 easily
seen in bright sunlight which cannot be
said for most of the AMOLED screens that
are out there today that wraps up our
closer look of the hardware on the
motorola photon 4g for sprint
if you have any comments or questions
leave them below if you have a questions
you would like to specifically answer it
about the software which is the video
review they'll be coming up next leave a
comment below and we'll try to address
that question very specifically in the
next review thanks for watching
