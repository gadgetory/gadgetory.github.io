against the best Sony mobile experience
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is the Sony Xperia Z versus a
Google Nexus 4 the Nexus 4 a
collaboration between Google and LG for
the most pure Android experience and the
Sony Xperia Z is same for Sony the best
of what sony has to offer all packaged
into a smart phone two very similar
concepts with vastly different outcomes
these two devices are true behemoths
they are currently two of the most
desirable smartphones on the market they
have a lot in common
and they also have a lot of differences
but when these two flagships go
toe-to-toe the purest Android experience
and the best Sony experience which one
comes out on top it all depends on where
your priorities lie one area these two
devices truly differ is in build quality
and design the Xperia Z is a very square
device with hard edges that make it feel
much more substantial and larger in the
hand but it also makes it more difficult
to hold and it doesn't feel as
comfortable around the edges of the
device it has a blue trim which gives it
a much more premium feel and look it's
distinguishing and it's rather unique
but once you get around to the right
edge there is a big bright power button
that you cannot miss the Nexus 4 on the
other hand is a much more comfortable
device to hold it's tapered around the
edges which gives it the illusion of
being smaller in the hand than it
actually is it also has a rubberized
trim around the backside of the edge
which makes it easier to hold on to and
doesn't give the feeling that the device
could slip through your fingers at any
minute the Nexus 4 in the Xperia Z both
feature glass panels on the front and
back of the devices however the Nexus 4
has Gorilla Glass only on the front the
rear is not and the Xperia Z has dragon
TRO glass on the front and Gorilla Glass
on the rear the Xperia Z is much more
resistant to the elements as it has both
ip55 and ip57 ratings for dust and
waterproofing unfortunately that means
that all of the devices ports are under
covers if you need to plug your device
in even listen to music or change your
SD card you're gonna have to lift a
cover first before you can access those
ports although the buttons are placed
rather strangely and the ports aren't
nearly as accessible on the Xperia Z as
they are on the Nexus 4 the Xperia Z has
the upper hand at the end of the day it
has waterproofing dust
and an overall more premium feel both
the Nexus 4 in the Xperia Z have a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
chipset 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of built-in storage although
in the Nexus 4 also comes in an 8
gigabyte model and that's where the
specification similarities end the
Xperia Z has the advantage and pretty
much all of the other specifications it
has a 5-inch 1080p reality display a
13.1 megapixel camera and microSD card
slot and a 2300 million power battery it
also has your typical connectivity such
as NFC Wi-Fi b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0 etc it
also has LTE connectivity depending on
where you are and also works on AT&amp;amp;T 3G
bands here in the States the Nexus 4 has
a 4.7 inch WXGA true HD IPS plus display
an 8 megapixel camera a 20 100 million
power battery and no option for
expandable storage
it also has NFC Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi
b/g/n a major plus for the Nexus 4 and a
big miss for the Xperia Z is wireless
charging the Nexus 4 adheres to the Qi
wireless standard meaning it's
compatible with any of the Qi wireless
chargers the Xperia Z however does not
have wireless built-in and you instead
have to buy a case that uses the metal
prongs on the side of the device this
means you have to use the Xperia Z in a
case if you ever want to charge
wirelessly and not have to open the
covers over all the ports when you
consider those specifications there's
only one area where the Xperia Z truly
blows the Nexus 4 out of the water and
that's the display the Xperia Z has a
5-inch display with a pixel resolution
of 1920 by 1080
that's roughly 443 pixels per inch when
you compare that to the 4.7 inch 1280 by
768 pixels or rating of 318 pixels per
inch on the Nexus 4 the difference is
considerable but the comparison between
these two displays is not just based on
density when you're watching videos or
looking at pictures the Xperia Z's
display uses the Sony Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 which makes colors pop a little
more and it makes it much more vibrant
in normal use the Xperia Z's display
pops much more than the Nexus 4 however
the contrast ratio of Sony's display is
not nearly as high as the Nexus 4's
contrast blacks are not nearly as darker
is inky on the Xperia Z as they are on
the Nexus 4 so it's kind of a trade-off
do you want extremely high resolution
with colors that really pop with Loki
trust or do you want to display this
relatively vivid high contrast and a
much lower density the true Achilles
heel of the 1080p display on the Xperia
Z is how much power it consumes laying
both devices side-by-side on the table
with the displays turned at full
brightness the Xperia Z drains much more
quickly
fortunately all those pixels don't come
at the expense of performance both the
Nexus 4 and the Xperia Z share the same
s4 pro chipset at the same clock speed
1.5 gigahertz and the normal use both
devices perform quite well and it was
quickly evident that the Xperia Z eats
benchmarks for breakfast and the
quadrant standard benchmark it scored a
seven eight eight three versus the 48 36
from the nexus 4 in the SunSpider test
it also scored lower which is better
than the Nexus 4 and using the antutu
benchmark the Xperia C blue the Nexus 4
out of the water once again but time and
time again we learned that benchmarks
mean very little when real-world
performance suffers the Nexus 4 falls
victim to very few performance bugs in
normal usage whereas the Xperia Z
suffered the occasional stuttering on
the home screen pulling down the
notification shade switching between
applications and so on and so forth
while there are major differences in the
hardware how does the software stack up
let's take a look unsurprisingly the
area where these two devices have more
in common than any other category is
software although the Xperia Z runs
Sony's customized version of Android the
software on both devices is very similar
customizations made by Sony and its
software is not nearly as overbearing or
prevalent as other manufacturers
customized interfaces sony's interface
allows the user to set a theme those
themes apply different accent colors
throughout the operating system so if
the holo blue on stock Android isn't
your thing you could try an amethyst a
ruby amber or emerald maybe a sapphire
you also have settings toggles in the
notification shades which largely differ
from the quick settings and Android the
icons are very Sony s if you've used a
Sony television or even a Playstation 3
you'll notice that these icons look kind
of familiar the application drawer is a
little different as well the settings
application while mostly stock has been
changed to adhere to Sony's themes and
accent colors and there are other tiny
little modifications all throughout the
system for instance Sony's
customizations comes with its own set of
widgets
and wallpapers and there is some
bloatware the good news is this
bloatware can be removed quite easily
aside from these many differences in a
customized lock screen on the Xperia C
the software on both of these devices
feels very similar sony has left many
cues from the stock Android experience
in its own customized software and of
all the interfaces out there TouchWiz
since UI this one is among the most
lightweight in the jellybean update
Google introduced a new camera interface
when this more user-friendly and quick
to use simply tap anywhere in the
viewfinder and slide your finger towards
the outside of the ring to access your
quick settings however the camera
experience on the experience II packs
more features such as intelligent auto
settings and filters for various effects
and when you compare the output of those
two cameras the 13.1 megapixel camera on
the Xperia Z is definitely the clear
winner pictures tend to come out more
crisp and clear with more vibrant colors
whereas the Nexus 4 tends to lack proper
detail and color reproduction all in all
the Nexus 4 in the Xperia Z are marketed
towards two totally different types of
consumers the Nexus 4 is geared more
towards consumers who want a stable and
consistent experience on the cheap the
Nexus 4 retails for either $2.99 or 349
depending on capacity and is an absolute
bargain but without LTE and a mediocre
camera it was never the top in its class
the Xperia Z however is as premium as it
can get it has an excessively high
resolution display a 13.1 megapixel
camera waterproofing dust proofing LTE
connectivity a microSD card slot
but that comes at a rather steep price
at upwards of eight hundred US dollars
if you're looking for a more modest
phone that's easier to manage one-handed
and comes with the most pure Android
experience Nexus 4 is definitely the
device for you but if you're looking for
something a little better for watching
movies or playing games something with
raw power a premium device all around of
these two sony's flagship smartphone is
probably the one you should be eyeing so
that wraps up the comparison between the
Xperia Z and the Nexus 4 if you liked
