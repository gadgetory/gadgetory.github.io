the program that felt like sort of a
case study all of you might remember
this as the Nexus at first began as a
showcase of hardware and software with
the Nexus 1 which was my first ever
Android phone which later evolved
stretching the boundaries of design
offerings from Samsung and later took a
step back and defined what a flagship
killer concept should be in which
companies like oneplus were famous for
today you'd think that that formula was
successful enough but no it was shelved
and in return the company went back to
its roots and see the pixel was a
different animal it was all about a
premium foam with a great camera and a
price to match this was more a product
to compete with the galaxies and the
iPhones and then necessarily succeed in
the process the pixel 3 was truly a
great camera with a mediocre phone and
as a result it didn't sell well at all
and the aftermath usually companies will
just drop the price tag of the failed
product and try to sell it aggressively
but not Google instead we got this this
is the Google pixel 3 a a far less
expensive iteration of that failed
product that's surprisingly far better
than I expected I'm hey I'm gonna be
better with pocket now and let me tell
you more about it
in the title of this video I called this
almost everything that you need and true
I know that's a bold statement needs
very but one of the things that I've
learned is that most people are just
looking for a good phone with good
battery life and great photos and you'd
be shocked at how much this phone nails
the essentials for just 399 visually it
looks a lot like the pixel 3 I mean it
even feels like a pixel 3 but trust me
it's not and by a significant margin
somehow Google managed to make the
polycarbonate finish feel like if it
were glass but lighter
I'm glad Google gave me the option to
pick my unit size in color as after
months with the pixel 3 Excel I really
wanted a palate cleanser and this
purplish color is awesome it almost
looks like bleached white that only
grabs the purplish tone depending on the
angle that you're looking at it it takes
me back to the times when all phones
were polycarbonate and then feel like a
fragile thing you could break the main
advantage to that polycarbonate is that
it handles fingerprints better and the
dents are far less noticeable if you
drop this phone now obviously corners
had to be cut for this phone to be less
expensive starting with the fact that
there is no water resistance here and at
the front we have dragon trail glass
which I'm not going to call less quality
than Gorilla Glass we just don't know
much about it under the glass we have a
5.6 inch 1080p + OLED at 18 point 5 by 9
aspect ratio and a sad 75% screen to
body ratio don't worry the always-on
display that we praised on the pixel 3
is here those of you that we're looking
for a bezel less display this is not
your phone but in Google's defense it's
actually not a bad display at all it's
not the brightest but it gets the job
done
it has a good 441 pixels per inch and
colors are actually really good for its
price point now what isn't common on
this price range is stereo speakers and
believe it or not there are here and
they actually sound really good you'd be
shocked what content consumption on this
phone is actually not bad we even have a
headphone jack though that is easy to
find at this price range
now other corners cut our internal but
this is actually a good time to make a
comparison with an iPhone because since
Apple owns the software usually they
don't need grid internals for their
phones and their iPhones perform great
same case here Android is Google
software and it shines in the pixel 3a
even with the qualcomm snapdragon 670
four gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage
we have a 3000 milliamp hour battery
that supports a fast 18 watt charger
that comes in the box and well that's
about it
still again Google is more software
company than it is a hardware company
and I think the biggest story about the
pixel 3a is the software experience and
the perks you get if you grab a Google
phone one of the major advantages is
that you get the latest version of
Android before any other smartphone you
also get the pixel launcher which is one
of my favorites though you will notice
some minor differences with the pixel 3
like the lack of the live birth
wallpapers that I love and you also
won't get unlimited storage on google
photos in full resolution though you can
still pick for the optimized version and
you'll be fine now loved it or hated the
pixel pill user interfaces here I
noticed Google has even brought the
haptics to interact with the app
launcher and yes you can squeeze the
pixel to launch the Google assistant as
well now one of the main reasons why the
pixel 3 was not one of my favorite
devices was because even if it was a
showcase of software it didn't really
perform well on that phone in the case
of the pixel 3 a obviously you can't
really ask a mid ranger to do great
things but software actually performs
just as well as on the pixel 3 meaning
that performs ok I'm not saying that
it's faster than the pixel 3 or in any
way better but it's not the opposite
either you can multitask between
applications or launch the app tray or
launch the Google feed and you'll rarely
ever see or notice a stutter here and
there another perk is that this phone is
optimized for Google fly and I can't
stress enough how much I love this
service those of you that are looking
for a good prepaid plan that's also an
international lifesaver the Google
pixels are the best phones for this and
true you can get Google fly on other
smartphones but those of you that are
looking for a device that's well
optimized to jump between networks like
US Cellular Sprint and t-mobile you'll
actually need a pixel and this is the
cheapest way to get into that and then
even better is the fact that the pixel
3/8 clings to the network
well in phone calls sound good and then
another pleasant surprise is that this
phone has really good endurance I mean
the pixel three was not great when it
came to battery life but the advantage
of the 600 series Snapdragon is that
it's more power efficient I've been able
to get through the day just fine and I
can't say that I've gone beyond the day
but at least I haven't had to deal with
any battery and anxiety which is great
but now let's jump into the reason why
you're here why these phones are called
pixels it's mainly because of their
cameras but I'm gonna start this by
telling you that I still find what we
have here to be impossible because true
the sensor is important but also
important as the ISP which is processor
dependent and the Snapdragon 670 doesn't
have a great one which means that Google
was able to figure out how to get great
photos from a sensor and software the
pixel 3 a does not disappoint photos are
just as you'd expect from a Google pixel
with fantastic color saturation and
contrast and detail is fabulous all
around I was expecting the pixel 3a to
just kneel when it came to low-light
performance but know it works just like
the more expensive brother and you do
have Knight sight here to boost
highlights even more I'm gonna go quiet
for a bit just to let you see some more
samples because they're really fantastic
now portrait photos are good but I do
notice that performance is not as good
as on the pixel three hair is sometimes
not well captured or if you were wearing
headphones the photo is just going to be
a mess things of the pixel three did not
have to deal with you know the sad part
is the audio capability of this phone
sadly as I expected video is not great
following all the steps of the pixel
three yes you can record 4k video with
30 on this phone but the audio is just
as bad as on it's more expensive brother
stabilization is okay and the selfie
video is also good though again not a
device that will blow your mind away and
then last but not least even if the
samples are all fabulous I think it's
time for Google to make peace with the
fact that they need to jump on more
camera sensors you need the versatility
of other lenses and sadly the pixel 3 is
not going to help you and nor will the
pixel 3 a to conclude let's go back to
the initial premise one is this almost
everything you need I mean why is it not
everything what's missing for this to be
the perfect phone I mean we have a great
camera good battery life pure Google
software that includes updates a good
experience consuming content and decent
enough hardware what more could you want
right well it's actually two things the
first is that most people don't really
buy phones for less than a year and I
have yet to meet a mid Ranger that ages
well I'm sure Google will support this
phone for its promised time but there's
a huge question mark over how well the
phone will perform over time as even the
pixel 3 is struggling and then the
second is really the looks I mean
Samsung has the market flooded with
good-looking mid Rangers and the same
goes for Oppo and other Chinese brands I
mean Google I get it that you're a
software company but you're not selling
software here you're selling a phone and
I think that it's time for you to adopt
a more 2019 sex-appeal design if you're
ok with a forgettable design I mean for
399 this is probably the best phone you
could get it's got the experience it's
at the camera it pushes all the buttons
that guarantee a great experience which
makes me wonder why you would even
consider paying more for anything else
let us know what you think about the
pixel 3a in the comments down below and

channels english and spanish for more
content like this one it also follow me
