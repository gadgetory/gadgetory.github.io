hangout today our special edition of the
pocket I'll live we are here with none
other than our own managing editor Anton
d not good morning to you good morning
america good afternoon Europe good
afternoon Europe yeah lucky you and
we've got our senior editor our new
acquisition mr. Taylor Martin how are
you sir I'm doing great how are you I'm
just doing fine my name of course is
Jaime ivetta it is a real pleasure to be
with all of you we are doing this
hangout as sort of an experiment we
always have a lot of work to do every
time we have an event to cover whether
it's the fact that we have two people on
the show floor right now which is
branded minimun and Michael Fisher and
the fact that we are back here at our
free at our offices of course dealing
with absolutely everything that goes on
from the coverage of all the videos that
go on to the post that we have to go up
to so obviously the fact that we always
have an opinion of every device that
gets launched so let's just say that we
do this on a sort of a live chat all the
time but we do it privately so we
decided to do a broadcast this time and
we hope we don't bore you with
everything that they say it's gonna be
kind of funny guys right yes indeed and
for for those who are just logging in
and checking us out now there are quite
a few the event is simultaneously
happening in in New York City and in
London our guys Michael Fisher and
Brandon minimun are on the show floor in
New York City so as soon as we get
information live from them will share it
with you and of course we're going to
comment on everything every little
aspect and feature that will be unveiled
today despite the fact that we've heard
so many rumors of this phone which is
probably the most anticipated HTC phone
of all times if i recall well what do
you guys think well to be honest with
you I think it's probably like the most
anticipated phone for even most of us
actually I mean how many HTC devices do
you have I mean Taylor how about you ooh
um yeah I've got three right now some
old ones show up come on show up yeah
look at this I can I think this was
called the diamond this was never
actually my phone I was my mother since
she just got rid of it pull on his ass
wasn't wasn't a diamond another qwerty
keyboard yeah that's the wrong
al that's the Raphael okay so I don't
know what it was called here I can't
remember it was something like that the
diamond was thousands that was a touch
pro two that was a touch pro the HTC
touch pro yeah it wasn't seeing you with
your device's I have one which will fit
in between that and your next device
which is the never dying HTC hd2 let me
just clear god oh god you're gonna put
me to shame i'm not gonna pull anything
out of here now come and now you guys
can continue chronologically you know
that one was little dirty and then ok
rock chronologically let's let's see
what we have here wow I jump the gun cup
yeah what is that what is that I can see
it it's the Tucker not touch HD 70 the
hd7 oh nice Oh windows phone nice nice
well let me start with Windows Mobile i
have got the hdcp 4350 which was
considered the herald for any of you
that remember that was the tmobile wing
that was the variance had a slide out
keyboard that was my first HTC branded
advice but before that I had the compaq
ipaq 3630 I think it was I'm and even my
old old HTC Trinity I think that those
clothes your fur that was your first
device that was yeah yeah I think
they're working temperate imeem both
your phone and my phone were released
sometimes in 2007 I think yeah 2007
early on yes i think i was still in a
diaper then oh really oh just the heads
up to everybody apparently the event has
not started yet it is 10 a.m. it's 1003
already and nothing has started uh
apparently they're still waiting for
people to arrive so we will keep you
posted Brandon and and Michael are
keeping us heads up with everything
that's going on so let's continue touch
pro two how do you think of this this
was probably I think this is the device
that I have most wanted in my life it
wasn't the tilting screen it was the
fact that the keys were staggered you
remember that yeah I used to sell that
thing like crazy I wanna hello it's nice
to get best buy right yeah I asked to
work there and we'll come in just
everyday touch pro2 touch furtively ran
him every week so I was really popular
yeah yeah I've got the HTC sensation
which is sadly dead is it be specific
what not non waterproof phone this is
the specific non waterproof phone that
mr. Brandon minute minimun tested in a
toilet oh wow what do you got there what
do you got there yes Taylor my favorite
phone Taylor what do you got it's one of
my favorite home ever can you do me a
favor I've got I've got the black one x
would you mind that we switched I hate
this color I love the black one is it
it's not ATT though I can't give up my
LTE actually I don't even use this thing
now i use it for hotspot jaime do you
remember last year in barcelona how
excited we were about the 1x in
particular I mean this year everything
and I'll tell you something I mean if
there's one thing that I love about HTC
is their showmanship if you want to go
to a really good event I mean we were at
Shoney's events previously before that
event in Barcelona and then you know we
were at Sony's event this year at CES it
was nice but I don't know HTC has got
these the this beautiful way of
portraying emotion in their background
that the event before the event starts
really good music really good food
really I don't know that everything is
like really nice at HTC events and you
know I'm just sad that I'm not variant
I'm not area I was about to say that I
loved the HTC One X because I really
wanted that phone to succeed and my love
41 x didn't go away with the galaxy s3
unfortunately it went away as soon as I
fired up a couple of pictures with a
camera because to be honest I were
saturated and he pixelated a lot of
noise and I know that this is probably a
thing to which most of the guys out
there will not agree but I made some
comparisons and it just came out not
that good so I'm expecting a huge camera
improvement on on today's phone at least
thats that's what I want yeah you know I
thought I think it's something everybody
boniface you know I thought the same
thing about for example here's the 8x
and you know they made a big deal about
the fact that the front-facing camera
was a wide angle camera um and yeah it
is a wide angle lens the problem is I
don't know if it's really wide angle
probably I don't know enough about
photography probably the readers can
come in and let us know but I didn't
notice that it's really wide angle all I
notice is that my cheeks are like twice
as big every time I take it you sure you
don't have silly you sure you don't have
like one of those filters installed or
turned on now it works your fade up oh
there what do we have here it's like
yeah this is um I guess they shot from
the show floor this is where I guess
Michael sit on these are Brandon these
guys days each man yeah it's mirrored
it's guys I'm looking keeping keep in
mind this is that it's not on Michael's
right he's on his left so he thinks
tired that is very important I think
it's most the most important thing is
that we are I think in the second row or
third row or at least very close to to
the stage itself yeah he's got some
great seats great seats by the way I
would like to just a short announcement
I'm sorry Jaime just a short
announcement you guys if you guys are
commenting right now on on YouTube we
are currently not reading that so
there's no way for us to be on our
YouTube channel to watch the stream and
to see your comments so if you're just
having questions why don't you go over
to pocketnow.com there's a boat there
should be this video embedded and there
you can comment we are reading that we
can do that and I'm sorry I'm it back to
you yeah and no problem I mean youtubers
uh don't worry we will respond to your
comments as soon as the event ends we
really and just for you know just for
confirmation I know that we've always
done the pocket now live as a reader
editor sort of mingle but the reason why
we're not doing this you know we're not
broadcasting this open to the public is
because obviously we have to focus on
the life you know on the live system
that we're using with Brandon and
Michael and we you know we have to try
to you know figure out what things were
going to post what impressions we have
so we are trying to provide you with an
immediate insight you know oh wow this
is the real
cool thing just happened right now for
example etc et-cetera so we will you
know keep you posted with everything
that we see everything that we like
everything that we don't like so we will
let you know and we have mr. Michael
Fisher are you there I think he's gonna
be only uh oh he's there for a second he
was mr. Michael Fisher can you hear us
no but I think it would be I think you
don't think I some text text only yeah
here we go uh we got text and by the way
by the way listeners and readers the
reason why we we try to do this like
immediately live like we have the
equipment in order for us to be able to
film whatever is happening live but
trust me whenever you're at trade shows
the network is the only thing that's not
there everything else is there to look
look it does not work and you know what
and you know companies try they always
have like these really good wires and
everything but if you're trying to do
anything that's not chatting it's not
gonna work at the video live streaming
is just not going to work and the event
is still not started let's mr. Fisher
any news on on how early what will
happens I think the front with rum from
what I've seen I think that it is just
starting as we speak with a slight 9 to
10 minute delay yeah aibelin we're still
we're still waiting here but we will
keep you posted I have another device to
show you you remember when the HTC Titan
came out this was the first 4.7 inch
display device yeah yeah you remember
this I was yeah I remember when Brandon
got this device for review you was like
oh my God look at how big this phone is
and stuff like that and now everything
is 4.8 inches 5 inches now we're going
5.5 inches I wonder what this Tino m7 or
one device will be because it was
rumored initially to be four point eight
inches then other people are saying five
inches what do you guys think is going
to happen I think that is going to be a
4.7 inch herb but I might cheat because
I might have some information but I
think that this is right now ten minutes
after 10am so I might be able to tell
you this but a
let's see what do we have here dealer so
um I call t-shirt oh look at him he
looks like he's working Oh interesting
it's just he's just posing a saying it
event is delayed for 10 minutes now
announcement is said they're waiting for
more people to show what oh my god it
looks back there I what are they waiting
for I i was reading Michaels tweets and
he was not stop constantly complaining
about the queues I mean of course at any
event there's a certain queue to get in
the event but I was never expecting a
new york city HTC event to be delayed
because there are insufficient people or
maybe it's it's those who were on the
list that didn't show up I don't know
but this doesn't feel good agreed we've
got some reader comments here let's see
the five-minute video is back up again
yes we're up Harlem shake on pocket now
anybody know how to do a Harlem shake I
have no idea what that is I don't think
different way to do it I don't know I
have no dancing bones in my body sir oh
yeah yeah well I am oh let's say Donny
says he is very excitable we all are
everybody is here we're just crazy here
we're just waiting for this to start and
let's see has been the Brandon is on the
HTC house music yeah he's always on
music not only that but he says this is
the best song on repeat I've ever heard
and on that exact note i will try to
michael fisher is not sure he's hearing
us but when Michael and myself were at
Aoife there was a certain booth which
had a music going on I think there were
exactly three or four musical notes and
that thing just went on and on and on
and on for four days non-stop until I
thought that I was going nuts oh let's
see cash pervez is asking will HTC
website stream this life sadly no there
won't be a live stream so that's why
we're here and are you okay anthem I am
very good though they look okay hey
you're looking I thought you were doing
something weird but I think there's some
lag in the Hangout
then we probably have a lot of audience
so that's probably the reason why come
on ladies ask 56 viewers know nice
that's awesome thank you very much for
tuning and everybody just a recap again
hi metairiela from bergen.com our own
Anton Dean arch get it right yeah
managing editor is here with us and
we've got tailored Martin as well who's
our senior editor were currently live
streaming this hangout to tell you
everything our first impressions
everything that we think about that's
happening at the HTC event currently
michael fisher and brandon minima at the
show floor they're covering everything
but sadly since we can't stream the
hangout for you we're providing
impressions we have communication with
them and they're telling us everything
that's happening just for the record
everything is delayed currently 10
minutes we are 30 minutes too late
already and apparently they're still
waiting for more people which is weird
but anyways we have Anthony janitors
being a question go ahead go ahead take
was gonna say maybe Peter Chao hasn't
showed up yet late to a commitment you
know if it's interesting by the way oh
nice a lot of people there I think not a
great event that might be the wrong
event you know you know this is visitin
this is uh I don't know this is
interesting Peter I've been you know
I've seen Peter Chou CEO I've seen um
sony co which I always struggle to
remember his name um we were earlier
I've seen the lenovo CEO um uh i think
it was huawei yeah huawei you know I
don't know I Peter Chou may struggle you
know with his english but i love the
emotion that he provides every time do
you remember when they launched I don't
know which windows phone it was and it
was in butler with peter chao anh on the
stage and a beat I'll just took I think
it was the windows phone 8x or something
even you hire to that and he said in his
good English but with an accent that
that phone was quote boom boom boom I
mean that would not yet moment I think I
left my ass up yeah I know but but i
love the emotion that the guy provides
this event you know if you really forget
that you're having
understanding what he's saying and you
just love the fact that the guy is
enjoying his product we've got another
picture there what are you doing there
Michael let me see well nobody's looking
he's one of the viewers of this hangout
so Roxy rocket he's watching himself I
am watching him solo taylor brown and
says smile more oh come on smile more
why not got me do any much I can't think
about smiling so let's get back to
rumored specifications so far we have
established that i believe and i think i
will be right that the HTC m7 will have
a 4.7 inch screen which will have a full
HD resolution that I don't have a ppi
calculator at 10 but I think that's
close to 4 30 ppi which is good at
four-thirty and that's going to be a
super lcd3 screen now what do you guys
think about the other specifications mom
said I have a comment here from I have a
comment here from anthony chen he's
asking if HTC One was uses the new
Snapdragon 800 series for 600 series can
it compete with compete with the galaxy
s4 well you know from our experience
with HTC we've seen you know quad core
processors the Tegra 3 on the One X now
we saw the x and o's and you know it
doesn't really matter it at the end of
the day meaning you know samsung has
done a really good job at optimizing
TouchWiz up to the point where i've
tested TouchWiz in just about every
processor and it works fabulous so it's
it's really hard you know it i hope that
HTC tunes sense this time just when we
we we hope the same thing last year so
it could be so just to be on the on the
unbiased and fair side of things it
doesn't matter what I think or what time
I thinks because we don't want our
personal opinion to get involved in this
but unless we use the Snapdragon 600 or
800 and the new processor within the
galaxy s4 we're just guessing because to
be honest nobody saw those processors
running in real time in real life except
for some benchmarks which were leaked
which might be true might be not but be
sure
one thing once we'll get those two
phones in our labs will compare oh heck
out of them oh yeah oh yeah and by the
way you apparently they're waiting for
the sink feed from London to get started
but for all of you that don't know these
are actually two events that are
happening simultaneously what is
happening in London the others happening
in New York City Brandon and Michael are
at New York City right now and we are
still waiting to the event to start and
can you guys believe we already have 23
additional comments in the website and
we have Kate hundred and sixty four
viewers and Counting for which we thank
you very much and we are sorry for as
lot of people yeah but yeah Taylor
minutes no word yet you shared some
leaked specs Taylor what else do you
remember from the leaked specs leaked
specs uh that wasn't me that was Tony
Tony alright thanks thank you for
keeping this between us so here's here's
what I can tell you it's not been
confirmed but it's pretty close to what
it will happen there's going to be a 4.7
inch full HD screen with 430 BPI
resolution and it's going to be a super
lcd3 the processor on the HTC One will
allegedly but most probably be a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor a
quad-core processor clocking and 1.7
gigahertz it's gonna have two gigabytes
of ram 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and here's the interesting thing it will
have a secondary front firing speaker
which will be so loud according to what
I've heard that it will probably be one
of your favorite boom boxes in terms of
cameras there's gonna be really 2.1
megapixel front-facing camera and a 8
megapixel ultrapixel camera 8 mega pick
eight megapixel ultrapixel camera which
will be made out of 24 megapixel sensors
and on top of everything powering it all
it's going to be twenty three hundred
million power battery with Android 4.1
point2 sw3 yeah that's bad oh come okay
for the record guys yet sorry to
interrupt the event is starting Jason
Mackenzie which is president of HTC is
on stage
New York right now so the event is
starting and apparently he's saying that
well let me see what does Michael say
here um there I was wrong on the big di
calculation yes yeah it's for sixty
eight ish this is 1080p 4.7 so 1080p of
five is for me if I'm wrong but that's
so far the highest resolution and a full
HD display on the phone I mean all other
phones out there are flow highest
density 4.29 so this this is should be
the highest density on a smartphone yet
yes by quite a bit not wrong yeah yeah
bike ride another I i I've never held a
1080p display I mean Taylor tell us
about the VNA used to have it yeah the
displays great but you can't really tell
how great it is I mean it's kind of
beyond what you can really distinguish
side-by-side would like the 1x or
anything else really you can definitely
tell it's clear but you can see that
full 1080p watching a movie it's very
clear though that it's 1080p deep 97 20
oh interesting interesting you know
probably and now that you mentioned the
1x I just and and this is for the record
I mean for me the 1x had the most
incredible screen till this date I still
consider it to be the best display and I
hope that they figure that same
mentality out for the for the m7 or one
whatever they're going to call it how
was your experience with the with the
DNA was the display just as good yes yes
it was just as vibrant pretty accurate a
little more on the saturated side then
say the nexus 4 but unkindly I will
kindly interrupt you and tell you that
the HTC One has been officially
announced it's just the 81 it's no
letters it's nothing it's just the HTC
One president of HTC Mackenzie has been
announced it in New York at the New York
event which is also earring live in
London so it's a double event and with
that I'm gonna get back to you guys to
your to your conversation and look at it
in the end that ended up being the
design with the two speaker grills which
just think about it guys how smart it is
we've complained about this in the
podcast for so long you know having the
speaker at the back
always gets muffled by your hand I mean
how smart it is to have the speakers in
front I mean that I think it's genius it
is smart and overdo it isn't really
going to do after you use a tablet with
the speakers on the front versus the
back it's a world of difference like the
Nexus 10 it's got those speaker grilles
on the side you know I've heard about it
Joe said talked a lot about it in the in
his review of the of the nexus 10 I
already forgot the name um but I have
never really experienced that I mean how
is it really that significantly
different yeah wow it's pretty
noticeable I have a little I don't know
if I've got it right here but I've got a
little thing that directs the sound
towards you so if you have a speaker on
the back you can pop it on the bottom of
the device where the speaker isn't it'll
shoot okay shows so for the comment for
the commenters we've already got 66
comments on the post and yes it is
called the HTC One apologies it's not
apparently it's not going to be called
the m7 but I don't know I still think
that there will be two devices launched
I mean the design of that other device
that looks so much like the ax was so
cool I mean just think about it bringing
what design to Android should be awesome
what if they're holding back on that
until nwc to show something off in
Barcelona too well they don't have a
trail from the VC do they mmm they will
have a booth most that most definitely
and Taylor can you see if we have any
pictures we should have any pictures of
the phone and while you're looking for
that Mackenzie also said that the HTC
One improves every part of the
smartphone experience so I'm I'm already
excited I mean I've been waiting for
this phone for quite some time and I'm
so jealous that I'm not there to get my
hands on it I just hope they bring it to
Barcelona because else I'm gonna go
crazy now here on the industry apparent
apparently it has dual speakers and just
two capacitive buttons yes that is true
it is one button for back and one button
for home if i recall well and the home
button also acts as a multitasking
button and also a way to fire up google
now so how am I gonna work slide up for
the
for Google now okay so so so so look at
this I mean you've got three buttons
sparsely displayed on this humongous 4.7
inch display why can they fit an extra
button in there I think that they found
it um wide listening I don't know
couldn't knife why couldn't they fit a
bigger battery in it I will always
handle him for that twenty-three hundred
million pounds everybody else is doing
three thousand and beyond and they're
doing 2,300 it makes sense guys because
the back but the 1i the 1x had a great
battery life by the way oh I don't know
your experience was but for me it's the
best battery life I've used you haven't
used a note too heavy yeah I do that's
my daily driver and for some reason but
the thing is i use the t-mobile variant
of the note 2 so i'm not sure if it's
the fact that that you know that that
device is not too well in because that
because of the fact that I unlocked it
could be um apparently the new the new
HTC Sense has been announced but I still
can't find the name I'm still waiting on
pictures until then I was just about to
say that it somehow makes sense to have
two buttons because the back button is
just normal compulsory for Android and
they ditch the search button because
there's Google now and that can be
accessed from the home button and if you
guys remember ad HTC one x + 1 x plus
all had some sort of a either double
touch or touch to hold on the home
button to get into multitasking or to
get into a search function so they they
just slammed it down and I had a
conversation with with Brandon last week
when we talked about the two buttons and
he was like what happened and then I had
a crazy idea what about the HTC logo was
a button but that doesn't seem to be the
the thing here but yeah two buttons
that's that's for sure okay going
through some reader comments I will
assume you guys asking is this device
gonna be better than note than the note
2 that's a good question Stadium of
unity especially for a comparison and
you find out yeah michael has the note 2
with him so most likely we will have a
comparison on the show floor hopefully
we will be getting a review unit today
that's the idea but i don't know let's
let's see what they would
in the end Taylor do we have any images
show no I'm I tried to tell Michael to
stop uploading all his other images and
he didn't so we're still just getting
his images not the so just a quick
reminder for those who have just started
watching this is bucket now live a
special episode we are currently
checking on HTC's announcement for the
one happening in New York and
simultaneously in London i have here
with me hi Matt Rivera who is the
multimedia manager of pocketnow.com
Taylor Martin is here as a senior editor
of pocketnow.com I am Anton denied
managing editor and we're commenting
live as it happens on all the features
and all the good stuff HTC is showing
off so far we have a name it is
officially the HTC One it is running a
new version of sense which is so far
unnamed what we think and we believe
that it sends five point 0 and as soon
as we get more information we will be
the first ones to let you know and with
that and good at you guys I'm trying to
communicate with Michael here I mean
what apparently they're starting to
mention HTC Zoe some somebody from ESPN
was showing off a nap right now but I
still we still can't figure out what the
name of senses right now so hopefully
these guys will will chime and give us
the information I'm just I'm still
trying to understand um how this whole
hold on i think i have brandon here uh
pics coming soon okay thank you very
much yeah we've got the facebook oh here
we go okay Peter Chou is live in London
now apparently the London event is
starting finally I'd suspect or only way
he's speaking from there and they're
going to sink his video and audio to the
New York event where were mackenzie as
president of HTC USA is hosting it could
be could be i again i love peter chao
showmanship I think that he makes HTC
events you know different and nice and
I'm I'm just setting out there it would
have been really cool quick question for
you guys last year a left last year the
One X was introduced in Barcelona and
then the galaxy s4 was introduced close
to two months after that and lung
so there was quite a difference between
them now we've got the HTC One today on
februari 19th and if the rumors are
right we'll have the galaxy s4 some time
at the beginning of March some some say
that in less than one month so the
distance between the two main
competitors on the Android blend
landscape today is getting closer and
closer and closer do you think that this
will make a difference as in the galaxy
s4 will not immediately kill the HTC One
it depends on the HTC One man I think I
don't know I feel that that what
answered it's a hard question like for
example um ok let's talk about what
happens on the iOS space for example um
the reason why people buy an iphone is
not because it's launched first they buy
an iPhone because it's an iphone and I
feel that Apple has done a really good
job in marketing the iPhone to be its
own brand that shown unit that people
are crazy about and I feel that Samsung
has done that exact same thing with the
galaxy brand and I i wish that HTC would
have figured that out but their
marketing their their marketing appeal I
mean you hate the fact Tony that you
hate the fact that um Samsung has
billboard ads and bathrooms and stuff
but that's really how you make a brand
something popular that is Jim let's
let's just hope that HTC does the same
thing you know the problem is when you
call the device the HTC One I really
hope the next year it'll be called the
HTC One again but you know the 23rd of
the 2014 edition you know just the new
HTC One but now changed is a good name
yeah keep one as a brand you know when
they were launching the 1x I remember
that I'll he you know Peter shout during
the whole presentation was like the HTC
One the HTC One and you always set HTC
One and never in the whole presentation
that he say 1x or 1s or ones or 1v the
presentation ended and then when I got
to the booty is like oh this is the one
x and I'm like oh okay oh this is
another and this is the one x I'm like
oh ok so there are three devices okay
fine okay camera you know but you know I
thought that one was gonna be the brand
I hope that they remain HTC one just one
just leave it there that's my thought
how about you Taylor um my problem is
what happens with the next device or
even another device psych mid-range
devices and anything other than the
flagship 1x last year was also a one
device so what do you call Cece to call
it the two of it but then what do you
call the successor to the HTC One the
HTC one two or like the iPod the iPod
has been the ipod has been called the
ipod ever since it was launched in two
thousand so when my ipod torn you know
the to the 2004 vision by the way let me
just interrupt everybody then the
apparently they already gave a name to
the front firing speakers on the one
that's being called boom sound sound
booms i got these names names ah boosts
am still waiting any barriers no i was i
was about just to say that HTC is very
very fond of its camera and i can't wait
to see exactly what kind of images it
will produce but until then I'm really
excited about the one thing from what I
see from from the pictures this HTC One
is a really really thin phone but if you
turn it it is it looks clean if you lay
down on its back it's the nakia smile
all over I mean it's not only tapered
but it's it's it's it just smiles and
and that's I think we lost Taylor but
I'm gonna invite him back I think we
lost Taylor it yeah and let's say while
you invite him let's just go through
some raider comments we have Rashid
carbot and I hope I'm sorry if I butcher
your name you're asking of this device
will be better than the HTC butterfly up
most likely I mean the device looks very
thin so just imagine the HTC butterfly
with a little bit of a smaller profile
in a fit of design and obviously better
speakers so I do believe that this
device will be much better but then
again we've got the new Snapdragon 600
processor which apparently willpower
this device it's not being mentioned yet
and there's there's just a lot going for
this device we have another comment who
is saying Samsung is going to kill HTC
lids it depends um and
see any other comment yeah we yeah we
already covered the fact that it's
cooking called boom sound and then let's
see it's it has a design new music
player that can launch a visualizer that
pulls lyrics and displays them at the
time of the music but you can already do
that with soundhound by the way and you
can also do that with use em yes yeah
you you're just playing a song in your
music blaring you just launched sound
how you can do that so it's cool to have
it within the player that's cool but but
sit it's not really something
revolutionary okay and I'm he I'm seeing
here something about sense and voice I'm
not sure what this is but Peter Chou is
apparently on live as we speak and he's
continuing to show off the phone that is
happening oh the camera the camera the
camera is being talked about now it is
called ultrapixel um but you you told us
Tony that it was I'm trying to
understand is it 18 megapixel sensor or
to sell my understanding is that there
are 24 megapixel sensors and why HTC
thinks that this is good is that because
of the two sensors it will produce a
clearer image a sharper image an image
with more contrast more saturation now
this is completely opposite from what
for instance nokia was doing with the
808 PureView where they oversample
actually downsampled images for sharper
and even crisper pictures I'm again
excited about this technology for
megapixels i believe is more than enough
for everybody's photographic needs you
don't need huge 12 megapixel images
because you're not printing billboards
so for your social life for your own
media library for sharing with friends
for megapixel images will be more than
of guy just guys just one question I
mean looking at the photos of the design
I mean are these chamfered edges yes and
and i think that the HTC one is a if the
blackberry z10 and the iphone 5 would
have had a baby it would have been oh my
god i mean this thing looks well aside
from the front firing speakers obviously
it looks like a trifle and apparently it
has an
freret port which will be acting as a
remote control which is nothing new
Samsung bin it has been including
infrared port on I think it was the
galaxy note 10.1 if i recall well but
with that infrared port you are able to
control samsung Display samsung smart
tvs now the HTC One also has an infrared
port and it will allow you to remote
control your other home appliances
interesting interesting well apparently
they're talking about music right now
obviously they're talking about the
camera I'm just trying I'm trying to
make out how could I don't know how did
this how could this ultra pixel
technology be better and apparently
they're saying that the myth of more
megapixels on a camera is a big fat lie
which is something that David Polk said
in one of his reviews you know it's
interesting I mean seriously you don't
need more megapixels no you don't if
you're gonna keep looking at those
photos on your smartphone this way you
don't the problem is when you've got a
Retina Display MacBook Pro and you try
to look at a an eight megapixel photo it
looks small I can tell have you guys
ever seen that yeah I don't have a
written up Excel on my on my laptop but
I have a huge 27-inch I do on your iPad
yeah you do on your iPad I mean just
think about it you have 2048 x 1536 on
your iPad and you know if you have a
photo that is gonna be of I don't know
how much is 8 megapixels by the way for
4 megapixels that is a tricky question 4
megapixel I think it's close to 3,000
something by I one close to two mega so
something like that okay okay so yeah
but but the myth of megapixels is is a
big fat lie okay true yes but ok what's
the beauty of having a DSLR it's like I
we were in Barcelona with Tony for
example and we were probably like three
blocks away from a sign that we wanted
to read and what Tony would do was grab
my DSLR zoom into it take a photo and
then just grab the digital image and
then zoom into it digitally to know what
the sign was saying so what's the point
about having so many megapixels what is
the fact that if you don't like the
whole picture
just crop it to whatever you want and
you have a usable photo so the band's
also on how you use the metal pixels
because the 808 PureView uses it to a
great extent I haven't I have a last
minute information the HTC One will go
on sale on March 15 that is if you are
in the UK and it will be launched on all
carriers at the same time so this is
great news and I hope in the US will
follow suit immediately because that's
what HTC needs as more carriers as soon
as possible oh man this is really
interesting oh wait a second they're
saying that this device is gonna have
HDR video is that even possible well I
think that it's possible because the the
Snapdragon Snapdragon 600 processor
definitely supports it and the HDR video
is already there on the sony xperia z if
i recall well you guys saw it at CES and
that was one of the main points but it
wasn't mentioned as it as a feature HDR
video i'm trying to think of that I
think it was do you remember that you
are muted I'm around you're talking for
like five minutes oh so nobody's heard
anything upset we know but obviously we
know I was saying that for megapixels I
went over in the article I wrote the
other day is twenty to forty by sixteen
eighty which for most cases is more than
enough on and I ok no the ipad is 25 its
larger yeah and and then you have the
nexus 10 which is even more than that so
it's gonna be smaller than that but
still you know it's good enough for most
cases ok so going back to the and we're
going back to another reader comment
that i'm trying to find here but i can't
find we have a hundred and eight
comments already on the post by the way
but ok so here's the deal why was it
that the galaxy s3 was better than the
HTC One X um it has to do with marketing
but you know you know HTC he last year
reminded me of blackberry you guys Tony
remember the days where if you would buy
a blackberry girl you had to either
choose if you bought the Wi-Fi model or
gpsphone yes because the SI de they were
not integrated in the same device okay
so yes say media guys with you just hold
on just one second the HTC Yahweh has
been announced as a feature of the
camera on the HTC One it apparently
allows you to automatically capture
high-resolution photos as well as short
videos at the same time so just to put
it in layman's terms while you are using
the camera most of the phones currently
allow you to snap pictures while you are
shooting video now apparently this HTC
Zoe z OE that's the three letter naming
allows you to uh it says Zoe captures
one second before the shutter is pressed
then three more seconds for a short for
second video so no more blurry images no
more photo bombers you if will start
capturing before you actually press the
button or you touch the display and it
will end capturing three seconds after
that so you probably get a nice great
sharp frame that is very interesting the
question is um so so you're taking a
photo um but you can we can
simultaneously take video but obviously
in the past that was just the frame of
video so now you're taking high
resolution photos at the same time is
what you're saying yes plus if i was to
snap a picture of you right now it will
start recording one second before i
would press the shutter button in the
HTC one is case the actual button on the
screen and it will end recording three
seconds after I release the shutter
button so it will have a four second
video clip of you and it will probably
allow either you or automatically select
the best frame within those four seconds
what do you think the other is am i
right um yeah that sounds about right I
would imagine that it just snaps a
larger photo that's what you're saying
right so because with the problem with
your when you're capturing pictures
while you're shooting images is that you
only capture at 1080p or whatever video
resolutions are shooting at okay so yeah
got got a lovely gotta love these reader
comments you guys don't even know about
the resolution of 89
so cameras unprofessional I'm like yeah
like if you know no comment for sure
wait wait let me let me pull that up I
don't know Oh Oh God 60 bad pixels come
on pull out of here all right and it's
different per camera it's different per
aspect you know it exactly exactly if
you want to take an eight megapixel
photo for example on the One X it will
not give you 16 by 9 you have to crop it
to six megapixels for that to happen
gentlemen I just received the official
specifications the press release is out
it is called HTC One and if you'd like I
can read you the entire spec sheet which
is officially arrived to my inbox from
HTC server lands good to me the size is
130 7.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 millimeters and
it's as thin as four millimeters towards
its edges so it's tapered design and it
tapers all the way to four millimeters
it weighs 143 grams with the battery it
has a 4.7 inch full HD 1080p display for
a total of 468 ppi again the biggest ppi
on a smartphone if i recall well the cv
is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad-core
processor running at 1.7 gigahertz it
runs HTC Sense with Android it's
interesting it's not it's not Android
with HTC sense it has certain it has a
certain HTC blinkfeed which is basically
the feet on your home screen for all the
social news and our assess news to which
you are subscribed to it has 2 gigabytes
of RAM and yes finally we have two
storage options 32 gigabytes and 64
gigabytes are also available even though
there's a melt here and it says
available storage is less due to phone
software of course and 64 gigabyte
variety of a label in select markets
only please bring that to the US
hopefully right by the way go ahead go
ahead Taylor um I just got confirmation
that AT&amp;amp;T will carry it from oh I'm
fabulous um
no pricing availability no pricing or
availability but it will come in 32 or
64 gigabytes okay let me let I have a
couple of specs and then we can discuss
about those I'm not going to talk about
the sensors because they're the usual
suspects there's a special dedicated
segment to the HTC boomsound which is
dual front there's two dual frontal
stereo speakers with built-in amplifiers
for studio quality sound with Beats
Audio it has to be there and then HDR
microphone as far as connectivity goes
we have DLNA Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC
everything you'd expect and now comes
the dedicated paragraph for the HTC
ultrapixel camera it has a dedicated HTC
image chip f 2 point 0 a preacher and 28
millimeter lens with optical image
stabilization smart flash and all the
others HTC Zoe is being being called out
the battery 2,300 milliamp hours and
that just sums it up so there we have it
that's the HTC One officially I got a
picture okay reader comments here Andy
thank you very much yes the HTC website
has been updated so if you want to see
the one it's there by the way for the I
have another comment down here but we
already have a hundred and eighty
comments i can't find that you were
asking what sort of body is being used
this is an aluminum body by the way and
we do get the iphone 5 chamfered edges
so if you wanted those on android there
now available or they will be available
in much it's a picture of the camera i
finally got one picture that is that is
a huge zoom on the lens and michael is
just informing us that this zoe
technology on the camera is awesome i
know i'm hugely excited about this and
he says that this is like the story
maker on steroids and I can totally
agree to that because it is just
excellent to have those four seconds
being shot what else we have also he's
currently excited and so are we about
the four millimeter standing that's just
this this then when it tapers out to the
edges so I wonder how that will feel in
the head what is the taper on the droid
DNA it you know oh no remember I don't
remember either but it
be slimmer than the droid DNA well then
I love it Nene was this one is aluminum
body so everybody everybody was
criticizing Apple that they went back to
the aluminum body or adopted the
aluminum body after the glass on the
iphone 4 and the iphone 4s excel to
taylor guilty no hours and now it looks
like I not only carbonate for that I
criticized it but by the way just to
give you an idea this is where is um I'm
trying to find where is my iphone 5 Tony
Guinea show is yours I have enough
somewhere oh here we go I have it I have
it okay so this is the iphone 5 this is
seven point six millimeters so just
think about half of this and that's how
thin it tapers dealers if we have an
image of the HTC One being laid down on
its back or be known from its tied let
this case so seriously here's the here's
the 8x I think that I think that they're
doing the 8x design in a way and then
they're doing like sharp quorum not
sharp but um how do you call this um but
they're not you know like they just went
tapers all the way to the borders I
think that it's tapering to some part of
the part of the edge and then you get
like the structural wall he'll hear that
separates everything so just think about
this I mean that's the price is
extremely thin extreme this is this is
what I'm worried about that right there
on my my oh yeah these do you guys think
that there will be a risk with the HTC
One especially the HTC One and black
because I'm not sure there are any so
many technologies to color aluminum I
mean aside from anodization you can't
really make make aluminum being one
color or the other so the white one will
probably be safe just like the white
iphone 5 but these guys think that maybe
the black HTC one is prone to chips and
scuffs just like the iphone 5 the other
one else do the one else was the one of
us anodized but why can't they just do
this all
time what we they thought that
polycarbonate was so last year and they
had to I don't know maybe aluminum
speaks of quality and this is again a
concept which was introduced by Apple
Apple introduced glass and aluminum and
everybody immediately thought of quality
when when father these two materials
samsung galaxy s free if i recall well
was almost always bashed by iphone users
as feeling cheap while polycarbonate is
still a plastic it definitely feels good
in the hand but i think HTC wanted to up
the game and go with aluminum taylor i
sent you a bunch of pictures of the HTC
one so if you can show us a couple of
those and everybody who's watching thank
you i have pull out HTC for going with
aluminum honestly i think that you know
it's it's hard to keep aluminum well you
know you obviously don't have to drop
your phone or you have to use a case um
but i feel the feel in the hand of an
aluminum phone is just amazing and i
feel that when the original iphone was
launched with aluminum um it felt good
but the problem is it at the bottom with
the plastic so it then feel as well as
the iphone five fields so i feel you
know there are two things that I like
about that is this HTC One Design the
first one is the fact that it's
obviously aluminum so it'll feel cool in
the hand and the second is the fact that
it's got the curt back so that actually
fits better in your hand then the
current fully sharpened the iphone 5
design so i like this design how about
you guys well i was just about to say
that with that the HTC event is
officially over after you guys finish
with this idea i will quickly recap the
specs for everybody to know and then i
will ask you for your top two or top
three features of the HTC One all right
I'm getting pictures right now okay well
Emily while you're getting the pictures
let me run again quickly really quickly
through the specification so the HTC One
is officially out it is being powered by
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad-core
processor clocking at 1.7 gigahertz it
has a 4.7 inch full HD screen width 468
PPI it has two gigabytes of free
32 gigabytes of internal storage 64
gigabytes in certain certain markets
there's this HTC ultrapixel camera with
that mysterious Zoe capability which we
will definitely check out and it is very
very thin tapers 24 millimeters on its
edges being made of aluminum everything
is powered by I believe a small 23
hundred million power battery okay wait
a second apparently HTC will give you a
hundred dollars okay HTC is launching a
new trade program where customers that
pre-order can turn in their current
phone and get a hundred dollars off oh
god you're going back yeah oh you're
going back this is right this is a solid
marketing and this is what what you
talked about Hyman I'm happy to see that
HTC is finally pushing from what I
recall I think there was a story which I
covered that HTC has refreshed their
marketing department and we're seeing
HTC move away from trade shows they have
their own event in New York and in
London today they are choosing a great
name for this phone the HTC One just
resonates just sound you can feel that
it is so far a great foam and with this
offer $100 up for any pre order if you
turn in your old phone I think they're
they are thinking big and now i think
the the bowl is in Samsung's court it's
in Samsung's court I just you know and
going back to the whole comment that we
were talking about okay is this device
going to be better than the galaxy s4
okay so here's the problem with samsung
um Samsung is the no compromise company
they're not after trying to sell you
beautiful design compromise for no
replaceable battery or no replaceable
storage they're like you want it all
here we gave it all to you and we even
made it thinner than the 1x um so you
know that's that's really the only thing
that upsets the about HTC they are so
pure in their design that they're trying
to do the apple thing and you know the
apple thing doesn't really work all the
time you know Android users want
expandable storage we want expandable
everything and that's not that I don't
think this device has a whole battery I
have just received
more information on the ultrapixel
camera with Zoey it's a short paragraph
so I'm going to read it right and I'm
going to quote the breakthrough HTC
ultrapixel camera redefines how people
capture relieved and share their moments
blah blah blah blah blah get back to the
point HTC Zoe gives people the ability
to shoot high resolution photos that
come to life and three-second snippets
these Zoe's photos and videos are then
displayed in a unique way that brings
the gallery to life and transform the
traditional photo gallery of still
images into emotion gallery of memories
it also automatically creates integrated
highlight films from each event
comprised of zoe's photos and videos set
to music with professional and so on and
so forth so basically it will capture an
image and that image from my
understanding is that it will have a
corresponding three second video like a
preview this is what I'm getting out of
it but again we'll just have to see for
ourselves and going through reader
comments a lot of people are complaining
about the fact that this device is not
coming to verizon and i think that's a
like like a big you know obviously
verizon got the DNA which nobody else
got but then a lot of us were actually
disappointed with the DNA i mean it had
everything except storage everything
except battery so it was like all right
it's not really a great device and it
was a good device and the one seems to
be a great device so it's just sad news
to see Verizon being left off Syria we
predicted this on the podcast if you
recall well we were talking about this
and I was I didn't think that it was a
wise choice for for verizon to get the
HDS you want but mark my words I think
that the one will get eventually to
verizon but i think that horizon and HTC
still have to sell that certain amount
of HTC droid dna's until the HTC one
gets to them and we have another picture
of this time the black HTC one right
here Tom Tony have you noticed something
that's really interesting I mean this
event was about the device and not about
sense and since looks extremely
different to the way it was before that
is true that is true but i think that
the
there they were probably focusing the
event was like 15 minutes late and it's
been over since like 10 minutes with us
a 30 minute event they were probably
highlighting the most important features
of the phone and believe me I am
impressed hardware looks really really
good but I totally agree with you since
five point 0 or whatever the name is
should have had at least or maybe it did
then we missed it so we just have to add
so we have a reader week we have a
reader comment here from Sally catharsis
why am I disappointed it's a great phone
features i love HTC but I was expecting
more hmm what more were you expecting I
and let's go through impressions I mean
free and just as a recap guys pocket now
live we're having a special edition
event I'm Brandon minimun and Michael
Fisher are at the show floor they are
most probably filming our hands on
footage right now so it'll probably be
live in the next couple minutes
obviously it'll depend network
connection and trade shows and events is
terrible so we rely on our separate
connections and it's hit or miss
sometimes so just bear with us right now
we will try to get you hands on footage
as soon as possible even if it doesn't
look as beautiful as we always try to
make videos look for you but tony is
with me here Taylor Martin is also here
with me we are covering our impressions
of everything that just happened the HTC
event so far Tony I will return my one x
and get those hundred dollars off and
get me an HTC one that's i will about i
will be so pissed if I cannot see this
phone in person in Barcelona that I'm
gonna probably have a heist area or
something like that I am getting the HTC
One I love that phone and I'm gonna get
the black one this time I am so so so
curious about Samsung's move I mean this
year the fight between the one and the
galaxy s4 is going to be tougher than
ever before and that's good for
everybody sure yes all of this it the
others you know that that fight wasn't
such a I mean that that fight was an
easy one and whether we like it or not
it wasn't easy fight this one will be
definitely a tough one to win yeah I'm
gonna give you a variety of colors here
see how that it's gonna be an
interesting fight I I think that Samsung
apparently and we've heard the rumors we
read these rumors today i believe it was
her yesterday that samsung is going to
focus more on and honestly I wouldn't
change the the galaxy s3 designer like
the design as the way it is so if they
focus on you know improving software
experiences more than hardware and not
make things too gimmicky because yeah
this this device had a lot of motion
gestures and things but I never use them
um so I don't know I think it's
anybody's game and I love the fact that
HTC is going to launch this phone on
sale probably hopefully before samsung
announces their galaxy s3 but we heard
the rumors yesterday that apparently the
samsung of it is going to happen on
march 14th so and the only reason why i
think that samsung is changing this is
because they learned about the HTC
launch and that's why they want to
launch their phone before people go out
and make lines for the one I think
that's why they're doing it that is true
and I definitely agree with you guys
real quick top two or top three features
of the HTC One okay well I can give you
a the only feature I don't like which I
think quicker that's the battery I have
hounded them for ages over their battery
life and Taylor what if what if the
Snapdragon 600 processor coupled with
with Sense 5 point will be very very
light on the battery and that 23 the
hundred million power battery will be
enough for a day long usage what what
about who wants just enough no I want I
want two or three days fair enough your
mum minimum Marinette now here's now
here's a point just think about this
how's the battery life on your Nexus 4
it's bad but i only paid 300 4 or 3 43
49 really ok so here's the deal um this
Snapdragon 600 is twenty-five percent
more efficient than the s4 pro on your
Nexus 4 so what would be twenty-five
percent more battery life in your usage
scenario here here's my thing
all these features this is more
efficient this is more battery efficient
this is more battery efficient that
doesn't help that much it might sound
like it does 25 more or twenty-five
percent more efficient may sound like
it's a lot but in my use I've noticed
that all these things that they say are
more battery efficient display this this
display doesn't use the battery it's
still the most it counts for the most
battery drain on any of the diocese ever
and it's it's not what exams the only
way to fight battery drain is more
battery for now yes but you know that
again there's the chicken and the egg
story if you were HTC and you were
thinking of a nine point seven
millimeter thick foam which tapers 24
millimeters you don't have enough space
to shove in a huge battery with that so
you have you have to have a trade-off
and I think that big go on go ahead go
ahead go good I think that this is the
dilemma of our days I don't mind
carrying a thick phone the 808 PureView
raid raid I mean give me a thick phone
with at least a max battery like
Motorola does but my wife is actually
one my one fear the one is that it might
be too thin I've always felt that way
about some phones the 1x that's about as
thin as I want really honestly um I
don't know I I'll tell tell I'll tell
you this much I I have to agree with you
guys I would prefer a thick phone with
an amazing battery if it's not gonna be
replaceable that's me that's also please
it's an amazing design it's it's
beautiful awesome that's great HTC um
but to 2,300 milliamp hours is cutting
it real short with a 1080p display why
don't they leave them at my hydrogen
make a max yeah the bat that the battery
life on the DNA HTC was terrible that
was one of our biggest complaints with
the with with DNA and this will probably
repeat itself and I mean hey it's fine
that you want to play the non
replaceable battery game it's it's okay
just get us a better battery that's all
I carry on I carry around to peak 6000
Chargers to keep all my phones charged
it's not bad it
um top features the display obviously
it's going to be the highest density
display it's above and beyond what
anybody can ever see but it's still it's
gonna be great um front-facing speakers
and the camera those are the only things
that I really even care about since the
battery life isn't gonna be great how
about how minor how about storage 32 or
64 gigabytes for you um like I said yeah
well I know how is good enough what is
just enough okay come on okay and here's
the problem and here is my problem with
Android as an operating system um when
you when you buy the HTC One X you'll
notice that out of the 32 gigabytes of
storage that you don't really get those
32 gigabytes accessible for applications
or at least not everything so you you
actually only get I think it's like
seven gigabytes of available storage for
apps and you know I find this really i
find it really stupid that with um with
a jetta with jelly bean and ice cream
sandwich I think it's only jelly bean
that you can't really select that you
want part of the app to go into the
storage section and and I wrong guys
because I've had this problem with the
1x that and I'm also having it with the
galaxy s3 i only get 16 gigabytes on the
galaxy s3 for apps and then i have to
use the rest of the SD card firm for
music but i can't really use it for apps
as I wish you know i was showing there i
have the 16 gigabyte nexus 4 here and i
have 12.9 2 gigabytes free or not free
but just amazed are available yeah i
mean one of those features okay for me
for me honestly number one is designed
the phone is pretty it's just as it is
it because it looks a little bit like
the iphone 5 you know i will you
remember you remember my posta of what
would Steve Jobs say about the iphone 5
and then I wrote you guys screwed up you
know my first impressions on the iphone
5 were that it was an ugly phone I mean
I well the first thing that I saw said I
was like what I was like what is this
you know a headphone jack at the bottom
and then one speaker is not the same
size as the other like this looks
terrible
like if the Steve Jobs would have seen
this thing but you know once you hold
the desired the device for the first
time you like okay fine pictures don't
do it any justice so you know the thing
is this device looks really beautiful in
photos it looks really nice it looks
really really elegant and I think that
it is a phone that I would be proud to
show around you know i I just I like it
um I don't know I I really like it I
that's my point number one is designed
number two I want to see that 1080p
display um I you know from me the one x
is like every time I would look at the
screen it's like if it was painted on
the display and I would be like oh it
was just such a WOW factor for me that I
really wanted to see the display and to
be honest with you I know that a lot of
people out there hate HTC Sense I'm on
the list that doesn't hate it I actually
like it a lot I feel that it's very
smart it's not the fastest operating
system or or plugin but it's it's it's
the smartest one in my opinion um and
then the third thing thing is I want to
see that ultrapixel camera I really want
to see it i want to see how good it is I
want to see HDR video that's like I'm
really looking forward to that you know
because probably one of the things that
pisses you off the most is when you're
in a low light situation and the flash
of the camera of any phone is not really
going to do much for the video and then
you notice that every time that you're
trying to shoot a video you know
obviously it frames into the shot so if
you try to take a photo um and you're
going on if you're on camera mode the
photo actually is able to take more of
the canvas then if you're shooting a
video it crops in for some reason and
you know I really want to see how this
camera will perform in night or in low
light situations that's me I just got a
last-minute information it appears that
here in Europe the phone will go
unlocked for brace yourselves 699 euros
which translates to none less than 800
0909 $35 so that's unlocked in some
countries of Europe oh wow um I got this
in a press release the HTC ultrapixel
camera which gathers three hundred
percent more light than other camera
sensors for better low-light performance
so they said that about they said that
about the 1 xn yeah but this I did but
allegedly is even more light-sensitive
than for instance Sony's backlit camera
sensor but for that I am very curious to
see how this HTC one compares to the
low-light performance of the Lumia 920
and the low leiper from low life low
light performance of the Sony Xperia
said I don't know I I remember I was
hold on
