now and this is another episode of the
Android application weekly in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it
easy PDF reader is a paid-for
application that costs $0.99 on the
Android Market and this is probably the
best PDF file reader available on the
Android platform so I have to do is
upload your PDF files directly to your
SD card and the program will find it so
here we have a little tutorial on how to
solve a Rubik's Cube a 2 by 2 root SKU
so I was trying to do this for another
video so we can zoom in we can zoom out
we can also search through this document
if I'd like it can go from one page to
another transition is very smooth flight
track is a paid for Android application
that cost $4.99 what this application
allows you to do is to track flights
let's say you're going to pick something
up at the airport and you want to know
exactly when they're going to rise and I
will search for this airline and it
looks as though Orlando to Las Vegas
let's just click on there
I came to view the information about the
flight I can also get any delay
information I can go here and view the
map of the real-time flight on this
Google map and I can also call Delta if
I like to nf also get a seat map my
paper airplane to is a light and paid
for game that costs $2.99 on the Android
Market so this game is pretty simple so
let's just choose one of these tracks
I'll choose the evening city and also
choose easy so it's a three-dimensional
game and well hopefully you can start
this and it works by using the
accelerometer to steer in and out and up
and down to gather these stars and to
also avoid other objects so what said
that I was to hit this tree then my
paper airplane would stop and I would
have to start over so top is a free and
paid for an Android application the
lecture to take panoramic photos and it
automatically stitches them together so
the way that it works is it uses the
accelerometer and digital compass built
into your device so it'll automatically
take photos when you change the
access of your device so I can load one
of the panorama ones that I've taken
this evening and as you can see it has
stitched the photo together to a
three-dimensional view sword so from
here I can upload it and also share my
panorama with other people wait voice is
a paid-for alarm clock and this probably
the best alarm clock available on the
android market at this time and it costs
around two dollars and 83 cents and
there is a free trial so how it works is
it will turn off with a voice command
and it will also also hit snooze and
other buttons so let's go in here and
you can change some of the settings to
our alarm clock so I'm just going to set
this up so that it turns on in just a
second and when you enter the correct
phrase it will turn the alarm clock off
and you can also change it to have new
settings and also weather information so
this has been another episode of Android
application weekly and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also Lisa comes down below the name
is live wallpapers called nightfall live
wallpaper and there are two versions
available a paid version which has a few
settings but a dollar 49 I don't
recommend purchasing it and a free
version which of course has limited
settings to get the download information
for all these applications just follow
the link in the description to the
director to pocket now where we stored
the QR codes and all you do is snap a
picture using Google Goggles or any
other QR code scanner to download those
apps thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
