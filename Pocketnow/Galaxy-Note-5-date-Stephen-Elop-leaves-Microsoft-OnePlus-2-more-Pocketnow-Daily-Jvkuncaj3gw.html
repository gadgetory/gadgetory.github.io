an early launch date moto 360 Android
wear update finally reaches consumers
and Microsoft has decided to align
engineering teams and let go of Stephen
Elop in the process I'm hi Mary vetta
and given the fact that it's Father's
Day down here I guess it's only fair
that you all only a beer this is fog on
out daily the official news today are
great for most of us rocking a moto 360
Motorola has finally decided to push the
new version of Android wear to the
SmartWatch meeting 511 you have any lap
tray the new way to connect your watch
through Wi-Fi in addition to a way to
lock the watch and so many other things
that were available for watch urbane in
addition to other models out there as
well so yeah it'll take some time for
you to take the update you know the way
this works but you can bet that I'm
gonna go put it on right now and for
those of you wondering what exactly will
be the name of the oneplus 2 well it'll
be the one plus two the company has
pretty much begun teasing the
specifications of its product and it's
being dubbed the oneplus with a number
two so one thing we have learned today
is that it will be a Snapdragon 810
processor powering this new puppy and
even though we don't know exactly when
the product will be announced it should
be soon as teasers are coming in hard
now let's talk about that Blackberry
Samsung product apparently the code name
will be the blackberry Venice and we've
seen some leaked photos of the
blackberry passport running Android so
yeah it makes sense for you know
blackberry to test android on its
current Hardware it seems to work just
fine but we also got specification
Snapdragon 808 in addition to three gigs
of ram and everything you would need to
power an android phone so we just have
to wait and see what exactly this will
all be about and given the fact that
Apple has pretty much taken over the
phablet market with the iphone 6 plus it
only makes sense for samsung to do
something about it we've heard rumors of
the galaxy note5 and just about
everything but the launch date because
we were expecting it to happen Anifah as
it always has but we've got some trusted
sources saying that no given the fact
that the iphone 6s plus might be
announced in September which
usually happens that way but it seems
that Samsung won't be waiting for a
fight seems that we might have an event
in August so you can bet we will keep an
eye on that and finally for the very
interesting news of the day isn't it
interesting when companies dismiss or
reorganize that they launched this
public statement saying we're
reorganizing our engineering teams to
better align with our goals and then
they fired so many people that is the
case with Microsoft they had just let go
of Stephen Elop in addition to other
executives and the most famous one is
Stephen Elop he was head of Microsoft's
you know mobile division addition to
hardware and yet this was the guy that
was assigned to know yeah to become the
company CEO then push it out of its
problems and ended up making it a
Microsoft company a lot of things have
happened with heel off he's famous for a
lot of things infamous for others and
that's mainly the reason why it leads me
to the question of the day are you happy
or disappointed with Microsoft's
dismissal of Stephen Elop in my case I
am mixed I do like the whole Lumia
concept the way nokia revamp itself I
just feel they chose the wrong operating
system but the hardware was beautiful
and the focus on camera technology and
other things was amazing I feel that it
raised the bar and so many things that I
feel bad for Stephen Elop to leave but
leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends you know the drill if
