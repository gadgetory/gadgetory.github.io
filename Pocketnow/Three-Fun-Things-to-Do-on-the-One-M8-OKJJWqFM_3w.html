to do with the galaxy s5 but if you want
to mate or nurse at home felt left out
no worries we have you covered too I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and here
are three fun things to do with your One
m8 out of the box the One m8 camera
comes with six shooting modes the
standard camera video capture Zowie
camera selfie dual capture and panorama
it also provides a hefty amount of
settings which you can tweak to get
exactly the picture you want if you're
prone to tweaking settings in the camera
application and find it frustrating to
have to constantly go back and tweak the
settings to your liking HTC included a
feature just for you you can save your
preferred settings as another camera
mode for instance I like to take HDR
photos I simply saved my settings as a
mode called HDR camera now I can tap the
shooting mode button in the lower right
corner of the viewfinder and load those
settings with just two taps you can even
rearrange the camera modes to bring your
custom modes to the front page there's
also another fun feature in the camera
or in the gallery rather if you take a
few burst shots or a Zowie
you can turn the multiple images into a
jiff open the stack of similar photos or
the Zowie video in the gallery and tap
the edit button and select jiff creator
trim the jib to your liking and hit next
on the next page you can choose how the
jiff plays back either forward backward
or yo-yo style the playback speed can
apply a filter and you can edit out any
of the individual frames you don't want
when you hit save you can choose from
three different resolutions and then you
have a chip something that can be
particularly frustrating when you get a
new device is setting up your home
screen sure it's fun but rearranging
everything the way you want can be
time-consuming and repetitive especially
jumping in and out of the app drawer
long pressing the app you want and
dragging it to a specific page or folder
there are two options on the One m8
which can make this process easier and
possibly even fun first if you prefer to
drag icons from the app drawer you can
reduce the number of pages to swipe
through by changing the grid size but a
fault is a three by four grid or only
twelve icons per page you can increase
the icon grid size by tapping the menu
icon in the app drawer
tapping grid size and selecting four by
five
this adds a tie cons to each page makes
better use of the screen size and
reduces the number of swipes you'll make
every time you visit the app drawer but
if you really want to add icons to your
homescreen quickly go to your home
screen and pinch to access the home
screen edit menu tap the drop down menu
on the left and select apps then tap
away rather than long pressing and
dragging icons one by one to a home
screen a single tap will automatically
place icons on the home screen once you
have all the icons you want or fill up a
home screen you can then rearrange them
this is both faster and far less
frustrating than the age-old
drag-and-drop method do you have some
fun things you like to do with your One
m8 share them in the comments below
