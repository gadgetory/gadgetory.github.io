display as production begins next month
the Samsung Galaxy s5 could include a
fingerprint scanner after all and
Microsoft may just be one week away from
naming a new CEO I'm hi Mary vera and if
I'm filming this video from Redmond next
week you'll understand why that is this
is parking out daily this way off with
some official news as Facebook has just
announced a new client called paper for
the iPhone it's currently just for iOS
there is no information on Android or
Windows Phone just yet and it should be
available on februari third and what's
cool about this application is that even
though it looks a lot like Flipboard it
actually is much smarter you can
classify your content meaning you have
different pains for your friends for
your news in a way that you won't get
everything vomited on the same timeline
especially for those candy crush updates
as well no this is actually smarter you
get everything separate and aside from
that it also takes stuff like your
gyroscope for example so you can pan
from side to side on a photograph well
they're having to touch the photo with
your fingers which is really cool again
februari third is when the application
is available and let's see when all the
platforms get it now let's talk about
Google as the company's quarter results
are out and those of you wondering why
that they sell motorola to lenovo well
these quarter results shed some light
the company had lost ready four million
dollars in just one quarter which is
double the losses compared to last
quarter which is quite significant
obviously it was a big cash cow but on
the positive news for those of you
worried about the Nexus line of dying
anytime soon well we've got reports that
the colored versions of the Nexus 5
should be available on februari Ford so
that could happen a lot later now let's
talk about Samson is famous tipster
Eveleigh says just detective of the
galaxy s5 includes this file that says
that it will include a fingerprint
scanner which is really interesting it's
actually the first leak about this
that's actually quite close to accurate
as we have assumed this but obviously
only because the iphone 5s has a
fingerprint scanner another leak also
says that there will be 3d gestures on
this phone and I wish somebody could
please explain to me what this is in the
comments down below but yeah that's
apparently coming also now let's talk
about Microsoft as it's been five months
since the company has announced that
they are looking for a new
oh and even though I'm still waiting for
their phone call it seems that the
company has already made a decision I'm
still waiting for the call and as it
turns out apparently the company is
planning to announce their new CEO next
week which is really important as a lot
of people are already worried about
Microsoft's future would so much they've
taken for this and even though that it
does seem that the CEO will come from
within big rumors have it that it will
not be Stephen Elop so stay tuned for
that and finally for the hot news of the
day we heard the news from tim cook
himself saying that they had bought this
manufacturing facility in meza arizona
to build set fire glass and the rumors
are this is actually for the iphone 6
rumors also have it that the plant will
begin production next month and that
Foxconn has already built a hundred
prototypes of the next-generation iphone
to finish assembly at this plant with a
sapphire glass though some of us are
believing that this is just the screen
protector others are actually believing
that this will be the glass that will
cover the display it's really hard to
know right now because there are just
tons of rumors but yeah the
manufacturing facility starts working
next month that's actually confirmed
then a hundred prototypes of the
next-generation iphone do mean that we
will probably have a phone by mid-year
so that leads you to the question of the
day what a sapphire display on the
next-generation iphone make you an
iphone believer would that make you buy
an iphone because it will obviously make
it more durable this is only less
durable in diamonds in my particular
case honestly i would still buy the
iphone anyways but yeah sapphire display
would make a big difference especially
if they keep the price but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
