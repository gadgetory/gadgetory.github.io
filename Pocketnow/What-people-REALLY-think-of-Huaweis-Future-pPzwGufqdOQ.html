Barco sips on a Samsung Cup I know man
certain companies have been very silent
lately for some reason hi miss hands
appear big compared to his head
hi Matt please confirm whether your
hands are larger than your head um maybe
the stove is for tend to cook sick burn
finally seven plus minutes ten minutes
would be great guys seriously I mean
last week's recap alone had so many
comments that we wanted to make a
comment video for the comments video and
then we were considering I mean wouldn't
it be great if we actually address
certain comments within the daily since
we have so many I feel that only four
comments per daily on the recap is
unfair let us know what you would think
about that in the comments but anyways
that's right it's that time of the week
I am happy that out this is PocketNow
this is the bargain out daily recap your
comments for this week
so in Monday the topic was you know that
certain interview that was conducted to
huawei CEO and you know when asked about
a possible ban to Apple he was like no I
would be the first one to protest I
asked you what do you think about Huawei
from that perspective I mean do you
think that the company is being too
aggressive or too little
we had 901 comments huawei approach is
admirable you know I would highly
recommend that you watch the weekly we
actually concluded that we have to
admire huawei CEOs reaction I mean he's
being very humbled regardless of the
fact that he does admit I mean the
company is going to probably it's
Werth's times but it's only making a
stronger which is yeah some people were
like yeah this is just PR jargon guys I
don't know what to tell you I feel that
the response has been great Bren is a
true example of good leadership true
that I mean you know I've seen leaders
like Steve Jobs he pretty much picked up
Apple when the company was at its worst
timing he said that there were like 20
days from insolvency and you know he
could have complained about everything
and made this whole show about it
instead he was like we've got to fix
this let's fix this and let's just get
it over with that's the mentality that
you need in companies like this
huawei CEO acknowledges Apple provides
great competition and keeps them from
becoming stagnant US companies could
learn from this guy seriously I feel
that one of the biggest deterrents in
the United States is the stock market
because it's that whole mentality where
we have to keep investors happy and
therefore we only focus on gains on
growth and not necessarily in doing the
right thing creating the right products
it's all about the investors and not
about the products for certain companies
while we should not change their
strategy keep being polite for
interviews and staying aggressive with
their quality priced product true that
we just hope that that continues
particularly with everything that's
happening but on Tuesday we we discussed
the possible Huawei solution I mean
there was the possibility of Arc OS with
the trademark and then we heard the TSMC
was actually going to honor the orders
they had for chips so we pretty much
could say that Huawei has their problem
solved I asked you what you thought
about this we had 956 comments Arco s
with better privacy
an Android would be ironic cuz you
deserve those 140 comments seriously you
know it's one of the things that upsets
me the most how we always say that you
know this whole espionage thing that
Amazon echo is constantly listening to
everything that I say and I need to
figure out how to cover that camera by
the way well we should give app
developers and customers a better deal
than Google and Apple do with their App
Store you know and the thing about it is
Huawei already has experience I mean
they have an app store already created
from China so it's not like if the
company doesn't know what to do truly
that I do hope that that would be the
solution I don't care what the software
does I just want something new because
I'm so tired of Android and iOS and
they're monopolies that duopoly
seriously has the market hindered
particularly with developers I mean
developers have to pay a strong cut for
their apps and well it's not necessarily
the best solution to create apps for
Android I mean any developer would tell
you that it's kind of a nightmare to do
so not so much a problem for iOS and
sure I mean I feel that the market needs
something better but you know what the
problem is that there has been something
at some point quote unquote better which
is what Windows Phone did and developers
just didn't care which is the worse
butter ran management and battery please
with ARC oh my god yes and you know wha
wait does have experience with this with
that operating system that they have for
the watch GT that watches battery life
lasts forever so they know what to do I
hope they could port it into a phone
then as a palate cleanser on Wednesday
we decided you know what let's stop
talking about huawei for a bit let's
talk about the Galaxy Note n we had a
ton of leaks and renders I asked you
what you thought about these I mean
single punch hole or dual we had 638
comments horizontal camera layout please
just place it higher to accommodate a
bigger battery know last year's iPhone
like layout please got seriously how
many companies are going to follow that
design I'm seriously hoping that
companies come up with something I don't
know
creative dare I say Wow away with that
square design of the mate 20 pro I mean
why not
I don't like the back design at all the
sn+ is simply perfect
just add the s-pen faster charger and
you're good to go
I don't know it's not that I don't like
the back design I just find it to be
very unoriginal it's not I'm not saying
that it's only er that samsung shouldn't
do it I've always loved the fact that
Samsung goes for the center design and I
mean why not do it here no punch hole
till then no Samsung for me oh man you
know I don't know which solution is
better I would rather the punch hole
over a lot of the solutions that are out
there right now horizontal camera is a
better design choice as it won't wobble
while on a table true that for many
companies but you know Samsung does a
really good job at not coming up with
the most horrible camera humps so in the
case of Samsung I actually would trust
them more and placing that hump wherever
they want but be able see then on
Thursday we talked about impossible
things particularly you know considering
Apple's reality distortion field there
was a band that considered the
possibility of foldable glass which to
my understanding is impossible for you
know the next generation iPhone or iPad
or whatever that may be we had a ton of
comments where people were like yeah you
know the Gorilla Glass just came out
corning just came up with this like
folding glass guys glass doesn't Bend
unless you heat it up and then it breaks
we had 685 comments peple is making
foldable products is the iPhone 6 plus
283 Lex man true that Apple won't use
glass it's physically impossible but
they'll call it glass anyways just like
they call sapphire to the camera
protective glass which is not sapphire
at all
it's got sapphire components but yeah
you're you've got a point there buddy
it's going to be a graphene screen that
is easy foldable pretty much unbreakable
vibranium or graphene like oh we still
haven't been able to make batteries out
of that foldable Apple device no thanks
I'm sure it'll cost ten thousand dollars
for the base variant $11,000 I'd say and
then finally Friday thinks got really
loaded with Huawei again starting with
the possible China blacklist and I know
there's already one but apparently they
want to extend it and now they don't
want to trade their minerals and they
don't want to allow certain companies to
come to China yeah crazy and then we
were hearing about Huawei starting its
own research center for 5g in Korea even
if they just lost the job
Penny's 5g business with a Softbank and
then we've got the plea that it's
unconstitutional everything that's
happening to them in the United States
everything was crazy on Friday we had
nearly 900 comments the Huawei stories
are way more interesting than the last
season of Game of Thrones
dude 600 likes and I have to agree with
you man what happened to the last season
everything was going great and it's not
like if people wanted it to end but yeah
I know I'm going off-topic I agree that
this is a loss loss issue but I hope
that US companies stand together and
stop this executive order it's called an
executive order for a reason it's not
that easy
I I don't know what's gonna happen dude
but I do hope I mean because like every
it's funny but I think the company is
losing the most is Google it's funny how
Google and Android are going to lose so
much of this continues unfortunately the
trade war is causing more harm than good
and I'll see how this can benefit any
site other than probably force
innovation but even that takes time you
know the biggest problem with this is
when you create a system focused on
trade I mean the United States was fine
before this they created this trade
system in the 90s and a lot of companies
just decided okay fine we're gonna start
building stuff in China and in Mexico
and creating those infrastructures took
years I was part of that I worked for a
US company in my home country and that's
just the way it was and you know a lot
of these economies depend on this trade
design and just out of the blue now you
want to create tariffs and it's
hilarious because a lot of the products
that are gonna be affected by these
tariffs are US products because these
are the ones that are being manufactured
overseas it's not just you know Chinese
products coming to the United States now
dude I mean what about everything that's
being built there which is not their
fault they just follow the trade
agreement that was created by the United
States the United States and eye for an
eye leaves the whole world blind and
what is going to benefit from this it's
a bad chain reaction definitely the
biggest problem with this whole issue is
that there's no way that anybody's gonna
win out of this the United States might
get some tax money from the tariffs but
how is this
going to benefit us companies surely I
do have to say that in the case of the
eye for an eye you have a point
China was blocking us companies from
making business in China for the longest
time Facebook Google so truly this is
not necessarily the United States fault
this is actually something started by
China many years ago so you know I'm not
saying that one solution is good or the
other it's funny how I read some
comments and everybody was like yeah
these guys are just huawei defenders
we're not dude it's just you have no
idea this is not about who's right or
who's wrong it's about the fact that the
you know countries are so entwined
they're they're so but I don't know how
can I say this economy's depends so much
on trade today that you can't just back
up now it's too late for that that's
just me but yeah we'll see how that ends
up that's it for the parking out daily
