packing.com and today i will show you a
neat little application from windows
mobile marketplace that actually allows
you to turn your photos into a photo
mosaic and this is called photo mez so
you first start off by clicking on the
center and then you select a photo which
you actually want to be turned into a
mosaic so if i pick this photo right
here it will start to activate and
actually go through the rest of my
photos inside of that folder and start
to turn the photo into a mosaic so as
you can see will let it continue okay so
as you can see as it's finished i can
actually see the image of the flower on
the windows mobile default photos in
this album so i can zoom in on the image
if i want and i can actually see which
pictures i've used so i can see that
there's a lot of different photos that
were from that album so i can also zoom
out and move the photo around if i want
so just go back and i'll do another
photo let's see clear that just go to
another one so if i pick this leaf as
you can see it's a lot of green on here
so it will probably use photos that have
a lot of green in them so we'll let it
just mosaic that photo okay so here we
have another photo as you can see it's a
little bit skewed because there weren't
too many images inside that folder so
this is photo mez and the application is
actually free so you can try it out and
this is another marketplace pick where
we picked some fun and interesting
applications on Windows more marketplace
