last few quarters and a lot of it has to
do with the company strategic
partnerships out of which there was one
I could just not pass out I'm high
memory when I with PocketNow here with a
quick look at the Oppo f1 plus FC
Barcelona Edition the approach the
special edition phones is not new with
cases like Samsung launching a Batman
phone then pricing it at a staggering
amount of money for just getting a
Batman logo at the back oboes approach
to the f1 plus barcelona edition is
actually quite different and I mean in a
good way the unboxing experience has a
lot to do with this the faux leather
finish of the cardboard is stamped with
an FC Barcelona logo making this one of
those boxes you just won't want to throw
away sliding from the top we're greeted
with more dark cardboard and then the
goods lie within the accessories are
actually a big deal as Oppo has bundled
the silicone case that includes the
signatures of certain FC Barcelona
players and then below we're treated by
the standard boug rapid charger and
cable in addition to the only thing that
I really won't celebrate which are the
headphones that are rather cheap the
main story here though is the phone the
Oppo f1 plus is wrapped around a matte
plastic that then reveals the gorgeous
anodized aluminum finish that's 10 to
the nefzi Barcelona colours within the
chassis there's also a gold logo of the
team that's textured and somehow blends
perfectly with the aluminum and about
everything else this is a noble f1 plus
just like the one that they booted in
March the same mediatek helio p10
processor with 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs
of expandable storage via micro sd and
that slot is actually doubled as a
second SIM card slot we've also got the
same gorgeous 5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED
display protected by Gorilla Glass 4 an
identical 28 50 milliamp hour battery
and the same set of cameras that go from
13 megapixels in the primary shooter the
16 megapixels in the selfie camera front
a lot of the same is actually not bad
and mainly because we're greeted by the
amazing build quality that makes
oh really famous the 2.5 the glass
finish actually protrudes the devices
frame giving it a surreal feel of
thinness that's not really matched by
other phones yes if this phone reminds
you of another it's really hard not to
throw it out there given the fact that
it's bundled case looks identical to
another fruity phone out there the
differences can be found mainly in how
color OS 3.0 is tailored to serve FC
Barcelona fans elements like the
launcher are then custom with a new
wallpaper that limits the colors of the
team and then the theme store also
provides additional options for
wallpapers etc for any diehard FC
Barcelona fan it really does not get any
better than this and given the fact that
the Oppo f1 plus is really not a bad
smartphone per se it's a really good
premium mid-range err this is probably
one of the best bets you can follow if
