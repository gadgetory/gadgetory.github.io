we've shown you how it stacks up against
the Galaxy s3 so the next logical step
was to use it as our daily driver for a
weekend right I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Galaxy camera as
daily driver a weekend experiment now
before you say anything no this wasn't
just a stunt we really wanted to find
out if the galaxy camera which runs the
full version of Android and packs a
cellular radio could substitute as a
daily driver for some people
specifically shutter bugs who don't make
a lot of phone calls but do communicate
in other ways like via social media and
texting it's similar to the question
that came up when tablets first became
popular could I carry this instead of a
phone or in addition to something like a
dumb phone is that possible is it
workable is it practical with the Galaxy
camera in this use case it admittedly
wasn't designed for the answer is yes
it's possible to use as a daily driver
no it's not practical but it's not that
far off the mark I took it for a spin as
my daily driver for a weekend on 80 here
in the Boston area and I came away with
these pluses and minuses first things
first you can't use the Galaxy camera as
a phone in the traditional sense because
there's no earpiece and the mic isn't in
the right place furthermore there's no
phone application in the jellybean build
that ships with the camera but you can
use the speakerphone to make and take
calls and Skype works just fine in that
regard with and without video in video
calling mode the primary shooter is used
as there's no front-facing camera though
the camera has a phone number assigned
to it it's not possible to make calls to
or send texts to the device in the
customary way but once again third-party
apps like Google Voice work just fine
for this purpose and samsung also
bundles their own chaton app for
messaging of course since this is an
Android device you can download nearly
any messaging solution you like Facebook
Messenger and gtalk performed very well
during our time with the camera that's a
recurring theme with the galaxy camera
if it doesn't come with the
functionality you need out of the box
you can download it from the Play Store
in most instances thanks to its nature
is a fully fledged Android device I was
able to get my home screens lined up in
my preferred order with HD widgets and
transit titles games calendars and even
Spotify it was a strange but fun
experience to blast pin back from my
camera
this being the 18 T version of the
device I was confined to HSPA
but data speeds and reception were quite
good and of course shots taken with the
cameras 16 megapixel sensor outclassed
what's possible with most smartphones
sugar's having the option to upload
directly to Facebook Twitter and
Instagram without bothering with finding
a Wi-Fi hotspot was really nice nothing
new for smartphones course but a
convenient novelty on something called a
camera unfortunately that comes with
some compromises as you might expect
this being a camera it's big and bulky
compared to most smartphones as I
mentioned in the galaxy s3 comparison
while portrait use is possible it's not
preferable because of the awkward way it
sits in the hand landscape dual handed
use is preferred again no surprise there
even for a camera though it's big this
is not a pocketable device because of
that massive optical zoom machinery what
was a surprise was the size of the
battery included in the galaxy camera
only 1650 milliamp hours and that
limitation was really apparent I don't
know why Samsung couldn't find a way to
include a beefier battery in this big
hardware it was easy to go from a full
charge to a depleted cell and just over
half a day with heavy usage and once
again that's usage as a smart phone
substitute not as a camera so it won't
affect you if you're using the device
for its intended purpose but it was
still quite disappointing for such a big
and heavy device to die so quickly
Samsung's taken some steps to squeeze as
much endurance as possible from the
camera and that's resulted in some odd
behavior there's an auto power off that
you can optimize in the settings menu
but the device also goes into a kind of
a deep standby at times that prevents it
from receiving timely notifications
almost all of my email text and gtalk
alerts were delayed significantly during
my time with the unit in standby which
says to me that Samsung has tweaked the
unit's listening settings when the
screen is off I was also surprised by
how much lag there was
daily use I thought that the same quad
core Exynos processor is the galaxy s3
this thing should be screaming
particularly with project butter
enhancements it felt a lot like the unit
CPU had been down clocked and I was
confused until I discovered that the
power saving feature was on I'm not sure
if this happened out of the box or if
this is something I did and then forgot
but you'll want to check that setting if
you're feeling a lot of lag on your
Galaxy camera because it absolutely does
limit the CPUs efficiency in the name of
battery life leading to a less than
ideal software experience taking the
Galaxy camera around town as my
smartphone replacement was as you might
expect again a study in compromise while
it bore all the challenges that come
with using a device in a manner not
intended it actually shined by virtue of
including the full suite of enhancements
that any high-end Android device offers
in 2013 but at for $99.99 this is no
impulse purchase or trivial investment
while I like it a lot and it's a very
capable camera I'd wait for the next
generation hopefully with slimmer
hardware and a beefier battery to give
this the full thumbs-up for data centric
shutter bugs looking to replace their
smartphone
that's going to do it for Galaxy camera
as daily driver a weekend experiment
