pocketnow.com here at CES 2013 we're
looking at the hawawa media pad 10 F HD
which is a competitor to the Asus
Transformer Prime infinity let's take a
look at it now we showed you this part
of it the tablet part at Eva and so so
that's not new what is new is this
keyboard dock and it makes for a package
that really competes with the
transformer prime infinity because of
course you can remove the tablet the
tablet itself is a full HD 12 or 1920 by
1200 essentially a little bit better
than 1080p you get some extra pixels in
the vertical here and it's got a quad
core processor with one or two gigabytes
of RAM depending on the configuration
that you go with now we've got four
always emotion UI which does something
that I love and we saw it on the d2 this
guy disappears like that so you go into
any application let's bring that back
say we're the Twitter app full-screen
view and then it goes in kind of
stretches to fit a full screen now I hit
the home button on the keyboard here
also what we get to bring that back also
what we get with this keyboard
configuration as we get a pointer
outlined in here
if we can determine if there's
multi-touch here that would be cool now
wouldn't it and by the way okay no
browser let see we can scroll now you
can't scroll Ikki just oh there's
nothing to Scrolls and that's difficult
to tell
and of course we want to release the
tablet you slide this over you get your
tablet free and then you get the thin
and light tablet that is the media pad
10 HD something that makes us here when
you close their gun when you close the
logos up stood upside down what a pity
thumbs down says Michael Fisher overall
really cool tablet though we're really
curious on pricing hopefully comes under
the Asus Transformer Prime infinity so
that it's more competitive there's
basically the same thing but for Huawei
certainly so that since the knee pad
tenant HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
