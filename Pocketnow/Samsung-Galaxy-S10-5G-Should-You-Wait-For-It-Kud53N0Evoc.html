coming for quite some time now some
people still don't even know what it is
while others are really looking forward
to it I was standing in the middle
waiting for somebody to actually show me
5g working and Samsung was the first
company back at MWC 2019
I'm home it'll be better with pocket now
and these are my thoughts on the Samsung
Galaxy S sent 5g sponsored by D brand
the Galaxy S 10 is already with us I
know that some of you are already
unboxing your brand new phones and I
know that others of you are waiting to
see if it's worth it to wait for the 5g
variant which is more future proof to
that I will say it depends see there
aren't differences other than the 5g
connectivity to the current Galaxy S
tens that are launching right now on
March 8th first of all the galaxy s 10 v
G is actually the largest of the pack it
was to be expected with the added 5g
antennas and yet it's not that much
larger in footprint of the galaxy s 10
plus we're talking about a larger 6.7
inch quad-hd dynamic Super AMOLED
display that's just the stunning as the
other galaxy has 10 units with the same
HDR 10 plus capabilities in tow the
aluminum on the sides has some
interesting accents to make it stand
apart and then there's this cool color
option that actually looks more like
gold on the back and that doesn't really
show fingerprints that much an
interesting twist is at the 5g logo in
the back is not available in all markets
and will also light up whenever it's
connected to 5g internally we have the
new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 paired with
the Qualcomm X 55 G modem it has the
same eight gigabytes of RAM as the rest
but a boostin based storage to 256 gigs
the battery is also larger at 4500
milliamp hours with the usual ip68 water
and dust resistance and qi wireless
charging that's also reversible and then
there are the differences with the
surely you have the same arrangement as
the Galaxy S 10 plus but there is an
advantage of a time-of-flight sensor in
the case of the galaxy s 10 5 G and this
is actually for both the primary and the
selfie shooter this helps the phone
create a better depth map and therefore
allow you to create videos with bouquet
and see the results in real time but now
on to the most important question is it
really worth it to wait for a 5g
smartphone i think that samsung's demo
was probably the most complete and best
that i've seen so far
to portray with 5g is capable of there
was an antenna for 5g in Hall 2 and they
showcased an MLB game where you had
various choices of how you wanted to
watch the game in real time you can
either choose to let the producer select
the cameras for you or you could choose
which camera you wanted to stick to but
the cool part is that given the amount
of bandwidth that 5g provides you could
rotate the camera around the player or
the position in real time see this is
really cool it goes beyond just being
able to watch your game live and instead
have an added value to the experience
that's only capable of you have the
added bandwidth which is only possible
with 5g overall I think that my two
biggest concerns with 5g were truly
addressed with this demo I was worried
that phones would get larger and bulkier
but Samsung has managed to bring some
really sexy Hardware here given the
bezel reduction it actually feels like a
Galaxy Note 9 and then my second concern
was if 5g only brought you more speeds
and that was it it turns out that no you
don't just get more speed and less
latency but you're also getting
augmented experiences that current
technology doesn't provide sadly I can't
tell you if it's worth it to wait for
the 5g variant or not I wish we had a
price tag to make decision-making easier
I will tell you two things though the
first is that my experience with the
galaxy s 10 plus so far has been great
expect our full review coming out very
soon and the other thing is that I
really have loved my experience with
that 5g demo so I think about the beauty
of the hardware matched with the
potential of the connectivity and yeah
it might also be great to win it out for
the 5g variant and to add to the cool of
your new
cs10 let's server today sponsored dbrand
