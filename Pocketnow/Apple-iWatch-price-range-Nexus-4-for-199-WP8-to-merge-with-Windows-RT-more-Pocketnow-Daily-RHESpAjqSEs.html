google nexus 4 now is the time to buy
apples i watch continues keeping
everybody's radar busy and rumors have
Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT merging
someday I'm hi Mary vera and I don't
know if it's worse to watch your team
play a game and not when our to watch 90
minutes of nobody scoring this is pocket
now daily let's stay off with the odd
news everybody remembers those sony
camera lenses that are supposed to work
attached to the sony xperia smartphone
lineup you remember those well we've got
some link price tags and well we're
talking about two hundred thirty dollars
for one and five hundred dollars for the
other pretty much buying another
smartphone here these lenses are
probably going to be available at Aoife
and we just hope that people are still
going to care at this price range and
speedy aviva in berlin another phone
that's being expected to be launched at
this event as the HTC one match which is
a blown-up ballad version of the HTC one
we've got some leaked photographs of a
removable back plate and nice a
removable back plate because the battery
is not removable and interesting there's
this whole at the fact that hence to a
fingerprint scanner which we will
probably see next week and aside from
that we've also got HTC being ruined to
be working on their own smartphone
platform let's just see how that goes
and speaking of smartphone platforms we
had heard the rumors of Microsoft
killing Windows RT but as it turns out
new reports have it that the company is
actually merging both just like you can
on iOS and Android for both tablets and
phones you have the same operating
system that shares pretty much the same
applications across there's actually a
cool idea and it actually hints to even
more probabilities of note gift tablets
and let's just hope they hurry with that
if they actually want to save the
platform now let's talk about Apple is
we've got some more ports of the I watch
it continues with a possible release
date of 2014 but this time we do have a
price range apparently it will cost two
hundred dollars or so somewhere around
there which actually makes the whole
concept compelling of Apple could
actually figure out why we need a
SmartWatch and that's not necessarily
just another smartphone companion and
aside from that Apple is apparently also
being rumored to launch tablets on
September 10th where they also plan to
launch iPhones if that holds have
tempered sent the event actually
even happens and finally for the hot
news of the day those of you interested
in the nexus 7 in europe well the device
is already retailing so get it while
it's hot but even hotter the Nexus phone
just saw this huge price drop it now
costs just two hundred dollars after
nothing this phone is off contract two
hundred dollars for the aching model 250
for the 16 gig model and it just makes
this price tag pretty much unbeatable so
that makes use of the question of the
day would this make the nexus for
compelling I mean you do know that this
phone is going to be revamped within the
next couple of weeks probably a month or
so but still I mean two hundred dollars
in my particular case honestly even if i
don't need the nexus 4 even if i want to
wait for the future nexus 4 and two
hundred dollars for that phone is just
crazy so leave us a comment down below
