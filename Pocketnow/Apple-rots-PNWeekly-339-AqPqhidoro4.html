welcome to episode 339 of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers recorded on this Friday
the 4th of January 2019 Happy New Year
everybody this is the show this is the
show you turn to for all that you need
to know about the technology that makes
us go from folding 5g phones to the
gizmos you couldn't even dream up as a
kid aids Georgia Vergara what's going on
everybody I'm of course your host of the
pocket now weekly and I'm joined by some
special guests this week for our first
show of 2019 first off the person right
to my side and the reason why we have
this particular set up so we can have
both of us on camera this is ESO
Rodriguez editor over at gadget match
and her gadget match yeah all right um
now we do think that Jaime is going to
join at some point he's now on the west
coast so he's more on my end of this of
the country at the moment but we don't
know really where he is at the moment
but I don't know but filling in as well
is he's coming in from the cold is the
tech young gun slinger Mario said a
photo hello everybody it's good to have
you back yeah always a pleasure
all right um what are you healing from
by the way I always forget where you're
podcasting from Minnesota
so those are the cold there's it's
colder than here
yeah oh I'm dying now yeah yeah well it
fluctuates you know not right now it's a
little bit nicer I can actually go
outside and not not loose my hands if I
don't wear gloves but uh so what what
would that be in Fahrenheit because
yesterday was 50 or 40 by you yeah I was
45 degrees Fahrenheit last night you
know i-i've been here for like three and
a half years and I still can't do
Fahrenheit so I couldn't tell you I
could tell you it's like minus 500 just
oh yeah oh just a like a flake then I
drop dead yes Julie says that's about 18
to 20 degrees yeah yeah Fahrenheit yeah
all right but I speaking of which jewels
of course as in the booth and he'll be
taking a look at the chat so make sure
you let us know what you want
here on this podcast also don't forget
that on Twitter you can let us know what
you want to hear about using the hashtag
was it P and weekly alright I'm gonna
start sweeping alright so let's go ahead
and jump into our stories for this week
now this first story that we're going to
talk about it seems like everybody and
their mother was talking about the
earnings report from Apple
so Tim Cook himself wrote a letter to
investors just sort of trying to give
some reasons as to why the forecasted
revenue for Apple in q1 of 2019 was
going to be lower than what was
projected and there are a lot of
different reasons for this I understand
that everybody might be thinking about
not only the product releases maybe
product cycles maybe even the iPhone is
not quite as popular as people thought
it was anymore it's declining in
popularity absolutely not Asia it's not
oh really
yeah so after the low E well I was
thinking I thought you were talking from
personal experience coming from I did
switch to Android which is something I
never thought I would do so all right so
like to be fair there are a few things
that we should cover um there are not
only do you have the 10s the 10s max and
then the 10 R so you do have a slight
dilution of just the iPhone brand itself
you also have a number of other products
that came out you have the Apple watch
series for the new iPad the iPad pro
even a new MacBook Air that's true so
even though you have a lot of different
products coming out but still have a
lower revenue than was projected is this
this is spell bad news for Apple what do
you think Mario well I mean I think us
expected and you know if you consider
the launch of the iPhone and nearly
coincided with the 2008 crisis and ever
since we have this kind of macro
economic expansion every other phone
company has seen a decline bigger the
Kleins in this like ultimately it's like
oh I think it and there being five
percent effective loss and it's yeah
it's the first decline but it's not like
yeah I think it was kind of something
that that was old that should have been
expected at some point again you can't
keep that sustain growth forever that
says
you know Tim Cook did list a bunch of
different key items so we could go over
some of them are interesting some of
them are expected some are you know
related to the us-china trade war and
sanctions and also like the cycle that
holly was about that the iPhones were
released after the summer instead of a
little bit later in the year like the
summer release cycle kind of kind of cut
into the key our really sad which is an
interesting way of putting it and also
like we've already made very clear in
the last two episodes of the weekly we
are not equipped to talk about political
stuff but there was also another reason
and joel's just write it up
also iPhone battery replacements what I
feel like this was one of the most
talked about points on Twitter from
anybody any tech pundants any youtubers
and new tech journalists we're talking
about how like the battery replacements
third party battery replacements are
really cheap so people are just able to
replace the batteries and move forward
with them but it probably wasn't the
biggest killer as Jules is saying here
of iPhone sales or just Apple revenue in
general but the fact that it was brought
up is kind of interesting especially
from a company that tried to throttle
battery usage
all right update at some point yeah yeah
well do you see a lot of iPhone tens and
10s is like kind of around where you are
cuz I want to focus on this generation
because this is definitely where that
they hit seems to be I think at least in
Asia and the Philippines are a lot of
people who use iPhones but you can see
the difference now as opposed to before
where it becomes an aspirational device
people are leaning towards especially
from where I am from all the OPOs and
the vivos and the Huawei's everyone's
wall-e has been killing it and because
if they are coming up with phones that
cater to what people want which is
mostly a good camera on a phone like
they've been doing very well so I've
actually seen people who are users like
me who are more into the lifestyle space
who used to work on iPhones but they've
been switching to always they've been
some people even switch to is Samsung so
it's I think there's a definite
although I don't think it's as that's
drastic as what you see in China where
like companies are actually giving what
discounts to people who would buy Huawei
phones and throw away their iPhone so
it's crazy I mean even in Japan Japan
has a really specific phone culture
Japan Japanese people have iPhones on
them but I think it was last year when
Oppo finally entered their market so you
see the change it's definitely not as
strong as before Apple has been slowly
losing their target market how about
over in Minnesota
you know you do see a lot of iPhones
here I guess it's just mostly like in
the United States like especially the
area where I live which is kind of like
app town and then I spend a lot of time
at the college campus so you see a bunch
of iPhones right that said I don't see a
bunch of the golden iPhone so that's
actually kind of nice but you have like
that little distinction I'm the only one
who has the tennis maxing gold yeah yeah
I haven't even seen it's not even a
proper gold yeah I still kind of cringe
every time I look right I'm still on the
fence about it personally well but the
fact that I don't see the brown phone
it's called brown because Brown it's not
gold yeah yeah if anything the fact that
I don't see it kind of tells me well I
don't see that many people are leasing
kind of like my it's certainly my
friends circle like I've got 11 to
friends but two friends bought the
bought an iPhone this year but they just
went for the regular ex just because
they could find it cheaper and I guess I
mean they didn't need all this stuff and
like personally like even in my case
I've been a tech fiend for so long but I
personally feel like I don't need to
upgrade at all this year with my note 9
and 60 one of our one of our chat people
saying that
Robin is saying in the chat phones are
too expensive people just want to
replace the batteries to not have to buy
the pricey phones like it's weird how
we're in this place right now and this
is the last point I want to make before
we move on
next it's another Apple story so we can
still stick with Apple the the whole
idea that Tech is no longer long-lasting
like it can be because the
specifications for performance can last
for the next two to four years but the
actual hardware itself is actually made
in such a way that you have to replace
it but I just thought of something do
you think that the iPhone what was that
that ten are contributed to like lower
sales because instead of buying the more
expensive one this is we review the 10r
and I'm like I'm totally sold on it
unlike before when I'm like I'm gonna
get the best Apple iPhone now it's like
this phone is actually a good phone it
works and it costs $500 or something to
that effect
but okay I would agree with you there if
they didn't also have so many other
products that should have made up the
gap right right and and hi Mei who again
I mean I I wish she was in right now but
he would say he's such an advocate for
the iPad pro but it looks like not so
many people bought it so also because an
iPad pro costs more than an actual
laptop yeah yeah well speaking of
products that Apple should be releasing
but for whatever reason have not you
were talking about lifestyle well one of
the most popular Apple products of the
last couple of years is a lifestyle
product and is the airport's yeah so one
of the accessories that was supposed to
come out not just for the air pods but
for the Apple watch and also for the
iPhone itself that has wireless charging
is an air power mat and we heard about
this like way long ago there's still no
word not happen it's not happening like
it's it's so weird like they're just
they're also way back in September of
2017 that was was when this like story
first broke and since then no word
whatsoever like what is happening don't
like third party manufacturers already
have stuff like this I mean if it's I
mean if it's Qi wireless yeah like I
could charge the iPhone Sena smacks on
the pixel standard yeah exactly
but this supposed to be a this was
supposed to be a first party right
accessory that you could lay every
product you have including a wireless
charging and the
old earpods case that was the other
thing yeah
air power for the air pods you do use
what I was charging a lot all the time
yeah in fact like the one I'm not an
Apple user right but the white the one
way in which this frustrates me and I'm
kind of like borrowing a Brandon's
philosophy here he always says you know
whatever Apple does everyone else
follows which is true I would I would
love it if this came out because I want
more attention put into wireless
charging like it has stagnated for so
long
most manufacturers that included include
really slow solutions or package really
slow solutions even Samsung's fast
charging fast wireless charging standard
which only delivers 7.5 watts and it's
still very slow and it really heats up
like it doesn't surprise me this is not
out because it's not it's not easy to
write to get this to work in a way that
doesn't degrade the battery because of
all the heat that the energy transfer
produces like this phone every time I
put in the wireless charger it really
really heats up now I don't mind because
I'm in Minnesota if I want to pick up my
phone and like I want to use it on the
way to the store or something that's
great because it's warm and you know
it's my own hand warmer but it's not
that great during the summer that said
it's still very slow steel frontals I
would like it if more attention came to
this space so I could see more Wireless
charters more phones with wireless
charging it's kind of disappointing that
Apple's not actually following through
with this because yeah if they would
have released it already then by
next-generation we would see all the
other manufacturers come up with their
own super wireless chargers well there's
some there are a couple of good
questions on this topic in that you're
right Apple maybe they're not quite the
innovator that they used to be because
they're coming in to wireless charging
one wireless charging was already a
thing friends who used to be the kind
that would be able to like dress up a
feature to make it seem like they were
the first ones and that's really not the
case here I feel like they could have
done it if they just would if they would
just make the wireless charging case for
the air pods mm-hmm because in terms of
truly wireless earbuds that is still
largely oh yeah I'm actually really like
the air pods which I
kind of hate saying they are actually
quite good like you are really good and
you talking about how it loo your mind
yeah it was pretty dope but also are
they are the this whole idea that they
might actually be having engineering
problems also like it's is is all of
this really tearing into their as you
say the reputation that they had yeah
definitely hmm I mean my dad was a
hardcore Apple fan he would stay up and
watch the keynotes just because what
also you're using a yes but also because
my dad was such a hardcore Apple fan he
migrated the whole family into Mac's
like at some point he was just like
nothing else will work better than this
you have that you man one of your cars
has those stickers okay so our German
Shepherd is named Mac oh but because I
never seen level yeah but even these
days he's like he I think he they saw
the keynote for the was it the pen yeah
after that he was just like yeah I was
underwhelmed they're not the same Apple
anymore I don't feel like it's worth it
to get a new phone he has been on the
8ec he's using by phony and he just
doesn't feel the need to switch he
doesn't feel like it's worth his money I
think is the main right um kind of a hot
take from our chat here Apple will be
from Louis Louise Louise Louis Apple
will be walking in the same footsteps of
Nokia or Blackberry sooner or later I
got here I'm if they're not careful yes
you're absolutely right but I'm gonna
adventure to say if it's gonna happen
it's gonna be way later than you think
this kind of stuff the the revenue stuff
this kind of a lack of innovation in
their products it doesn't hurt companies
quite as hard as you think it's a slow
burn Exhibit A HTC yes yes yeah
everything is Jules is saying mom didn't
fall in a day absolutely speaking of
which Jules also brought up a different
rumor here that speaking of wireless
charging apparently show me who were
probably talked about a little bit later
or they seem to be working on 50 watt
wireless charging you were saying how
your phone gets really warm Mario isn't
that concerned yes I mean like like just
to give listeners an idea the fast
charging stand that Wireless frustrated
stand of same some producers he has its
own fan and the fan is often louder than
my computer fan like that that's how how
intense he can get sometimes like I'm
not saying like when I'm fooling like
gaming or something but but still and
I'm like doing like a duel or even
triple monitor setup browsing the
internet and doing a few spreadsheets
and stuff the freaking phone fan but not
phone fan but the charging phone
whatever it's louder than our computer
yeah Wow pretty crazy it's in the phone
still super warm you know it's still
charged it's really slowly so I'm not
sure you know whether they're gonna be
able to balance that I mean I always
find wireless charging to just be the
thing that's like I'm not doing anything
else right exactly
take a shower but see this is why I sign
you the other day about how I hate that
portable wireless chargers oh yeah they
don't make sense if you're walking
around and you can never put them on
properly oh so you're saying that your
wireless charger heats up that much and
you're in Minnesota what if you're like
Asia
no no I like a tropical country you that
that's that that's gonna die yeah yeah
final final thought from one of our chat
peeps Richard I personally think that
wireless charging is overrated a great
idea but I don't think we're fully there
yet a hundred percent I think that
there's there's a certain company
comfort there's a certain convenience to
wireless charging but your lifestyle has
to fit it rather than the other way
around which is our point and can I
think that what you just said honestly
I'm not into the whole wireless charging
thing because I like being on my phone a
lot if I if I put it on the stand it
annoys me because that means I'm just
I'm like on my desk typing well it's
propped up so half of the time I really
still plug my phone in yeah yeah alright
so we were talking about Xiaomi for a
minute there here comes the big story
we don't know if this is confirmed or
whatnot but there are some clues
apparently Xiaomi according to good old
Evie leaks Evan Blass was he put out a
video on Twitter that was showing a four
by three display tablet
essentially a tablet where the two sides
like an envelope would fold in and it
becomes an 18 by 9 16 by 9 ratio phone I
honestly want this to be true that looks
awesome it looks cool yeah is this for
like like how come no one's thought
about this method of folding a phone I
mean why did they have like notches
you'd you'd think that in technology
everyone's gonna be like smart and
innovative and yet like most phones have
notches and now they're coming up with
hold phones like why there are a couple
of clues in this video that point to
Xiaomi not only the fact that it like
everything on the phone was Chinese but
also there was the me store spotted on
one of the home screens how do you feel
about uh how do you feel about this this
concept Mario I think it's actually
really interesting I'm actually very
excited because I know that other
companies are working on it so obviously
Samsung's working on it Microsoft is
student rumored to have been working on
a surface phone forever now they
actually confirmed that they're working
on prototypes from whatever I think it's
really interesting and there's like a
lot of things that you can do with this
kind of design for instance the first
thing I thought when the screen was
folded it's like you could have it so
that you know it's like effectively you
also have a screen on the back so it's
like when you fold it it's like screen
off front and screen on the back kind of
like that that phone that came out
recently that I like screen on the back
and be like yeah yeah so that's pretty
cool because like it's not like um I
mean it's kind of like that um the axe
one phone the axe on em get you screamed
like that's like it's kind of an Oscar
not really right but but I like that
idea as well so you also get the utility
of having to displace when you fold it
up they'll be nice and then
again you can like turn into what that
way I mean I'm concerned as to like
obviously they're they must have thought
of this and like engineered in such a
way that this doesn't happen but like
you know when you fold it so much what
happens to like the hinge the portion of
the display and and so on and so forth
whole lot right I have to admit that
fold just seemed too good to be true
right yeah it was so like the way you
were talking about wallpaper TVs right
and it's kind of like that like you
rolled but yeah also that concept also
kind of pisses me off because yeah it's
great to have a TV or a display that's
that thin but then it's connected to
this big old box that still has to do
all the process right so all phones go
that way at some point like just got to
put like a modular thing on the bottom
to make it work I want to point out too
though that this is a shot in a very
dimly lit place well so was also was the
Samsung yeah yeah and we have so that
I'm just trying to say that there could
be like details that we don't see from
this video I don't feel like if we do
this in real life it's not gonna be that
seamless I guarantee you there's a brick
on the back and when you fold it is like
it when they fold it flushes with the
brick on the back but otherwise it's
comes out and it looks like this fat T
we folded phones in a lonely place
that's what it seems like he's like dim
the lights I don't want anyone to see
exactly how this works yeah yeah which
is fine but like the moment that phone
comes out it's gonna be like the notch
it's gonna be it's gonna be once the
notch came out every other manufacturer
was like we got to figure out how to
reverse engineer this and that yeah like
figure out how did how to change it out
this is like the second one right ever
what first was the Samsung foldable one
well LG was talking about folio displays
for a while he was that famous thing
where yeah it was like neither were they
were like they were just like bending it
it wasn't really folding but it was it
was like yeah and then they put the
technology to their TVs yeah
well you know we're talking about about
that at the time I remember the rumors
were like guys is it gonna happen and I
just released the G flex which was like
really not know what we expected no we
wanted
I will admit though I kind of I kind of
missed that before we move on this kind
of fold or the half and half this kind
of fold definitely yeah it looks cool
and I don't know I feel like it'll work
better than the half enough
okay okay great yeah I think this looks
better it's more interesting and if
anyone if anyone can at least attempt it
it'll be Xiaomi I mean they helped bring
back the slider phone for like a minute
so one other thing is you get if you
want like technically wouldn't you be
able to just fold one of the sides and
not get like the full screen but still
get a bigger screen yeah well I mean
it's still gonna be an Android phone so
it may not be seamless to it yeah but
anyway um okay so we're gonna go ahead
and talk about the Moto Z for play so
some renders have come out basically
anything that that points to the Moto Z
for still having a lot of the same
tropes that we would expect from a XIII
or any of the phones we have up until
now
also the play version of the Moto Z line
happens generally has a lower spec
processor generally the 600 series of
Snapdragon which probably points to this
phone not being at all 5g compatible so
it's probably not going to be that type
of phone however it does come with a
tear drop notch it comes with the same
moto mod pins on the back it also has
way that a single camera so no dual
cameras or triple cameras in this case
but yeah the return of the Moto Z line
the z4 plain particular I think the last
one I might still have it actually the
last thing the last one we looked at was
the Z it was a z4 so the z4 play is just
sort of like a more affordable one mid
tier device all right can we look
forward to more from this from from moto
in 2019 like I know that they were
pushing for 5g a lot and 2019 is gonna
be all about five Jeep
in terms of just devices like do you get
excited by moto devices you know the
first time I saw I learned of what do
you call this the mods I'm so excited
but then it's like I really still don't
know how to feel about them it's like
they haven't if they're gonna click they
should have clicked mmm but it still
hasn't clicked to me I guess
and it's like wow that's cool you put
something on blah blah blah blah and
they're still doing it
and it still hasn't clicked as much I
guess yeah I'm a little warm up it's
also kind of cut at the knees right
because it's always a Verizon phone like
you can't really get into many people's
hands when it's only on one carrier like
this yeah it's a great advise and you
know they do some great stuff I'm not
trying to throw shade or anything but
yeah moto Z's generally are all found on
one carrier mmm the z4 play as Jules is
saying here has a wider distribution so
it's a little bit better but you're not
getting the absolute best version of the
Z any thoughts Mario yeah I mean it's
it's still surprising that they're
sticking with moths so I mean when when
they first announced the original motive
see they they said that they would
support it for free generations back
then I was like really I mean this
probably sounds like something I'll be
writing about in two years how this was
a broken promise but no they did and now
they're taking it to a fourth generation
and it doesn't seem to stop but I agree
that it even though they keep pushing it
hasn't like really found its its spot it
just doesn't it hasn't clicked indeed it
hasn't clicked like the moths themselves
a lot of them offer functionality that I
would much prefer if you bake that
functionality into the phone some
capacity like if there's a speaker in
there right exactly it would give me a
better camera on the phone itself yeah
so it obviously something like a
projector well that's a different use
case but like bad are you just give me a
better give me a bigger battery a better
battery life and so on it's interesting
I've just never been too excited in fact
like at this point I'm I'm almost
wanting them to move away from this and
go back to okay just make a a
traditional phone with a traditional
design because also you know keep in
mind that there's only so much they can
do
while conforming to that standard right
conforming to it has to have the back
has to have have to have this dimensions
and the pogo pins need to be here and
that limits the internal distribution of
components in the arrangement I just
want I just want motor to move on at
this point like again it's not gonna be
well I guess they knew they might be 5g
compatible because they're releasing
these ridiculous motive motive mods I
have a little chip and it just like a
whole chipset in it for the 5g
functionality which is ridiculous um
Jules is over here saying this is just
stalling because I remember when the I
remember when the 5g mod was announced
when Moto announced it with Verizon
there was talk of this being the last
generation of moto mods and then they go
ahead and double down on it by making a
5g mod and she's like what he said it's
it's sort of stumps it and makes it look
like a certain way and that's the time
when you have creation for I'm gonna go
all out with the colors and everything
yeah you know this I love cute looking
phones like no matter what you say I
will go for the colorful ones I will go
for the gradient once and I this just
looks very you know what utilitarian
yeah exactly
I'm gonna look at this phone and I'm not
gonna care because it's like it looks
like it's 2019 they should do something
about the gods I don't know maybe a
cover a case that that might help but
yeah they put a little piece of plastic
on them yeah so they have all these
phones with oh sorry all these phones
with beautiful colors gradient designs
you have leatherback special edition
phones you have all these fancy things
and you give me this phone we'll just
have the same specs like was pointed out
like it's a it's basically a vanilla
phone yeah and then you have to spend
more for stuff that you'd expect other
phones to do by themselves and it
doesn't look as well so it's well and
this is coming from Motorola which they
had modem they had moto maker like he
had the cutest phones you know
like you could make it you can make it
your own you can make it as cute as you
wanted you can have the bamboo backs
that let the letter backs like them they
were innovating on the design front like
really innovating at you absolutely
absolutely
they need a mod they're gonna make a mod
that you can customize on moto maker
[Laughter]
alright so speaking of companies that
you may or may not be hearing too much
compared to of course the incumbents the
the mega companies as they may be called
we have Nokia and Nokia has been making
a bit of a splash of the last year and a
half with some good releases there are
some people who are very much in love
with the Moto the Nokia 701 yeah
everyone really loved that phone and now
they might be they might be going all-in
with the Nokia n9 mm-hm
so there's a lot of rumors coming out
about the Nokia 9p review and okay yes
there's going to be a lot of different
specifications are gonna be rolling
around but the one everyone's talking
about is this five lens camera we talked
about this it looked like a Photoshop
thing when we first talked about this
but it keeps coming back what do you
call that um some people don't like
looking at like stuff with holes in it
it's some kind of phobia yeah but I
thought this was a joke effort as a
makeshift tripod chuckle Toby had yeah
of course Jill's new right but I mean at
the time where so we went to a lantern
festival last night type of low light
photos with a pixel three and people
were commenting on my tweet saying like
wow they're that these photos were taken
with a one camera set up and at a time
when this is doable
I don't think five we need five cameras
what would those cameras be I don't
think anybody even knows exactly what my
super wide one for a portrait
I don't know all of them all of you have
types in there but you know what I find
really interesting about this is that
okay we'll talk about the true
I almost said triple camera will talk
about the Penta camera in a second good
throw an infrared camera like that oh
yeah oh there you go yeah it's January
not October what I do like about this
though is that one thing that I've
always enjoyed about Android is that you
can get really good specifications
without having to fuss too much what
matters is what brand you like the most
yeah so you can be like oh yeah I'm down
with Samsung I'm down with og I'm down
with all this now you have snapdragon a
45 6 gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of
storage a 2k display peer review the
pure display do you get all of that and
now there's no keel on the side and I'm
like that I like that exact yeah and not
just that but enjoyed one that's
probably like the thing I like most
about Nokia phones now um as for like
the camera bit you know I mean swarf
reminding listeners so this is not the
Lumia Nokia right like this is a HMD
like if you think back the they had it
was it Lumia 1020 right they had like
the crazy camera that we can even like
go back to that and say yes they have a
proven reputation of camera that they
can in fact make a good camera phone
because this is not the same company so
it's just the same brand specifically
the same name so that's the thing like
can we really expect a lot out of this
now if Hyman was here you'd probably be
like you know my may 20 Pro has four
cameras and that's great and that's true
like if you have a company like Huawei
working with a company like lekha
they can make a really good camera phone
well these guys got Zeiss clubs yeah
yeah that's true so I'm you know you're
right it knows because like I just find
it so funny that like that that's what
the back might look like let's take a
bow it looks like I mean I guess movie
Thor it's how stuff looks if you if you
bust it out everyone's gonna be like wow
yes 5k yeah that looks like a robot yeah
you get that wow factor yeah that's the
set itself looks good otherwise so like
it looks fine it looks looks very 2018
which I'm not sure if it's the best
thing to look like in 2019 would an 8:45
and all the other kind of vestiges but
there are going to be there are going to
be some changes in hardware design in
2019 because we're trying to leave 2018
in the dust and that includes certain
things like notches so that is why
everyone is really looking forward to
what the Samsung Galaxy S 10 is going to
look like and that's where our next
story is about so that we potentially
may have the first live photo of what
this will look like and I know you have
a lot of thoughts about this but
essentially you know there are of course
going to be like case manufacturers and
screen protector manufacturers who
already have reference designs for what
the phone will look like so they can
have their products available for the
launch of the font so those are clues in
and of themselves but clearly from other
leakers like evan blast you have like a
photo like this that has okay I don't
know if it's mirrored but it looks like
it's on the right side of the phone the
the hole punch also clearly one camera
on the front so we're not gonna get any
dual cameras on the front so drill says
it looks like it's mirrored because I
think everyone is thinking it's gonna be
on the left but either way you got a
hole it's in the corner and it's that's
where the camera is and that's how you
get a full court full screen experience
without resorting to a notch I mean I'm
so mad
they can't even fix Instagram stories
with a knotch
mm-hmm now they're gonna put a hole in
it yeah I'm gonna smudge it up so much
because it's just like in the middle of
everything yeah this is the case I'd
rather have a bezel on top okay you
rather have bezels yeah not an arch but
bezel yeah oh my gosh I hate the not so
much whatever like if I had a notch I'd
turn it off okay mmm I don't see why we
can't be honest with ourselves
if if you stop making the knotch happen
it's never gonna happen
it's like it's just ugly it doesn't make
sense it's ugly and I don't see why it's
such a big problem to have either bezels
or like I do flip up so what do you call
that slide up yeah now though I I'm a
huge advocate of the slider returning
but I don't remember if it was you Mario
or somebody else when we were talking
about it that said the one problem with
the slider phone is that it kills IP
ratings yeah because there are bits that
can get yet yeah quite literally you're
making an opening into the phone yeah
how many hours in a day do I shower and
do I need to bring my phone in it as
opposed to how many hours in a day do I
stare at this ugly freak and not I am I
can't get over it
it's ma'am I'm never gonna I'm gonna
coop the Jules's joke here Lisa is
tearing this a new one then juices just
fill the phone with the epoxy that's a
terrible idea Jules oh my god Mario yeah
I mean my hope is because it seems I'm
doing it
but you mentioned an Instagram like
these companies cannot just ignore the
punch hole or whatever like they can't
ignore the knotch because this is gonna
be the biggest phone of 2019 so they can
just like be caught and say oh well our
app doesn't properly work with this
right okay I'm sure same sex probably
like working with them behind the scenes
to pre update their apps so that this
doesn't happen that would be what I
would hope would happen right
this particular pictured looks bad
but but if the picture itself looks
about it doesn't mean that the phone
looks bad it she's like the pictures
crap like oh wait it's a leak I'm like
yeah right it's look like it is like one
of the bad leaks right cuz it's it's
it's got a K's on it that the wallpaper
the wallpaper sucks which is actually
that's right like if you think about
like these companies like they mark they
they price spent a lot of time thinking
what wallpaper do we want with our phone
we want
this phone has to have the right
wallpaper and we're gonna use it on our
marketing material for a whole year it's
got it's gotta look good they have this
ugly wallpaper and then everything is
everything else blurred they blurt
everything like even the stuff that
would possibly never lead to a an ID
right like if you have the gallery on
your phone you don't have to blur that
every phone has the gallery on the home
screen right so I kind of bothers me I
can't I can't tell like I can't tell
anything about the design the aesthetics
of the actual phone and the only thing I
can kind of miss your it's okay there's
this much diameter for the hole that's
it that's all I get is a it looks like
also the thing that's really I'm getting
kind of triggered by right now look at
the bottom of this leak it's full screen
gestures and I'm shy
like I'm I get it I can get used to full
screen gestures I know that this is our
future but I'm never gonna be happy at
first I'll get used to it
I'm never going to like seeing it on the
outset because there are these three
lines on the bottom that yeah literally
for like swipe up from this swipe up on
the right to do this swipe away I left
to do this are you're probably gonna
mess it up when you're swiping up you
put a hold because you don't want a
forehead and yet there's a there's still
a bottom bezel it's like what are you
going on here you're missing the whole
point
punching it within it so you don't have
bezels and then put a bottom bezel yeah
yeah whether or not this is the phone
it's probably the s10 we'll probably
have a hole they already released a 8
with a hole and it's like I guess I'm
just scared of 2008 P 2019 will be the
year of the holes as much as I don't
it's a hole haha okay you stop there but
as much as I hated the knotch
I feel like the hole would probably be
on the same level okay oh we got to go
to our next story but I will say the one
thing I wanted to say and I think I said
it one time before that a hole isn't the
perfect spot to cover up the back button
on some apps so yeah a little worried
about that all right so we we are
unfortunately in a bit
bind right now as far as the country is
concerned the the government has been
shut down for the past 11 days and one
particular branch that needs to be open
for products to make it into the US is
also closed for because of that the FCC
okay so in particular the offices of
engineering and technology so apparently
is it 14 days Jules my bet I don't know
I'm bad a pulpit 14 from today okay so
oh that's right I was reading from the
article this is a this is from a few
days ago okay um okay so the FCC itself
is set to shut down which means that all
the approvals that have to be done for
products actually make it through the
FCC and then become manufactured and
then come into the u.s. that branch is
not gonna be operating we don't know how
long that's going to take I mean again I
don't want to get into why the
government showed that right now because
it hangers me but but the the fact of
the matter is that there might be delays
and one of the big delays might be the
phone that we were just talking about
because it's gonna be one of the first
phones that's supposed to come out of
the u.s. yeah what I don't know what we
can even say about this other than this
sucks like yeah this is kind of bad
right first it sucks I mean that's the
first far right like I don't know like
like I mean obviously we can't really
tell at this point whether this will
impact like we also don't know how like
how extensive of a procedure like the
approval is like it just might be the
case that if it's just like yeah we're
gonna stamp this report that some third
party did and that's it like I don't
know really how but but if it is
extended for I don't think it would be
extended for another month certainly but
how I expect this to be resolved now
that there's been you know a bit of
change in Congress so we'll see we'll
see what happens
don't know I know you're not it's just I
guess it's just sucky for you yes yes
she's not a u.s. person the variety of
phones that we have
it's crazy yeah like at this point I
can't even count with my fingers how
many phones that we have make aside from
the Samsungs and the apples and the
whatnot we have the vivos and the oboz
and all these other like we have local
phones we have other Asian phones like
you just cannot imagine the variety and
you're not getting any of those Chinese
phones and no you're not gonna get this
awesome for any other new phone for that
matter and I'd like again that sucks for
you yeah
that's all I can really say well I mean
okay so maybe this will be one of those
weird opportunities for us to be like
you know you're not gonna get the new
phones for a bit until we resolve what's
going on so maybe you can just learn to
appreciate the one you got yeah yeah
hashtag mindful you know but yeah and
it's funny how we're having this problem
and we're going to see yes like tomorrow
is when things are meant to be well yeah
when things are meant to be announced
and potentially released in the US and
they may not even be able to be released
I guess welcome to my world because from
my side of the world
everything gets announced in the West
and then you wait for it to trickle down
right if you're lucky if it happens
after a few months you're not if it's
like half a year or a year they have to
wait in Argentina was the same like us
always like the new Galaxy would you
know like the Galaxy S would come by the
time the Galaxy Note is already it's
just gonna be a simultaneous release
alright so moving on to our next story
now this is one that I will admit I
don't know to I I know the name I don't
know too much like Mario D are you more
familiar with projects solely I kind of
I mean I've read about it it's just like
it's been like on some kind of
backburner I guess now we know why maybe
it's interesting so you don't haven't
heard about it it basically uses waves
to detect your
is it's just the electromagnetic
spectrum to attack your actual hand
motions some distance away from the
receiver and then it parses that into
some kind of gesture and that way you
can control a user interface kind of
remotely we're not actually mmm-hmm
sorry
interacting with the glass or some dial
or whatever and it's cool like it can be
used for like smartwatches it could be
used for home appliances I don't think
it would be used for smartphones because
I study holding the thing yeah the last
time we did an experiment and the tech
industry did I should say the last time
an experiment with no touch gestures was
yeah this is the Galaxy s4
oh my god yeah a little sensor on the
front we can be on scrolling do you
remember the ads for that like the x-ray
they had like the pool party and just
like nobody's ever gonna do this yeah
nobody's gonna use the release the
actual unpacked it was I think it was
their first ever unpacked like they
actually called it unpacked it was in
Radio City Music Hall it was a Broadway
musical and it was yeah let's just say
it wouldn't really fly and we already
very political climate I get that it's
not something that feels like it's
useful I definitely feel that it's not a
key feature but honestly I could see
myself using it like okay okay and I
don't think but if I were to learn how
to bake and make a mess in the process
I'd be like oh what the
but again that's what this my displays
are for for kitchen stuff it's perfect
like if you your hands are messy you
know you've been I don't know needing
some doll or whatever but if there's
like a timer or something that you need
to like dial or anything it's cool
that's cool
there's no denying that there are
scenarios where it would make sense it's
just a way to presented it was just way
too tone-deaf and freed them to sell it
as the main point like it would be a
nice addition but like for it to be the
highlight I guess some people are
excited about this because it makes it
seem like we're gonna make it to that
Minority Report thank you
I almost said we're gonna make it that
Minority Report a thing and if it's not
a SmartWatch but the thing is gonna look
weird if it's not a spoiler so much it's
over here like no but it does look cool
the video I saw is basically someone
like snapping mmm I'm gonna make the if
it was controlling the was it was it a
watch or something
watch I could see you totally doing that
where there's a little your screen you
can touch to do something you're still
going like this with your hand above the
one yeah useless main takeaway from this
whole thing though is that I feel like
there's some technology going on in the
back end because Google and Facebook are
arguing over stuff that we don't even
understand like I was thinking when I
first read this and like what what does
Facebook have to do with frequencies
right sake
Google is where I add friends and post
photos why are they babbling with
frequencies frequencies and stuff but
they are and like the reason the whole
point of this whole program being able
they want to see you want to track your
hand that's not so far away the only
reason they proceeded was because there
was a compromise oh sure
so the whole thing here is they're going
they're going there yeah and you gotta
find every little Dino track it's a
little scary it's a lot scarier actually
you know it's like I would be fine make
I'd be like like by ghosts but we let
them track us so that we can have faster
YouTube and faster everything as AT&amp;amp;T is
trying to prove with their 5g speeds
it's that way but there's a butter
butters but are a kind of they're not
really there okay so we're looking at
these two these two screenshots here
from speed tests speed tests on that so
what we're looking at here is about 200
megabits down which is okay I still get
mad when I see upload speeds that are
wait but they're like 0.1% of the down
yes don't pisses me off but apparently
these speeds are not quite as fast as
all 5g is meant to project house 5g I'm
good this is a very specific question
what what does 5g look like at all in
like your part of the world oh yeah
probably in some parts of Asia sure when
the Philippines definitely not but you
have to realize that in the Philippines
it's a mirror of how a lot of markets
are yeah in that region of the world if
we're talking about Singapore for tiny
buck I don't know
I pay probably for talking about China
sure that's gonna be great but in a lot
of areas we're just one thing better
internet it doesn't even have to be
forged like a lot of the time 4G is a
problem wealthy is a problem yeah so at
this point in a lot of places in the
world no one's even one thing to get 5g
if they can't even get the four G's yeah
hierarchy of needs yeah I agree
yeah um someone in our chat be Floyd
says AT&amp;amp;T 5g speeds they just rebranded
4G LTE to 5ge
yeah can we all just keep saying this
five gen-5 yeah they actually they're
actually doing that which is crazy
Wow like they they're yeah and it I
don't know I mean it's it's fine it's
early gen whatever also just for
listeners the the numbers that Joshua
just recited were from obviously not a
phone because we now have like cheap
phones yet is from hotspot that AT&amp;amp;T is
selling and some user already posted it
right and uh and yeah the disparity was
like ten megabytes down and I faked the
upload looks like just like again like
this very small gap yeah yeah and the
latency was the same um yeah so I make
that plain all the time here like even
hi May whenever he's on back in Honduras
in South America like he's always saying
that his 4G his LTE speeds are much more
reliable than his Wi-Fi speeds we
don't have that here like you yeah you
got to basically be on Verizon to get
that kind of consistent LTE speed and
like I said that to like if we can't
perfect our own LTE why are we even
thinking about cuz 4G LTE is part of the
grander picture of 5g yeah so we're
already cutting ourselves off at the
knees by using something that's not
amazing and perfect to create this whole
new platform it's it's it's good but I
bet we're gonna be hearing a lot about
5g in 2019 obviously it's gonna be one
of the thick hot trends yeah the choice
and we're gonna be talking about that in
a little bit but that does it for our
first part of the show we're gonna go
ahead and take a little break all right
okay so quite on the set for this part I
have to read an ad that's why all right
the pocket not weekly is supported by
triple bytes the job board for coders no
matter where they come from
and really it shouldn't matter if you
got a degree from MIT or Princeton
software engineers come from all walks
of life and many of them didn't even
think it would be there jamm that girl
who runs a few too many homebrew servers
for obscure JRPGs she writes the guy who
got tapped by his boss to maintain
mobile apps for the business he writes
to but the problem is sometimes you
can't really put your experience into
our resume and expect big tech companies
to hire you fortunately a triple byte
you don't have to worry about that you
take a quiz you land a first interview
with one of the many well-known firms
like Apple like Dropbox on Adobe and
then go on to a second interview and
then boom you're in in fact
triple bite is so confident that you'll
get in that is offering a one thousand
dollar signing bonus for PocketNow
weekly listeners just head to triple
bite com / weekly that's triple B YT
e.com slash weekly thanks to triple buy
it for supporting engineers and
supporting the weekly all right we're
back in right before I got into the
break Jules was saying the word 5g will
be banned in 2020
and by then it'll be it'll be five GH ve
- age - finally so there's a there's a
thought that we wanted to do in the
interim between our two big segments
here we're gonna be talking about the
top trends that we may be into or very
much not into moving into 2019 but here
is a question that I wanted to pose to
everybody what is the phone the daily
driver or the phone of 2018 that you're
bringing into this new year like what is
what it would have what is the one that
you're relying upon us as that as the
clock turned let's start with Mario cuz
you're I can see the gears turning in
your head for me it's probably not nine
I mean it's like a tough big between the
60 and the not 9:00 for me the thing is
like the note 9 just like again while
it's charging
little small things like that it has
everything there right the 60 to me it's
like actually more enjoyable phone to
use surprisingly enough like if I want
to just like lay back and browse my
phone I'll just you see the 60 but if
I'm going outside or if I'm you know
driving up somewhere or going on a trip
going to some event or whatever I'd much
rather have the note 9 and you know it's
serviceable like I can't even see what I
mean I say this every year with the
notes I guess specifically the notes but
I can't see what Simpson would do that
would make me want to upgrade and to be
honest they don't do much I still
upgrade just because I like the phone so
much I should put like an extra pen and
then you have chopsticks I don't know
where that came from
it's just the moment are you hungry I I
might be the moment it got in my head
like I thought it I was like I have to
say this exactly IG IG v G of 5 I mean I
do love that s-pen though yeah yeah as
an influencer uh-huh yeah that's what I
wanted to say in my review of the note
night I wanted to say because I I came
up with the term this phone is for
social media junkies
I wanted to say I've had friends who are
non techies like these people have lived
on their iPhones swore by their iPhones
but they switch to the note 9 and they
love the selfie features of that S Pen
so what are you taking is that what
you're taking from 2018 into now yeah
wait you have way more phones to choose
from okay no so I'm just gonna be
truthful about this I I switch back and
forth between the pixel three not XL no
notches yes the XL is much it's crazy
stupid but that being said and this is a
surprising pic for me too and you see
news beyond this phone for so long it's
the Oppo find X Lambo hmmm Lambo though
only difference the only difference the
only difference is that like people are
going crazy over fast charge but I still
maintain that Opel has the best fast
charge technology it's literally zero to
a hundred percent in 35 minutes and this
is what I've been living on and for the
first time after having been an iPhone
user for years when I am so used to
freeing cables and carrying a power back
everywhere I went like I plug it in for
30 minutes
it's the 30 me taking a shower or
putting on my eyebrows and it's charged
so it's awesome and like honestly that
phone screen that is a real full screen
phone well you're well I don't know
where you put it but I have the me mix
three in the house so speaking of full
screen display like that's that's what
we're gonna be using I'm plan that's the
phone I'm bringing with me to CES I'm
trying to finish the one +60 review
right now just for me and there's
already one pocket now but I'm trying to
finish my review of it and I have to say
I adore what oneplus is done I adore it
it's great and I was I will admit that I
would I would first go for the McLaren
Edition than any other edition but you
kind of you you can't really go wrong if
you happen to be on t-mobile you're
gonna get a monthly plan a cheaper
then the 1 plus 60 is a really
compelling choice and that's what I love
the most about it we have a few people
in the chat here
Max is saying I want them mate 20x next
I know a lot of people oh we have that
the big one you have it yeah it's too
big I mean ok this is a thing with me
again I'm a very specific type of user
like I mean it's distich it's this big
my my hands can't even grasp that thing
so uh Abraham says s 9 plus until 2020
you certainly could as long as a battery
doesn't crap out on you yeah uh Henry
says any phone over 6 inches is too big
for me before I got my P 20 light it was
over 4 inches which was too big and then
Snead says I really like my moto x4 as
much as my pixel to XL I would maintain
that the pixel 2 XL is still a pretty
damn good phone you could still use that
now if you wanted in 2019
but speaking of 2019 let's talk about
some trends that are gonna be happening
we know we have a suite we do have some
glimpses into what's going to happen
we're gonna get even more starting as
soon as tomorrow when we go to see yes
Mario are you gonna be reppin at CES I
know I not this year I gotta go to
Florida kiss my mom at a house and she
really wants me to go check it out I
know yeah I am bracing myself for the
work for the next few days yeah it's
gonna be pretty nice TK will be out for
XDA though right yeah yeah yeah and I
think Michelle will be going too ok yeah
be sure I'll be going so yes probably
meet at some point all right cool so why
don't we start with you then since
you're not gonna be going to see yes
yeah what what trend do you think is
actually gonna turn out very well in
2019 and also we're gonna ask you what
you think will be the worst trend of
2019 ok we have a few examples in our
little worksheet here but like in
anything that you want to talk about
well I mean I guess not see us related
necessarily cuz it's probably gonna take
a while for this to trickle down I think
that I feel like camera pinhole will
turn out well but I don't think I would
like it per se I think that in the end I
Satan will probably do a really nice
presentation with galaxy yes 10 and I
think that reviewers are gonna like that
phone because they like D s phones in
general there
good phones so it's gonna get good
reviews the fact that it's gonna get
good reviews will probably make the
phone a success like a relative success
again because we see this market decline
but it is still we gonna be one of the
better Falls of 2019 as expected and
it's gonna carry that punch hole which
you know it's what it is it's it's it's
still one of the more interesting design
changes at same so we'll have done and
then other companies will follow suit
so other companies will follow suit and
they'll come with their own punch holes
they're gonna be smaller and they're you
some of them are gonna be at the middle
and at that point why don't you just
include a water drop knowledge but you
know we're gonna see that we're gonna
see that and I think that it'll get to a
point where it'll be everywhere and the
phones are again phones are gonna market
it they're gonna market it like a thing
just like you saw a bunch of volumes
actually market the notch which was
crazy you're gonna see owners market the
punch home which it's it's less crazy
there's a it's kind of like a thing it's
like more of an interesting design
feature and it's gonna be big doesn't
mean I would like it probably be buying
a phone with that what a punch hole just
because like we just said do I need to
upgrade no will I be the one reviewing
these phones for X date probably not I
don't even I wouldn't want to I just I'm
not interested in in it but it's gonna
be make whether I like it or not our
chats going nuts about the pin hole
right now oh boy okay so that would be
what you think is actually gonna work in
2019 what do you think is gonna flop
what do you think is gonna land right on
its pinhole face I mean I don't want to
say if I GE but I had to say five you
and I'm gonna there - yeah if we say
like million camera phones yeah whatever
like we've had this right like don't
yeah it's gonna nobody's gonna pay that
much attention to Nokia it would be more
interesting if she was something that
Samsung was doing and it failed and and
all the companies have already proved
that it can work like why wait so
foldables I don't you know maybe late
this year they'll be released
who knows but if I GE the phones with IG
are coming out soon and the service is
not going to be in my opinion what I
expect it's not gonna be noticeably
improved over 4G LTE certainly not the
kind of higher-end of LTE so that's
gonna have people wondering why why are
we doing this now and and that's the
thing it's gonna be a slow process we're
not gonna see the improvements right
away but what worries me is that we
might not see any improvements right
away any improvements at all like any
anything tangible that users can point
to and say my phone is doing 5g and it
benefits my user experience in such a
such way you're not gonna get that word
of mouth if there's no noticeable
improvement that people can point to and
as we said we saw already like the speed
difference doesn't seem to be there as
far as like the AT&amp;amp;T 5g hotspot in
particular goes if it's not there for
the snapdragon a 55 and the X 24 module
that the 30 X 50 yeah the X 50 modem
well yeah ah then we're gonna be in a
real trouble I think so that's why I
used to be a what do you think well
obviously I hate the whole bunch whole
idea that that's about making controls
happen they're never gonna happen I will
I will keep saying that until 2020 or
until I figure out a way Instagram
stories or something figures out the way
to fix it but I highly doubt it they
haven't fixed it on the knotch
they're probably gonna fix it they're
probably not gonna fix it so you think
pinhole is still gonna be a it's gonna
suck it's gonna suck but like every
single trend like the notch will end up
with pinhole yeah
phones which sucks I want the foldable
phones to happen okay so I don't think
they will okay
I don't think we're there hmm I hope we
get more say their phones yeah later
phones were cool when I was a kid slider
phones are still cool now
if the whole point is getting a
full-screen phone just do the slay there
guys gosh oh hey yeah IIIi think I last
week said I wanted to pour one out for
the slider phone this early because we
just got them back and now the pin hole
is appearing so sliders are gonna die
before they even have a chance to like
see it
slider phones are just fun yeah you know
it's it's the whole act of doing that
lady thing whether it be the mimics -
whether it be your vivo necks or your
opal find eggs it's always an amazing
experience and it's been a while since
just on a fundamental level hardware has
been this fun yes probably the only
phone that's done it is yours Mario the
no.9 like yeah actually have fun with
the s-pen you can use it in preamble
that's true that's actually very true
yeah like when you when you slide I
haven't done it yet because we were
still fresh what the me mix three but
when you slide it down you can get a new
could be a sound effect yeah yeah yeah
sore cheating and like yeah a little
nice effect yeah you know I walk around
so people like okay what's so funny
about Slater phones it's like you'd
think other people would know this but
they don't really like you can walk
around with a Slater phone
slide your phone all you want but the
person sitting next to you won't notice
unless they're staring yeah and I get
the same reaction over and over with a
fine X it's like I'm using it flipping
around playing with it and no one cares
until like I say something or they ask
me what phone I'm using they look at it
and actually see the the camera tomorrow
and that's when their minds are doing
yeah so it's it's a great thing because
it's a fun thing to use it's something
that isn't too flashy but there's still
that wow factor and there's no hole do
you prefer the the motorized version or
the that's the thing though people don't
really like the motorized version and I
get it like you've been telling me that
it's gonna die but we live at the time
when they after two years we switch
phones which is fine yeah so I mean
honestly I thought it would bother me
more but it doesn't after a while if
Noor
molasses and it's just fun the built-in
fidgeting that's a new feature actually
like Mikey Miami makes three hands-on
for vodka now started with me just
quickly yeah yeah in our chat max is
saying faster in display fingerprint
sensors I agree with that I would say we
should be seeing more of that if you ask
me though the trend that I think is
going to flop I think is gonna be 5g but
it's not gonna be like a dead flop it's
just gonna be it's not gonna be quite
where should be yeah no one's gonna
actually look at it and go 5g is here
let's all rejoice but no no one's gonna
be rejoicing because there's still an
LTE to that point it's just unlike
certain trends like let's say slider
phones or the pinhole camera which the
whole world more or less can experience
5g isn't something that will be
impactful it's you're gonna say there's
5g everyone's gonna say okay this or
that but certain parts of the world will
not even get to see that anytime soon
yeah so true I would have to say I think
the trends that I'm looking forward to
the most I think will actually truly
benefit people will be better wireless
audio I think that companies are going
to be diving in a little bit more
Qualcomm already announced their chip
that allows for independent streams to
truly wireless earbuds which is awesome
and that means connectivity way better
that means the audio will be better but
I also think that just in terms of
mobile audio what we're seeing right now
are phone manufacturers creating the
USBC earphones that and their phones
require because they're the ones who
took away the headphone jack in the
first place but I want to see actual
audio companies I want to see boast jump
in I want to see Sony's audio division
jump in I want to see audio technica I'm
using a pair right now I want to see all
of that all of those companies dive into
the world of mobile audio headfirst yeah
because then we're gonna get great
sounding audio whether it's wired or
Wireless I'm actually really looking
forward to whatever truly wireless
earbuds are coming out and see
I'm trying to get a beat on like who
who's gonna be doing in what new futures
are gonna come out because I love that
oh yeah I think on some level there's a
parallel universe where I am that guy
from her exactly exactly but
so speaking of specific users and
specific user basis what I love that
happened in 2018 was tech because we've
gotten to a certain point and think
we're like you more or less can do stuff
ready your mid-range phone can do what
more or less a tiny like part can the
the flagship phones can do yes like it's
basically there's a line we're all tech
is over does that make sense yeah yeah
so that being the case manufacturers are
able to cater phones to people who are
less techy like people like me my
portable especially yeah I think my
demographic had it good when it when it
came to tech the previous year because
again we soft phones that are marketed
to users like me like the s-pen for
example one main selling point was that
it can take selfies
mmm we have seen beauty modes going
crazy we've seen beautiful leather-bound
phones we've seen all these gradients
and the fact of the matter is this is a
demographic that has been left out a lot
and that just shows me that that is
taking it to a place which allows for
more inclusion more personality yeah
also which is what's been kind of
missing a little bit let me see here we
got a few we got a few things coming up
the concept of the slider is a Peter in
the chat the concept of the slider is
great but the BlackBerry Prive didn't
take off the way it could well I would
argue that the print I would argue that
the prayer was less a slider phone and
more a keyboard phone which is where it
faltered the most so they tried to they
tried to use the slider concept to
reveal the keyboard what we're talking
about here is a slider to reveal other
things a keyboard will never take off on
a smartphone now that's just that that's
just the truth so I think giving I think
giving the print a little bit more
credit than that would be and I let me
see here if black brain were to make
this again now with their newfound
experience yeah I mean I
that a new Prive we're due for one I
think it'd be great to see what they
have coming up next let me see
Craig had the slider phone from the
matrix it didn't last
oh and Nokia released the same phone
last year the banana phone they actually
did it that's okay I think yeah I think
that pretty much does it I mean if you
want to let us know what trends you're
into for 2019 what you think is gonna do
great what do you think is gonna flop
also let us know what phone you're
taking in to 2019 make sure you let us
