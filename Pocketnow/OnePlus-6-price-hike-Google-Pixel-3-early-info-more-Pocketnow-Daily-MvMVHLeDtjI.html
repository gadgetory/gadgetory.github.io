six and it seems to be getting scarier
we also seem to find code names for the
Google pixel three and honor is
launching another AI phone very soon I'm
high metal Iveta and whoa it's Friday
already
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals as you know
just coming back from China I realized
just how important WeChat pay is over
there and clearly Apple wants to do the
same thing with Apple pay the company is
now offering discounts in certain stores
you have the store list in the
description definitely it keeps growing
and subscribers and there's a reason for
it other interesting official news have
to do with honor as the company has just
announced that we will have a press
event happening in London on May 15 we
don't know exactly what we're getting
the rumors are that we might be getting
an honour view 10 in a smaller variant
even though I really like the view 10 as
it is let's see exactly what we get
overtime now let's talk about the Google
pixel 3 and pixel 3 Excel whatever the
case may be as a we are hearing code
names these just came from XDA the
problem is that the source is
necessarily we would consider credible
and then I'm completely conflicted over
the names because will blue line I
haven't heard before but then cross
hatch and albacore are code names that I
had heard in the past I may be mistaken
let us know in the comments apparently
three devices probably will see now
let's talk about old G we've got some
interesting patents that just emerged
about a possible device that can fold
and we're talking more like X on M type
of folding and not necessarily something
like a curved display so much so that we
hear that there are foldable batteries
being included and least full at a
specific section another is that we hear
that there will be two headphone jacks
because I guess they want to mock the
companies that are getting rid of it and
LG hasn't been one of them let's see
what this is going to be all about we're
not exactly sure we're gonna get this
and finally the most interesting news
today that we hope don't get scary have
to do with the oneplus 6 as we
continuously see that smartphones have
been raising the price tags and well
it's apparently inevitable for
to happen to oneplus though we're
expecting it to not be so significant
apparently the company wants to play a
tare game where in the case of the 64
gigabyte variant we're starting at that
one as well and we hear that it will
start between five hundred and twenty
three and five hundred and fifty bucks
we also hear there's gonna be in 128 gig
variant that's going to start at six
hundred bucks and stretch all the way to
six fifty the interesting one is the 256
gigabyte variant because we assume
expandable storage is not making the cut
again of 700 bucks depending on
whichever market you're looking at
that's kind of crazy it's still a lot
less expensive than most competition at
that amount of storage but in today's
question let us know do you think that
this would completely kill the whole
purpose of the oneplus 6 with that price
tag or would you be willing to consider
it in my case one plus I hope you're
listening I would not in mine the you
know $50 price gap if anything notify 50
gives me 64 gigabytes of storage and
give me an expandable sim tray and I
could deal with that I don't need more
storage and I don't need that game but
that's my opinion
leave us a comment down below we'd love
