you've got an application that's
throwing notifications way up here in
your notification bar and you don't want
them to show up but you don't want to
get rid of the app what can you do if
you've got jellybean I've got the answer
for you let's go take a look so here
I've got my GSM Galaxy Nexus it is
running jelly bean and there's something
interesting that we found notice up here
I've got all of these little
notifications what if I don't want them
but I still want the app well if I've
got Facebook or Google+ or Twitter or
really anything that puts something up
in the notification bar and I just don't
want it anymore
with jellybean I can get rid of that on
an app by app basis pull down your
notification shade go into settings from
there you want to find apps tap on that
once the list of apps is populated let's
go ahead all the way down to the bottom
and choose Zelo open that up if you
don't want notifications to show up
anymore uncheck that box say okay you no
longer have notifications I no longer
have that little Zelo green checkmark up
in the top if you want to reverse that
pop that in there and you're good to go
we'll come back the next time you start
the application so if you've got apps
that you have notifications showing up
that you really don't want to see
because they're not all that important
simple fast easy on an app by app basis
you can go in and turn those
notifications off if you like seeing
