pocket now calm and this is the unboxing
of the HP ipaq glisten on AT&amp;amp;T it's been
a long time since HP has released an
ipaq they released many ipads back in
the early days of windows mobile and
they kind of went on a hiatus and it
looks like they're back this device is
slanted towards the business user for
those of us that prefer a blackberry
like form factor with the keyboard on
the front and there aren't that many
windows mobile devices that that have
this form factor so we're really excited
about this and it also has an M OLED
display which should mean awesome
battery life and really good color depth
let's take a look at what we have inside
the box so we sort of have the non
retail box here this is a a review unit
so here box if you get this device won't
look like this let's see what's inside
say we're going to put the device to the
side for a minute so we have here Wow a
really really tiny wall charger I think
this may be smaller than the wall
charger for the iphone and it is this is
probably the smallest wall charger that
I've ever seen says HP on it we have a
table that uses let's see what this is
using micro micro USB which is good to
see companies starting to standardize to
micro USB and the battery is of size the
battery doesn't of the capacity listed
on it we think that it's 1,500 milliamp
hours so that coupled with the AMOLED
display should mean really good battery
life nothing else in the box again this
is not the version that you will receive
if you purchase 1 and this device is
only available on AT&amp;amp;T s website they're
not putting it into stores they're
really going right after the business
user Wow very small device it's pretty
lightweight the battery is not in yet of
course let's take this this screen
protector off it's got a smallish screen
kind of low resolution but this isn't
made to be a multimedia phone it's made
to be a text messaging phone and have
really an email machine which which we
really can appreciate the keyboard looks
fantastic the letters go all the way to
the edges this looks to be a very
similar keyboard to the motorola q 9h
which many revered to have one of the
keyboards on a mobile device we have a
d-pad here and it is a touchscreen it's
resistive it's quite thin has a nice
rubbery coating on back this is going to
be a very productive device for people
that really want to do a lot of
messaging let's take a look at it in
comparison to some other devices so here
it is next to the motorola q 9h and you
can kind of get a feel for how similar
these keyboards are they look almost
exactly the same although in terms of
the keys being raised the q 9h has
pretty larger bumps on all the keys and
so does the the glisten which is really
nice and actually the numbers are
located in the same area on the glisten
than they are on the the q 9h let's take
a look at thickness this doesn't have
the extended battery and they are about
the same thickness I'd say the glisten
is a little bit thicker it has this nice
chrome strip down the side to take a
look next to the HTC snap phone that
doesn't get much attention but it's
really a great device with a fantastic
keyboard this device doesn't have a
touch screen like the glisten the screen
sizes are the same as you can tell if we
tilt them upwards like so the snap is an
extremely thin device so the glistens
going to be thicker so we have a lot
more coming up on the HP ipaq glisten
this is HP's first windows mobile 6.5
device and it looks like it's off to a
good start this keyboard probably is
really fantastic this may serve as a
good upgrade for those still using the
motorola q 9h or the samsung blackjack 2
or even the samsung jack it adds a touch
screen amoled larger battery and some
other goodies as well we'll be back soon
with more on the HP ipaq glisten that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
