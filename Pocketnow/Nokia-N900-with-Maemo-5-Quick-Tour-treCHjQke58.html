be taking a look at the Nokia n900
smartphone which Nokia calls a mini
computer because it runs on a Linux core
the operating system in this device is
called the mimal Linux OS and in this
generation it is my mo v which like
Google Android is based on Linux
unlike other previous and series devices
from Nokia the Nokia n900 takes a
departure from the Symbian operating
system otherwise known as s60 and uses
the my mo 5 OS in the first part of the
video we're going to go ahead and do an
unboxing at the device and see what's
included in the box in part 2 we're
going to go ahead and do a hardware tour
and compare it to other devices on the
market such as the HTC Touch pro2 and
the Motorola Droid on Verizon Wireless
and lastly we're going to go ahead and
explore some of the features of my mo 5
in the box you have a wall charger which
connects to the device via a microUSB
port also you have a micro USB to USB
connector for connecting the device to
your computer there's also a TV out
cable which connects to the device via a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio and
video out port speaking of audio Nokia
also bundles eat in ear earphones which
uses a soft tip silicone ear gel that
connects onto the audio/video output
output port there's also a soft cloth
for wiping down the device a battery and
some user manuals and warranty
information let's go ahead and take a
look at the hardware of the Nokia n900
the n900 is a multimedia capable device
because it's part of the N series family
which uses a Carl Zeiss optics for the
camera the camera has a sliding lens
cover and features a 5 megapixel camera
with dual LED flash on the back the
camera can also record video in DVD
quality at 800 by 480 widescreen
resolution there's also a kickstand
here which one flipped out you can place
the device on a flat viewing surface and
operate the device that way in order to
remove the back battery cover you just
insert a fingernail and start prying and
lifting the battery cover off in the
device underneath the battery which one
is installed already you have the SIM
card tray in the US the Nokia n900
operates on the t-mobile advance
wireless spectrum Network and will not
be compatible for 3G speed on AT&amp;amp;T 3G
network although it is a quad-band
unlocked phone the device features a
micro SDHC card slot which is accessible
without having to remove the battery
which is a nice feature the device also
has 32 mate gigabytes of onboard memory
which is capacious enough to fill your
device with musics video and photos also
the n900 features one gig of application
memory of which 256 megabytes is
reserved for ram so you should be able
to multitask with ease on the device the
Nokia n900 has a resistive touch screen
that measures three and a half inches
diagonally the touchscreen is viewable
with 16 million colors and offers great
color contrast and clarity it is of
resolution 480 by 800 which is wide VGA
format on the device the device is meant
to be used as an Internet tablet with
phone features so it is meant to be used
in landscape mode you have a hardware
qrd keyboard along with an onscreen qrd
keyboard as well the hardware keyboard
is roughly the same size as the one
found on the Motorola Droid if you line
up the a key and the L key in the middle
row they're roughly about the same
however the Droid has a flat keyboard
whereas the dome keys on the n900 offers
great tactile feedback and there's a
nice on
movement as well the touchscreen is very
sensitive and offers a great field
despite it being a resistive very in my
mo five offers for home screens for you
to place widgets and shortcuts including
visual shortcuts to two internet pages
here we have the pocket now page set up
already on default so if you tap the
pocket now page it should launch the
Mozilla browser which is custom-made for
the n900 the Mozilla browser can support
Ajax and other third-party plugins
including Adobe Flash 9.4 which will
render a lot of pages beautifully
including banner ads and YouTube videos
in my experience Hulu videos played ok I
mean who leave idios load but the
quality isn't great
you'll be basically getting video
slideshows instead of true video and you
will also get stuttering an audio of
clarity as well so while the page is
loading you can zoom in by double
tapping or you can use the hardware
button here which in normal mode
operates the volume controls but if
you're in a web page or in the camera
you can use the the hardware button to
zoom in or out
nokia also uses a gesture based on
feature on the touchscreen so you just
scroll in a circular motion here any
content zoom in and scroll
counterclockwise to zoom out let's go
ahead and explore on the desktop further
on the desktop you can customize the
desktop with additional widgets or you
can remove the ones that come pre-loaded
on the device just by Xing out of it you
can move the widgets around you can move
them to different screens as well which
is a similar feature that we found
Samsung's TouchWiz UI or on the Google
Android operating system on the droid
also as well just go ahead and done you
have a separate programs menu here which
will give you access to additional
programs that you may not have space for
on your home screen for shortcuts or
widgets the Nokia n900 features the
power button in the middle at the top of
the device in landscape mode here you
already saw the volume up and down
control or the zoom features on the web
browser and the camera you also have the
dual promote camera button which when
you press in once focuses and if you
press in again will capture a picture at
the far right side you have an infrared
port which is the novelty on today's
market for smartphones on the right hand
side you have one of the two speakers
the device has stereo speakers you'll
also find another speaker on the left
hand side here you have the screen
toggle button which toggles to the lock
screen and also you have the TV and
audio output port which is
three-and-a-half millimeters there is
also a stylus which isn't the best
quality but it is doable on the left
hand side you also have the micro USB
charging port there's nothing really on
the bottom and the device has a metal
frame but plastic a plastic body that is
well built much like the touch pro2
compared to the touch pro2
the device has a better screen with
better contrast and better color
rendering the device is a little bit
thicker the n900 is a little bit shorter
than the Verizon Wireless Touch pro2 on
the front of the device you have a VGA
quality web camera light sensor to
control the automatically control the
screen brightness as well as LED
indicators for notifications and to
alert you if the device is charging or
is fully charged the phone function on
the n900 is unique in that it is the
only program at this time to be used in
portrait mode the phone integrates
nicely with some voice over IP software
including Skype although Google Voice
isn't supported at this time and
hopefully a third party will come in and
bring Google voice support with the n900
multitasking is a really great feature
and you have visual tasks visual task
manager here where you can tap to go to
different programs that are open or you
can close programs within the task
manager itself so this has been a quick
look at the Nokia n900 and the my mo 5
operating system which runs on Linux
I'm Chung win and stay tuned for
