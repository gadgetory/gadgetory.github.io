microsoft office for iOS and Android
coming soon and Samsung's building a
galaxy s3 mini sort of I'm hi Mary that
I'm wondering what to call that Nexus
device now and this is out daily
alright so what is it do we call it
Nexus g or Galaxy Nexus to a French
newspaper is now calling it the Nexus 4
and apparently there's already a rumored
launch date for october 29th it's kind
of interesting though because microsoft
is planning their launch of windows
phone 8 on the same date now whether we
get a galaxy nexus 2 or the LG e960 it's
really irrelevant now all we want is a
phone you could really quit it with the
rumors now that football has just
announced a new trial subscription
service for apps in the Google Play
Store where if it was already hard for
you to pay a dollar for a nap now
they're going to give you a trial for
you to test out a subscription and if
you like it you can keep it and you get
a subscription service for payments or
if not then you just get your money back
they'll still grab your credit card upon
the time that you subscribe but you
won't be billed until the time when you
decide that you want to keep it or not
now it's just interesting because
subscription service have never been
famous unless you're doing something
like Spotify so let's see how that goes
now Microsoft is just confirmed that we
will be getting their office
productivity suite for iOS and Android
according to Redmond we will be getting
aversions on time with in March of 2013
though they weren't specific if this is
going to be any better than the
currently already limited version that
when those phone customers have if this
happens in any better than what we
currently get with documents to go it
has no reason for being but we'll see as
a follow-up to yesterday's news google
has just provided the factory images of
android 4.1 point2 to the galaxy nexus
gsm into the nexus 7 as expected in the
changelog we will be getting the
landscape orientation for the Nexus 7
not sure about the GSM Galaxy Nexus
though and we will be getting new
gestures to be able to expand
notifications better well sadly the
sprint and the verizon version of the
galaxy nexus had no files available but
what were you expecting and finally for
the awkward news of the day Samsung is
rumored to be launching a galaxy s3 mini
tomorrow that
in every way like the current generation
galaxy s3 only with a four-inch screen
though the good news in there apparently
the specs are terrible it barely makes
it to be called a mid-tier device and it
just makes you wonder why OEMs are only
bringing the greater specs into the
jumbo phones and that leads me to the
question of the day do you like the fact
that only jumbo phones get the best
specs I'm not a big fan of big phones
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think and for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Paco now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm home every better
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
