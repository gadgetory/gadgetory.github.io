share of comparisons most are serious
drag races comparing the features and
performance of two very similar
smartphones this is not one of those
comparisons this showdown between wildly
dissimilar devices might go down in
history as one of our strangest some
would say at least necessary yet but
there's a method to our madness so let's
dive in I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Samsung Galaxy
camera vs. Samsung Galaxy s3 this
devices have the same heart beating
underneath under the hood of each is the
same Exynos 4412 quad-core cortex a9 CPU
running at 1.4 gigahertz actually our
Verizon version here packs a Snapdragon
4 LTE but for argument's sake let's call
it the International Version they're
close kin in displays as well while the
galaxy camera swaps Super AMOLED for a
super clear LCD panel the displays bear
identical measurements each is a four
point eight inch 1280 by 720 capacitive
touchscreen at 306 PPI on those screens
Android runs nearly identically on each
unit with the galaxy camera running
Android 4.1.1 and our Verizon sgs3
running the older 40.4 still
responsiveness and app launch times are
so close as to be identical as I
mentioned yesterday in my software tour
of the galaxy camera this is no hobbled
version of Android you have access to
the whole Google Play Store for
customization
just like on the s3 finally there's more
similarities on the radio side with each
device sporting quad band HSPA in
addition to Wi-Fi and regional and
carrier variants building an LTE support
see we're halfway done with this
comparison already of course there are
substantial differences in these units
as well and we're not just talking about
the lack of telephone hardware on the
Galaxy camera meaning no conventionally
located speaker and mic though the
device does have both the galaxy s3 is a
svelte eight point six millimeters thick
and a featherweight 133 grams in the
hand and it disappears easily into a
pocket it's easy to cradle in a hand and
its curved body is quite economic it's a
comfortable device to hold in any
orientation the galaxy camera is none of
that at 19 millimeters thick
not counting the lens and a whopping 300
grams it's a beast no matter what
orientation you hold it in the preferred
orientation is obviously landscape with
two handed use and your fingers wrapping
around the front of the right side grip
here but as we've seen portrait mode is
supported in the software you just have
to get used to grabbing onto the lens
cover with your fingers it actually
looks okay in this perspective almost
like a smartphone it's only when you
come around to the side that you realize
just how awkward it is to hold battery
life is another point of variants the
1650 milliamp power pack in the galaxy
camera pales on the spec sheet to the
2100 milliamp power unit in the sgs3
and that translates to real-world
performance as well it must take a lot
to power the optics and the radios in
the galaxy camera because I've got to
charge this sucker every night with even
moderate use and then of course there's
the camera itself the sgs3 packs one of
the better smartphone cameras we've seen
an 8 megapixel autofocus shooter with a
killer set of features built into its
viewfinder software from granular
settings to filters to scenes almost
everything you need but the added bulk
of the galaxy camera means it can
accommodate much beefier optics and the
fact that the word camera is a part of
the devices name should make the
enhanced shooter here no surprise it's a
16 point 3 megapixel sensor paired to a
wide-angle 23 millimeter lens with 21 X
optical zoom capability augmented by a
pop-up xenon flash and with the ability
to shoot video in 1080p or 768 by 512 at
120 fps for slow motion capture for this
informal comparison I captured these
shots in out of box settings for each
device that means photos from the galaxy
s3 were shut at 8 megapixels while the
Galaxy cameras default setting was 5
megapixels as a result the Galaxy camera
delivered photos that were
softer and its color reproduction was
somewhat less vivid than the galaxy s3
though it did do better in low light
when I cranked the resolution all the
way up to 16 megapixels results got
better from the Galaxy camera but it
still didn't seem much more impressive
than the sgs3
I'm not sure the optics alone are worth
the added weight and size penalty of
carrying a second device but the 21 X
optical zoom and the much more involved
software suite with many many many
shooting modes including expert
customizations definitely is again check
out our earlier software tour video for
more on that if you're still wondering
why anyone would make this comparison
between a dedicated camera running
Android with an HSPA radio built-in and
a smartphone that happens to have a
camera built-in well you'll have to tune
in next week to find out or listen to
this week's episode of the pocket now
weekly podcast to get a sneak peek and
some more candid impressions of the
Samsung Galaxy camera folks that's gonna
do it for our latest comparison and for
my last video of 2012 I'd like to thank
you for a wonderful year and I will look
forward to seeing you next year in the
meantime if you liked the video leave us
a thumbs up here on youtube if you have
a comment leave a comment on the post at
pocketnow.com you can follow us on
twitter at pocket now it's you can
follow me on twitter at captain 2 phones
we discussed the Galaxy camera the
galaxy s3 and pretty much every other
mobile device imaginable on the pocket
now weekly podcast every week and be
sure and check in to the pocket now
daily broadcast for Jaime Rivera's take
on the news almost every day once again
thank you for watching and we'll see you
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
