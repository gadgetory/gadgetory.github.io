phone in smartphone history well that's
the story according to LG anyway and
we're in New York City to witness its
debut I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket
now and this is our first hands-on with
the new LG g2 innovation for the sake of
innovation is according to LG old school
so the g two packs some unconventional
additions alongside the standard spec
bumps we were expecting chief among them
is a rear-mounted volume rocker and
power button LG says it's more ergonomic
but it's also situated there to give the
g2 a sleek buttonless chassis elsewhere
in usage it feels pretty good and it
provides the ability to jump into
special LG features like quick memo and
the more useful self portrait
functionality in the camera it's easy to
see why LG spent so much time on calling
out the back button because it's really
one of the only things separating the g2
from its competition in an aesthetic
sense the build is plastic and glossy
very light and very thin all attributes
we've seen elsewhere but inside is a
snapdragon 800 processor it's the first
smartphone in the world to carry that
SOC which runs at up to 2.3 gigahertz
and contain support for 4G LTE Advanced
and improvements in power consumption
which should help the g2 make the most
of at 3,000 milliamp hour battery the
camera is also pretty impressive on
paper it's a 13 megapixel shooter with
optical image stabilization and improved
low-light performance without requiring
the camera bump of other similarly
equipped units the display is a 5.2 inch
1080p IPS panel that uses graphic RAM
which LG says should help it conserve
power and the bezels flanking it are
only a tenth of an inch a piece the g2
also packs a lot of software
enhancements too many to cover in this
hands-on but the most critical are
improvements to the UI you can now
double tap to unlock and lock the device
the multitasking approach has been
improved with software called slide
aside and there's now a special guest
mode for added security when sharing
your phone beyond those conveniences old
touches like qslide and the
ir remote control have either been
retained or improved the g2 follows in
the footsteps of the g pro it's a fast
responsive lightweight Android device
with a ton of software customization but
the g2's real story beyond the
performance of its Snapdragon 800 chip
will lie in the special software
features LG has baked in this time
around at first glance it's looking
pretty interesting and there will likely
be a fair bit of buzz surrounding this
device when it launches later in the
year this has been Michael Fisher with
pocket now stay tuned for a lot more on
the LG g2 from New York City</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
