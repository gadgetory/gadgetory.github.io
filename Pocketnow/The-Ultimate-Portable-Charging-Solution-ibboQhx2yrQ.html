phone and regardless of if it's powered
by Apple Android Windows or blackberry
we all have one thing in common battery
life and charging I'm Joe Levi with
pocket now and this might just be the
ultimate charging solution power bricks
come in all shapes and sizes but they're
not all created equal some of them
support various different fast charging
technologies some of them have different
prongs but ultimately you have to plug
them in and there never seems to be an
outlet around when you need it that
isn't a problem anymore because we have
this this is a relatively small solar
panel it's 6 watts not not an awful lot
but let's go ahead and take a look now
this is very durable it's pretty rigid
but there's a little bit of flex to it
essentially it's a PCB a printed circuit
board that has a little component on the
back that sits a little bit proud of the
panel it's got a USB port on it just one
and then the front is this really nice I
don't know if that's polycarbonate or if
that's some kind of glass but it's it's
really nice and solid and durable
grommet holes in the corner so that you
can hook it up it even includes a nice
pink carabiner so you can hook that up
to a back pack a bag tree limb a rope
whatever you want to do I was with tool
now this little guy is not terribly
expensive it's about 20 30 bucks
depending on where you buy it from I got
mine from amazon and i'll have a parts
list for you in the article over at
pocketnow.com but this by itself isn't
all that grape it does not come with a
USB cable so you'll need one of those
this is a nice short one this plugs in
relatively easily and then of course
that would plug into your phone the
downside to this is you're going to have
to leave your phone out when in the Sun
outside when it's charging which doesn't
make this a great thing now of course
you could charge a flashlight you can
charge a radio you could charge your
phone you can charge whatever because
that's got a
standard USB port and of course any
cable you plug into it's going to be
just fine as well but what if we had
affordable battery this is our G
Wireless battery by zens we've shown you
this in the past works great charging
moto 360 and other Chi compatible
devices but it also has a USB out port
on it and of course this USB n which is
what we're going to take advantage of to
date this lets you have an all-in-one
solution so you can charge up using this
device and you don't have to leave your
phone outside next up we have some
command strips these are what you'll
find there by 3m you'll find them in
pretty much any grocery store drugstore
one not they are a sticky back adhesive
strip that kind of has a hook and loop
or velcro style connector you just push
them together and they lock then of
course you want to take them apart and
take them apart
and we're going to just lay that in
right about there again pressure is
important once this is all charged up
and it's not going to be fast guys k
this is relatively slow essentially a 1
amp 1.09 milliamp at peak efficiency
panel so it's not going to be fast but
because you're charging a battery it
doesn't have to be you can set this out
and forget it and get your label maker
stick your name on it so if you get a
lot gets lost somebody can return it to
you but there you go this is not saying
this is the only way to do it you can
use basically any any portable battery
that's just fine you don't have to use
ends you don't have to use something
this chica paddle I just wanted
something that could charge all of my
devices and of course my moto 360 which
doesn't battery to the last as long as
I'd like it to charges by chi and I can
just lay my watch factors my watch I can
lay that right down on top of it and
it'll charge I can also use this to
charge my nexus 6 my Nexus 5 any Chi
compatible device I can charge right on
that and it comes off really easy and it
goes back on equally as easy very easy
very simple very portable and overall
not all that expensive that's how you do
it I want to see what you do with yours
and I want to see how you improve upon
this design so make sure you tell me
down in the comments down below show off
what you've got over pocket now you can
post pictures of your setup okay or a
link to a video if you want to do the
same I'd be very eager to see what you
can do to improve upon that design
because after all again regardless of
what platform we use or what size our
devices are all about the power keepin
our devices topped off when we need them
okay thank you very much for watching I
hope you enjoyed the video if you did
hit the subscribe button below if you
haven't done so already make sure you
thumbs up button as well to let us know
that you liked it I'm Joe Levi over on
twitter i'm at Joe Levi pocket now
throwing on how you can stay popped off
we'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
