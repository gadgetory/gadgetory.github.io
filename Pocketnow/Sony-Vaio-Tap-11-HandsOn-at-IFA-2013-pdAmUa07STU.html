pocket now we are here still at the Sony
booth and we are taking a look at the
Sony Vaio tip 11 the latest Windows 8
tablet let's go check it out so what we
have here will strike you immediately
this keyboard is going to come in the
box with the biotype 11 but it is
independent of it it is not tethered so
you can use it from a distance because
it's connected wirelessly and since
we're talking about keyboard let me just
go around the back flip open the
kickstand and leave the tablet to the
side for a second because I can keep
stands always cool once you are paired
with the keyboard you can take the
keyboard away and work from a distance
and it will still be manageable
however the keyboard has a battery
attached the rating has not yet made
public but whatever you will want to
charge the keyboard battery it's done by
this port so whenever you flip it closed
that port there will connect and in this
mode it is charging by the way this back
finish is not aluminum this is magnesium
and it looks really good and feels good
in the hand and it's magnetic it's
detached the tablet will be powered on
and since we're talking about a tablet
now let's take a look at this gorgeous
gorgeous 11 inch screen very nice colors
full HD resolution and since we're on
the sides
check out a couple of ports like the
HDMI port right here like the charging
port down here nothing going on on the
downside on the back we have an 8
megapixel camera we have the kickstand
which is always good especially if you
want to use this tablet as a laptop we
have dual speakers on the back as you
can see right here on the other side we
have the power button volume rockers for
volume up and volume down and this part
will also be the part where the built-in
stylus will attach it's not attachable
at the moment on this version it will be
magnetic and this the final stylus
version of the size will be right there
you can of course operate it as you
normally would with any stylus the
operating system is Windows 8
full-fledged Windows 8 we're not talking
about Windows RT here and as you can see
it is pretty pretty damn
a little bit of multitasking action
going on there and flipping back to the
home screen itself
up top we have a two megapixel webcam
and under the glass we have Intel
Haswell processors there will be two
different versions an i3 and the i5 4
gigabytes of RAM I mentioned 128 gigs of
internal storage and that's pretty much
it it's a solid tablet especially with
the keyboard included
that's gonna rip up these short and
quick look at the Sony Vaio sep11 here
at the Sony booth at PIPA 2013 in Berlin
