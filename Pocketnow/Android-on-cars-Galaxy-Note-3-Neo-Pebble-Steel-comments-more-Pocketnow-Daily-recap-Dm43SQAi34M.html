you mean I'm overpriced oh yeah baby I
would love it uh what are you talking
about you just need to talk about eighty
percent of the speed and everything will
be better why don't you listen twenty
percent faster that's right it's that
time of the week I am high memory data
this is pocket now and is our parking
out daily recap for last week so on
Monday asked you you would pay extra for
an Android equipped vehicle the news
were about audio and all these cars and
that open automotive Alliance being
created to bring Android into your
dashboard we have 225 comments out of
which one of them says android is free
but hardware is not so you'll definitely
have to pay for it out here's a deal
there is already hardware on your
dashboard you're just changing the
operating system and obviously it would
require better chips there is a locker
button videos already on this ground so
I do assume that because of the fact
that Android is a free operating system
why not why shouldn't it be free but
yeah you do have a good point then
another color says can't wait for the
news of the first rooted car it will
happen someday and yeah this is probably
one of the biggest issues with being
Android into your dashboard obviously
the fact that yeah you won't be able to
root it and that's awesome for some
people but not really good for others
then actually Higgins says android and
cars is going to be a fatally bad ideas
idiots will start loading facebook as
they are driving and again that's the
biggest problem about rooting your car
the fact that even though android will
not be designed to do this trust me
there will be a lot of people that will
be doing this then on tuesday i asked
you if you like the new pebble steel and
when you pay 250 dollars for it because
the news war of the new pebble steel
being announced at CES and pre-orders
beginning we have 320 comments out of
which one of them says he'll to the nat
for 250 dollars you can just buy another
unlocked phone and strap it to your damn
wrist then yeah sure for two hundred
fifty dollars i could buy a computer and
use it to make phone calls right the
problem is yeah you can do that but who
would be dumb enough to strap a phone on
your wrist uh you know its form and
functionality when Carson 588 says i
would easily spend 150 dollars on the
steel so long as it place nicely with
the gs3 so i can take full advantage of
it and that's the biggest prom that
probably the most popular Android phone
out there are the galaxy phones and yeah
these don't really work
with the pebble at least in my
experience but that's obviously because
Sampson wants to sell you the gear then
a coma says two hundred fifty dollars is
a good price I think anyways I would
like to see the pocket now reviewing
yeah wait for review or review would
definitely be live soon as soon as the
product is out there a lot of us would
want to see what is the biggest
difference for those of us that are
already carrying a pebble would we pay
those extra hundred fifty dollars I
would like now say that for example
you're paying for glass and stainless
steel whereas this is plastic and rubber
so yeah I think that those hundred
dollars extra do make sense then on
Wednesday I asked you of dual booting
when those tablets would interest you
because the news were of Intel building
new chips with the focus on allowing you
to dual boot in four seconds between
Android and Windows we have to run in
somebody do comments out of which bar go
matza says android tablet entertainment
and a windows mode for work that would
be killer and yes that is actually a
great comment the fact that we could
have the option to get all the
applications that we like from Android
but then again we need work definitely
Android tablets don't do the best job
but Windows tablets do so that's a great
combination then another commenter says
of course but with a good price maybe
250 or 350 dollars it would be awesome I
just don't think it'll happen and if it
does it'll obviously beyond cheap
tablets and that's not necessarily good
then Robbie Brett says sounds like a
good idea to me but dual OS requires
larger memory space which means a higher
price and yeah I don't think that this
new mentality will be cheap but then
again hey until is on this bandwagon and
the ipad is making such a strike on
their sales and i'm sure that they want
to play hardball then on thursday i
asked you what would you change of the
galaxy s5 the news war of samsung CEO
coming to bloomberg explaining
everything that they were planning a
full revamp for this phone and
everything we have 870 comments out of
which walking idea says the new tablet
TouchWiz UI on the s5 and yes I do agree
with that that would be awesome that new
tablet UI is awesome the rumors are that
it is coming we have seen the leaks
sadly it'll come to the gs5 first and
then you'll probably have to wait a year
to get it on your older phones but again
that is a good idea another commenter
says make the s5 cheap bitch too
gimmicky touch which features do
something like the tab no-pros
Snapdragon 800 is already more than
enough for flagship oh is pleased and
yeah you pretty much nailed it there
that would be the dream galaxy phone
then Jordan I success
build quality and battery life seriously
and we are going to agree half on that
build quality is not something I
complain about because plastic is more
resilient than aluminum when falling but
then again on the other hand the battery
life of the galaxy lineup except the
note line if has been terrible just
terrible you can't get a full day on
that thing not even from the galaxy s1
on so yeah that is one thing that I
would be wishing they would change at
least and finally on Friday I asked you
if you would pay for a smaller and less
power Galaxy Note 3 because the leaks
are of the galaxy note 3 neo which is
the light barian we have for nintendo
ments out of which david lon and says
people by the note 3 because they want a
big phone and no i don't buy the note 3
because i want a big phone i buy it
because it brings me additional features
that i can't get on another phone and i
do have to put up with its size so it
does make sense to have a smaller galaxy
note 3 but then again why not just give
me a galaxy s5 with no capabilities and
just sell me the s pen you know on
another well you know separately then i
go pro HD says Samson is making way too
many phones period and we agree on that
but they can so why complain then John
tucuman says smaller note 35 inches or
less yes less powerful note 3 know and
we agree on that I don't want a less
powerful note 3 what I want is a smaller
note 3 or again sell me a galaxy s5 and
sell me the s-pen separately i'd be
willing to pay fifty dollars for that if
you wanted to but again i don't want a
big phone i've put up with it because it
gives me the multi-window support that i
like but not necessarily because i like
a big phone so again these are the
comments for this week thats it for our
pocket out daily recap thank you very
