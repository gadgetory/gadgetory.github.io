Tony's behind the camera we're checking
out the lower end of LG's lineup here at
mwc 2013 the optimus l5 2 and optimus l3
too let's take a look so we decided to
review these two devices together
because they comprise the lower end the
lineup but because also they they carry
some low in specs but that are rather
interesting first of all you can notice
a hardware here the elf 32 is a tiny
little device I mean it actually sits
rather cozily in the hand despite its
sharp corners here the l5 to having a
much more conventional orientation as
length to width ratio pull them around
to the side you can notice they have
similar thickness is a chubby little guy
the l3 to come around to the back we can
compare these cameras this is a 5
megapixel shooter with flash this is a
3.2 megapixel shooter with no flash over
here but the covers are identically
colored on these units nothing special
just a glossy plastic finish that's not
going to impress anybody speakerphone
slots down there headphone jack your
power button your usual stuff but
interestingly on the left hand side not
sure if you can see in the light the l5
2 is the last one down the line to carry
LG's quick jump into the memo
functionality you can also do the same
thing on the l3 too but you have to do
it with the through the notification
shade you notice the display differences
here are quite apparent this is a 44
inch true color IPS display at wvga
resolution whereas the l3 to harrys at
3.2 inch display at kew vga resolution
obviously the difference is very
apparent if you can ever get the demo
video to stop running on you in the
middle of a demo processors are
identical between these two units in
clock speed at 1 gigahertz but the l3
too as well as most of the rest of the
LG line of care is a Qualcomm processor
whereas this is a MediaTek on the l5 to
we asked a little bit about that LG
wasn't able to give us an answer on why
this one is special but we'll look into
that just a little mild curiosity very
very quick look at the lower end of the
LG optimus l3 2l
52 Michael with pocket now Tony behind
the camera we'll see you soon stay tuned
for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
