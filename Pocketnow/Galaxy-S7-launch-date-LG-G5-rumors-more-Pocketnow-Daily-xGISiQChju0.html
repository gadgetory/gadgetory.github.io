launch date later in 2016 LG seems to be
ready to take a break from the g flex
three and we've got some major deals on
the galaxy note 5 and other flagships
I'm hi meri behna and thanks for all the
compliments with the fitness videos you
can tell I'm not that much of a drunk
this is plucking out daily the official
news today begin with tmobile as the
company has decided to chop off a lot of
money on some major flagships there is a
deal code of the liquid description and
if you follow that you get $75 off the
galaxy note 5 the galaxy s6 for the LGBT
10 and other devices and there's even a
way to get another extra twenty percent
off again in the lecture description and
speaking of LG those of you that are in
the market for the successors to either
the LG g4 or the lgb 10 well we hear
that the LG g5 might be ready for
somewhere around April 2016 which makes
a lot of sense as obviously this is
around that time when the galaxy
flagships our revamped as well and we
both know the way both of these
companies compete against each other and
for those of you in the market for the
future successor of the v10 would being
the b11 that's apparently going to
happen on the second half of 2016 and
that's sad for you to know that you get
the g5 but then there'll be a better
phone later that year and the view are
already fans of the google nexus 6p made
by Huawei you better start liking it as
we've got some trusted sources that are
rather early already talking about the
future Nexus successor and apparently
two things number one it will be made by
Huawei again which is good news I mean I
seems that the nexus 6p has been well
praised by everyone and second
apparently the Snapdragon 820 is going
to make the cut and that was rather
expected let's just see when the phone
launches as will the spotlight over to
Samsung as the company continues
diluting its galaxy brand with these
Galaxy alpha devices i mean the galaxy
a7 and a 5 we're really good phones that
look a lot like the galaxy s6 they bring
a fingerprint scanner and everything and
a very little compromise but now we here
with the a9 that we get a six inch
display in addition to a 4000 milliamp
hour battery which is pretty much what
you got with the Oppo r7 plus a
this could be a really good phone stay
tuned we might learn more about it on
the future trade shows and finally the
very hot news today have to do with the
galaxy s7 as well we hear that there
will be a problem nouncement at CES or
that it could happen again at mwc just
like the galaxy s6 was announced last
year but it seems that if you're wanting
to buy the spoon you're gonna have to
wait until March for the product to
launch we're not exactly sure which
markets will be launched first and
particularly with the way the galaxy
note 5 is being handled that just makes
a skeptical but it leads me to the
question of the day we hear that the LG
g5 will be ready for April the galaxy s7
for March which one would you pick what
device are you out there in the market
for in my case I like the galaxy note5 a
lot I might keep it till then but after
that if LG continues with the
expandability mentality I'd probably go
for LG it was a comment down below what
would you pick friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on pagano
comet struck trying to channel as well
it follow me on twitter hi my underscore
Yvette are on Instagram it I'm every
data please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am high
metal be better thank you very much for
watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
