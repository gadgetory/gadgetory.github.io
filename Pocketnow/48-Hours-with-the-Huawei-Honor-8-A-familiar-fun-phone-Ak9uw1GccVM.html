conversation loose it's been 48 hours
ish since we got the honor eight from
the launch event up in San Francisco
there's just nothing quite like doing a
midnight unboxing video from your hotel
room and I'm still sick as a dog I
picked up something funky coming back
from that event it's all up in my nose
right now but I heart transitioned over
the honor eight turning it into my daily
driver so we could chew through a review
as quickly and efficiently as possible
just a little inside baseball right
quick we get asked a lot in the comments
and our videos on pocketnow.com on
social media what's your favorite phone
or what's your daily driver and
legitimately I have to answer whatever
phone I'm reviewing is my daily driver
our entire editorial schedule just got
kind of a little interrupted once we got
our hands on the note seven when I flew
out to New York to meet up with hi mate
of Nevada rod to cover Samsung's newest
phablet I was in the middle of reviewing
the xperia x performance and the axon 7
now the plan was to give hime a the axon
7 I would finish up the X performance
and then we can move on with our lives
and start prepping for Aoife that plan
got all wibbly-wobbly twisty twisty but
we promise you the axon 7 is getting
wrapped up we will have a review of that
phone out shortly but until all of that
get sorted out I'm switching over to the
on rate and I'm pretty excited about it
most of us in North America probably
know the honor brand by phones like the
honor 5x released earlier this year this
$200 phone received critical acclaim for
being such an amazing budget-busting
device now while we appreciated what
honor brought to the table if I'm being
honest with you folks I actually liked
the Huawei branded phones better not
really comparing oranges to oranges here
but stepping up to phones like the
Huawei gx8 yes it's a more expensive
device but every little attention to
detail piece of this phone I liked
better than its honor counterpart have
you been following the reviews on this
channel especially the real camera
reviews you would know that I personally
felt in love with the Huawei p9 released
earlier this year of course notable for
these dual camera sensors on the back of
the phone in this big lekha badge here
by the flash it was this phone that
helped me score a victory against Adam
Lane and his Lumia 1020 in our pocket
now fireworks challenge so I'm flying up
to San Francisco I've seen the Flyers
for the honor event it's two circle
next to each other looks like an 8 or an
infinity sign or something like that I'm
thinking maybe what we'll get is some
sort of mid ranger option something that
bridges the gap between the 5x and maybe
phones like the GX 8 but they're gonna
throw that dual camera system on it it
could be really compelling it could be a
fun solution and then they show off the
otter 8 and it looks very much like the
p9 it looks so much like the p9 because
it's almost exactly like the p9 so I'll
get the nitpicks out of the way first
here we've got emui on tap I am NOT a
fan of emui turns your entire Android
experience into something more
resembling iOS if I wanted iOS I would
buy an iPhone so of course the first
thing I did was I threw nova launcher on
there just so I could get back to my app
drawer and that layout of course we do
have that issue with the split
notification shade you know you just
kind of have to live with that unless
someone has a good option for replacing
the notification shade drop me a comment
below this video now the look at this
phone is really cool
during the honor announcement for this
device they detail that there are 15
layers of glass there are different
diffracting elements to help you carve
up light and reflection in really
interesting ways you always have these
sort of they look like spotlight sore
spot lamps that are sort of streaking
through the back panel of your phone for
example I think the idol 4s is a very
attractive phone but there's a subtle
difference between the way these two
glass back devices are playing with
reflections and I think the honor eight
has a slightly nicer look to it in fact
the only device that I might compare
this to would be some of the newer glass
back effects that we see on phones like
the note 7 but if you've been following
my videos you guys know i'm actually not
the biggest fan of glass on the back of
phone I think it looks really cool like
I want to set it up on a museum stand
under museum lighting just because I
think it's such a great design piece but
I don't know that it's the most
practical material to make the back of a
phone out of first of all if you saw the
the first impressions video in the
launch video it's just a crazy
fingerprint magnet wiping this phone off
on my shirt in between every single shot
and I still couldn't keep it from just
magnetically attracting smudges from all
around its environment so the honor
folks supplied us with these
plastic clear clip-on back plates and
that's what my honor
eights gonna live in but we've also
gotten a number of Commons from people
saying that they think the p9 is the
more attractive device there's something
to be said for the glass cutout window
that white accent the metal phone body I
can totally understand why people would
be of differing opinions as to which
device they think is more attractive but
I do have to commend honor for making
this back glass piece just so simple
it's so clean you've got this one little
break for the fingerprint sensor and
then everything else is completely flush
totally smooth there's no other break or
seam or gap and that is actually pretty
impressive I mean it's just blue does it
getting out of the setup process this
thing performs a lot like how we found
the p9 performed that's a very good
thing I don't have a lot of experience
with high silicon cure in processors
this uses the cure in 950 which as far
as I can tell is just an underclock
version of the cure in 955 found in the
p9 but from all of the numbers that
we've been able to generate from the
tests that we've been able to do have
played a couple games on it I can't find
a significant real-world difference
we're talking maybe a five percent
difference in benchmarking and then in
real-world application this is one of
the few phones that I've done that
automatic setup process where it just
dumps all of your apps from another
device after you kind of like make out
with the back of another phone and it's
one of the few that hasn't completely
locked up while it's been downloading
that huge deluge of app updates all
phones are going to slow down when
you're hitting both data and you're sort
of saving information and hitting that
CPU to install those new programs but
this phone handled it better than most
when doing that initial setup and this
phone post some of the best multi-core
benchmarking numbers I've ever seen it
does lose single core benchmarks against
phones powered by a Qualcomm 820 but any
app that's taking advantage of that big
little octa-core environment that the
kuren provides you're going to see
wonderful performance out of this device
and a quick note about the cameras again
very exciting to see that this is nearly
identical performance to what we found
on the fa√ßade Pinay the p9 became
something of a backup phone for me while
I was out reviewing other devices it
joins a list of phones like the Lumia
1020 in the LG v10 if I knew I was going
to be out shooting photos this was a
phone I wanted to have with me and now
the honoree joins it for the most part
nearly identical but we do see some
differences in the camera app slightly
different layout most of those modes are
still intact we saw have a full manual
control mode which is phenomenal
unfortunately the honor 8 does not have
native raw capture built directly into
the supplied camera app now unlike some
other manufacturers who shall remain
nameless
you can shoot RAW photos you just have
to download a third-party app if you're
in a situation where you feel you really
want to get that raw image captured and
all of the electronic shenanigans that
have to be employed to communicate with
these two image sensors are handled at a
hardware level so you don't have to
worry about using a third-party camera
app all of that information is still
going to be transferred and raw photos
from open camera look nearly identical
to raw photos from the p9 and the Huawei
camera folks I gotta say this is a
really happy surprise for me not only
seeing what honor was able to do in
pulling the p9 hardware over to their
youth brand the honor for the brave
brand but also knowing that this is
coming out at a three hundred and ninety
nine dollar price point I'm gonna spend
a couple more days playing with it I'm
gonna try and knock out a review over
the weekend but even from the second and
third day impressions I can already tell
you this is more than capable hardware
at a great price point which totally
deserves to stand opposite phones like
the one plus three for the axon seven
that's really exciting territory for a
manufacturer to be playing in right now
it's probably the most competitive price
point on the market today and if you can
give me something cool to play with in
this tier something unique well that
just makes my job a lot easier
so folks be on the lookout for our full
review of the honor eight I am going to
be doing a few more camera tests just to
make sure that all of our results are in
line with what we found on the p9 if
there are any significant differences
then I'll try and do a separate camera
review video but we might end up
just linking back to the p9 camera view
if our results are consistently similar
with that other phone as always thanks
