pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to unbox the samsung omnia pro be
7610 we've been waiting for this device
to come out for a long time now it's
been delayed time and time again and
really excited because this is a very
good competitor for the HTC touch pro2
in fact it has a few legs up on the
touch pro two it has an AMOLED display
it has a slideout keyboard of course and
it also has an 800 megahertz processor
the CPU on the touch pro 2 is about five
hundred and twenty eight megahertz so it
may be faster it may have a better
screen better battery life we're going
to test all of those things but let's
get to the unboxing of the samsung omnia
pro be 7610 this is basically a samsung
omnia two but with a slide-out keyboard
and the samsung omnia tube got very good
reviews including from us so let's see
what we have here on the box versatile
power of touch 7610 so this device is
also divx artifice like the omnia two it
has gps it's got that 3.5 inch WVGA
AMOLED screen full touch 5 megapixel
autofocus camera FM radio let's see if
there are specifications listed on here
does it look like it's on this area
let's open her up okay we'll put the
device to the side for a second let's
see what we get in the box kind of a
simple box that Samsung likes to do so
here we have some software getting
started user manual we have some
headphones here okay here's a battery
looks kind of big and wonder how big it
is it is of size 1500 milliamp hours
which should provide a ton of battery
life for this device the omnia to an
extremely good battery life thanks to
that AMOLED display which not only saves
on power but it really allows colors to
pop on the screen see what we have here
we have Micro USB which is good that
Samsung went from their proprietary to
micro and here is the wall charger
let's take a look at the device and
we'll do some comparisons as well this
device feels a lot thinner than I
thought it would and we're going to
compare thickness to the touch pro 2 in
a second okay it feels lightweight
that's because the batteries out it
definitely feels a lot thinner than it
looks in pictures very nice design has a
very similar design to the omnia two for
good reason they're based off the same
thing so we've got very minimal buttons
on the front we have call end call start
we've got what looks to be here a button
of some sort let's take a look at this
keyboard very nice spring assist action
nice size keyboard I don't think this
keyboard is going to be as good it is on
the touch pro 2 but it's definitely a
smaller more pocketable device than the
touch pro 2 let's see what we have on
the back wow it's got this weird red
coating off the look into that a little
bit more alright can you see that it has
a actually a red swirl to it I've never
seen something like this very nice has a
flash with the camera which is fantastic
very small device I'm actually quite
surprised at how small it is looks like
there's a stylus silo the omnia two
didn't come with a stylist I'll have to
check the box for that ok let's do some
comparisons let's do first the touch pro
2 which is the closest competitor the
touch pro 2 has a screen that is point 1
inches bigger than the b 76 10 let's
take a look at the keyboards so
obviously you get a kind of a nicer
keyboard on the touch pro 2 but the
keyboard widths are about the same so
perhaps it's not that big of a
difference it doesn't have that extra
row for the nut for the numbers or for
the symbols depending on which a variant
of the touch pro 2 you have let's take a
look at thickness the b 76 10 is
definitely thinner than the touch pro 2
and turning over to the back again we
see this beautiful red coating which is
quite interesting and here we have the
camera the touch pro tour the tilt two
doesn't have a flash it's got a little
divot down here i guess this is for the
speaker let's compare it to some other
devices let's compare it to the iphone
3gs the iphone 3gs has a three point six
inch screen in the 76 10
as a 3.5 inch screen obviously you don't
get a slide-out keyboard on the iphone
so the 7610 is going to be thicker and
let's take a look at it next to the hd2
I shouldn't even do this but um yeah but
of course the hd2 uses an on-screen
keyboard like the iPhone so you're not
going to get that extra thickness
associated with it so we've got a lot
more coming up on the samsung omnia pro
be 7610 we're pretty sure that this does
not support us 3g and that it's intended
for the european audience and we say
pretty sure because there's some
conflicting reports out there on whether
it has that US 3g band as the european
omnia two oddly did so we're saying 5050
right now and keep it to pocketnow.com
to see if you can get us 3g on this
device and that backing is just gorgeous
we'll be back with a lot more on the
samsung omnia pro that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
