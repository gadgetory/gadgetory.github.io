finally properly tore me away from
Windows Mobile when I first held an Evo
and saw what Android could do I had high
hopes for the bolt after revisiting the
HTC 10 especially following so closely
behind the HTC manufactured pixel and
now it's time to report on whether the
bolt lived up to those expectations
first for you Hardware junkies you can
pause the video here for a quick rundown
on what the bolt is packing now with
that out of the way the bolt further
reinforces why I love HTC design with so
many phones generically rounding and
curving corners and edges HTC offers up
something subtle but unique an actual
design language which evolves from the
10 to the bolt bolder facets and
chamfers will be polarizing some people
are going to hate them and those people
are wrong but that comes with the
territory of actually making a design
decision instead of just following the
herd I'm still not personally a fan of
front-mounted fingerprint sensors but at
least this phone makes better use of
bezel real estate than the previously
mentioned pixel other than dancing the
phone in my hand to reach the home
button it's a well-organized layout and
HTC has learned to better differentiate
buttons on the side great tactile fields
the power key in the volume rocker the
5.5 inch quad HD screen is nice and
crisp but this LCD is one of the dimmer
displays we've tested recently we
normally run our battery tests at 190
Lux which is about 3/4 of the total
output living in Southern California
this isn't the easiest to read screen
when out and about moving over to
software what an unholy mess of yellow
and black yeah there's a lot of sprint
piled on top plus those value-added apps
pre-installed a full suite of Amazon
applications triple-a news republics
sprint services and draftkings look it's
a chore but cleaning this up is pretty
straightforward and let's slap on a less
i searing wallpaper how about very nice
after all that trimming it's an HTC skin
running on top of Android nougat richer
notification split screen apps and
improved multitasking Plus HTC additions
to the app drawer and reorganizing the
setting
menu over the years HTC is toned down
aggressive UI elements so the tweaks
here are fairly inoffensive if maybe
even appreciated for delivering
something fun for folks who feel stock
Android is too plain but once we start
talking about performance we start
getting a bit concerned
this phone is packin a Qualcomm 810
chipset the same chipset which helped
doom the HTC One m9 Sprint's play for
this phone is to show off LTE Plus which
required modem and radio support only
found in the 810 that's great for folks
who live in LTE plus coverage but
otherwise this is still last year's
chipset packed into a phone sold at the
end of 2016 this processor has been
refined since its initial launch in 2015
but it still won't go down as a high
watermark for Qualcomm those hardware
runs warmer than we'd like getting
downright hot to the touch if you use it
while charging most of the time it's
snappy and responsive but start running
it warm in the phone will lag or hitch
especially when multitasking this means
the bolt also isn't much of a gaming
champ future fight is already poorly
optimized for Android but it becomes a
slideshow at the highest graphic
settings and the phone is really warm
after a handful of missions less
graphics intensive games play much
better and shorter sessions of casual
games are this devices sweet spot Wi-Fi
performance is acceptable for a metal
backed phone falling just behind
recently reviewed devices like the mate
9 and the LGV 20 but maybe the most
important reason for this phone's
existence is LTE performance Sprint's
LTE plus coverage well we went war
driving around my neighborhood and we
will credit Sprint's coverage map this
heat map shows a pretty wide disparity
in performance from city block to block
and that's exactly what we encountered
one stretch of road delivering some
snappy data speeds only to turn a corner
and drop below a 3G connection the area
is a faster coverage though we saw some
encouraging speed tests those pockets of
data sometimes besting 18t and verizon
we're sure more devices in the future
will support LTE Plus but it is a nice
perk for folks on Sprint now getting the
most out of what little yellow has to
offer Oh what to do with you HTC Audio
used to be the one area we could count
on you to destroy the competition
speaker performance on
is good for a mono bottom firing
solution but that's just normal and
plain now we don't get that split
speaker playback we had on the HTC 10
but the headphone situation is just
downright frustrating
see there's no headphone jack HTC
includes some great earbuds but this
isn't how we want to see the transition
to USB see audio take place these
earbuds only work with the bolt they
don't work on my laptop they don't work
with other USB see phones USB C is
supposed to bring better support for
peripherals it's supposed to be a
standard so using this connector for
proprietary audio solution is at best
confusing at worst it's a small step
backwards for creating a true standard
the camera game on the bolt is solid
though this 16 megapixel shooter feels a
lot like the camera on the HTC 10 this
is a great camera app full manual
controls and raw support and never does
it remove you from your composition
window photos come out well exposed and
saturated and though HTC dropped laser
assistance the phase detection autofocus
is pretty snappy 4k video is on tap with
the excellent high quality audio mode
it's a great all-around capture the
image stabilization is still wobbly er
than we might prefer but it does a
respectable job of minimizing handshake
when you're trying to hold still even
though we're dealing with a higher
resolution sensor performance is very
similar to what we experienced with the
10 it's not going to lead the pack this
year but it's an overall better shooter
than what HTC is delivered in the past
now looking at battery life the bulk
comes with a slightly higher capacity
battery but that doesn't seem to make up
the difference in using a less power
efficient chipset battery life is just
okay running our media test streaming 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux
the bolt drained 7% it's not difficult
making it to the evening with battery to
spare but we're off and running low at
dinnertime recharging is also mid pack
30 minutes on the supplied charger
topped off 34% well behind the
performance of the HTC 10 so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the
HTC bolt
this phone leaves a lot of folks
conflicted myself included the main
mission here is to show off LTE Plus
which is very well accomplished you want
the fastest network performance on
Sprint you got it unfortunately dreams
of a pixel cousin with sharper HTC
styling are left unfulfilled it's
perfectly capable of getting daily tasks
done though not as smoothly as phones
which are already almost a year old and
we have some concerns with how well this
chipset will age over time considering
the other options on Sprint $600 for the
bolt isn't a bad price for a premium
looking phone with a 5.5 inch screen but
it's only $50 cheaper or about two bucks
a month cheaper than the smaller and
more powerful HTC 10 still it is a darn
pretty phone as always thanks so much
