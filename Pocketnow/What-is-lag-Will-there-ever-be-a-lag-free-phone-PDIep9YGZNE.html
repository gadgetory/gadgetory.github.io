for faster performance which makes sense
because our daily interactions with our
phones are usually pretty brief we want
to minimize the amount of time we spend
interacting with the phone so we can
maximize the amount of time that we
spend with our data and services lag is
one of the more subjective points we can
discuss but it's also one of the most
frustrating reading through the comments
on our reviews it would seem that pretty
much every major flagship phone is both
the lagus device ever made and also the
most lag free device ever created it's
kind of like pornography we can't always
define it but we know when we see it so
what is lag looking this up on Wikipedia
we get an entry focused on online gaming
lag is a noticeable delay between the
actions of players and the reaction of
the server this actually works for our
conversation about smartphones a delay
between action and response most of us
have probably experienced a situation
where we go to tap on something on our
phone screens we don't get any
noticeable reaction from the phone then
when we go to tap again that's when the
phone responds to the first command for
the purposes of this video we'll call
that lag and we can separate this from
otherwise slow performance if it's
taking a long time for an app to load on
your phone but the phone is showing you
that it reacted promptly to your input
that's not really lag you just have a
slow phone and this is the difference
between the actual performance of a
gadget and the perception of the
performance of that gadget this is
something Apple nailed on the original
iPhone utilizing pretty animations to
transition the user from the input
command to the actual service they
requested it might take the phone a long
time to get that app running but at no
point should the phone ever appear
completely inert and today on a
powerhouse phone like the galaxy s7
hitting the multitasking button produces
a three-fold response first there's a
little haptic pulse a little vibration
to inform the user that the key press
was registered then an animation pulls
the screen away from what you were
looking at previously and transitions
you into a series of cards for the user
to interact with we find a supremely
frustrating to touch a button on our
phones and see zero response lag is that
unholy beast which makes us question
whether our phone is performing poorly
or if we just missed the command we
intended to hit it's also why it's so
hard to demonstrate lag consistently for
our reviews our phones are constantly
under differing amounts of load with
different background processes or
pulling information from online services
thankfully it's a rare surprise to
encounter a phone which lags
consistently enough for us to catch it
on camera high-end performance across
the board is pretty smooth these days so
might we ever have a truly lag free
phone in two words probably not in a
perfect world where one monolithic
company could have complete control over
the hardware the software and anticipate
every single consumer interaction with
that gadget then we might see a device
which consistently and instantly
responds to every single customer
command our phones are pretty
complicated little devices to
oversimplify let's take Android for
example we have a layer of hardware
which communicates with a kernel in this
case Linux and on top of that kernel
runs an Android runtime environment and
then on top of that environment are all
of the apps and services that consumers
can use moving information through that
hierarchy takes time sometimes that time
is measured in individual processor
cycles and sometimes there's a quarter
second delay before your navigation app
pulls up the information that you
requested on a point of interest since
we don't live in that boring perfect
world we'll just have to contend with
the occasional stutter skip or that
moment of waiting as our phones process
insane amounts of information
utilizing billions of dollars of
communications infrastructure also we
can bask in the glory of watching cat
videos online so let's have a little fun
down in the comments what the lajiye
Steve I see you've ever used phones
tablets mp3 players they're all fair
game as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more fun informative videos
like these and hit that thumbs up button
for a little extra positive
reinforcement
for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now
you can chat me up on Twitter and
Instagram as some gadget guy and I will
catch you all on the next video
it's like being in a conversation with
someone and you finish your point the
other person just staring at you without
any kind of reaction on their face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
