Park
calm this part two of the
1:10 focusing on software you'll notice
HP sports a couple of different things
real small not nothing real big but
tools to help you out for example this
today bar that gives you battery
information program memory information
storage and storage card information I'm
gonna control for your backlight which
is good it's not bad at all you also get
a battery bar at the top which is not
really common I'm when those mobile
devices in the Start menu you'll notice
this beatty phone managers with just
something real interesting it actually
allows you to control your your device
and another phone and use that phone's
GPRS connection or any other connection
to connect to the internet if anybody
remembers pocket phone tools from BB RP
supported before this is practically the
same application only it doesn't have
any messaging it only focuses on
allowing you to connect to the internet
but just good connectivity options are
good you get this HP help and support
which is a different sort of help tool
don't think you don't get the same
Microsoft how about in which is down
here it's the same thing pretty much
another thing that's included photo
smart mobile is something that I really
really liked on this device it's much
better than the Microsoft built-in
software to control photos you get the
typical slide tool different things you
get recording you get printing through
Bluetooth but actually one of the things
I like the most is that it's a little s
it's a bit less crappy than what is
included by Microsoft there are a lot of
tools included which I won't go through
right now because they're a lot you
could check it out later on this EMA
that you see here at the side I'm
honestly are still trying to find out
what it is all it does is actually
connect to the HP website and allow
options there but then pretty much
that's just about it
you get HP Quick Start tool which brings
different basic touring of what the
device includes and what things you can
do with it it's really a good help tool
included but a buy HP here really nice
one thing I don't like I consider a bit
of problematic but then again it's not
not really a big deal is every time you
reset the device the device starts here
on HP I pack tips and it brings
different things for carrying and
stuff that you could consider once you
turn on your device it's really good for
new users in town on the games don't
think it includes contra that's
something I installed but then it brings
the same bubble maker and solitaire
nothing really out of the ordinary you
get the same messaging app what's funny
is you get internet sharing which I
honestly don't know what Internet you're
going to share but it's included you get
your typical Windows Live pack which
includes a messenger you get the same
Microsoft notes the same media player
the same search practically the same
thing I like the fact that HP tries to
bring you the same suit as included in
Microsoft they're not bringing too much
stuff into the device you get clear view
PDF reviewing which is something I like
a lot more than a dough belly one thing
I do consider great about the device is
the fact that you do get office mobile
6.1 so you are able to open office 2007
files on Excel PowerPoint or word mobile
if I had to judge the device on stem and
I would consider it fair for example I'm
at 70% of battery life and I've been
using the device for the past 30 minutes
which is not good or bad and the past
week that I've been using the device
I've had a fair day of usage without the
need of recharging which is pretty much
fair but I haven't really put it to the
test on performance yet on connectivity
options well you get Wi-Fi 802 BG which
is good you also get Bluetooth 2.0 with
EDR which is enhanced data rate another
good thing you get is well the bt phone
manager which i mentioned which is good
you actually have the option to connect
the DVRs edge 3g hey whatever you got
the only thing I wouldn't consider good
about this is the fact that for example
as I mentioned before if you send your
device to standby Bluetooth just turns
off so you actually lose a point there
if you're not able to keep messengers or
stuff like that on the background
working while you're not connect while
you're connected that's pretty much it
for what the device offers and software
and pretty much my first impressions
will keep toying with the device seeing
what else it's got in performance and
measuring the way develops that's pretty
much it for now more videos to come here
