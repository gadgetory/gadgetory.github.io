interesting foldable device that
technically shouldn't be able to fold in
that material according to a new report
Samsung will be killing something that
is gonna make a lot of people
disappointed and somebody's MacBook Pro
just got on fire after he was giving it
normal use and it seems that Apple is
taking time to respond I'm high metal
Iveta and I'm sorry for the late upload
it's been a crazy day traveling but I
can do this all day
this is parking out daily brought to you
by the honored 20 series the official
news today begin with deals of you are
in the market for the Apple watch and
yes I do highly recommend this product
in the case of series 4 but sure of
series 3 is currently available for 279
on bnh if you're looking for the most
affordable variant again this is not the
watch that I recommend most but then
again it's available in addition if
you're looking for iPads that 2017 iPad
pro is currently for up to four hundred
nine dollars off you can learn more in
the description it's actually a really
good deal now how about if we talk about
the sales figures for 5g phone something
that is not happening necessarily yet
fully in the United States but it has
been happening in Korea so we know that
the Galaxy S 10 5g and the LG b 50 have
launched over there but guess which
phone has one it turns out that the LG v
50 is the phone that's selling most
right now and it's rather interesting
because what you're technically getting
is a V 40 with 5g capabilities in design
and everything I assume that it probably
has to do with a more aggressive price
tag it could also be the fact that the V
50 has literally the same footprint as
the v40 whereas the galaxy s 10 5g is a
substantial device not saying to the v40
sorry V 50 is a small phone but then
again yes a hundred thousand units we're
not exactly sure that win from LG is
gonna last long but that's where it
stands right now now let's move the
spotlight over to t-mobile and
conversations about 5g as a we haven't
really reported that t-mobile is running
any tests we know that the Verizon is
running their tests in Chicago or
actually gonna be in one of those tests
very soon but apparently and very
silently team
has been conducting tests of their 5g
network here in New York and it seems
that it's been through a galaxy s 10 5 G
489 megabits down and up to 59 up which
well 59 up is nothing to go crazy about
but yeah the 489 is obviously if I just
capable of much more but indeed these
are just baby steps towards getting 5g
deployed and I'm loving the fact that
it's finally here
so I'll keep you posted if testing ever
conducts our way and we can show you
more now let's talk about Apple for a
brief second as well we've heard about
exploding smartphones and everything but
I don't remember the last time that we
heard about an exploding laptop well
we've got a particular user very popular
on Twitter you can follow his
information in the description we're
about of the blue his a MacBook Pro just
exploded no injuries to himself there
were some damages to his house and
obviously he used the power of Twitter
to tweet at Apple apparently he did get
a response that they're gonna respond
within 5 days and yeah obviously Apple
has been going through a transition
right now with a new top case and you
know that if you do replace that
keyboard mechanism it doesn't just
replace the keyboard it replaces
speakers it replaces the battery it
replaces the trackpad it's the full top
case so we still need more details again
this is just one case but we will keep
you posted as to what cost this and
let's talk about controversial changes
that are coming for the Galaxy Note 10
the probable design changes the punch
hole in the front all this looks very
beautiful and if the renders are true
this phone looks really sexy but if you
notice the the Galaxy fold was actually
the anti Samsung there was a notch and
there was no headphone jack this phone
doesn't necessarily bring a notch in the
case of the note 10 but we've got
trusted sources claiming that we will
not be getting a headphone jack and that
is definitely alarming a Samsung has
like you know use this as their flag of
saying we listened to consumers we're
keeping the headphone jack it's not
going anywhere they're providing the
decks on their phones
and definitely the Galaxy Note is one of
those devices that I really do want to
retain it we've got the footprint we've
got the size so I'm I am hoping that
there is some good justification for
this obviously we're still far away from
the possible launch so it could change
over time we'll keep you posted
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with a patent that was just
discovered from Apple for a foldable
product and this patent is rather
interesting for a couple of reasons
obviously in typical Apple fashion this
device is designed to be able to fold
and not be able to compromise the
integrity of the device and we noticed
that there is a double fold up to a sort
of an S and design and I think that this
is the second patent that I've seen from
Apple that follows this design that's
all fine and dandy the interesting part
is that truly if extended this could be
the size of an iPad if closed this could
be the size of an iPhone the thing about
the patent is when you read that the
material it's made of is glass
technically you cannot fold glass unless
you heat it and even so it's not
necessarily any type of heat we know
that it's rather difficult to be able to
fold and shape glass and even so once
you fold it you can't extend it without
breaking it even if you heat it and it's
such a dynamic process and again I'm not
a physicist please anybody if I'm wrong
shyam in the comments we would love to
know what you think about this and while
we're at it why don't we start with that
the conversation today what do you think
do you think that it is possible for
Apple to come up with a solution that
involves glass for foldable you know
I've been thinking about this because
one of the things that the patent didn't
mention is that Apple is looking for
alternatives to the hinge so could it be
that they've found the plastic
alternative to the hinge that has the
same amount of integrity because they
want to avoid the excess of moving parts
read the pad information it's actually
rather extensive and could it be that
only the portions that are not folding
are going to be made of glass and we
have a sort of fusion between two
materials I'm not even sure if that's
even physically possible what do you
think do you think that Apple is capable
of pulling this off are you interested
in a product that actually folds into
like that
or do you think that this is just
Apple patenting something that's not
gonna happen this in my case I mean I
don't think you know Apple can have a
reality distortion field but you know
bending the laws of physics pun intended
I don't think that that's possible
that's just me guys prove me wrong I
would love your conversations let me
know what you think in the comments and
obviously we will be discussing this in
the recap very soon and folks this
