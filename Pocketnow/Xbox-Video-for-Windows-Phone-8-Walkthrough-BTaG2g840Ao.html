video app for Windows Phone 8 i'm taylor
Martin this is pocket now and this is a
walkthrough of xbox video at long last
Microsoft finally delivered the Xbox
video app to Windows Phone 8 users
before videos and music were collected
into the music videos hub bringing the
zune experience overed Windows Phone and
while your xbox music pass give you
access to millions of songs to stream or
download there was no access to the xbox
video service from Windows Phone devices
all those movies and television shows
you've purchased on your xbox weren't
available from mobile Microsoft for
whatever reason remove the surface which
was built directly into Windows 17
yesterday that changed while the music
and video hub still exists xbox music
and Xbox videos are now separate
standalone applications both of which
only work with Windows Phone 8 once you
download the xbox video app from the
Windows Phone store all you need to do
is log in to your live account all of
your existing or previously purchased
content will be displayed in the
collection swipe to the right and you
can begin browsing new television shows
and movie releases or you can purchase
full seasons individual episodes or
movies you can also rent available movie
titles you can search for your favorite
titles or browse through the featured
top selling new releases top rated and
even shows which aired the previous day
when browsing you can also filter by
Network for television shows or studios
for movies so I think through previews
of movies and television shows you find
a synopsis critic reviews from rotten
tomatoes cast information and similar
related titles trailers for movies are
also integrated when purchasing video
content you can switch between SD and HD
but note that HD playback either through
streaming or downloaded movies and
television shows is not supported from
mobile only standard definition is
supported though if you buy the HD
versions you can stream and watch in
high definition from other platforms HD
playback is said to be coming to the
Xbox video app in the future but it
unfortunately does not currently work
within settings you can restore
purchases redeem codes manage payment
options and billing information view
billing history edit privacy settings
and contact preferences and of course
you can sign out of your live account
one of the best features is the ability
to pin the content you own to your start
page for super quick access to playback
however the unfortunate part of playback
is that xbox video currently lacks the
ability to synchronize your current
position in a show or movie between
devices if you watch a couple of minutes
from your computer and want to pick up
from your phone you'll need to manually
skip forward we've also been
experiencing some trouble with playback
on a few titles but backing out of the
app and trying again seems to work in
most cases as far as functionality
concerns go this is nothing
revolutionary but it is finally the full
experience dedicated Microsoft ecosystem
users have needed for a long time you
can now watch your purchase content on
Windows Phone 8 pc tablet xbox one or
360 and Xbox video com
