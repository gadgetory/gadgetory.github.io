pocketnow.com and this is the last part
of our series of the pocket now
throwback we're taking a look at the old
legendary eye pack 3650 which came out
of the gate in 2000 running an operating
system called Pocket PC 2000 it didn't
have Wi-Fi did that phone functionality
it had a horrible display but it really
revolutionized mobile devices and a
computing power that you could fit into
your pocket so in this video we're going
to compare it to a present-day device
the HTC Touch pro2 running the version
of windows mobile 6.5 that we'll be
shipping on devices coming up in the in
the fall of 2009 and we're gonna kind of
compare this experience to see how far
we've come and how far we really haven't
come with Windows Mobile so we're in
turn on both devices and right away you
can see the contrast in the screen they
use different screen technologies and
obviously the resolution on the touch
pro2 is much much much greater than you
will find on the eye pack so let's take
out a stylus so we can kind of control
things so back in Pocket PC 2000 in 2003
we saw Microsoft bring forward this
concept of the today's screen and we
still have that today the idea of the
today's screen is that in one glance you
should be able to see your next
appointment your next task who has
called you who is text of you who has
message do everything in one screen
because most of us are busy people we
have a lot going on and our device
should show us in one quick glance what
we're doing versus the iPhone where you
have to journal into every application
to see where you need to be who has
called you know what messages you have
things of that nature so the today's
screen actually has been replaced in
windows mobile 6.5 with what they call
titanium and this is kind of a more
expansive version of the today screen so
instead of just owner information
upcoming appointments messages and tasks
we have pictures and music missed calls
voicemail text messages which have
become huge in the last nine years email
calendar and favorites so a really very
versatile way to
see all of your stuff and we can
actually revert back to the old old
Windows Mobile today's screen quite
simply we just turn this off and we hit
all of these things and now we're back
to the standard old today screen that
lets you see all of that information in
one glance it's not necessarily the most
beautiful screen but it's very
customizable and anyone that's been
using Windows Mobile will tell you that
you can just customize the heck out of
the screen you could have icons for
people you want to call and weather in
stocks and pretty much anything you need
to see you can customize on the Today
screen so let's drill into the Start
menu which obviously previous 26.5 was a
drop-down menu kind of like you get on
the desktop version of Windows but now
in windows mobile 6.5 you get a larger
finger friendly list of programs a big
focus in 6.5 is on finger friendly
optimization because that's really where
touch phones are going in no longer do
people want to use a stylus so we go
into programs to see how limited the
amount of programs and what kind of
compare things here so let's start with
games and as we talked about in a
previous video what once was called
jawbreaker is now called bubble breaker
but they do basically the same thing
these are the stock games to come with
min Windows Mobile for the longest time
and then we have good old solitaire
which Microsoft
also puts on all of its desktop version
versions of Windows which hasn't changed
very much the resolutions a little
higher but that's pretty much it let's
take a look at some other programs to
see how they've changed let's go into
the calendar application and again this
hasn't changed very much but of course
you can get third-party programs like
Pocket informant to really spruce up
your calendar so we can go to the next
view which is day you can go to the next
view here which is the month view this
is the week view and the month you again
it's very similar to how it was nine
years ago what is different and what
you're gonna notice here is that the
buttons on the bottom are different back
in I believe Windows Mobile 5.0 they
introduced standardized soft keys on the
left and the right so instead of having
a bunch of buttons here you just had two
menus but that created another problem
so now we have menus after menus in some
screens not here but sometimes we'll
have an over arrow than one an over
arrow and before you know it you have
many many different screens Windows
Mobile seven is likely to finally fix
this problem let's go into the contacts
application to see what that looks like
again contacts application not much has
changed you can type in the name up here
here you have an alphabet you can jump
right to it although if you have a lot
of contacts here you'll actually get the
alphabet along the side we can tap on
new tap on new outlook contact pretty
much the same thing
something that HTC has done is spruced
up this screen so that when you have a
newer device like the touch pro2 and
you're running touchflo 3d you get a
nicer looking display here rather than
the dull windows mobile contact form
that hasn't been updated in ages or
really since the beginning so let's zoom
out again and take a look at some other
programs quickly that we have loaded
onto here such as Pocket word Pocket
word is hardly changed although it was
called Pocket word then now it's called
born mobile although word mobile can
read obviously 2007 file formats and
that sort of thing a really quick
reference to the keyboard this is the
only keyboard that you could get back in
the days of the Pocket PC but now you
have the HTC keyboard which is fantastic
and you can use your thumbs to type you
can turn it into landscape to get a wide
screen keyboard back in the days of
Pocket PC you had the tap tap keyboard
that you had the use with the stylus and
you really couldn't use your finger to
type here buttons were way too small
but this is really HTC's changes and
Microsoft is very fortunate that HTC is
a hardware partner and they've made all
of these changes to Windows Mobile to
really bring it up to speed to where
other mobile phone operating systems are
what I want to do now is kind of drill
into settings to see what settings are
the same and what's different and you're
gonna find that they're pretty much the
same it looks a little different on the
right here because the menu system has
been changed for 6.5 but we still get
personal system and connections and here
is personal system and connections so
we're gonna go to the system tab and we
get pretty much the same items we have
the about certificates and let's see the
difference in the about screen looks
about the same the tabs have been kind
of rounded off in windows mobile 6.5
that's one of the problems with windows
mobile 6.5 it doesn't go back to the
previous menu screen that you are in
before so we'll go back into system take
a look at memory here obviously
modern-day windows mobile devices have a
lot more free memory so we have 120
megabytes of free RAM which is great but
over here as you saw before we only have
five megabytes of free RAM and of course
this doesn't have flex crawling I just
tried to do flex scrolling if to use the
sidebar completely and totally and
impersonal you still give the same old
screen that you get for the did the
today's screen they actually brought it
out in one level so you can change the
theme of the today screen or you can go
to items and choose which items you want
to have on the on the today's screen and
obviously there are more that have been
added in this particular on this
particular device we've touched both 3d
and windows default which is titanium
and right now we have just the standard
Windows Mobile stuff turned on so
settings really hasn't changed the menus
to get into them look a little bit
different but at its core they are the
same settings that there were many years
ago
so overall at least from a visual
standpoint Windows Mobile or Pocket PC
hasn't changed that much in the last
nine years we still have the basic same
thing at its core although they're
running different versions of Windows CE
II although there's a lot of different
underlying technologies but visually
speaking they're very much similar which
is a good and a bad thing it's good
because developers have had a ton of
time to customize the interface you can
totally revamp the entire Windows Mobile
operating system to really be your own
but it's bad because a end user gets it
and they want something that looks
awesome out of the box and sometimes
Windows Mobile doesn't bring that unless
you're getting a touch pro2 or one of
the newer devices that has the whole
customization so we hope you enjoyed the
look at the old compact Ipek there's a
legendary device that really brought a
lot of change to the world of Windows
Mobile we're looking forward to the next
evolution of Windows Mobile as we see
the six point five point one or the
interim release before seven and of
course we're looking very much forward
to Windows Mobile 7 and all
the awesome hardware to come so that's
it for the look at the old Ipek 3650
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
