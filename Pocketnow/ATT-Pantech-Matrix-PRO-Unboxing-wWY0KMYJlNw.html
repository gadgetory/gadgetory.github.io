pocket now calm and this is the unboxing
of the new pantech matrix pro this is
the second windows mobile device ever to
have a dual slider design the first one
was the pantech duo and actually I'm
surprised that they didn't call this
device the pantech duo too but they went
with the name matrix pro instead it's a
windows mobile standard non touch screen
device and let's take a look all right
take a look at this box here pantera
pantech matrix pro dual sliding keypad
so 14 numbers and one for typing with
text okay 3.5 millimeter headphone
adapter see what it says on the side of
the box do a slider smartphone one as
well with 6.1 a gps video share all that
stuff let's take a look what's inside
the box looks like the Fox was ripped a
little bit and shipping so we have some
specifications on the top and a piece of
paper getting started guide which is in
color very nice and here's the device
itself will take a look at that in a
minute let's see what we have in the box
we have a battery that is of size 1320
milliamp hours which is pretty good size
actually for a non-touchscreen windows
mobile device we have a proprietary
charger that comes actually right from
the pantech duo and then we have that
convert converter cable for a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack insert your
matrix pro into the sleeve for
protection so we have a sleeve oh that's
good keep it away from sharp objects in
your pocket the backing to the battery a
sinking cable a lot of stuff in the box
and then we have some software and stuff
like that okay so let's take a look at
the device I've a feeling it's going to
be a very slick device the original
pantech duo
had a lot of problems with bill quality
hopefully that won't be the case with
this device so wow it's a very round it
actually feels like a pebble it's quite
thick almost as thick as the original
actually could be thicker now which is
one of the complaints with the device
Wow super slick it's just basically a
screen on the front I like the mirror
finish let's see if this is spring
assisted yep it is spring assisted the
buttons are completely flat which may be
difficult to be able to feel for them
with one hand let's see if this is
spring assisted yes great the original
pantech duo did not have a spring
assisted keyboard which made it feel
really cheap actually let me get the
battery in and put on the cover so we
can compare it to other devices alright
so we got the cover on again it's very
thick but it feels a lot better in hand
than the original pantech duo so I think
the increased build quality a lot and
let's take a look at it next to the HTC
touch pro it is not as tall but I think
it's actually going to be thicker this
the matrix pro is very very thick guys
that's going to be a big sticking point
let's look at it next to the black jack
to another windows mobile
non-touchscreen device and of course the
matrix pro is going to be much thicker
than that device it's got an interesting
kind of blue green paint on it so we'll
be back with more videos on the AT&amp;amp;T
pantech matrix pro keep it to
