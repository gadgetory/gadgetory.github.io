going to show you the new windows live
messenger app for the zune HD a lot of
people have been waiting for this and so
really nice so here we are and this is
my little icon up there you can see a
little closer and right below it I can
update my status type something there if
I tap the icon I have some cool options
it can change to a busier way or pure
offline I could sign out from any of the
other locations oh look at that that
means you've got multiple points of
presence so I can see I'm signed in on
zune my media center my TM 2 we can sign
out from anywhere and over this facebook
chat that's turned on all right let's go
back and we've got let's check out
options real quick show it's plain on so
my friends can see what I'm listening to
right now contacts or by status or name
messages emoticons time stamps yep while
that let's get back to
sounds mute all you've got all those
options measures you can turn those on
notifications one gotcha here with the
notifications is that if you close out
of messenger you know it stops totally
there aren't any notifications don't
come in or any of that so that's
unfortunate next let's show your friends
we have a list of friends and what's
nice is that you got groups at the top
so there's favorites recent facebook
friends myspace now he's there linkedin
you got a couple and back to all and we
double tap one of them we can see a chat
we can talk for them like that zoom in
that's kind of a focused in there
let's go back to chat and let's try
somebody else so that you can see you
know multiple this little button down
there that will give us a keyboard and
we can say hi and a response and you see
my other chat people are up here in the
pivot so now I can go back to him so you
can really easily toggle between
multiple chats right there so that's a
really good feature and we've got all
our Facebook people that's pretty nice
also oh you can also get your chats from
here there they are listed okay okay and
we also have social which is really cool
this is just like the windows live
messenger 2011 that was recently
released as well you got all your social
stuff here and look at that you go to
the plus button I can post comments so
those are some from facebook but it's
going to load them from all of the
social networks that i have aggregated
so you know things from linkedin or
myspace or Flickr or you know all sorts
of social networks are going to show up
here here's some pictures and do status
messages
we've got our little loading thing even
sorts links out so there's people who
post links and videos unfortunately if I
want to see this video I can't do
anything with that kid I tap it nothing
happens so that doesn't work here we're
back to highlights let's go back to me
so me is going to show stuff that i
posted there's a picture i just posted
on facebook that's pretty cool
alright so let's go back to my chats and
I'll just show you again this is all I
can do I can only type messages I only
have a keyboard there's no sending
pictures this is no voice clips or video
chat obviously with HD the zune doesn't
have a camera in it so I know that's
kind of pointless anyway but you only
have little uh you don't have a
emoticons either so that's unfortunate
but overall this is pretty nice live
messenger app for the zune HD and we can
get an idea of what might come through
in Windows Phone 7 anyway that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
