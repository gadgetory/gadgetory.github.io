ruled against the samsung galaxy note 7
leaks at the HTC bolt emerged in all of
its metallic glory and TT seems to be
ready for a larger axon seven max very
soon I'm hi Mary vera and once the
Department of Transportation gets
involved you can totally say that the S
has hit the fan this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
the Apple watch series 2 though not this
one the nike+ variant that a lot of
people have been waiting for st. price
tag and pretty much almost the same
watch only it's got the benefit of a new
nike band and some extra modules but
here's the thing those of you that were
waiting for it to launch in october it's
gonna launch on october 28 and if you're
a new customer you won't be able to buy
it on that date you'll actually have to
wait till november that's the case as
will the spotlight over to sony this is
a rather interesting piece of news
that's happening right now we heard that
Nintendo is launching their mobile games
and even though Sony tried to do the
same with Android only on the company's
xperia smartphones it seems that the
company is going to start its own
licensing scheme where the company plans
to bring PlayStation games into both iOS
and Android apparently we are getting
old titles that can no longer play on
PlayStation consoles and will also be
getting something new you know the only
problem is apparently we'll have to wait
until March 2018 that's far away one of
the most interesting smartphones of 2016
is the ZTE exon 7 mainly because it's a
flagship on the price tag of a premium
mid-ranger and we also got the exon 7
mini we love the speakers on both of
them but it seems that the company is
not done there there are leaked images
of a ZTE exon 7 max I guess it's got
dual cameras the only problem is that
well you get a six inch display that's
great but apparently it's a Snapdragon
650 to processor so it seems that it's
targeted to the premium mid-range as
well other very interesting leaks now in
photos have to do with the HTC bolt
famous tipster Evan Blass has been
covering this phone for a while it looks
a lot like the HTC tennis got
champers but it seems that it's going to
be a slimmer phone and there's even a
very interesting design for the USB
type-c port the only problems is that
number one apparently there is no boom
sound on this phone number 2 i'm
scrambling to find the headphone jack
but i could be wrong we'll see what we
get and finally the very hot news today
have to do with the samsung galaxy note
7 and the d-o-t aka the Department of
Transportation the United States as the
federal administration has just ruled
against travel for the galaxy note 7
meaning you can't carry it on your
carry-on you can't carry it with you you
can't check it in a bag you literally
cannot fly on a plane with that thing is
completely banned and for my experience
in my previous couple of jobs I do know
that if you try that means prison and
that also means a crazy fun at least for
hazardous materials when I came to
transportation it was twenty five
thousand dollars so yeah it seems that
the United States is really invested in
not allowing you to travel with this
phone I highly suggest that you switch
it mainly because at some point most
likely Samsung will just a bit of
software update that will simply not
allow you to use it but pay it leads me
to the question of the day is this the
last Domino on the table that will
simply just make you want to swap the
phone because in my case yeah I mean if
I literally can't travel with it and I
could get in trouble for doing so I
might as well just go switch it but
