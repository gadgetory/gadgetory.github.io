review with super high expectations the
OS 10 devices were improvements over
classic BlackBerry's and the probe with
it Schneider lens was an improvement
over the passport the key one is the
third phone made by TCL and the first
which doesn't look like Alcatel zidle so
does this partnership deliver a better
camera experience over blackberry
produced Hardware buckle up folks we've
got a lot of ground to cover and I'm
going to move pretty quick the claim to
fame here key one is using the same
image sensor as the one found in the
Google pixel a 12 megapixel shooter with
fairly large individual pixels and
though this phone is using a mid-range
or chipset it's still capable of
producing UHD video at 30 frames per
second starting off with some daylight
shots on the whole we managed crisp
colorful exposures but shots are nicely
sharpened without going overboard
we had some cloudy windy weather roll in
so key one was shooting in softer light
than we'd normally showcase for Los
Angeles earthy colors browns and greens
are produced well but our same
criticisms arrive when shooting warmer
colors in full auto yellow start to
smear a bit and reds aren't prone to
sizzling or turning magenta but we do
still see some color clipping where it's
hard to distinguish individual petals or
flowers happily key one required only a
fairly minor adjustment in this scene
for us to clearly see the difference
between these red and purple
Bougainville blossoms again for the
cloudy weather our normal white balance
tests are a bit off scenes around town
were a touch cooler than we normally
show and key1 produced that tone
consistently well for our few bright
patches of direct Sun the phone
appropriately dialed up a little extra
glow this white balance system though
tends to favor object color over
lighting especially at night where our
creepy gate doesn't showcase much of the
ugly yellow lights which watch this
scene unfortunately there is no raw
capture in app or any support to pull a
raw file from another app you're
shooting JPEG only which means you don't
have a huge safety net for fixing a shot
over exposing the scene by one stop
none of the info or texture of this wall
can be recovered and taking a quick look
at lens performance it would seem the
key one shares more than just a sensor
with the pixel it also inherits some of
that phone's lens flaring most
noticeable at night almost all lights
will have some JJ Abrams action
opening and every now and then you'll
catch a light at just the right angle to
streak your whole frame it's not as bad
as the pixel and happily we don't see
the same pronounced ring flare otherwise
fringing and ghosting are kept to a
minimum for high contrast areas this is
actually a pretty nice piece of glass
which should satisfy all but the most
ardent pixel peepers and we don't like
pixel peepers so that's fine
pushing the phone into macro territory
and again like the pixel key one
delivers really Pleasant bouquet for
your backgrounds this is on par with
many other high-end phones even slightly
nicer than what we might see from an
iPhone or a g6 considering the slight
deficit and aperture users shouldn't be
concerned about image composition here a
focus that this distance can be tricky
to pull off though and the phone has a
tendency to bounce you out of focus
while still reporting a lot it's a
single sensor phone so we shouldn't
expect miracles from the zoom but again
key one performs surprisingly well
pulling legible info out of small street
signs and at night cropping into this
restaurant this is pretty good not
really for a phone with no Hardware
stabilization in low light this is a
really good crop for video blackberry
also puts a resolution aware limit on
that zoom in UHD you don't get much
range to pull in but you also won't
overly sacrifice image quality the phone
has more pixels to play with an HD video
so we get a closer crop there returning
to the focus the word I keep coming back
to is bouncy
this autofocus has a really bouncy feel
to it the pulse through the focus range
puts you on pause for just a split
second while the phone locks and even in
video here you can see some of the
issues I had in trying to lock at closer
macro distances this action takes just
long enough that you can interrupt it
taking a photo before it fully locks all
while the phone shows you a green circle
another gripe I have with many phones
focus reporting positive when it
obviously doesn't have a lock BlackBerry
includes a mode to hold your shutter
until the focus is finished but it
introduces even more of a delay which I
feel will cause you to miss more shots
in the long run than just getting a feel
for how this Focus performs now it's not
often that I get to say this high
dynamic range photos are really well
balanced the key one unlike most
androids actually works to rein in
highlights while boosting shadows
the phone stacks a series of exposures
so that means movement can cause
ghosting or blurring it was a windy day
so a few shots were busted there but I'm
honestly impressed by this image
processing the only gripe is that it
occasionally works too well one of my
least favorite things about HDR in
general look at these white fluffy hazy
clouds and pulling down highlights those
white pretty day clouds start to look
like storm clouds this is not a problem
with the key one but with HDR in general
and why I never leave my phone in full
auto or HDR plus processing modes HDR at
night though is an exercise in patience
the phone really does layer longer
exposures and can seem unresponsive for
seconds while capturing a shot if you're
not prepared for it you'll blur your
photo by walking away before the phone
is finished
hand-holding HDR is tricky enough to get
blur free images so we'd recommend
sticking with the phone's normal night
mode processing instead unfortunately
the panorama game is decidedly
last-generation like the pixel I'm not a
fan of lining up these circles I've
never managed to complete a wide shot
without some major break-in stitching
and now it's time to talk about selfies
so the front shooter on the key one is a
capable performer which likely won't set
the world ablaze pics are a touch dull
and shaded shots were produced a bit
warmer than I would have liked video
similarly just felt a bit black and I
would really like to see more companies
use some software stabilization for
these front cameras
I think the vloggers in our audience
would really appreciate that the
exposure compensation is accurate maybe
a touch twitchy fast and how it makes
adjustments still I got to give
blackberry props here there are no auto
odo modes or beauty filters degrading
your face
this phone isn't built for the
fashionista crowd and it's not
pretending that it can fill that niche
here the area I was most concerned with
actually came out okay low light
performance was good - very good in most
of our night shots
we don't benefit from the crazy image
processing of a pixel but these photos
were not difficult to pull off we just
have to expect a bit more noise
reduction as the ISO climbs and slightly
longer shutter speeds but this manages
two best phones like the LG G six for
auto image processing even a rear camera
selfie this is a
rising Lee good shot which can almost
compete with some of our favorite
low-light chants
the downside this is not going to be a
subtle shooter for candid quick shots I
was able to pull this off at the
newsstand which is well lit but a darker
creeper shot at the restaurant just did
not work while trying to be discreet and
this completely falls apart when trying
to capture objects in very low light
this is a situation you just want to
throw your flash the key one uses a
mid-range or chipset but that doesn't
prevent it from shooting a respectably
high quality UHD video image integrity
texture and color processing are on
point this looks good and in bright
light you shouldn't have any problems
pulling a nice crispy eight megapixel
still exposure adjustments are snappy
quick and I was happy to see very few
dropped frames during most of our tests
night videos for the most part avoided
the trap of trying to push exposure to
bright we see a very mature balance
between saturation brightness and
keeping noise in check these bigger
pixels do a very good job of soaking up
light of course as you may have noticed
during these video tests there is no
Hardware lens stabilization so all of
these UHD videos are doing a terrific
job of showing off how I'll never be a
surgeon with these shaky hands dropping
down to 1080p video retreated to some
excellent software stabilization very
satisfying performance here which again
provides evidence to my hypothesis that
hybrid hardware and software
stabilization is more destructive to
video quality than just using one or the
other
like other software systems though key
one can sometimes have some issues when
you're trying to hold still an issue
we've also run into on iPhones and
pixels the phone might overcompensate on
that crop stabilization leading to some
unnecessary squirmy adjustments taking a
listen to the audio performance and
video we shouldn't be surprised that a
blackberry would have decent microphones
on board upper mid pack and delivering
very good dynamic range in stereo
separation
as a special note because of the windy
conditions I'm very impressed by the
restraint on this wind filtering
balancing the roar of wind against the
traffic noise for individual vehicles
without becoming a mess of noise
reduction warbling very well done here
there is a 720p slow-motion mode which
delivers a very smooth and fluid video
but image quality is reduced enough that
it starts to resemble a comic-book
filter honestly better than I thought it
would be I mean LG could even learn a
few things here but probably not a fun
feature you'll turn to very often on
this phone taking a quick tour around
the app this is nicely refined software
over previous blackberries which does a
surprisingly good job of keeping you
focused on your photography main modes
above your shutter filters above that
switching cameras below and of course
the shortcut to your gallery on the left
hand side flash toggle timer aspect
ratio HDR and remaining settings these
are all well laid out but I wish they
would toggle in place instead of pulling
out another target for your finger to
hit I also have to point out the
remaining settings are on a bright white
page completely removed for your
viewfinder it's a pet peeve of mine I
never want to be removed from my
composition window in manual mode a
switch will pull up settings from the
bottom to adjust focus shutter speed ISO
white balance and exposure just a bummer
that the maximum shutter speed is only a
half second long so no light painting or
streaking tail shots here while the
keyboard might force a bit of a reach to
use on-screen controls it is used to
great effect for adjusting exposure
where these sliders can often feel
sluggish they might lag or they might
slide too quickly sliding across the
keyboard has a terrific feel and ties
quite accurately to your exposure meter
this is really easy to dial in small
brightness adjustments it's
fantastically well done first setting
more people should be using to help
improve their output plus using the
spacebar as a backup to your shutter
button is a nice ergonomic consideration
this layout is very well considered just
because I want access to manual controls
doesn't mean I want to switch modes just
to activate an HDR photo in video I just
took it for
that I have to go into settings to
change resolution and framerate but you
can switch it right here from this icon
something Apple could learn from and for
all the worry I had about the mid-range
chipset app launching and recycling
times have been better than I thought
they would be the occasional Android
inconsistencies the odd lag or hitch
while the phone was chewing on something
else in the background but on the whole
I saw performance which did a capable
job of hanging with more powerful phones
so let's wrap this up where's that leave
us with the camera on the BlackBerry key
one
damn I love seeing progress these TCL
partnered devices are another step in
the right direction for blackberry
camera performance
- Google's crazy image processing tracks
I had fairly low expectations for the
performance here
a camera is more than just its sensor
but for almost every situation the key
one not only exceeded my admittedly low
expectations but proved to be a capable
competitor will this be a top phone
camera of the year probably not but it
really didn't need to be we just had to
know that this wouldn't feel like a
severe compromise against other premium
mid-range errs that's an important point
for me to underscore it might not win
many battles against a 1 + 3 T for
example but multimedia is not a primary
focus of this phone TCL has been pretty
clear about what audience this device
targets but they haven't forgotten that
just because this is a business phone
and option to be found in a corporate IT
catalog that users won't want capable
photo and video performance
acknowledging some foibles it's not only
capable it can be a fun shooter to use
in many situations once you get a feel
for its hardware I rarely felt the
desire to put it down and use another
phone during these photo tests this was
one of the classic mistakes of
BlackBerry's past all work and no play
the key one doesn't completely fix that
work play balance but it gets us a hell
of a lot closer as always thanks so much
