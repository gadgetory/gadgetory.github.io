their music service the Nokia Lumia 610
spotted recently and why would you ever
want to run Windows Mobile on your
Windows Phone 7 hardware all this and
more coming up right now
hello we're when I'm high never be
better with packing out common welcome
to Windows Phone view the show we wrap
up all this week's good and bad inside
the world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's start this week off
what's good well there's a lot of talk
about nokia this week so let's get that
off our backs first of all we have to
leak devices apparently we have a Lumia
730 and alumina is 610 which plan to be
budget devices nothing really compelling
coming to the table but again I know
price is a proper many so that would
probably be an option eventually we also
have this leaked image of a nokia x7
which i'm definitely calling a fake i
mean there are a lot of concept nokia
device images out there and this pretty
much just seems to be another one
probably just made by an enthusiast
though a lot of things could happen this
year it could probably be true you never
know so that's the reason why it's in
the show but again this is probably
Nokia's year for lumia devices let's see
if they come up with some Lumia x7 in
the future because if the 710 is out and
the 800th out and the 900th out I mean
which other numbers coming and while
moving on over to LG after the league
renders recently we've gotten out images
of the LG miracle which plants to be a
miracle apparently though we're not
really sure that's going to happen don't
expect something really big from LG I
mean this is the same typical windows
phone mango specs wvga screen with the
typical one point something gigahertz
processor and that's pretty much it it
even brings only 8 gigabytes of storage
and apparently obviously it won't be
able to be expanded so sadly it's too
bad to see that LG really doesn't get
the memo regarding the fact that we're
expecting something bigger out there
from LG not necessarily just something
that matches up to other devices out
there that are more into the mid-tier
not really high-end devices will see now
that's what's coverage machine catch
Adam lanes recent xbox live preview of
why chickens can't fly and before you
look at me funny it's a game just watch
the video it looks kind of cool and a
lil aside from that Facebook recently
got an update so Adam also from the
video of the good things that are coming
with the app because hey they made a lot
of good moves with that app that they
needed to make like a couple of months
ago so
they comparing to watch before we get to
the bad section somebody finally was
able to get screenshots of Windows Phone
tango and yeah believe it or not the
cool thing here is the fact that they
got screen shots out of windows phone's
operating system but the problem is that
they got screenshots of Windows Phone
tango and well they were trying to
install in that from the marketplace and
sadly it responded as the device didn't
have enough RAM to run the application
excuse me now think about this if we've
already got the samsung focus flash
which is a budget device with all the
specs thing you need to run every app in
the marketplace what's the point about
tangle bringing lower RAM on devices if
they're not going to be able to run all
the applications I mean talk about
fragmentation that's going to be really
bad that doesn't preclude let's continue
on with what's bad and we'll call this a
rumor but apparently Microsoft is out
there shopping with record companies to
bring out a new music service am
question is why I mean they already got
the zune serves sure they ditch their
devices already but zoom's offer is
actually really cool in a lot of us are
fans of the zune pass so not really sure
what's going on there with Microsoft but
apparently they're trying to figure out
a way to bring something different out
to the table something that works with
Windows 8 Windows Phone whatever 78 or
whatever comes out and i'll show the
xbox since apparently spotify already
does that so not really sure when that's
gonna happen or if it will happen but
it's really sad news because as long as
they figure out to do that with this
whole zoom past thing i don't really
mind and hey recent video has just been
published where we show windows mobile
6.1 working on windows phone 7 hardware
and well it's hey this is coming from a
guy that comes from the Pocket PC era I
mean it's cool but sadly I mean it's
really late it would be good if we had
more devices windows mobile devices all
devices running Windows Phone 7
operating systems but going back to
Windows Mobile is not really good the
only really good thing here is the fact
that it apparently is an application
within windows phone 7 meaning you can
have when those phones having to be
booted and then
run windows mobile as sort of an
application that's pretty much the only
good thing there that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high never be better remember to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now
