their music service the Nokia Lumia 610
spotted recently and why would you ever
want to run Windows Mobile on your
Windows Phone 7 hardware all this and
more coming up right now hello we're
when I'm high memory when I was packing
out on common welcome to Windows Phone
view the show we wrap up all this week's
good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform let's
start this week off with what's good
well there's a lot of talk about Nokia
this week so let's get that off our
backs first of all we have two leaked
devices apparently we have a Lumia 730
and a loonie is 610 which plans to be
bunch of devices nothing really
compelling coming to the table but again
I know price is a problem for many so
that would probably be an option
eventually we also have this leaked
image of a Nokia x7 which I'm definitely
calling a fake I mean there are a lot of
concept nokia device images out there
and this pretty much just seems to be
another one probably just made by an
enthusiast though a lot of things could
happen this year it could probably be
true you never know so that's the reason
why it's in the show but again this is
probably Nokia's year for Lumia devices
let's see if they come up with some
Lumia x7 in the future because if the
710 is out and the 800th out and the
900th out I mean which other numbers
coming and while moving on over to LG
after the leak renders recently we've
gotten out images of the LG miracle
which plans to be a miracle apparently
though we're not really sure that's
gonna happen don't expect something
really big from LG I mean this is the
same typical Windows Phone mango specs
WVGA screen with the typical one point
something gigahertz processor and that's
pretty much it it even brings only eight
gigabytes of storage and apparently
obviously it won't be able to be
expanded so sadly it's too bad to see
that LG really doesn't get the memo
regarding the fact that we're expecting
something bigger out there from LG not
necessarily just something that matches
up to other devices out there that are
more into the mid tier not really
high-end devices we'll see
now that's which coverage machine catch
Adam Lang's recent xbox live preview of
why chickens can't fly and before you
look at me funny it's a game just watch
the video it looks kind of cool and will
aside from that Facebook recently got an
update so Adam also from the video of
the good things that are coming with the
app because hey they made a lot of good
moves with that app that they needed to
make like a couple of months ago so
really compelling to watch before we get
to the bad section somebody finally was
able to get screenshots of Windows Phone
tango and yeah believe it or not the
cool thing here is the fact that they
got screenshots out of Windows Phones
operating system but the problem is that
they got screenshots of Windows Phone
tango and well they were trying to
install an app from the marketplace and
sadly it responded as the device didn't
have enough RAM to run the application
excuse me now think about this if we've
already got the Samsung Focus flash
which is a budget device with all the
specs that you need to run every app in
the marketplace what's the point about
tangle bringing lower RAM on devices if
they're not going to be able to run all
the applications I mean talk about
fragmentation that's gonna be really bad
that doesn't really good let's continue
on with what's bad and we'll call this a
rumor but apparently Microsoft is out
there shopping with record companies to
bring out a new music service and
question is why I mean they already got
the Zune service
sure they ditched their devices already
but zoom software is actually really
cool in a lot of us are fans of the zoom
past so not really sure what's going on
there with Microsoft but apparently
they're trying to figure out a way to
bring something different out to the
table something that works with Windows
8 Windows Phone whatever 7/8 or whatever
comes out and I'll show the Xbox since
apparently Spotify already does that so
not really sure when that's gonna happen
or if it will happen but it's really sad
news because as long as they figure out
how to do that with this whole zoom pass
thing I don't really mind and hey recent
video has just been published where we
show windows mobile 6.1 working on
Windows Phone 7 hardware and well it's
hey this is coming from a guy that comes
the pocket PC era I mean it's cool but
sadly I mean it's really late it would
be good if we had more devices Windows
Mobile devices old devices running
Windows Phone 7 operating systems but
going back to Windows Mobile is not
really good the only really good thing
here is the fact that it apparently is
an application within Windows Phone 7
meaning you can have when those phones
having to be booted and then run Windows
Mobile as sort of an application that's
pretty much the only good thing there
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high metal
you better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
