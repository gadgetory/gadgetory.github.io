massive battery begin to emerge iPad
protesting has already begun according
to some data logs and Android wear watch
phase options are about to get a lot
cooler I'm hi Mary vera and this cold
does not go away by tomorrow I'll have
to get me some tequila this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with Google you should be getting an
update to your Android wear SmartWatch
today or in the next few days and the
update will allow interactive watch
faces to work on your device meeting you
can press the display and go change into
something different or allow you to
shortcut to applications through
gestures or whatever it all depends on
developers it all depends on the options
that are there we can't wait to give it
a try we'll keep you posted other
official news come from gartner analysts
for those of you that are wondering
exactly how the smartphone market is
behaving lately we all know that it is
slowing down mainly because the economy
is not at its best depending on the
country go to China particularly but if
you're wondering which company is
selling more right now well this is a
very interesting point Apple has grown
thirty-six percent in sales when it
comes to the iphone year over a year
compared to samsung which is still the
current smartphone king but has actually
declined in sales 5.3 percent so yet
even though Samsung is still selling
more smartphones that's because they
have more smartphones they serve more
markets they cater to other different
demographics compared to apple but it's
just shocking to see that iphones
continue to sell biam the most expensive
smartphones out there and they're not
being affected by the problems with the
economy now let's talk about Intel and
Microsoft both companies have just begun
working on a very interesting project
that will allow you to wake your windows
send computer through voice commands and
yeah that voice command will be a
Cortana we're not sure exactly what
specific hardware you will need from
Intel for this to work but most likely
what you will need to do next year
whenever you want to renew your
computers look ahead for Intel
processors as hopefully that is
compatible with devices that are being
sold right now
soon but yeah the idea is that your
computer will be on deep sleep you will
say hey Cortana and it'll wake up as
your power button let's just see what we
get and speaking of Microsoft we've got
some trusted sources claiming that the
company is planning a major launch event
in October and yeah I said launch oven
not announcement because apparently the
company might still announced its new
Louis and the surface pro 4 and the
Microsoft band two on either Aoife or
ctia the company's actually sponsoring
these events but it could be that we
will not get these products until
October or it could just be that
Microsoft will just blows off and have
something for October and that will be
it it's really hard to predict with
Microsoft is planning to do but Aoife is
just around the corner we will keep you
posted and finally for the very hot news
of the day for those of you that are
disappointed with the galaxy note5
because it's not the powerhouse that you
were expecting there are rumors that
Samsung is already working on a more
powerful active version now hear me out
here we only know two things about this
device right now number one ip68
waterproofing which is great and number
two that it will sport a massive 4100
milliamp hour battery which would be
great now we don't know if it'll have
expandability in any way or anything yet
but hey it leads me to the question of
the day do the rumors of an act the
variant will make you want to wait for
that or are you just getting the current
galaxy note 5 or any other smartphone
leave us a comment down below tell us
what you think in my case hey if they
make that thing ugly I would rather
stick to the current note friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the nose earlier before this video
