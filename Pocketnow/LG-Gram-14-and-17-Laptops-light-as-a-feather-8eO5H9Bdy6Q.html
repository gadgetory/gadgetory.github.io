think back to just how heavy that thing
was this laptop is going to completely
change your perception of it this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is a look at
two new LG Graham laptops here at CES
2019 okay we're going to start off with
these smaller LG Graham 14 this is
actually a 2 in 1 laptop meaning it can
fold on to itself thanks to a 360 degree
hinge the touchscreen is really
responsive and it is full HD resolution
so you're not going to be getting
anything beyond perhaps the standard on
laptops especially for a 14 inch laptop
but it does have full windows
capabilities along with a tablet mode
that automatically triggers when you
fold the LG gramme onto itself the
internals include an eighth gen intel
core processor and comes with either 256
gigabytes or 512 gigabytes of
solid-state storage now the product
manager for these two laptops told us
that they still believe that integrated
graphics could still work well for most
people out there and most people is
definitely the term you're not going to
be doing much photo or video editing on
these and if you do it might be just a
bit too much for the processor package
you have inside now one thing that is
nice about both of these laptops not
just the 17-inch but also this 14 inch
laptop that you might be moving around a
lot because of its 360 degree hinge is
that they have the milspec standard for
durability and true to the name LG gram
the LG gram 14 is really light at only
2.5 pounds you do get a bevy of ports
including an HDMI port but as you can
see there you also have to use a
proprietary charger as there's still a
port for it you only have to give a
little bit more weight to it to get to
the LG gram 17 now think about that for
a second it's below three pounds in a
weight and yet you can weigh more screen
and there's a lot that's going on here
that might make this a very interesting
probably the most interesting 17 inch
laptop I've seen as of late the 17 inch
screen is a 2560 by 1600 panel that's a
16 by 10 aspect ratio it should be ideal
for image and video editing which is
true a 17 inch laptop generally has to
be considered a desktop replacement but
one thing you have to know about the LG
gram 17 is that it also does not come
with dedicated graphics it's still
integrated
still has the eighth generation intel
core processor but without dedicated
graphics you're going to have to rely on
one of those USB seaports which do
support thunderbolt so I guess in that
sense you can look at this laptop as a
desktop replacement you can have the
large screen there along with the
keyboard which also has that power bond
with the fingerprint in it and you also
get a number pad on there as is to be
expected on a large body like this you
can fit even more keys on the keyboard
so you have that on your desk and then
you connect an e GPU for example into
the Thunderball port to get the
capabilities that you don't have
otherwise and all of that in something
that is almost three pounds like it's
crazy to think that you can just pick
this up with your two fingers and you
can be secure and knowing you're not
gonna drop it because it's so heavy the
17 inch laptop will set you back sixteen
hundred and ninety nine dollars while
the two and one convertible will be
$14.99 the metal bodies do make it feel
more premium than your average but you
might want to consider with the LG gram
17 that you still have to buy something
like an e GPU in order to get the best
capabilities out of it thankfully that
Thunderball port will help out but it is
a bit of a steep price to ask let us
know if you would buy these laptops I
mean they are the lightest 17 inch and
14 inch laptops I have ever used which
itself is a great little gimmick and it
also leads to even better portability
but if that's not enough for you let us
know why in the comments down below stay
tuned to PocketNow for all of our CES
coverage and also subscribe to the

you can keep up with all of our videos
and we will see you next time for even
more on CES 2019</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
