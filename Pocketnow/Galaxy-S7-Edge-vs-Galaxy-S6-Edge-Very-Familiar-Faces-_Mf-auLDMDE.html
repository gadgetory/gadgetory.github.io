difference between both of these devices
we could not agree more
I'm Jaime Rivera with pocket now we're
pointing from MWC 2016 in Barcelona with
a quick show for comparison between the
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and the galaxy s6
edge+
brought to you by deep brand
if you just spend top dollar buying the
galaxy s6 edge+ this past holiday season
we don't blame you for being upset
Samsung's announcement of the galaxy s7
edge that looks almost identical to last
year's phablet just leads to a lot of
confusion even though there are some
significant differences for starters the
company did make a smart move in making
the edge variant a tad larger than the
regular galaxy s7 since the curved
design feels smaller and lighter in the
hand regardless of which device you're
holding it's hard to deny that both
devices are gorgeous at a distance and
feel very premium in the hand if you're
the type that likes to grab attention
and the publicly your device either of
these is a rather the way to go
aesthetically both devices are nearly
identical really if it wasn't because
the galaxy s7 edge has a slightly
smaller display you wouldn't be able to
tell them apart from the metallic trim
to the glass front and back to even the
placement of the buttons these devices
are pretty much almost the same thing
say for the few microscopic differences
that you really have to nitpick to find
there's this interesting curve where the
glass meets the aluminum on the new unit
that you didn't really see on last
year's model and if you didn't like how
the galaxy s6 edge+ stood out from the
crowd when it came to the camera hump
Department all that got fixed with this
new variant now to be fair the
differences between them is rather
significant when you look internally the
new galaxy s7 is ip68 water and dust
resistant compared to none of these in
the larger cousin there's also no 64 gig
option in the newer galaxy s7 but the
newer model marks the return of
expandable storage be an extended sentry
which doesn't exist in last year's unit
you'd say both devices share the same
gorgeous display but this newer model
provides users with an always-on mode as
well something you didn't see in the
past in addition to that the new Exynos
88-90 or Snapdragon 820 processors also
include a liquid cooling system and our
able to perform 30% faster along with
60% in boost of performance in the GPU
though both of these units have the same
amount of RAM and even if it's harder to
believe this new Galaxy s7 sports a
larger 3600 milliamp hour battery
compared to the 3000 milliamp hour
battery of last year's phablet now even
though we praised the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge+ for its camera Samsung claims that
this newer model has a better one it
starts with a brighter F 1.7 aperture
lens compared to last year's F 1 point 9
and even though there are more
megapixels in last year's sensor this
newer model sports a 12 megapixel camera
in which each megapixel is actually
larger than the previous unit allowing
for more light and also for faster
focusing though again these are things
that we would have to test in the real
world other enhancements come in the
form of the software and what it allows
them to do the newer Galaxy S seven runs
TouchWiz on top of android 6.0.1
marshmallow and while differences are
not really aesthetic they are in
functionality with the old galaxy s6
edge+
what you could do with the edge was
really limited to two panes with the
just contacts in an app launcher with
the new galaxy s7 edge the new edge
returns to some of the old elements of
the Galaxy Note edge from two years ago
with third-party edge features
enhancements for contact lists quick
actions and much more it's designed to
augment your experience with the phone
and it does so rather well even if you
could say that the software on the show
floor unit is still not final overall
even though the galaxy s7 edge is a far
superior device in specs and paper it's
not like if the old galaxy s6 edge+
wasn't still a great phone already it
would be hard to call any of these a
winner but our full review in
comparisons coming in the next few weeks
