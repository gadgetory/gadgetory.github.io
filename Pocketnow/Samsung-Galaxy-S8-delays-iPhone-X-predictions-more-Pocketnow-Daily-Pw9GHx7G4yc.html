interesting hurdles with the production
of the galaxy as eight analysts predict
that Apple is still not done with iPads
and Apple watches at least when it comes
to variants it seems that we actually
will be getting another HTC device later
this year I'm hi meri behna and that yes
tomorrow we will all be out because we
will be covering the Samsung event here
in New York City but stay tuned for all
the coverage for now this is parking out
daily the official news today are not
official actually let's go through leaks
famous tips for Evan glasses at it again
this time with HTC as it seems that the
company is not done there is another HTC
you coming and this time it's codename
ocean and we covered the league's of the
ocean for a while but this time
apparently this will be the successor to
the HTC 10 Snapdragon 835 processor a
design that looks a lot like a little
pixel we do notice dual cameras here and
there delhi we can't include the video
in this clip for some reason i'm having
a hard time getting it but what i will
tell you is that it does include some
sort of a new HTC Sense user interface
that's based on the edges even though
this is not a curve display so we can't
wait to see what we get apparently it
will happen in early May and for those
of you that thought that this new iPad
was the only ipad it seems that no Apple
is working on another iPad pro we heard
of a possible 10.5 inch very small bezel
like ipad that will bring pretty much
the same for factor at least in size
from the 9.7 inch ipad pro and the only
thing is apparently it will happen in
mid-april and even though we do have
invitations already for WWDC that's
happening in june analysts predict that
it will be announced earlier so stay
tuned for that and speaking of analysts
we've got some trusted ones that are
claiming two things to happen number one
is that there will be an lte-capable
Apple watch series 3 to the announced it
could happen at that WWDC event that's
happening in June but the second one is
that apparently this iphone next is
going to bring some major changes and
some things won't change one of these
'verily will be lightning so for those
of you that are upset over all the
fragmentation that Apple has right now
it dongles are just out everything that
it has even between its own products
that's not over that's where the
spotlight over to Samsung as we hear
that samsung galaxy s eight might be
constrained and supplies at the
beginning you might want to rush and get
your unit whenever pre-orders begin
mainly because apparently samsung is
struggling with its 10 nanometer chips
and it won't be able to produce enough
to meet demand I have to remember that
Ella's predicted that the galaxy s 8
won't be of crazy cells comparison to
previous galaxies mainly because
apparently this phone doesn't bring
anything hard to the market I defer from
that obviously we will let you know more
as we learn more tomorrow at the event
and finally very hot news they have to
do with the funk phone apparently coming
back from the dead let's talk about the
galaxy note 7 we've seen more news that
claimed this phone will be revived
refurbished and sold in other countries
I have ignored these news to include
them in the daily because they've come
back and forth this time apparently
we've got some very trusted claims that
seem to say that it won't come to the
United States it will be launched in
certain markets not just india and
apparently it will have a name change
which is interesting but it leads me to
the question of today tell me this if
you had the option to buy a galaxy note
7 again would you buy it or not Oh in my
case I love the note 7 I miss it I would
be seriously considering it but anyways
leave us a comment down below we love to
know your opinion brands you love the
way it goes if you want to get the news
