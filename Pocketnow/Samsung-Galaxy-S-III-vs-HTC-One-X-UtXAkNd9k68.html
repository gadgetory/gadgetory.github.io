and today we have a special face up for
you this time
it's Samsung's flagship the Samsung
Galaxy s3 versus HTC's hottest film the
HTC One X we're gonna do lots of
comparisons application launches
benchmarks internet browsing gaming and
a special comparison between the two
screens and camera quality so don't go
anywhere
it's Anton it's pocket now and it's face
of time we have the HTC One X on the
left and the samsung galaxy s3 on the
right and we're gonna kick off today's
face off with a boot up test which will
not be a fair one because HTC is
employing fastboot on the HTC One X
which of course can be disabled from the
settings but HTC has put it there for a
certain reason so let's take a look at
this and three two one go
and the one that should be a clear
winner here but once you disable the
fastboot feature it will boot up even
slower than the galaxy s3 so this was
HTC with the fastboot feature and the
galaxy s3 is coming in second lagging in
about seven or eight seconds for a
normal 17 18 second boot up time so here
they are both usable homescreen a clear
winner here the HTC One X let's talk
specifications both of these phones are
their respective company's flagship
devices they both have been launched
this year the One X at MVCC in February
and the galaxy s3 in May at the
beginning in London the HTC One X is
powered by 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
NVIDIA Tegra 3 SOC it has 1 gigabyte of
ram 32 gigs of internal storage with no
possibility of expanding so you cannot
add a microSD card to it 4.7 inch Super
LCD to display with an HD resolution of
720 by 1280 8 megapixel camera 1.3
megapixel front-facing Android 4.0 ICS
out-of-the-box and HTC Sense
for point on top of it the Samsung
Galaxy s3 is powered by a 1.4 gigahertz
quad core Exynos processor made by
Samsung itself with one gigs of RAM and
16 gigs of internal storage this one can
be expanded with a microSD card but you
can also go with 32 and 64 gig varieties
of the phone which should be available
soon the screen is 4.8 inch
it's an HD Super AMOLED screen of 720 by
1280 pixels in resolution the camera is
8 megapixels webcam is 1.9 it's running
Android 4.0 ICS out of the box and it
has TouchWiz 5.0 aka TouchWiz UX nature
on top of it so in terms of RAM in terms
of camera and in terms of the operating
system these two perform the same a
quick word of note at the beginning both
of these films have been reset to their
factory defaults and applications have
been mirrored so whatever there's on the
One X you will find it on the galaxy s3
and vice versa no applications running
in the background and screen brightness
is set to maximum so it's 100% on both
which will be interesting to see in our
screen comparison now let's go to a day
to day slash real time usage application
launch test let's start with the mail a
little bit faster on the One X let's go
to Google Play Store application was
launched faster on the One X but content
was loaded faster on the galaxy s3 let's
go to the gallery application faster on
the One X but only because the Galaxy s3
is using animations to load the images
let's go to third-party application like
Spotify pretty much the same let's kick
off Maps
head-to-head which Moloch's in first
galaxy s3 locks in first HTC One X Luxan
second let's jump out let's go to social
applications like Facebook and Google+
it was quite instant on the galaxy s3
and at 1 by 2 seconds let's go to
Google+
they're going head-to-head so it's faith
fair to assume that let's see who knows
the galaxy came in second okay
one more let's fire up the camera
application the HTC One X 1 again so
this concludes our short real-time slash
application launch comparison let's take
a look at benchmarks we will start with
quadrant fast around the s3 and let's
start the test on both of them and
they're both approaching the end of the
test let's see which one performed
better
according to quadrant let's see the
results and let's see the results we
have 50 to 94 on the galaxy s3 and we
have 46 0-3 on the HTC One X let's
continue with another benchmark this
time and to do fast around the s3 this
was a previous result from yesterday's
comparison with the galaxy s2 but let's
start the test while these two are added
let's mention that the One X features
three capacitive buttons one for Test
Manager one for home and one for back
but they have emitted a menu button so
whenever an application will need a menu
button it will place it right here on
the screen taking away from your screen
real estate well you can see there's
much more information displayed on the
Samsung Galaxy s3 which has a dedicated
menu button but let's get back to the
bench market so the One X has finished
and the galaxy s3 should finish just in
a couple of seconds we have ten thousand
three hundred and forty three points on
the left on the One X and there's some
aberration here on the antutu benchmark
yesterday when we compared it to the
galaxy s2 we got some twelve hundred
score here but today the application and
- - under galaxy s3 captain crashing so
which is gonna leave it at that if you
compare it to yesterday's numbers it was
twelve thousand here compared to ten
thousand three hundred and forty three
no conclusion John about this let's get
back to the home screen and let's try
one more benchmark it's going to be
smart bench 2012 so let's see this one
HTC One X again finished first let's
take a look at the scores let's bring it
up here up and close we got 40 let's
zoom in more 4208 with 2680 and the
galaxy s3 is still running it just
finished
let's display the scores on this one 39
77 1635 the HTC One X has won this round
and this concludes our look at
benchmarks we'll get back to you with
browser comparison let's go to
pocketnow.com and let's go to the galaxy
s3 tag page the s3 is ahead 1x not too
far behind
as three finished 1x finished right
after it let's go to the home page
s3 is again ahead 1x1 second behind s3
finished 1x still loading
and still loading so we should probably
give this round to the galaxy s3 without
any doubt even if it's faster only by up
to one second let's stop it right there
and we're gonna input another webpage
let's go to the full version of the and
gadget website galaxy s3 leading a
little bit and the finished first HTC
One X it helped finish second so this
round goes to get Samsung Galaxy s3 by
one or two seconds depending on the
complexity of the website scrolling as
you can see is buttery smooth on the
galaxy s3 and it's also smooth on the
galaxy on the HTC One X I'm sorry double
tapping now works it had a hiccup but
once you zoom in the HTC is flowing the
text so that you don't have to scroll
all the way as opposed to the galaxy s3
which doesn't do that double tap to zoom
back out and this is probably the reason
while after zooming in or zooming out
the HTC is acting a little bit slower
because it basically rearranges the text
on the page so if you zoom in like this
on the galaxy s3 you will see text
coming from out of the screen well when
you zoom too much in on the HTC One X it
just rearranges and flows the text
nicely so in terms of usability of the
internet browser this round goes to the
HTC One X ok let's get back next up is
gaming same game again is GTA 3 let's
launch it at the same time
just a tad faster on the galaxy s3 now
these are videos we can skip them more
videos
and let's see the loading time of a new
game it's faster on the galaxy s3 by one
to two and something second ok let's
keep the visuals and let's try to play a
couple of frames on both not too much
and let's start with the galaxy s3 my
driving skills while playing are not
better than yesterday shall expect me to
hit the walls the buttery smooth no
frames skipping so everything is working
as it should on the galaxy s3 there we
had a slight hiccup and one more here
but else its move let's get back out of
this and let's see the HTC One X
volume up whoops so this one this one is
smooth too but I don't know why I had
the feeling that as far as framerate is
concerned the Galaxy s3 was a little bit
smoother I don't know by a couple of
frames but now it seems to have
recovered I can't say the same about my
driving and yeah that's a replay so in
terms of gaming performance I would say
that the Galaxy s3 is a little bit
better because I have that feeling it
renders the game with a higher frame
rate now game settings were the same on
both devices maximum resolution maximum
detail everything maxed out so we'll
give this round to the Samsung Galaxy s3
and now we will take a look at how the
screens compared the SLCD 2 versus the
HD super amoled now in terms of screen
quality it could go both ways
basically these two right here are the
best screens on the market right now of
course the Apple iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s
screen comes in a second if these are
the top ones now let's see how they
compare color on the One X is a little
bit warmer while color on the galaxy s3
is a little bit cooler so you will see a
bluish greenish tint on the galaxy s3
because it's an AMOLED screen opposed to
the SLC d2 on the HTC One X it's gonna
be a little bit warmer a little bit more
reddish because it's an LCD screen now
in terms of color accuracy and
reproduction both reproduce the colors
very well as you can see here the greys
are more neutral on the SLCD 2 as
opposed to the galaxy s3 where the greys
are not neutral but are a little bit
tinted and if we take a look at natural
color tones skin tones you will again
see that the 1x has better color
representation which doesn't mean that
the screen on the galaxy s3 is not good
it comes down to your personal
preference if you like deep blacks then
you will definitely go for the galaxy s3
and you will probably also like the high
contrast if you like more natural colors
you will love the SLC d2 on the HTC One
X we have one more image to show you
this one right here let's go into
landscape clearly the AMOLED screen wins
here because it represents blacks better
but as you can see there's not such a
huge difference again you will see a
difference and chones warmer on the 1x
cooler on the galaxy s3 our last part of
our comparison will be a comparison
between the camera quality of these two
phones I will insert it right now after
this footage this was answered the
United Front pocketnow.com if you've
enjoyed this video please give us a
thumbs up conclusion which one would I
pick I would pick a perfect Android
phone which would be the combination
between the two maybe the speed of the
galaxy s3 with the HTC Sense 4.0 and the
camera from the galaxy s3 because I have
to pick one I will pick the galaxy s3
but that doesn't mean that the HTC One X
is not a good phone it's an excellent
phone so it could really go both ways
take a look at the camera quality and
decide for yourself thank you very much
again for watching hey everyone it's a
bright sunny day here and oh god it's a
little bit weak and we're up in the park
checking out the video quality on the
HTC One X as well as the Samsung Galaxy
s3 now the audio which you will hear
will be the audio from the Samsung
Galaxy s3 and we'll try to record the
same image on both
let's see some white bells modifications
a little bit of batting around and now
we'll switch to a darker region
there we go let's try to lose some
close-ups let's try to get close to one
of these roses here this one should be
in the shade right there and this one
should be well lit
and once again
and let's turn around to go into the
shades once more
and that's pretty much it this wasn't a
pocketnow.com taking a look at the
comparison between the HTC One X and the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in terms of video
recording capability thank you very much
for watching
