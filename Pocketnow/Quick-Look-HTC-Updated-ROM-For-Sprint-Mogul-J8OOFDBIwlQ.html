a quick look at HTC's new rom for the
sprint mogul
on Monday March 10 HTC released a new
rom updating a couple of things on
Sprint's device before I go through some
of these enhancements let me show you
what the current rom version is if we go
to settings another the system tab we go
to Device information mostly that the
current rom version is 3.3 5.65 1.2 with
a rom date of februari 22nd 2008 current
mobile users can go to HTC's us website
and download this file the file itself
is about 60 megabytes and takes about 10
to 15 minutes to install now before
doing the rom upgrade make sure that
you've synced up your contacts your
calendar items your tasks and backed up
any applications that you have as this
upgrade process will wipe out everything
that's currently on the device so what
does this upgrade do well the first
thing it does is it enhances the phones
radio from EV do revision 02 evdo
revision a what does that mean for you
current users well under revision 0
there was a theoretical max birth rate
of 2.4 five megabits per second revision
a upset first rate to about 3.1
megabytes now in real world usage you'll
probably see something around 400 to 700
kilobytes per second but to test it out
let's see if that's true we'll go to
pocket Internet Explorer here and I've
already bookmarked dsl report com to do
our speed test so if i go to favorites
dslreports com will do the 100 kilobyte
test which i know is going to be
unstable because it's too small so we'll
choose a larger file and we'll do the
one megabyte file
then where I live I live in Connecticut
and in this area where I live it's a
little rural so we may see some spotty
coverage but look at this here we just
got a speed of 948 kilobits per second
with a latency of point to 32 and a
download titanum 8.8 46 seconds really
strong showing there we'll try that
again to see make sure that's not like
an anomaly it could possibly be looks
like this run is a little slower than
the last
still loading here and we're at down to
721 kilobytes per second with a latency
of point to 28 download time about 11.5
seconds I'm just going to do one more
run of this just to see what happens
again looks like we might be in this 700
kilobyte range just based on the based
on the time here and actually we're up
to 800 32 kilobytes per second so it
looks like we've got some pretty strong
showing from the this update 10 seconds
to download the file this time but if we
were in stronger areas we'd probably see
a little bit more consistent showing and
probably a little faster but also keep
in mind that network traffic may also
affect the download times so the second
update that HTC has made was actually to
enable the gps chipset that's already
built into Qualcomm's MSM 7500 processor
I know a lot of sprint users were
looking forward to this as the only
device in the US market right now that's
a windows mobile 6 professional device
that has gps enabled is the AT&amp;amp;T tilt on
the Mogul here I've installed I guidance
version 2.1 which is I an application
i'm currently using on my tilt if we
click ok we're going to see how quickly
it takes to acquire a satellite signal
now I've already set this up on I
guidance for so there's not gonna be a
cold time test here so this will be a
warm start and just to give you an idea
I set this up on calm for and the baud
rate was 4,800 and as we saw their the
acquire time was pretty fast just a
matter of 10 to 15 seconds there and it
looks like the Mogul is acquiring on to
about six to seven satellites I'm going
to bring out here my 18t tilt to see
what kind of acquisition time we can get
here using the same application
tilt still working on it and it looks
like it acquired on 257 just about just
as quickly about 10 seconds or so but if
you notice that the mogul actually has a
stronger catch on the satellite signals
so that's a pretty good showing from the
mogul here let me put down the tilts and
we're going to exit out of I guidance
here I've also installed Microsoft's
live search and Google's google map
mobile on the device so let's try google
maps again I've already set up the GPS I
haven't used it yet if we click on use
GPS huh we get this error message your
gps receiver does not appear to be
responding interesting is I guidance
already recognized it and start it up
pretty quickly if we scroll down looks
like we get what is GPS how can i
improve gps reception and could be a
function of me just being inside my
house let's try to retry again doesn't
look like it looks like maybe google
maps doesn't recognize the gps device on
or the gps chip on the Mogul let's see
if live search has that same problem
again I've already set up the settings
for the gps so if I click on map here
blows up the satellite view pretty
quickly Center on GPS here it's getting
the GPS position it's close to my house
but not exactly it
and there we have it looks like a the
GPS chip does work on Microsoft's live
search and it's centered on the position
where i am currently so that's
interesting looks like the GPS chip may
be hit or miss depending on which
application you use but right now it
looks like it works on Microsoft's live
search and it also works in I navs I
guidance version 2.1 this looks like
it's a promising rom update and looks
like something that most sprint users
will want to do so this has been raid
one with pocketnow.com and a first look
at HTC's new rom for the sprint mogul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
