powerful hardware and more date
information Samsung's new mobile chief
doesn't see a very bright future for
2016 and Steve Ballmer isn't all that
happy with the recent Microsoft changes
I'm hey meri behna and all I need to
make this Friday better is a couple of
hilarious Steve Ballmer videos and a
beer
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with oneplus as the
company's oneplus two is finally going
out of its invite system as of the
stroke of midnight of December 5th so
for those of you out for the phone this
is about that time but if you're also
interested in the oneplus X the cool
thing is that there will be a window of
no invites during that weekend as well
pretty much at the same time as the
oneplus 2 is going out of invites the
only problem is the oneplus X is not
going to remain that way for the future
another company that's interested in
heart competition is t-mobile those of
you that are current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers
even if you're using a go phone plan
well if you bring your number to
t-mobile you'll be getting the $200
discount and the 128 gigabyte iPhone 6s
meaning that for the same price that you
pay for the 16 gigabyte model you get
the full-blown 128 gigabyte model and
since we don't know exactly how long
that deal is going to last hey we've got
a good team mobile signal go get that
and speaking of iPhones we've got more
conflicting rumors of the iPhone many
that we talked about yesterday we're not
even sure where to call it iPhone 6c
anymore and the reason for that is
because well we hear that it'll be 150
dollars cheaper than the iPhone 6s which
is not necessarily a good thing at a
time when you still have the iPhone 6 in
the market for $100 less and then well
it seems that it will be powered by the
a9 chip which is a good thing and that
it will have a metallic chassis and
support different color options that are
not the ones we currently see on our
iPhones stay tuned we'll see what we get
in the end as some of the spotlight over
to Apple's largest competitor and
partner Samsung the company's a new
president and Mobile CEO just came on
record to state that he considers 2016
to be a tough year and that investors
should not expect the major boost in
profits we're not exactly sure if the
company just wants to iterate the
designs that we saw this year but it
wouldn't be a bad idea given the fact
that these designs were actually rather
cool they should just probably add more
features the fact is and the problem
that the galaxy s6 did not sell as well
as the company was expecting and yes
this is not a death threat for Samsung
it's not like if the company is going
down or anything but it's not selling as
well as it expected and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
Microsoft's old CEO Steve Ballmer who
just came on record after the company's
investor meeting and claimed two things
number one he's not too happy with the
fact that the company is not providing
any details on the profit margins for
the hardware division or the cloud
division and he also claimed that he's
not too happy that the whole Android
application project for Windows 10 went
downhill and we don't have any status on
that according to him that's crucial and
he's kind of right even though Microsoft
has done a tremendous job with the
recent changes it's done but it does
lead me to the question of today what do
you think about the new Microsoft do you
think that Satya Nadella is taking the
company in the right direction or do you
think that Steve Ballmer is right that
the company should give more importance
to the things that are going downhill in
my case I think that nothing should be
overlooked I mean Steve Ballmer did do
some good things for the company I'm
just trying to remember one of them but
hey leave us a comment down below let us
