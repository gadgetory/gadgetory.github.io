hardware and more date information
samsung's new mobile chief does to see a
very bright future for 2016 and Steve
Ballmer isn't all that happy with the
recent Microsoft changes I'm hi meri
behna and all I need to make this Friday
better as a couple of hilarious Steve
Ballmer videos and a beer this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with one plus as the
company's one plus two is finally going
out of its invite system as of the
stroke of midnight of December fifth so
for those of you out for the phone this
is about that time but if you're also
interested in the oneplus X the cool
thing is that there will be a window of
no invites during that weekend as well
pretty much at the same time as the
oneplus 2 is going out of invites the
only problem is the oneplus X is not
going to remain that way for the future
another company that's interested in
heart competition is t-mobile those of
you that are current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers
even if you're using a gophone plan well
if you bring your number to t-mobile
you'll be getting the two hundred dollar
discount and the 128 gigabyte iphone 6s
meaning that for the same price that you
pay for the 16 gigabyte model you get
the full blown 128 gigabyte model and
since we don't know exactly how long
that deal is going to last hey you've
got a good t mobile signal go get that
and speaking of iPhones we've got more
conflicting rumors of the iphone many
that we talked about yesterday we're not
even sure wish you'd call it iphone 6c
anymore and the reason for that is
because well we hear that it'll be one
hundred and fifty dollars cheaper than
the iphone 6s which is not necessarily a
good thing at a time when you still have
the iphone 6 in the market for a hundred
dollars less and then well it seems that
it will be powered by the a9 chip which
is a good thing and that it will have a
metallic chassis and sport different
color options that are not the ones we
currently see on our iphones stay tuned
we'll see what we get in the end as with
the spotlight over to apple's largest
competitor and partner samsung the
company's a new president and mobile CEO
just came on record to state that he
considers 2016 to be a tough year and
that investors should not expect the
major boost in profits we're not exactly
sure if the company just wants to
iterate the
designs that we saw this year but it
wouldn't be a bad idea given the fact
that these designs were actually rather
cool they should just probably add more
features the fact is and the problem
that the galaxy s6 did not sell as well
as the company was expecting and yes
this is not a death threat for samsung
it's not like if the company's going
down or anything but it's not selling as
well as it expected and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with a Microsoft's old CEO Steve Ballmer
who just came on record after the
company's investor meeting and claimed
two things number one he's not too happy
with the fact that the company is not
providing any details on the profit
margins for the hardware division or the
cloud division and he also claimed that
he's not too happy that the whole
Android application project for Windows
10 went downhill and we don't have any
status on that according to him that's
crucial and he's kind of right even
though Microsoft has done a tremendous
job with the recent changes it's done
but it does lead me to the question of
the day what do you think about the new
Microsoft do you think that Satya
Nadella is taking the company in the
right direction or do you think that
Steve Ballmer is right that the company
should give more importance to the
things that are going downhill in my
case I think that nothing should be
overlooked I mean Steve Ballmer did do
some good things for the company I'm
just trying to remember one of them but
