pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a hardware tour of the verizon
wireless HTC ovum ozone global
smartphone it's a global smartphone
because it handles both the cdma ev-do
cellular standard as well as the more
popular internationally gsm standard
it's a quad-band GSM phone so it handles
US and European cellular frequencies in
its a dual band evdo CDMA device for the
US and those countries that have cdma
ev-do networks so the device has quite a
few keys it's really a hardware Kibum
which also acts up to initiate voice
control you've got the left softkey home
key familiar windows mobile d-pad the
right softkey a return key the end call
and also that doubles as your power off
call we've got a clear T keyboard with a
function overlay for numbers locking the
device going to vibrate mode the
communications manager you can also
access your email directly and mute the
device so you can see the fact that they
put the email key next to the space bar
means that this is really a texting
messaging device you know it's really
designed for email to compete with
devices like the blackberry you've got
the speaker at the top microphones at
the bottom we've got the mini USB
connector which requires a dongle to use
headphones which is I think really the
low point of the device but hopefully
HTC will be changed met on their newer
devices soon then you also have the
volume key on the side here we've got a
2 megapixel camera we've got the
speakerphone a speaker here the
microphone there if we pull the cover
off you've got the microSD card slot
which can handle up to 16 gigabyte and
if we pull the battery you'll see this
is where the gsm card and it comes
pre-loaded with a verizon vodafone gsm
card so the phones already enabled to
work with the gsm network and that's
something that i'm curious to see how if
it works with an AT&amp;amp;T sim card since I
won't be going overseas unfortunately to
test the device oh that would be a nice
treat it runs out see if we power it on
here it runs the windows mobile 6.1
operating system and which gives you you
know all the active sync features if
you're using exchange email server or
you can connect to services like Google
Gmail or msn hotmail in comparison to
other devices have an old smt 5800 from
verizon which was a non-touchscreen
device as the ozone is
meant for emailing or texting but it has
a slideout keyboard the thickness of the
device shows because of the slide out
keyboard this was a much thicker device
although smaller in size but I have to
say I really like the wavy ozone feels
in my hand or of course we're going to
compare it to he iphone although the
iphone is a touchscreen device and more
of a multimedia device it's about really
the same size as the ozone and feels
feels the same so if you are looking
really for a hard keyboard and you don't
need to touch screen functionality the
ozone feels pretty good especially when
you compare it to like the samsung i760
now this has a touchscreen and this is a
corporate workforce it's got the
keyboard here but i find this device
some in a lot of corporations that i
visit then if you compare it to a newer
device from verizon like the touch
diamond the touch diamond is obviously a
touch only there's no keyboard it is
thicker the touch diamond i think is
meant that to be more of a multimedia
device although both are running windows
mobile 6.1 you've obviously got a larger
screen on the touch the touch diamond so
you know for the price difference I mean
you really have to take a look if you
want the hard keyboard at the HTC ozone
on a two-year contract it runs 119
dollars and ninety-nine cents but
verizon is currently offering a seventy
dollar rebate which brings the price
down to 49 99 that's a pretty incredible
price for a full-featured small
fun so this is definitely a phone to
look at especially when you're comparing
it to some of the of the blackberries
out there I think you get much more
value out of the windows mobile platform
that you do out a new blackberry
platform so that's about it for the
hardware tour and I'll be back with my
first software tour shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
