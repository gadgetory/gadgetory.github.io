paki me.com and today i will show you
two classic games that come in one
package called battleship connect four
and this is by Hasbro so all I have to
do is click which game I'd like to play
so I'm going to choose battleship right
now so click on that and I'm just going
to choose player vs. computer you can
also choose player versus player if you
have another friend that you'd like to
play with you so we can just choose the
rules now we can choose classic or power
attacks and what that allows you to do
is fire and reload so you have a certain
time limit reload the cannons so I'm
just going to choose that game and we'll
pick my player let's see we'll take this
old Kruger guy and click Play and here's
where it says you can either use your
d-pad or your screen so I'm just going
to click Next and now i can assign my
pieces i'm just going to randomly assign
them now it's good to me click play this
is the i go first on this game so all i
have to do i'm just going to scroll
through all this all I have to just
select a piece on my board so let's say
I want to choose this one right here and
attack and I actually hit something so
now I'm going to attack again and you
get as you can see this progress bar up
here shows me when I need to reload and
shoot again so I've hit this little c2
is where I've hit and I actually
attacked this specific ship so I'm just
going to click Next
and now it's the computers turn as you
can see they've launched apparently the
computer is a lot faster than I am
because they are able to reload much
quicker than I was so I'm just going to
click Next again and now I know that I
have a piece here that might be let's
see there's one okay so I've hit that
battleship hit that battleship so I can
just keep going and going as long as I
had this progress bar de that doesn't
fill up so I ok so they've hit one of my
ships so it's pretty basic it's actually
just the original battleship on a
windows mobile device so I'm just going
to click here and click return to main
menu and now i'm going to show you
connect four so once again we can pick
player vs computer or player versus
player so we have the rules of classic
power chips and we can also choose our
difficulty so I'm just going to pick
easy and also a time-limited like but
I'm going to keep it for an unlimited
time so it's on the hyphen right here
and click play ok so to move my chips
all I have to do is click on a certain
line and then tap on the chip and it
will drop down now it's the computers
turn and the object of this game is to
actually get four pieces in a row so
let's see the computer is doing a little
bit better than I am I'm going to go
here go here again let's see
they said I have three in a row will we
see what the computer does hmm let's see
go here again I'm actually going to go
here let's see what the computer is
going to do oh you blocked me okay and
go here oh darn okay so the computer is
blocking me in every move that I've done
so I'm just going to go back into the
options and this is aware you can
actually change your sound or vibration
to have them on or off and go to return
to main menu so this is another
marketplace take and the game is
actually called battle should connect
four and at six dollars and ninety-nine
cents on windows mobile marketplace
