adopting ease and technology and
carriers are worried just as much as we
are the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is
apparently bringing better specs but not
changing much of the price and it seemed
that Sony wants to join the Tahrir in to
selfie camera bandwagon I'm Jaime Rivera
and definitely the Sunday will Cup
Finals your predictions in the comments
I am rooting for Croatia who are you
rooting for this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you are in the market for a new laptop
that's a expensive I guess it seems that
these new MacBook Pros that just got
announced are already part of the deals
that are being offered by Best Buy you
need a dot edu email address meaning you
need to be a student then you have to
prove it
but yeah 150 bucks off which is
compelling Apple usually brings these
back-to-school deals we're waiting on
them now let's talk about an interesting
twist coming from Adobe we've seen the
company make a move to iPad applications
in just mobile apps recently and now we
hear that full-blown Photoshop is coming
to the iPad we're not exactly sure when
we're going to see the final product
what we do here is that it'll be
announced at an event in October so let
us know in the comments what this make
you buy an iPad I use iPads a lot so but
I'm actually using it to record this
video by the way part of it so yeah
we'll see if that helps Apple gain more
of a pro effect to their tablet lineup
now Sony the company continues silently
surprising us with products we rarely
care about but yeah the xperia x z2 is
actually a phone I like the egg z2 the
new one the premium now brings dual
cameras finally it seems that the next
the X z3 whenever we get that is gonna
bring four cameras what are the purposes
of the four cameras is hard to predict
let's just hope it's not just for boat
clip okay blur and I almost got stuck
there but yeah let's expect that
probably by MWC next year now let's talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 we are
hearing all about the specification x'
the improvements that we're getting
larger battery new processor etc
obviously the big question is what a
samson going to do about the price tag
we know that even after the
price tags just soared like crazy with
the iPhone 10 so the big concern is are
we gonna get an expensive Galaxy Note
bear in mind they're already expensive
rumors are that the price tag is going
to remain but that doesn't mean that it
doesn't scratch $1000 we'll see how that
goes for Samsung and finally the hot
news today and should I say the most
concerning ones have to do with the next
generation iPhones because we hear that
the company plans to adopt ecent
technology for these phones all three of
them and they're in mind easton
technology on phones is actually not new
we've seen it on the pixel to pixel to
excel you don't need a SIM card to
connect the project Phi and I love that
the problem is Apple's implementation we
hear that we're getting the same
technology that's on the Apple watch and
for those of you that are on prepaid
plans I'm sure you're having a hard time
getting your Series three connected I
was never able to and I know with people
that were never able to and then you
have the problem that Apple pretty much
controls which carriers they have
partnerships with for the isom
technology to work so what happens when
you travel abroad
I just want to pop in a SIM card you
can't do that it seems like if you're
gonna have to deal with provisioning and
carriers and the reason why I'm saying
all this is because apparently the main
argument for this change is to bring
even more space to the chassis meaning
they do want to get rid of the SIM card
so in today's question let us know are
you okay with this do you want it or not
I even hear the Verizon and Sprinter
concern in my case I am definitely
concerned I travel a lot I swap SIM
cards all the time I do care about these
things leave us a comment down below we
left one of your opinion friends again
