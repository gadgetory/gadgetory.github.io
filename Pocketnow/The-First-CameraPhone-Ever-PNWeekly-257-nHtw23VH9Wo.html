ladies and gentlemen it's my pleasure to
introduce the guest for this week's
podcast this is a story that is
basically shaped almost my entire adult
life and I say that without hyperbole
mr. Philippe Kahn is responsible for a
technology that we probably all take for
granted today but we're celebrating a
very important anniversary we're five
days and 20 years ago he assembled all
of the pieces to share a photo from a
digital camera over through a computer
and over his Motorola StarTAC
cell phone this is an incredible story
as the photo that he shared was of the
birth of his daughter so all of these
pieces came together in an incredible
way his wife Sonya in the hospital as he
is tinkering with this equipment to make
it all happen in this moment and it
creates the foundation of every social
networking service every cloud service
every data service that we use now all
all came from this momentous event in
technology history and momentous event
in his own life so without further ado
let's jump right into this conversation
as mr. Khan is a phenomenal storyteller
he's often running like a shot as we
started this podcast I I present to you
our conversation with Philippe Khan so
to answer that question you know you can
ask her herself but she's running around
here but she she she she she's a full
participant and you know we're partners
really close in life and in business and
a well in technology but you know she
had a bit on during this 24 hours but
you know the camera phone did come
didn't happen 24 hours I spent a year
before that building that bolas the
server and the software infrastructure
and everything that's needed to create
this instant picture share we're not you
know you need to be able to store
picture to send notifications and this
is 1990
and the web was young there were no easy
tools you know you don't have a pad you
know the Apache you didn't have a lot of
the tools that you have now and so I you
know I worked on the third year and then
after we made it work
I said Maternity you know I'd take it
took quite a bit of time to integrate
the whole thing into you know a module
that could be embedded in a phone or
something I got so that people could
seek you could really do once this thing
was integrated in at Roane the
combination of the what people call the
camera phone but you know I and they've
server infrastructure but it's really a
song where chunk there plenty of people
who had put you know videos and photos
and phones the problem is the pictures
and everything stayed there no one
thought about it I've gotten into a few
sort of spirited conversations debates
about that because you know I really
feel that Jay phoned the sh0 for was the
very first true camera phone in that I'm
so racially combined and a lot of people
have come I actually talk about Jay
phone in my book I have a book about
smartphone photography and I've gotten a
lot of replies like well it wasn't the
first phone to have a camera on it and
like well I could another one camera to
any phone but I can't do anything such
as I I call it the Bulldog Craig symbol
I said you know anyone can take a
bulldozer and a crane put him together
and sent the Bulldog crane the problem
is what do you do with the Bulldog crane
did you that ended and people went
weren't doing anything anything with it
and that is exactly the point Jay phone
is not the camera phone is as much the
the SHA mail infrastructure that we
worked with transcoding and anything
that we work with him on and it was the
same thing with Sprint you know we we
created a phone with Cascio we help them
integrate this stuff and build some
firmware but the real thing is the
ability to instantly share pictures with
thousands of people without sending
thousands of
the way in which Facebook and all these
things the Instagram and a lot work
today and that's exactly the point J
phone was the first were you and you
know I'm all over the place but let me
let me say the argument that I take
sticks with everyone I said listen all
these people who claim that they they
all these claims about a camera phone
it's pretty funny they say every one of
these guys who make claims and I met
pretty much all that's it so where are
the pictures you took right exactly and
the answer is oh we don't have those and
said well what was the point well we
left him on the phone it said the lab it
never been really and I'm going the
point is to point shoot and share
instantly it's a Polaroid of the 21st
century so right that's exactly the
point is that there were no pictures
they didn't even use for their own
pictures of their own kids it Riley for
me okay
if they wouldn't you wouldn't mind I'd
like to backtrack really really quickly
here just for our audience and
especially why I was so excited to have
you on the podcast is this is a really
important anniversary that we're five
days removed now at the time that we're
recording this from the twentieth
anniversary of this process that you
developed this this ability to to
instantly send over a wireless
communication system a photo that other
people could interact with and and I
want to do this is just to kind of start
even before the the birth of your
daughter which was one of the most
amazing
I think occurrences to coincide with the
birth of the camera phone because you
were creating this infrastructure for
years before all of these pieces really
came together for the first practical
demonstration was it always with the
focus of photography or was this sort of
like you were just looking at ways that
you could create sort of a prototype for
what we would now consider cloud storage
in the modern era no I'm looking at
closet this was 1997 I started in 1996
then the web was like really young and
three years old and and I was focus on
the images I really Sonya what
was one of the first people at that time
to do a digital photography manipulation
on computers which was not something
that a lot of people did and we were
looking at how do we share these things
instantly and we realized that the times
not just wirelessly it's like in general
the bandwidth even at the time you know
the end of the web the internet wasn't
that you know you get caught is that you
couldn't we had a list of 2000 people
around the world that we knew and if we
wanted to share an image we're not going
to send 2,000 pictures at a time I mean
today but but but the same problem
arises to dinner different waves but it
didn't scale so we said we need to build
something where as the owner of this I
can upload this image and then I have a
list and I can notify these people that
if they would like here's a link back
they can to get an email just like you
get notification and email notification
just like you get in Facebook and then
you click and you could take a look take
that thing on the server and everybody
can see each other's annotation people
can interact like at the time we used to
call that forums or bulletin boards you
know Baltimore style discussion that
you'd have under each image and it was
exactly thing but you couldn't really do
it and in in in a brute force way with
this okay outside 2000 images and even
if you did that how would you have a
conversation between the people who you
don't but the problem is the same that
now because you could argue okay there's
plenty of bandwidth today you can send
2,000 picture but now people end up you
know getting a million views right so
you're not going to send a million
pictures or a million video people get a
million videos you know if you know
viral video of some kind of of a you
know a dog skateboarding or something I
get a French bulldogs favor and you know
they get 5 million if you have to send
by
million copies of it wouldn't work so
you put it in one place in each person
who wants to see this you know of a
freshman skating French pink skating
French Bulldog you know four point five
average rating and then you go I'll
click on that but then you see it and it
downloads here it's your bandwidth it's
not my bandwidth as a creator that needs
to be almost infinite because millions
of people are going to see it do you
farm saying and that's really the so it
was the same thing at the time you have
very little bit of bandwidth and so you
have to do it today you have very
powerful pipes but at the same time the
numbers of people who are looking at
this stuff is huge so it's the same
scalability challenge right well and
especially for the aspect of creating
this with the notion of social
interaction baked into it that that I
feel is where we've experienced a lot of
this exponential growth in that when
something goes viral or even just when
something's popular among your own
family and friends that the resource now
needs to be stable enough to hold that
media to hold that data but essentially
the systems that we're using today are
all very similar and tracked almost
directly back to your initial
experiments trying to solve this one
problem of sharing an image from your
computer easily amongst a population
that's exactly right and and and the
ability to have people come back
comments each other's comment and
interact it adds to live the you know
that's the instant picture male where we
go please you know you're interacting
you know you you post a picture of your
baby and suddenly yeah people say Oh Len
you know what whatever it is they want
to say and and it should always be oh
what a beautiful baby now there's always
one if it's really public as you know
right as a bunch of smart asses out
there who will and that's that's
actually an interesting when you get to
the to public side it's a curation is
interesting because you have some really
weird people who post weird thing
close up and so that's a defense of
modern phenomena but it's an important
one well and it was also a we had a lot
of conversations my wife and I before
the birth of our first daughter that I
we we made a conscious effort not to
share her publicly I think there are
maybe five photos that have ever gone
live of my daughter in any kind of
public forum but we have gigabytes and
gigabytes of photos and videos that we
share with our family and friends just
in private little photo cloud storage
shares of private folders so we were
definitely cognizant of that and then
also we never had our kid photos
broadcast publicly so we wanted to give
her a shot and having some kind of
privacy before she has her own Instagram
account that she can do whatever she
wants with and that's absolutely true by
the way it's like Sophie she's 20 like
camera phone right she's at NYU she was
doing my and she she people ask you know
can we have a picture of her today and
she goes no exactly if they see my you
know like 30 minute old picture and I
want I want my privacy I want to be
successful in my own run had nothing to
do with this picture except being born
and this is really exciting it's really
fun to be there but you know I have my
own life this is not my life I don't
want to be the camera phone baby you
know I you know she is but she didn't
want to be true and this is something
that she's grown up with says she has to
she has to know especially with where
society is gone how important that image
is to technology history yeah she she
knows but no one can tell it's her it
could be anyone and but it's hers but it
does the point is that you if you look
at her today and you look at a picture
yeah if you look carefully maybe you'll
recognize some trees but she's that baby
could look like you know million people
on the planet you know if you look at a
picture but it's our babies our babies
on picture but she
it's for her I mean the way I
interpreted she choose smart kid and for
her she goes well I was born and that
was great but I really mom did the work
you did the technology and I happened to
be there at the right time and she goes
I want to be successive everywhere she
goes he could she's really success she's
a very good writer she's she's also very
good with technology and stuff and she
said I know what I want to do and she's
very focused she's a she's a very busy
kid and and she she she has her own life
and and she does not want people to say
you know like for example I'm on her
college application she did not want to
have it I'm the camera phone baby
because she wanted to accept it
somewhere on her own merits not because
she was as she happened to be there and
mom and dad did the work so and so for
the members of our audience who maybe
aren't quite as familiar is my sort of
geek fascination with your store key
maybe walk us through what actually came
together because it's it's such a
phenomenal story the there's an amazing
dramatization of it on your on your site
on what is it memo musings from Philippe
its memo calm memo calm but you know in
sort of condensing this this story for
years you've been working on a backbone
on a service the server-side service for
sharing the photo and then your wife
goes into labor and you are macgyvering
the individual pieces to create a
hardware chain that can interface with
the server side solution right up to the
birth of your daughter um take us
through that you know part of that day
that that's an amazing joining of events
to all arrive at the at one moment in
time it's approved that if it wasn't for
the last moment nothing would get done
so so so it's a other way that
dramatization was not done by us we
discovered it a week ago
some film company was doing that as far
as an encyclopedia of Technology
and accomm protected so we had nothing
to do with it just just took the story
and made it happen we thought it was
pretty good so what happened so I think
what's important to understand as you as
you put forward is that a lot of work
had been done before on all the server
infrastructure all the mechanics of
storing remotely a picture and notifying
a list of people that there's a picture
that might be interested in through an
email and with a link back to that
server so that they could actually if
they wanted look at the picture and post
a comment or something I got and so now
the question was at the maternity here
in Santa Cruz when you're there at the
time you didn't have any way to connect
or it anything and I know I wanted to
take pictures and this was 1997 was the
first year where there was a successful
digital camera that took pictures 240 by
320 if I remember correctly like quarter
VGA and three every hazard right ad and
that was that was the Kazi of QV 10
winner 210 whatever it was called
and so we have one of those for the
first time we could have one of those
and it could it could you know they had
a little cable and could download to
your laptop at the time you know like
most people I had to Sheba procure a
laptop and I could download pictures and
I I had built a little control program
that was able to actually rapidly
download these pictures and push him
through the modem port and and and and
and and do that and and you know using a
wired modem that's how we communicated
with the server right the problem is
there was no no no Archie 11 plug until
online in a full line in the you could
use and so I had a start tag and so the
start tag could act as a wireless 1200
baud Wireless
Odom's and it had a little blood plug
but the challenge is always you know the
protocols I figure it out but the
question is how do you connect really so
the control program what would be in the
MCU was on the laptop how do you connect
a laptop to star tech and have the
laptop tells us start tag the phone
because an analog phone at a time it was
an analogue start at how does the laptop
physically you know in Hardware well
what's the wires talk to to this phone
and tell it to to use a wireless modem
in there to actually send to the server
those images sequentially and
automatically it's just like a job
control language you know the old days
and so you're putting this together in
in the waiting room of the hospital well
I actually it's a it's a maternity we
were very lucky because Sutter in Santa
Cruz in a cave mem tourney with very
large rooms actually that have in it a
Jacuzzi and they have a desk oh you're
lucky you were just kicking back in the
jicama absolutely we were there and she
had a long we got there early they sell
you can you can either go back home
where you can stay here because you know
you're probably 12 hours from where we
need you as well is just a because it's
very comfortable and it's a comfortable
place it's it's a maternity not a
hospital and and there's a lot of room
so I had my desk in 11 missus yeah well
might as well do this and see if I can
advance the project you know it sucks
there's a piece of the product and I got
stuck and and and and that's because
Sonia's contribution really you know I
said I was like started I mean really
the issue is distorted is that the the
female laptop I know how to hack that
but the the phone is really difficult
because you know it's like you know you
couldn't take these phones apart really
requires it and then Sonia's idea was
don't you don't we have a car kit in the
in the car
you know you so he plugged the blah blah
and it actually was able to do a
hands-free call and I said wow that
that's a great idea do you mind if I
tear it off she goes I even if I'm I am
you gonna do it anyway so okay I'll be
right back so I took a bunch of tool
when the pliers and etc and went to the
car and basically undid the work of
putting in a car kit I had I've
installed the park it myself and so so
you know the car KK with a little no
enclosure for for speaker then there was
a cable and then there was also another
cable with microphone so he clipped the
microscope to the top of the of the of
the you know the guys referred that
maybe put it on the visor and then you
have your old box that was a speaker it
was actually worked quite well and and
and it all plugged into this to the back
of the phone and I said well at least I
have a plug because that's the hardest
thing and with all the wires coming out
now I need to figure out what to do with
each wire and that was really the key to
making it work then exactly and there is
that too because I couldn't without that
back blog and and and something any so I
am t you know got rid of the speaker got
old and used that actually as a place to
to cross wires to test things and all
that and it works and that was really
kind of the miracle of the day it was a
18 hours of non-stop work really it was
like focused like you know how you get
in the zone right so I was in the zone
and I says I'm gonna make this work
and that's how that's how it function
and
it was funny because usually you're not
off so Sonia
Sonia's delivery happened let me see you
what just happened here Sonia's delivery
huh
you're very small suddenly Oh
if you've switched to a different page
it'll probably shrink me but that's okay
you're BA
I got it I got here yesterday right
there we go I'm not as familial Skype so
so what happened was was that after 18
hours is that you know I think we should
do a c-section and usually in there so
when you see sexually you get into the
operating room office right and usually
you're not allowed to bring anything
into an operating room but we were lucky
that the delivery surgeon was a geek who
knew me adilyn happier he was he was
trying to learn to program and I giving
him tips and stuff like that and helped
him out it so the kid I bring this is
cool what's this going to do and he was
an eye on a prop problem getting him
focused on Sonia and the delivery but
don't worry he does that all the time I
was much more interested on the phone
and oh wow what are you doing yeah right
right right baby show me this camera
let's get there as it's a big kid Go Go
focus on that so funny that it hey Dad
but the pumps not working I go look I'll
I'll stop working on this I'll go fix
your palm let's just go focus on you do
your java it was pretty funny but it was
it was it was a I was very lucky that
that and he was he witnessed the whole
thing that he he's funny because he's
very articulate guy is actually a great
surgeon and he he he really was with a
piece of it because he anybody else I
think
said I can't do that all these wires and
stuff alog because I was fixing up but
he was he was great and he's funny when
he talks about that and and and so that
happened there and kind of the it all
came together and probably 24 hours you
know there it was very intense at Sony I
didn't sleep for 24 hours out of either
because I was just so yeah I was in blue
zone and that's how it all transpired
any I don't think the process was
important what happened right away is
like we had a list you know some yes
from Korea I'm from your Europe and so
we have people all around the world
friends and family and people we know
and we had a list of about 2,000 people
some of them were friends you know 200
of them probably ecologist by then that
need probably 50 family or something I
got then the rest were people we knew
through work or whatever and we just
took that list and it was on the server
and we just assisted work as advertised
and suddenly I started getting you know
I was watching these these these
annotations on the server and and I go
well people go how did you do that we
could see pictures say you're sending
are happening in real time and because
there was a time date stamp on him and
any because how do you do this and the
one of the first person to respond to
that was the guy from The Wall Street
Journal Walt Mossberg would just retired
and Walt Mossberg says how do you do
this I said well Walt Mossberg ask that
that's pretty good I he goes yeah I want
something I need something new with Walt
Mossberg doesn't know how to do it right
and so so at that point we said wow you
know this is our next gig you know we're
going to make this camera phone thing
successful and you know we this is like
the Polaroid of the 21st century and
we're going to find a way to make it
happen what do you then realize is
there's a big difference between
building the concept car and having a
car that can drive 100,000 miles on the
road and getting the roads to accept us
and the question we had is that
everybody we accept we talked in North
America Kotick in particular and pollard
they were clueless and as I met with the
seals of these companies I actually
spent two or three days in Rochester you
know talking to sand carp and all his
team and they didn't see it so the the
Kodak man today as you know subsequently
they went bankrupt he said uh no one
wants to do this digital thing look at
the VGA quick people silver highlight is
there forever we have all these many
labs one our labs and everything no
one's employed were the same way the big
thing at the time was they were going to
make a printer that was be attached that
would be the next version of the Lloyd
was going to be digital so it was going
to create they were going to take a
digital picture atlas and instead of
being a film it was going to be a
printer that would get and I was going
in a little mini printer for the
right-hand - suits on to the labs you
know I went well you know if you didn't
have to web maybe that's a good idea of
it so let me get this I remember telling
to see you you're going to print this
picture like this right and you're going
to hand it to whether people are going
to look at are you are you going to use
a photocopy machine as oh no we print
one more so I said so what if you want
to share this with somebody in Tanzania
any good oh you send it through the mail
I said okay so we have this instant
picture mail how would you like that and
they didn't take then I went to Motorola
and and Chris was the son of the founder
was running the with the CEO of the
company and he called his whole staff I
remember being in their boardroom and
discussing it everybody was going now
people want better voice people want
better voice mail people want this
people want
there were no texts in the time you know
Texas just rang the guy was about to
emerge so they they didn't see it and I
insisted on an update they were not
interested and that's one of inthose
you've created this process and you have
you know this anecdotal experience I
shouldn't even say anecdotal you got
this test case experience which is sort
of one of the perfect momentous life
events that someone would want to share
this story is still being lost on the
executive teams of the companies you're
pitching this to well I made a mistake
the mistake that I made is that I'm not
a I'm a technologist I'm not a marketing
sales guy and I should have said he done
exactly what you said which on we saw
momentous events instead my demo was
suit
live make it work live with people there
take that pictures and Sharon chives or
something and say okay why and then I
think if I had said okay it's your baby
pictures it's a wedding pictures it's a
selfie take on the beach whatever it is
it's you know and by the way J phone
invented the selfie the practical
something if not do you remember the
phone at all absolutely well and J phone
actually kicked off with that notion I
love the fact that that for an entire
generation of phones we had those little
mirrors on that so our gadgets yeah
because we only had one we only had one
imaging sensor and so that people don't
realize that it's out that Jade the
concept of J phone was a selfie I mean
Dane right
selfie really plucked practically so the
the I wasn't successful I didn't do a
good job cell but I think they were
thick as a brick because they're old web
background model on wind back record
eckworth right and they couldn't see the
paradigm shift
there was a paradigm shift which was
everything is moving to digital
photography is willing to for digital
story phones are moving to phones are
going to become camera phones and smart
phones and they're going to be one and
you're not going to be able you know
milking Nokia try to relaunch you know
old phones and say people said I don't
want that I do too much molecular they
were on paradigm chef and all these guys
have had missed a paradigm shift that
every time there's a paradigm shift in
technology like that you have some
players who completely lose it there
were major players you know me when the
paradigm shifted personal computers
happen you know that people like Dagon
Burroughs and Wang and all that that one
they all disappeared I mean people don't
realize at the time how classy what
happened I think they're saying things
happening in the sleep industry right
now is that you know we're seeing him
but there's a paradigm shift from bed to
smart bed from sleep to to digital
quantified sleep and all that and
and additional magician the traditional
mattress companies if they don't harness
that paradigm shift will will see the
same challenges as the Kodak's
Motorola's more kids so from those from
those initial meetings where there was
difficulty in getting this idea across
there were a few companies that that
were kind of leading into this
conversation and sort of ready to take
so obviously J phone with a was the
sharp sh0 for they got on board and then
you want to had a partnership with
Sprint um that happened I hate it so how
that happened was look so I felt you
know I three four months in Japan pretty
much and the we who basically spent time
in Japan and and and so we created this
business and it was great we did all the
transcoding for them and all that
and you know I first went to do kumal
and this we NTT DoCoMo which was the the
big dominating wildlife company internet
and they were also a thick as a brief
whoa you know they were doing the
Japanese you know right weed no no and
you know you didn't get a response and
you spent a lot of time so until we
found chaise longue and and and there
was nobody and they took it on and they
were very successful as you know so in
in in early 2000 so as you know Jeff ona
launched in late 1999 if I remember and
in early too you know a few months later
this writer from wired about parks saw
the J phone when sharp saying and
realize that of our involvement and so
since I want to write a story and so he
wrote the story and I think appeals to
over 2000 this year something I got of
Wired which this was supposed to be the
title of the story was the big picture
and the prior basically the idea with
the paradigm shift
and he oldest was what was great and and
what's happening and they they even came
to shut the cover picture and a left and
then this is the issue where Napster
died where we're not forgot
unplug right right this is that famous
issue where I got a call from the
editors of wired say we're really sorry
we disrupted we're still we're going to
run your story in there but the proper
going to be a a a black cover funeral
right a cover for the funeral of Napster
because yeah so that's a famous that's
that famous issue and so they ran that
and but they ran our story which was you
know a big story but parks is a little
long story and very descriptive and he's
still around and people ask him and he
says well it's amazing because when we
were together we described to him what
was going to happen with citizen
journalism with telemedicine with ole
lamented it all happened and he was very
skeptical at not but he wrote a great
story and a couple of guys at Sprint in
Overland Park you know cancer
read the story that was a guy copia Babu
and a guy called Danny dominant if I
remember and yeah and daddy wrote that
and I got a call from Pierre saying I'm
with friend where you know there were
the small carrier compared to AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon this time and I want to do what
what what J phone didn't in Japan it in
the US I said well that's great because
we can't convince AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon to do
it right now and so we went to cause you
but an office here and it would you be
interested they were very either because
they had lost J phone opportunity was
sharp right in his right and so that's
how we launched in the u.s. whisper and
cause EO together we build a whole
infrastructure for spirit everything we
not only built it but we ran it for them
so it was software-as-a-service really
it was a platform of the service that
software as a service and and they were
very successful that puts sprint for the
next five years melted like crazy they
were the only or the you I remember that
we have have it working and and you know
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon had to come to to to to dad
firehouse at one point but it took him
several years and so all those years
print was very successful so with with
that now we finally got a foothold in
the United States people are starting to
understand this concept and from my from
my rememberings that this this was a
field that exploded rather quickly I
mean obviously there were a number of
those conversations that will your
trading expediency for quality obviously
if you want quality you've got to go to
a standalone camera but these phone
things they're kind of fun to play with
up to this point now where we find that
phone cameras have largely eclipsed t'
standalone camera sales people can leave
their their proper camera at home most
days because their phone cameras are
able to
to carry the weight to carry the load in
there in many cases just as good or if
not better than some of the consumer
point-and-shoot cameras what are some of
your feelings you look at you look at
this landscape and you see the the the
past that you've created for people to
create content and to distribute content
what does that feel like I mean looking
twenty years back to now this is such an
amazing story and it's exploded so
quickly that this was all sort of
directly from your your handiwork yeah
and you know the beauty of the camera
phone is that it's always in your pocket
or in your handbag or in your hand and
so you always have it with you and that
is you know the concept was was really
that one is that instantly share what
you experience and so it led you know
when you look at it what it led to like
citizen journalism you know you you know
I think it's saved the lives of people
in many ways and and and change the
political landscape in a lot of places
because you can't hide there's always
someone with a camera phone
who's fillable people with phones or
multiply and I say it happened this way
I don't know look at the video the
camera come through and it's pretty
funny and and and and and so that's a
perfect example another one is you know
if you go if you get it out of the US
where we're it you go say to Africa or a
you know circle third-world country you
find people who don't have a house well
home who don't have a laptop we don't
have anything nice but they have a
camera phone a smartphone with a camera
and they now have memories and now those
memories are stored on Facebook whatever
they do it and they share it and they
notify and they do all that stuff and
that's something they have before they
have a home they have to have a car
before they have any you know they even
have a bed a lot of these before they
have public charging stations and so I I
really that's the social impact and the
impact of something as like that to me
is is more important than the size of
the industry you know I mean there's
plenty of people who build you know
incredible you know large businesses and
they're very successful and alladin that
good for them but you know I mean yeah
it's great but my focus is more like you
know you spent time on this planet you
try to make misses and misters
everyone's life a little better not just
claim that I made a lot of money but you
know Windows is better or something well
it's not but but you look you know you
you you you just look at you look at you
know what can you what have you done
really directly with technology that has
had an impact I think that's that's
really an important piece of it and and
you know that's the power of the people
who make the ARPANET that turn into the
internet turn into the into into the the
web and that turn you know and to into
the ability for for mrs. and mr.
everyone to do things that they couldn't
do before and I think that that's a to
me that's the important piece of it is
is yeah it's exciting it it's fantastic
when you see that the camera you get on
us
run a latest Samsung or something I got
you go wow this is better than you know
you'll never use that that that although
that functionality is it's pretty
amazing and you know now there's
extensions even you know what the good
drones now are sending directly to your
to your phone that stuff which is
streamed directly and you know and now
suddenly you can see it from space you
know I mean it's it's really the
personal communicator and everyone
connected with everyone at old times and
suddenly well and your story again in
the creation of this is something that
hit very close to home personally is I I
was finishing my photography book while
my wife was in the hospital bro we were
going to have our daughter and I've got
my DSLR there I've got lenses I've got I
mean I'm prepped I'm ready for my
daughter to arrive and when the moment
actually came that I got to see my
daughter for the very first time my
phone was the right tool it wasn't that
it was a compromising quality it wasn't
that it was just easier to email from my
phone once the photo was there was this
was more discrete the optics were plenty
good enough for me to capture the moment
and it kept me closer to my daughter
holding her for the very first time now
then if I had taken the time to break
out my SLR and pop on a really fancy
macro lens and have this giant piece of
machinery in between me and her in that
moment and you know if when I when I
read your story and when I especially
after watching the dramatization that
video is is really charming it's
something that that personally has
affected my family and it's something
that I think a lot of people can can
will resonate with a lot of people a lot
of people can can sort of express those
moments I had this or or maybe it was
something dangerous or maybe it was
something momentous or maybe it was
something mundane like you know a cop
says I was parked in this wrong position
and so I took a photo of where my car
was and I showed the judge exactly
that that now we've got this ubiquitous
control this is democratized our ability
to tell a story or to share a moment or
to join a conversation again something
that we've not always had had had in the
past exactly I agree 100% I actually you
know the funny thing is we live in Santa
Cruz there's a lighthouse because at the
Harbor we're close to a lighthouse and
so a lot of times we walk our dogs
whatever and there's people at
lighthouse is nice at sunset in a lab
nice white lighthouse so if there's
always people who say hey can you take a
picture of us I feel like if they're
asking me they don't they don't know
just what edit a thing it's great it's a
great experience because there we go you
know that's exactly right now they have
them they share it instantly and you
couldn't even do that and how would they
do that in any other way and they had
the camera there they probably wouldn't
have carried a camera it's reshaped a
lot of the industry at a photography
industry but you know that better than I
do it and there was a huge paradigm
shift for the Stuber fee industry and
some of them made it and some of them
didn't make it as well
so I want to circle back to something
else because I know you've been keeping
busy you've been keeping busy since the
invention of you know sort of photo
sharing online 20 years ago and you
mentioned briefly you were you were
talking about sleep and in reading
through some of the the articles on memo
comm this is something that I think
you've taken up as your next cause or
your next what what's going to interest
you in the next phase of your career and
it's something where I kind of feel the
technological barrier between
services and data and then human biology
is probably going to be the next
battleground or is probably going to be
the next exciting consumer area we see
little hints of it with things like
fitness trackers you know getting room I
get my heart rate you know 24 hours a
day of when I wear my watch kind of a
thing and that's that's really great but
I don't think we fully explored all of
the opportunities for improving the
quality of life not just bombarding
physiology with more services and more
apps and more data I agree with that and
so sleep is a very interesting thing
it's um we found a fit roughly a third
of our lives in our bedroom sleeping or
supposedly sleeping eight hours a day
that's a third of our lives six and a
half billion people it's a lot of time
and we sleep we live in a sleep-deprived
society and every time I make a speech
in a big you know hotel or something
area some convention or conference let
me always ask people
who said too much last night there's
always a sign that otherwise the smart
as is always said too much okay if I ask
people who would have wished they could
have slept a little more and they all
think everybody raises their head I'm
talking to you fresh from a trip that I
got stuck in Shanghai and I'm still on
the wrong timezone in my brain I'm I'm
Way off my sleep cycle right now so so
so you got it to everybody sleep
deprived in some way you know you see
people falling asleep at business
meetings and other I mean where else we
could drive then we have work we have
kids we have fear you know a game of
Thrones to watch we have video games to
play we have whatever it is that we do I
mean you know Facebook actually Facebook
Never Sleeps that's from and and so
people have a certain the way we look at
it certain sleep budget you know you you
basically have six eight hours a day
that you you basically know that you're
going to sleep the problem is you know
you get all these sleep doctors and tell
people oh you should sleep more so
usually you actually sit at least leave
six hours you should sleep it that
doesn't work we're busy we're looking at
Facebook we're doing playing a video
game whatever it so it doesn't work so
what can work is people have a certain
sleep budget and look at sleep just like
you look at you know a 5,000 meter run
is look you can look at at your time and
you try to improve your performance so
my whole focus has been to understand
sleep and try to give people the tools
or build them over time that help
improve your sleep efficiency
performance so that in the same amount
of time if I can improve your sleep
efficiency by 20% and you sleep six
hours I just gave you over an hour more
of sleep without changing any of your
schedule so you should be happy and I
should be happy and that's really what
we're we're looking at and so we've
built non-invasive monitoring systems
they get and
under mattress away don't see him you
don't have to wear anything you don't
have to charge anything that are able to
collect that information that
respiration rate heart rate all that to
give our AI bike and that's cloud base
AI by again the information it needs to
actually help you with personalized tips
and coaching to help you be more
successful in your sleep improve over
time the quality of your sleep and and
and and and and if you have better sleep
and you've been you will perform better
and everything you do during the day
whether it's work whether it's
relationships whether it's sports and so
that's what we look at and so is this uh
is this a consumer facing business yet
or is this still in a sort of a
prototyping or testing phase or their
products that people can engage with now
for that kind of data
so my what I do is always a b2b my
customers are people like Nike like
Simmons bedding like ceramic and all
that I built technology for these guys I
don't hey I'm not a market here and a
sales guy I want to stay away from that
because it's really difficult and once
you start doing that then you're not
really building technology it's very dry
you're just you're just because I rather
build technology suit for people and let
them go sell it so yes so our partners
at at Simmons Serta Beautyrest have
actually just released the first version
of what they call a sleep tracker
monitor and it's at they sell it through
their bedding channels which are you
know companies like Jordans and all
these okay because that's where they
sell their mattresses these are kind of
sell millions of mattresses a year and
they actually just put it on Amazon but
uh and so they you know the debate if is
150
our solution that that you just put a
longer processor into the wall for two
sensors under your mattress and then the
whole AI base cloud that we run doesn't
work and then you get everyday a report
on your sleep and tips and personalized
tips and coaching that help you improve
your sleep and that's our version one
and that's how you know it's a it's
really an interesting challenging
problem similar challenges because if
you have we don't have them yet we have
you know maybe a hundred thousand
households using the system but just a
hundred thousand bed phones during the
night smart home streaming you know
eight hours worth of heart rate and all
that all night a lot of data there's a
lot of data so we had to solve very
difficult and does that data has to fit
into machine learning and AI engine that
allows us to analyze in real time how
you're sleeping and then very rapidly
notify you as that's how you perform
against yourself or just you know ha the
same day of the week last week or versus
people like you which is you know
looking at a demographics of people for
example your age group your weight guru
and fitness level and see how you
perform and and and why would it be that
you would perform as well in your sleep
and so it's really fascinating has a
fantastic team of scientists and data
scientists and mathematicians and all
that and it's a it's a real exciting
space and has Sonya continue to work
with you on these projects like after
after picture picture phones and camera
phones is this is something she's still
involved with or was she more of a
digital artist no she she she's to a
hundred percent involved we do this
together I don't think were we actually
worked well together sheesh
is a digital artist and a pianist and a
cello player but she's she's a she she's
also a very good operational person and
a very good trick you tinker and she's
much more organized operationally than I
have so so she I picked my wife very
similarly haha how do you know she maybe
she picked you I I feel that's probably
a more accurate way of putting it yes
okay so it's so we have we have a very
we work well together you know we we
know that our boundaries in Aladdin we
don't sit in the same office only on
that we don't do but we we work together
well and she's she's a hundred percent
of part of of this of this company full
power and our customers are people like
Nike like cinnamon Serta
beauty rest and people I got so it's an
exciting company very AI based cloud
base AI because really the secret is in
in getting those massive streams of data
and what you do with it and how you
interact with it how you build
artificial intelligence extra can deal
with these things in right and in in
real time because well I don't hate that
to the customer to it's those right you
know you have a mountain of data even
just for some of like my fitness
tracking if it's two charts and graffiti
I might really not know what my goal is
moving forward is sometimes it does need
to be sort of broken down and spelled
out to me in a very simple way exactly
it's like it's it's to to to understand
yourself first you want to quantify
yourself but quantifying is not good
enough it's you know it's the
infographics type of lines you know how
am i doing against myself how am i doing
against people just like me and that's
true for sleep but it's also is true for
how many steps you're
being active you are etc so that's it's
a it's a quantified self right
absolutely mr. Khan I can't thank you
enough for joining us on this on the
show joining us tonight
it was something that was very important
for me to have this conversation with
you just how much a part of my life this
technology has become and especially as
I was growing up you know we're talking
the late 90s I was just getting out of
high school watching the system's
evolved and watching this technology
explode and and going from the early
days of where I was carrying around Palm
Pilots and Windows Mobile pocket pcs and
being made fun of to seeing just how
pervasive you know like I felt pretty
good I was ahead of the curve on some of
that stuff but to have you wanted to be
able to share this story that 20 years
ago we couldn't communicate this idea or
why people would care about it and now
we live in a world where we can't live
without it is amazing and so one I just
want to thank you personally for being a
part of your vaping this landscape but
then also thank you for joining us to
have this chat and thanks for having us
again you know communicating is a key
part of building technology and you're
obviously great communicators so thank
you for doing that but absolutely my
pleasure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
