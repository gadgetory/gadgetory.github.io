pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to take a look at the hardware on
the eaton glofish be 900 this is attends
latest and greatest windows mobile
device so let's take a look at the
hardware here in the front we see that
the paint is kind of a bluish gray
metallic and while some people may
appreciate the deviation from the
standard black found on a lot of windows
mobile devices I find it to be a kind of
cheap looking in a little bit retro but
I guess that's a matter of your your
personal taste on the bottom here we
have a call start button and a call end
button notice there are no soft keys or
Hardware soft keys to use this joystick
moves around as a standard d-pad but
it's quite sensitive I don't know if I
like that very much and to press inward
would do a select command moving up from
the bottom we have a light sensor here
and a front-facing video camera and
there are two LED indicators on either
side of the speaker here and there's
some v 900 branding i like how small it
is it's not big and in your face it's
kind of kind of subtle they're going
over to the side we have volume up and
down via this kind of chrome button that
feels a little bit cheap to the to the
right of that we have a note record
button onto the bottom yes your eyes
aren't deceiving you there is a 2.5
millimeter headphone jack here it's not
3.5 millimeter but I guess it's better
than having to use a converter jack with
mini USB and speaking of mini USB this
device happily accepts mini USB so
that's good news over here we have a
port for the microphone going over to
the other side we have a dual action
camera button so halfway will focus the
camera and all the way will take the
picture and then we have a very well
placed micro SD slot and I like this a
lot because it's covered by a dust cover
it's easy to remove and it's easily
accessible plus it's hot swappable
because it's not behind the battery
which means that you can swap in and out
cards to play media and look at files
and that sort of thing without shutting
down the device so that's good to the
right of that we have a soft reset hole
in a convenient location and to the
right of that is a standby button though
I would have liked it better on the top
going over the top we have nothing more
than
then the letters GPS this device has GPS
built into it if we turn over to the
back we find that the back is covered in
that soft kind of stuff soft plastic
texture that makes it feel really solid
in hand that said the device actually
feels a bit cheap in hand because most
of what you see here is plastic up here
we have the 3 megapixel camera lens and
to the right of that is the LED
flashlight and a self-portrait mirror to
the right of that is the external
speaker phone which produces pretty loud
and clear audio which is good now take a
look at this as you know this device or
as you don't know this device has the
capability to receive TV signals over
the air look at this antenna let me set
this up on the table so you can kind of
get an idea of how this looks and this
antenna actually also works for the FM
radio so that means you don't have to
carry around a pair of headphones to use
the FM radio and i found the reception
to be pretty good i've been using this
indoors and listening to some radio
while I work and I just kind of place
the device on the table like this and
position the antenna and I get a great
FM radio signal since I'm in North
America I can't test the TV broadcast
unfortunately I I'd imagine that after a
while this would become loose and
probably break off you don't see many
cell phones with an antenna this is kind
of an old-school telescoping antenna
that you would find on your old CD
player and if you want to find the
stylist it's in the bottom right corner
which is always a good place it takes a
little bit of effort to take out the
stylus it's a telescoping stylus which
isn't preferred it feels kind of cheap
and flimsy as the telescoping variety do
but at least it's placed in a good spot
and that's pretty much it for the
hardware on the eton glofish be 900 the
next video will be the software and
features video that will cover all of
the interesting things that this device
does will actually turn it on and get
into the operating system that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
