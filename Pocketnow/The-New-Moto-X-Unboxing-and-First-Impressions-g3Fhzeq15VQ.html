now reviewer wanted to go back to after
they'd moved on to another device was
the Motorola MOTO X now it's available
in second generation let's unbox it see
what's inside so let's take a look very
plain white box it's got a nice recessed
moto Motorola logo Moto X on the side
just walk around this one apparently is
an AT&amp;amp;T unit and then the information
that's on the back of it let's go ahead
and slide this out it's a very tight box
that usually means you know attention to
detail and packaging hopefully
translates to attention to detail in the
product but that is a very tight fit
another walk around here
essentially what you'd expect box pivots
off and the first thing you're met with
unlike other devices where you see the
front of the device the the screen this
is the back and it's a nice kind of a
graphite gray it feels very nice you've
got the motorola thumb button or index
finger button and then the camera nice
there front and center lifting that up
and turning it around or you've got your
AT&amp;amp;T texting can wait logo go ahead and
set the phone down here just for a
minute and see what else is inside
you've got a nice envelope with a whole
bunch of stuff we'll come back to in
just a minute got our micro USB cable
white very square edges on that one and
then our charger this one happens to be
a double charger so you can charge two
devices at the same time so after
pulling out the flashlight taking a look
right down here it says that we are five
volts DC at 1,150 milliamp so one point
15 amps output which is not bad for
single port but for double it's a little
bit shy let's go ahead and take a look
also got our our sim tool very nice and
package that up put it back in there
let's look at our books quick start
guide and then our Motorola manual oh
and set that aside and let's take a look
at the device first of all again
graphite very very grippy feel without
being gritty without being slippery just
very nice it's an unusual feel something
that I haven't felt before on and on a
phone on a smartphone it feels kind of
like a soft touch but not quite AT&amp;amp;T
logo down here looks like laser etched
into the bottom of it so very very nice
over on the side we've got our power
button with its grippy edge to it and
then the volume rocker just nice and
placed perfectly up at the top we have
our SIM tray right in the center we've
got our headphone jack for the Michael
Fisher
pele exposure that he likes so much
there we go turning it on for the first
time press and hold bright screen now
one thing I'm noticing about the screen
got a a really nice kind of extended
power grill down here or power grill
speaker grill on the bottom and the top
very nice hopefully we'll get some good
sounds out of those camera up front
we've got a nice rounded edge not really
a chamfer but a rounded edge on the
screen and then of course that is not
going to touch the surface of whatever
you lay it down on because you've got
these speaker grills there to help it
stand up proud micro USB port on the
bottom and then our get started of
course we're going to cover all of that
and more in some upcoming videos make
sure you subscribe to our video channel
and of course follow us on your favorite
social media network we've got a lot
more information coming on this cool
little device in the next few days and
weeks as we do our full review and
additional coverage and you won't want
to miss out on any of that for pocket
now showing off the latest and greatest
from Motorola I'm Joe Levi thanks for
