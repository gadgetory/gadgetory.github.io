pocketnow.com today we're going to take
a look at the additional software
included with the verizon version of the
samsung omnia I 19 back in August
Brandon produced a detailed video
reviewing all of the Samsung software on
the omnia i900 this is the same base
software that is included on the verizon
version of the omnia I 19 I'm included
his YouTube video in the post on the
pocketnow.com site so please check it
out now let's take a look at the
software verizon included with the omnia
I 19 let's go to the samsung touch
friendly main menu first off let's look
at VZ navigator which uses the internal
GPS VZ navigator is a subscription-based
application which provides turn-by-turn
directions with integrated traffic as
well as search functionality to find
such things as restaurants and movie
showings unfortunately this is the only
location based application I got to work
with the integrated GPS I consider this
a big negative the next verizon
application is visual voicemail like the
iphones visual voicemail the application
downloads voicemail for you to listen to
offline you select the voicemail you
want and play it you can either listen
to your voicemail via the speaker or
with the phones earpiece i wish there
was a prominently displayed button to
select the speakerphone unfortunately
it's buried in menus and as you can see
i'm having trouble finding it
this is just not to user friendly but
otherwise having visual voicemail is a
great feature okay let's go back to the
Samsung main menu and next up is an
application called mobile IM this is a
verizon branded instant messaging
application which supports AOL windows
live messenger and yahoo IM it doesn't
look like it supports google but
although this is a very helpful
inclusion the last application we're
going to look at is VZ abs own which
provides a central place to view your
appts messages tasks news weather it
also provides a central place to
purchase and download third-party
application takes a little while to load
because i believe it goes out to the
internet here is the main screen and if
we move over and go to the marketplace
button and the buttons are a little
small for touch they really need to
re-engineer it for the omnia i900 cat
bestsellers and you can see right now
one calc from omega one is at the top of
the list you can select it purchase it
and download it and install it all from
this application so it's all very handy
i'm a big believer in one-stop shopping
for application it just simplifies the
whole process let's go back to the
samsung main menu and that wraps up the
roundup of the very helpful verizon
specific software which is included in
the omnia I nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
