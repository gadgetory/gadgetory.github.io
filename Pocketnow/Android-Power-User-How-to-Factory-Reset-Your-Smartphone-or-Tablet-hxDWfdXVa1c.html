users life when it's time to move on
when it's time to go from the old and
replace it with the new but there are
some steps that you need to do do you
want to leave your old just sitting
there on the shelf gathering dust maybe
you want to give it to a family member
sell it to a friend or maybe even put it
up on a classifieds website but it's got
all of your personal information on it
you don't want to give it away with all
of that so how can you wipe everything
and get it all ready for whoever it is
that's going to take on your device and
give it new life that's what we're going
to talk about on today's episode the
Android power user so I'm going to show
you how to do this on for devices the
steps are pretty much the same but there
are a few things you want to keep in
mind there are also a few things you
want to keep in mind if your device can
use an SD card like these two devices
can but these two devices cannot so what
do we have this is a t-mobile g2 this is
a samsung galaxy nexus of course the
motorola droid razr HD and the nexus 7
from google this is the t-mobile g2 or
the HTC Desire Z in its generic version
it's running right now a cyanogenmod
nightly version 7.2 point something or
other which means it's running
gingerbread android 2.3 point 7 so how
are we going to go ahead and take care
of this let's go ahead and hit menu on
the home screen and go into settings
from there we're going to come down to
privacy and factory data reset from here
this does have an SD card slot it does
have an SD card in the slot so we're
going to go ahead and say erase that now
word of warning sometimes this isn't
erasing what you think it's erasing
meaning some phones have an internal SD
card and an external SD card you might
not know which it is my advice take the
SD card out of your device after you've
run through this whole process just a
lot easier you're going to be in there
to get your sim anyway so go ahead and
do that
we'll go ahead and reset phone and now
ask you if you want to reset everything
and yes we do want to erase everything
in this case you can see I've got a
problem it's saying i have an invalid
path no so let's go back try this again
without the erase SD card and go from
there you can see that was causing me a
problem because well I don't have
anything on my SD card and some
developer didn't write for that
contingency it's going to go ahead and
run through the process usually this
will involve a reboot maybe two while it
wipes everything off the phone this is
currently my daily driver it's the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus the GSM variety but
i'll show you the first steps on how you
i'd go about erasing this one thing to
keep in mind this does not have an SD
card in it so i don't have to worry
about any of that i'm going to pull down
the notification shade and then hit my
settings button from there instead of
going to privacy like we did on the last
one i'm going to come down to backup and
reset and you can see that that's under
the personal section inside here I've
got all these options and factory data
reset tells me a little bit of a warning
that says this is going to erase the
internal storage that includes
everything music photos downloads and
all of your account settings now I'm not
going to do this on my daily driver just
letting you know this is Android
jellybean 4.1 point2 so I'd go ahead and
reset phone and that's how I do it over
there let's take a look at Ice Cream
Sandwich next so here we have the
motorola droid razr HD from verizon this
is the one that we've been reviewing for
the last several days if we want to go
ahead and reset this back we pull down
the notification shade hit our little
gear to get us into settings now this is
ice cream sandwich and we have to scroll
down again to privacy tap on that and we
are going to now factory data reset all
of thats already configured so let's go
ahead and reset phone it says this is
going to take about 10 minutes do we
want to erase everything yes now I do
not have an SD card in the phone but it
does have an SD card slot will this
erase that or not I wouldn't
chancit pull the SD card out when you
pull your sim out so that you're not
going to be giving that information to
someone else you might not have anything
on the SD card but it's relatively easy
to pull stuff off even after you've
deleted it that's just the nature of SD
storage this is Google's Nexus 7 tablet
it is running a cyanogenmod nightly so
it's the latest and greatest 4.1 point
to build of jelly bean to to reset this
we do the same thing we pull down our
notification shade we hit settings and
once we're in settings we find back and
reset under the personal section from
their factory data reset everything on
the tablet and it's just as easy as that
so as you can see resetting the data on
your device and getting it ready for
resale or giving to someone else isn't
all that difficult though there are a
few different ways to go about doing it
depending on the device that you have in
the operating system that it's running
another item to note in addition to take
out that SD card that's just a bonus tip
for you but another item to note is a
lot of times this is referred to as a
factory reset and that's a little bit
confusing because you're not restoring
this to a factory image at all in fact
if your device came with say Android
version 4.1 point one and then you
installed 4.1 point2 later on and then
you did a factory reset it's going to
reset it back to 4.1 point2 so it's not
going all the way back to factory the
same thing goes if you have cyanogenmod
or AOKP or any other custom rum you're
restoring it back to the factory version
of that custom rom that also includes
your custom recovery image as well so
it's not factory factory fresh so if
you're listing this on craigslist or
your local classifieds you don't want to
say it's factory you want to still say
that it's running whatever custom rom it
is unless you do want to do a factory
reset in which case it's not a reset at
all you've got to go out and you've got
to find the original factory images for
your device and then flash them all and
of course do it QC to make sure
everything's still working you didn't
break something in the
sess I wouldn't go that far I think a
custom rom is a benefit it's an added
benefit to your device but hey that's
just me what do you think hopefully you
feel a little bit more comfortable
wiping your device and reselling it or
giving it to someone else and giving
your device new life whether that's your
phone or your tablet whether it's stock
or custom instead of just throwing it in
a drawer letting it gather dust because
after all that's what Android power
users do instead of just keeping stuff
all around myself excluded because I got
to do videos like this we like to give
our stuff back to the community and grow
the Android power user base that's what
this video series is really all about so

to reset your device I'm Joe Levi thanks
