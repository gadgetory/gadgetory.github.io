disappoint most of its specs Motorola
also has a bevy of product announcements
today and we get the first photo of the
galaxy note 5 I'm hi Mary that I end up
yeah I know I got the wrong background
I'm still trying to figure that out but
the show must go on this is pocket out
daily the official news should i start
with tmobile as a the company has just
announced and carrier 6.0 in more
details the company has just nailed its
deal with Apple music you can now stream
it for free on t-mobile's network
meaning you won't be affected on your
data plan whenever you listen to Apple
music in addition to that they also have
this deal where you can actually pretty
much reserve your iphone success by
picking up an iphone 6 right now and
until Labor Day more details in the mix
of the description other official news
have Microsoft as a the company clearly
shows us that they love Android they've
just launched a new arrow launcher and
it's a different paradigm to with the
way launchers work you get three paints
that are fixed and when you get
applications and the other you get
people and then the other you get notes
and search settings and stuff it's a
really weird the launcher in its own way
but it's a different thing obviously we
will give it a try and let you know if
it's actually worth your time because
it's free now let's talk about Samsung
as a the company is clearly going to
revamp its Galaxy Note lineup we've seen
leaks we've seen renders but we finally
see a photo of the galaxy note5 in its
back and yeah it's glass and it's got
these very interesting curves on the
side or it could just be an effect of
the camera whenever taking the photo but
yeah it does seem that Samsung is
planning a major revamp and design let
this seemed to beat a gorgeous phone
let's just see if it lives up to the
hype with its specification Xin the way
it performs with all this change another
company that made headlines today is
motorola with its new Moto X and moto G
the Moto X style which is the pure
edition is one of these devices there's
actually a moto x play that will be
available in other areas but this moto x
style quantity display snapdragon 808 uh
interesting specifications you get mo
make sure you can even add microsd
support and it starts at 399 that's
crazy now in the case of the Moto G
obviously it is a budget phone in every
way but its specifications are also good
links in the description because we've
got a full editorial round table of
everything that Michael was able to live
at the event and finally I wish I could
say the interesting news of the day but
all news today were interesting
particularly Motorola but one plus also
announced the 1+2 we were able to get
some hands-on time with the phone and
well it is a should I say good update
it's an iterative update to the oneplus
one that we knew but there are some
interesting changes like for example 5.5
inch 1080p display snapdragon 810 not
expandable storage dual some options the
design is a really interesting with a
fingerprint scanner indeed there are a
lot of things that are cool about this
song but it is just so interesting that
it pretty much got overshadowed by the
new Moto X and it does lead me to the
question of the day the ads a pic 1 + 2
or new Moto X style which one would you
pick because in my case I would swap in
SD card on that moto x and get that one
for me but it was a comment down below
