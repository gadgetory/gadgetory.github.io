calm and we're going to take a hardware
a tour of the HTC 7 Pro let's go check
it out first off here we are you got
your nice 3.6 inch screen there up here
we got your logo and a speaker grille
for the handset down the air you got
capacitive flat buttons for back start
and search and you got another grille
here but that's not not a speaker or
anything that's just decoration the
bottom you got your microphone over here
we got your micro USB port volume up and
down toggle switch it's got a nice
rubbery feel to it
this whole piece is a rubber or rubber
finish at least around the top we have
our power button and a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack over here we got nice
little chrome II and we have our camera
button it's kind of really close to the
corner there it seems like it might go
off while you're in the pocket but
luckily the proximity sensor keeps it
from taking pictures whilst in your
pocket and we should have an LED light
in there in the speaker grille and it's
hard to see any proximity sensors but
I'm sure that it okay and then we got
keyboard and this is a really cool it's
spring-loaded sliding and tilting see
that it's a little hinge here that comes
up
and you'll notice there's no way to get
this battery car off when it's closed so
if I open it now there's a little notch
there and you can get it open like that
there we go so there's our battery and
you can get it out like that
and there's your SIM card slot and
that's about it
we have this big screw there and this
plastic is a little bit translucent as
you can see that kind of cool effect and
this is a nice metal back there you go
over here you got your speaker grill
five megapixel camera and a little LED
flash some logo HTC there nice chrome E
and the Windows Phone logo and back of
the screen there's nothing really
special there it is flat so that's that
four internals this is the European
version of the seven pro so it's only
got European 3G bands and it only has
eight gigs of storage inside there of
course the other stuff as usual Wi-Fi
bluetooth one gears processor Windows
Phone 7 so there you go now let's look
at the keyboard this is a very nice
keyboard we over here we have little
lights to indicate shift or function so
when that's on a device is off and you
have little holes all around the
keyboard and they go over here too
it can even see them inside the little
buttons those don't do anything but it's
kind of cool texture now the keyboard
let me show you our compares again to
the touch pro2 so you can see there's a
little bit less bevel to the keyboard on
the sudden pro but they feel pretty much
the same which is good because of the
touch pro2 has pretty much the best
mobile device keyboard ever and they
have a slightly less click to them but
they feel really about the same it's a
really really nice keyboard now some
people are going to ask are these stereo
speakers because that would be awesome
if you could be playing video and a
stereo speakers here but they're not
let's see if I can turn that this is the
only speaker that's the only time you're
gonna get audio it sounds good but it's
not stereo so let's see if we can get it
to show actually we'll do that in the
software tour so that's about it for the
hardware on these seven Pro and it's
pretty nice really quality stuff
keywords slides pretty good you've got
to remember to tilt it back because it's
not going to slide back when it's like
this and it can be tough if you don't
get it the right angle anyway that's it
for now HT 7 Pro stay tuned for a
software tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
