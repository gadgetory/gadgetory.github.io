over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's take another look at the round
SmartWatch that made round smartwatches
a thing
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the motorola moto 360 and this is
episode 43 of after the buzz the Moto
360 started out as the only circular
Android SmartWatch but it was never
gonna stay that way in the nine months
since its release it's been joined by
the LG G watch R and G watch urbane with
the Huawei watch also coming soon
add to that non Android wear offerings
like the Alcatel OneTouch watch and
Samsung's Orbis wearable and you might
think the Moto 360s scheen would have
faded but it really hasn't part of this
is due to its minimal design where other
watches feature prominent lugs and other
adornments the 360 is as simple and
streamlined as it get giving it a sense
of timelessness that still turns heads
even after nearly a year also the
stainless steel and Gorilla Glass have
held up very well over that time despite
frequent bashes against door jams and
table tops the casing bears very few
scratches or dings on my unit and those
who buy the 360 today have more
customization options than they did at
first release moto maker now allows for
a choice of three different casing
colors and a variety of watchbands while
I really liked the look and feel of the
stone leather band when I first bought
my 360
it's definitely aged into something less
attractive over time so you may want to
spend the extra 50 bucks to snag one of
the metal options
other aspects of the 360 have grown less
impressive over time too the screen is
still fine when considered a loan but
alongside newer sharper displays it's
not aging well and that has nothing to
do with the so called flat tire at the
bottom the fact that it's an LCD instead
of an OLED is just as disappointing
today as it wasn't launched considering
its impact on battery life in ambient
mode the smart charging pedestal and
bedside clock function are both
excellent additions you really can't
find anywhere else but the 360 also gets
pretty warm when topping up and it stays
warm until you take it off which doesn't
bode well for long-term battery health
in fact I feel like it's already
starting to lose some of its endurance
last fall I could sometimes get to the
end of the day with 50 percent remaining
nowadays it's down to 30 or 40 percent
by nighttime on the plus side you can
charge it on any Qi compatible charger
so if you already have a lot of those
for your Qi enabled smartphone you can
top up the 360 more easily or more often
Android wear has seen a few updates
since we first reviewed it last summer
and in concert with Motorola's own
upgrades and the ever-growing pool of
third-party apps and watch faces it's
now a much better SmartWatch platform
than it was
we covered the usability upgrades in our
Android wear lollipop video but they
include discreet notification modes
finer control of the screen brightness
in various situations and general UX
improvements to make using it less
cumbersome sadly the instability that
seems inherent to Android lollipop still
rears its head the voice control is
still quite often hit and miss and the
Moto 360s occasional lag in animations
and low framerate in general does get
annoying at times it's possible the
newest version of where the 5.1.1 will
smooth out some of these bumps as it
brings new features like Wi-Fi and a
further revised user interface but keep
in mind that the Moto 360s old OMAP
processor isn't as spry as the
snapdragons and the rest of the lineup
so we'll have to wait and see at a base
price of $249 the Moto 360 remains one
of Android where's pricier options even
more so if you go for upgrades like the
champagne gold finish or a met
banned and given its display and
processor compromises we'd recommend
seeing what Motorola's coming up with
for the 360s sequel which we expect to
see announced very soon before pulling
the trigger here but Motorola is also
huge into discounts as this video was
being put together the company was
running a promotion on its website that
offered the Moto 360 and the new Moto G
smartphone for $2.99
combined it was a short sale only four
hours long but Motorola does them so
often that it's pretty easy to get a
good deal if you can snag one of those
the Moto 360 is definitely still worth
picking up and if you already own one
you can rest assured that it's one of
the best smartwatches available all
things considered but if you're strapped
for cash obsessed with the cutting edge
or just on the fence wait till the Moto
360 second-generation hits shelves
before making your final decision if
you're curious about other smartwatches

Alcatel OneTouch at pocketnow.com visit

videos from PocketNow until next time
this has been michael fisher captain to
phones on twitter reminding you that a
flat tire isn't the end of the world but
a fat tire at the end of the day is
pretty cool see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
