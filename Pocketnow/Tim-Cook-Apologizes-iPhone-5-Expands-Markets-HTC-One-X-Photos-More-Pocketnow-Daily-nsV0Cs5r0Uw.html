the iPhone 5 is now available in u.s.
regional carriers in 22 more countries
and the HTC One x+ makes the news again
I'm high Meadow vivetta I'm still trying
to find my way back home Tim and this is
parking out daily that's right s
scheduled Apple is now offering the
iphone 5 and more areas starting with
regional US carriers where you can
actually get the phone a little cheaper
than you can in major US carriers for
example cricket is offering the phone
off contract for just five hundred bucks
that would be a good deal and it's also
available in 22 more countries mainly in
Europe though sadly as our colleague
entendi naga was reporting he
pre-ordered his in Hungarian and he's
gonna have to wait for weeks AT&amp;amp;T is
also announced adobe adding four new
devices to their LTE line of all made by
samsung first of all we've got the
samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 I hope I got
that right then we've got the galaxy
rugby and the galaxy Express all
mid-tier devices but the best of them
all is the galaxy note 2 which is highly
claim then you'll think yeah I left the
best for last though sadly we don't get
any dates as to when they will be
available but hey we've got a samsung
event coming for october 24th take a
wild guess now rim made the news again
because they accidentally leaked the
video showing off their blackberry 10
and series device which is a
front-facing curity phone and don't you
just love these leaks where your stock
goes up seven points just because of
that but anyways we've got a
front-facing curity device with a new UI
coming with blackberry 10 though sadly
we've got no other details except for
the fact that you'll have two devices
whenever this launches anybody excited
here um nope okay and yes we finally
have a photo of the HTC One x+ that
we're proud to show you though it's only
got a little red here in there it's the
same design of the One X though I love
the fact that it finally brings the
black that I would have loved in the 1x
that I have uh no dates no specifics as
always probably Black Friday is our
biggest guess and finally for the drama
news of the day yes believe it or not to
cook just publish the letter on the
apple website apologizing for the poor
performance of maps on iOS 6 according
to cook they fell short on their
commitment to customers and feel
terribly sorry they also offer a link to
their app store where they offer a full
feed of different maps application that
you could get and also leave an office
links to Nokia Maps and Google Maps
through a browser kind of a bold move of
the asked me but this leads me to the
question of the day how do you feel
about Apple's apology in my case I find
that good but I would have loved the $40
apple gift card to get garment USA leave
