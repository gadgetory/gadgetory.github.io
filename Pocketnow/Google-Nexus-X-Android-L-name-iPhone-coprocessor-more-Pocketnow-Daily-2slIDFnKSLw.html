coprocessor that's coming to the iphone
6 HDC teases its first 64-bit smartphone
for the masses and we get the possible
name for the motorola nexus palette so I
hema Rivera e SI puede leer lo so titulo
significa que pode olhar este vido ponyo
este spa kanawa diario let's begin today
with some official news that we could
call them that way as we remember the
rumors of the LG G watch too and as it
turns out it's actually more of an LG G
watch are according to the teaser from
LG we're talking about a round
SmartWatch that's coming from the
company and with some of the teasers
apparently this thing will be flexible
which is interesting let's see what we
get Aoife 2014 our own team would be
there covering everything live and
speaking of teasers another company
that's teasing its first 64-bit
processor smartphone is HTC it seems
that this will be the desire a 20 so
we're not really expecting a high-end
smartphone but then again the desiring
16 look very hot and then it turns out
that the images in the leak look very
interesting that doesn't look cheap and
apparently this will be powered by the
Snapdragon 615 processor which we still
have to confirm but stay tuned it'll
probably happen at efile now one
interesting that that just came through
is apparently samsung is not going to
end things with the Galaxy alpha and we
know that the metal chassis is coming to
the Galaxy Note 4 but no it seems that
there is this new line of smartphones
that starts with an a alpha is going to
be the first as esa is alpha and then
apparently we will have more devices
that start with an a though we don't
know if that will be part of the code
name or the name or whatever the case
will be it seems that Sam Singh is
creating this new line of a phones and
yeah looks are going to be everything as
if they didn't look like everything up
there than whatever Samsung does and
even more interesting tip comes from
Apple and this new codename phosphorous
motion coprocessor I know that's weird
it's not called the m8 as last year's
was called the m7 to assist the a7 and
as it turns out instead of just giving
you accelerometer gyroscope and comp
estate apparently this new motion
coprocessor will give you health data
like heart rate blood lovers and sugar
and stuff like that and my god I even
forgot them out of so many complication
but still it seems that apple will give
us that next step with its motion
coprocessor but apparently everything
will be paired to wearables and then the
question comes where are the wearables
let's see what we get and finally for
the very interesting news of the day or
rumors should we call them it seems that
we have two very interesting details
coming from google number one it seems
that the future motorola nexus cravat
which we don't know if it'll be a valid
anymore is going to be called the
motorola nexus x or google nexus x and
it could be that this event in Chicago
will be to announce this product though
it's very odd usually all Nexus
announcements are being handled by
google so this is extremely rare strange
not really sure if that's going to be
the case or it could be that we will be
getting the moto x + 1 and then this
will be the basis for the whatever Nexus
product we get later which could be the
case it's happened with LG in the past
and even more interesting it seems that
the final name for android l will be
lemon meringue pie I had to repeat
Mariah a couple of times in order to not
forget that oh my god that leads you to
the question of the day what do you
think should be the name for the next
version of android you know Android L in
my case honestly why don't we just call
it android l why do we need to call it a
pastry leave us a comment down below any
other names you'd like friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
