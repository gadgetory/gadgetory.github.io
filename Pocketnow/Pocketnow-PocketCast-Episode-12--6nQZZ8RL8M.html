episode of the pocket now podcast we
were just saying how we are now a
preteen podcast you know if you're 12
years old your preteen and so we must
have a curfew I don't know what that
means that actually makes no sense
whatsoever I'm brand a minimun
editor-in-chief of pocketnow.com and on
the line we've got a special guest dan
webster say hi damn hello everybody
hello hello and you might know Dan
Webster from many reviews on pocket now
he also does the windows phone 7 app
showcase and the android app weekly
every week he does does these videos
where he goes through a variety of
applications he covers them in in 30
seconds each so it's a very quick dirty
way to get you know some some sort of uh
I guess recommendations on apps that you
might want to download for your windows
phone 7 or your Android device so check
that out if you haven't yet they're
really interesting and they I love
watching them because I'm always looking
for new apps to uh to download so we're
going to do a little a little bit
of a shorter show this week probably 45
minutes instead of the full hour it's
Easter Sunday so we probably want to
yeah go on an Easter egg hunt or are you
are you going on an easter egg on down
and I'll actually have to work oh no
yeah it's been an interesting weekend
let me tell you will there be eggs at
work uh I doubt it but uh someone
destroyed one of our bathrooms oh no so
anyways how is that echo yeah so I've
been testing the echo or trying to use
it as my daily driver it's as I'm
probably going to conclude in the final
review whenever that happens to be
written it's a really good concept to
have two screens on a smartphone but the
use case scenarios are very limited
that's the problem number one problem
number two is that kyocera is making
this thing it's ugly the hardware isn't
great and it's backed by a name that
hasn't done really a smart phone before
to the first point when would you want
to look at your email while browsing
page on your smartphone I haven't run
into one situation yet when would you
want to look at google maps on one
screen and something else on another
screen it's just the use case scenarios
aren't there can you think of any
instances then when you thought to
yourself well by two screens on the
smartphone my life would be a lot better
mm probably not the only purpose that I
could see the alternate screen being
used for is a keyboard and if you're
that inclined to have a keyboard you
might as well have a you know a physical
keyboard on a device it seems kind of
weird to have two screens I mean if
you're in a watch a video you have that
you know you know black bar in the
center between the bezels so I don't
know it doesn't make much sense to me I
mean it may appeal to some others but
yeah seems kind of like a gimmick at
this point it is a gimmick and I think
kyocera thought you know how can we how
can we make headlines in making our
first smartphone and they did it but as
you imply the the black bar between the
two screens you know maybe in two years
when we could you know pack a dual-core
processor into this thing with better
hardware even higher resolution displays
and software that is even more optimized
for dual screens then we could have a
really compelling solution but right now
the technology is not ready the world's
not ready for a dual screen smartphone
yeah if they had like a AMOLED or
something that was flexible and you
could fold it out and it be flat that
would be okay but still I mean you have
a 4-3 aspect ratio between the two and
there's really nothing out there
nowadays that uses a 4-3 aspect ratio I
mean everything's in HD 16-9 so I mean
it doesn't make sense to have a screen
like that yeah I I guess you know it's
kind of cool when you flip out the two
screens and you look at like Twitter or
Facebook you get 960 x 800 resolution
which is sort of cool but I don't know
if it's that that much of a better
experience than if you were just used
one screen you know yeah other than the
screen I mean how is the other hardware
I mean it is co Sierra so is it just not
that great or is it fast and I would how
would you rate that well
it's a little bit slow it definitely
needs a dual-core processor to keep up
it needs a little bit more RAM it's ugly
as sin it's just it's thick it looks
like a prototype it really does and it
probably is very close to the prototype
what it looked like so it's it's got a
lot of problems in that respect it works
a little better than I thought it would
actually I mean the way you bring up the
two different applications is you press
two fingers or one finger on one screen
one thing or the other screen at the
same time which also happens to kill
multi-touch you can't use multi-touch in
these applications that can run in
parallel so kind of a kind of a pain
there to have to resort to double
tapping to zoom in it feels like it's
you know 2004 or something that's weird
how's the battery since it has those you
know two screens I mean is it worth it I
mean I saw that there were only six 13
over the 13 90 s up like that yeah
thirteen thirteen seventy the battery
life is tolerable if you leave automatic
screen brightness on and when you do
that the displays become very dim so if
you turn off automatic screen brightness
you'll go down about two percent every
minute sometimes three percent it's kind
of ridiculous well that's fast that is
true so what the full review coming up
soon on pocket now the kyocera echo with
performance benchmarks more remarks on
battery life and what it's like to live
with the dual screen phone really as a
daily driver so let's hop on to the next
thing on April eighteenth there was a
sort of piece of news talking about
Samsung launching a 2 gigahertz
dual-core smartphone for 2012 and you
know we heard that the galaxy s2 and the
HTC Sensation are going to ship with 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processors which
seemed really fast I mean think about
when your desktop computer had at one
point two gigahertz dual-core do you
remember do you remember when that was
then I think that was like 97 perhaps a
long long time ago but but the thing is
that like processors even though they
kind of maxed out at like four Gigot
Giga Hertz because of the you know
silicon technology it can only you know
do so much right so it I mean when will
the phones stop having super fast speeds
hmm I mean even just a couple years ago
we had like what four hundred megabyte
or megahertz processors and yeah the 409
so we're around for a while I mean
eventually i think this sort of happened
with laptops especially you run into
power consumption issues so it's better
to have more cores clocking in a lower
lower you know frequency than to have
what fewer course clocking in a higher
frequency exactly but then we talk about
this all the time on the podcast about
we're seeing an arms race really for
processor speed on smartphones I mean
all of a sudden we're seeing dual-core
processors and you know one gigahertz
wasn't enough for going to 1.2 and two
gigahertz next year what are we using
this power for I checked my email on my
phone I look at a YouTube video Android
isn't built for multiple cores can you
think of any situation that would
benefit from having multiple course
besides gaming of course the only thing
that I could see it benefiting is a hero
to record like Full HD or playback full
HD but the displays are gonna you know
make it smaller anyway so there wouldn't
really be and that's you know a
necessity to have a two gigahertz
processor with dual cores unless you're
going to be recording those those high
resolution videos that's night the only
thing that I could you know team we
reasonable to have such a yeah yeah and
even even in the case of a qhd screen
like on the sensation so you have 960 x
540 it can record 1080p but it can't it
doesn't have enough pixels on the screen
to play it back exactly and I mean you
know we have video cameras that only
have a very low processing speed in
their digital processors and they can
are there still able to record 1080p so
I mean it seems like a lot of wasted
power yeah I guess I guess if you want
to do some video editing on your phone
you probably benefit from multiple cores
that would be fun
that would be fun it might be a little
bit frustrating I mean editing video on
a desktop can be frustrating so let
alone a kind of phone oh yes so speaking
of multiple core processors and software
taking advantage of it or not taking
advantage of it Apple is reportedly
doing something that's very very smart
the iphone 5 which is probably going to
launch in September or so is likely to
have the a5 dual-core chip and so what
they're doing apparently is seating
developers with iphone fours with an
upgraded chip so the developers can
start working on apps to take advantage
of two chords because the operating
system will be able to handle it the the
hardware will be there so Apple wants to
launch the iphone 5 with apps that can
take advantage of two cores which is
such a great idea yes it's very smart it
seems I hope that they change the form
factor of the iphone from the iphone or
to a different iphone 5 but it is smart
to send developers a dual core
processing device because now they're
able to create better games and all that
great stuff I don't know is it the
iphone 4gs that they're sending them or
something like that yes I guess that's
kind of what it's called and and who
knows maybe maybe the iphone five will
be called the iphone 4 it wouldn't be
for geo that's trio 4 4 s 4 s they're
really messing with these names I mean
it's very likely that the the iPhone 5
is not going to be forgy capable meaning
LTE or it'll probably do hspa+
especially if it'll be on tmobile which
we're hearing about today inter be
really cool is if they just sent all
unlocked cdma gsm everything you know
that'd be pretty cool with me what do
you mean well if like they just sold
unlocked devices that you could go to
apple purchase kind of like you do in
canada you pick the carrier you want to
use you can either use verizon tmobile
or ATT and then you just do it like that
that'd be awesome if the the network
technology was similar enough to allow
you to do that yeah that's what they do
in Europe right I mean we were talking
about this last
I'm yeah it's it's a it's great freedom
to be able to buy a phone and then
choose the carrier but it's almost as if
in the US the carrier is the almost the
primary motivating factor I mean you've
got to get the right plan you've got to
get a service that you deem to be
reliable and good in your area rather
than starting with the phone and then
going to the carrier very much so pretty
cool alright well let us move on now the
next thing we're talking about in
previous podcast we were sort of
criticizing the windows phone 7 updates
because you know Microsoft released this
grid that said you know had februari
update listed and then March update and
it was like April and the februari up
they hadn't been delivered to devices in
the United States but they seem to have
catched up quite well it looks like
across the board except for the HTC
surround the the node 0 update and the
pre no no update have gone out however
AT&amp;amp;T sort of has tried to explain why
there was a delay with with the focus
and with the quantum and now with this
around which is that they added some
enhancements which i think is kind of
silly one allows you to automatically
switch between 18 key hot spots when
available units gets great and the next
one will allow support for the AT&amp;amp;T
address book what you know everyone uses
yeah what is the AT&amp;amp;T address book okay
I if I can remember I think it's a paid
for service that's provided by AT&amp;amp;T that
where they'll store your phone numbers
but who would use that nowadays I mean
we have outlook we have you know google
contacts so many services that are free
that allow you to just save your
contacts I think it's for people that
don't really know what's going on yeah
that makes sense it does i mean that's
like they don't know they don't know
that there's other options out there in
order to save their context yeah
there there are a lot of people like you
know like my mom and my dad and your mom
and your dad who would pick up a phone
like this and say oh you know I I don't
I don't know anything about storing my
contacts in the cloud so that they're
always backed up but look there's a
program right on my AT&amp;amp;T phone that does
that for me and it's only you know two
dollars a month or whatever I'm exactly
but um speaking of parents my mom is
still using a flip phone gotta get her
to I gotta get her on android or windows
or something something okay what what do
you think she'd be happy with you know
what I got her a nokia surge a year or
so ago and it was it was nice because
the keyboard was huge but she's she's
still having trouble so she should
rather use for long this is fun we're
talking about phones that Dan's mother
might like oh we can move on well
actually no this is kind of a cool topic
of conversation because I think a lot of
people you know that are listening are
probably young ish there might be some
you know older folks listening and we're
happy to have them where their parents
are still using foot bones feature
phones they haven't yet converted to
smartphones because they say you know
why do I need you know why do i need to
pay apps for a data plan why do i need
to check my email when I'm going out of
the house I don't care if I you know get
any email from from work my dad actually
got a smartphone for the first time in
in the summer with the iphone 4 and
naturally as predicted he loves it I
mean he checks flight times on the way
to the airport he checks his his bank
when he's you know what he's thinking
about it not near a computer uh but my
mom yeah she said she's still in love
with her her flip phone nice I let's see
I I don't even know what my dad's using
these days I think he just switched to
verizon most likely it's not a flip
phone I know that a lot of his friends
use Android so I don't know why he
doesn't get on the bandwagon maybe he's
a non-conformist he's kind of he's kind
of computer illiterate
oh that maybe he's got her illiterate
maybe yes he's 110 speaking of flip
phones it's been a really really long
time since we've seen a smartphone flip
phone I think the last one you know
recently was the blackberry what was it
the guy remember the name smart flip
right yeah something like that and
before that you got to go back to the
HTC Star Trek remember that oh I have
one it uses it's a pretty sweet device
just because um you know it it was it
was powerful for a flip phone yeah what
would I run windows it was a windows I
think it was five that it came with of
course you know changed that to six
point five or six point one or so like
that yeah I think they upgraded to 6.1
that phone you know Adam had when I had
one that was a really cool phone I mean
it was really it didn't have a
touchscreen it was kind of slow and you
couldn't do much with it you can really
browse the web very well but it was it
was it was a revelation to be able to
have smartphone capability in this
familiar comfortable flip phone form
factor so it was a pretty nice phone I
don't know why HTC decided to not go to
flip phones of course now we all have
slate so apparently they were right why
do you think HTC canned the flip phone I
think it was probably more design trends
people were probably fed up with the
flip phones although flip phones design
was was great because you wouldn't
accidentally dial someone like you do
today I mean yesterday I even
accidentally dialed someone on my iPhone
and mmm so did you have a capacitive
stylus in your pocket okay i'm such a
nerd but yes I did no way that's what
you accidentally called someone I don't
think that's how it happened but um I
did have a capacitive stylus in my
pocket because I if I'm at work I can
pretend that I'm writing on paper with
my
stylus and use my phone I'm a bad guy
man what can I say I hope I wasn't no
one from work is listening to these
differing state I hope not the reason I
mean at the end of the day if you want
to know why company doesn't make a
product it's because they don't think
it's going to sell I mean obviously
they're in a for-profit business and I
think this is one place where omz wrong
I think a flip phone would sell despite
it having to have a smaller screen I
mean the screen on the Star Trek or
whatever was about 2.5 inches it was
microscopic compared to the monsters of
today and first there are still people
out there that want a flip phone i don't
know i think we should do a petition and
if anyone listening is you know it feels
the same way about the flip phone form
factor and wants it back leave a comment
and maybe we can maybe let our voices be
heard or something like that you do a
poll we could do a poll in fact we shall
do a bowl i'm going to write that down
and i know we weren't supposed to talk
about flip phones but one more thing
that I really like about flip phones is
that you always got a dialer pad so you
open up the phone and you start dialing
to make a call it's not you know go into
the phone application go into your
favorite list or go into contacts hold
down the android button to bring up the
keyboard so you can type the name of
someone trying to call all right well
let's get back to our scheduled program
and we'll do a little pull about flip
phones because we can say speaking of
dialers why are we still having to dial
the entire number or search for a
contact why Cannot every single
smartphone just you know automatically
start finding who are searching for you
know just about dialing the first few
digits of the phone number or their name
is one of the biggest things that I
don't like about some smartphones is
that you're you're a hundred percent
right I the echo doesn't do it HTC
devices do it for those of you that are
unfamiliar we're talking about smart
dial so if you're trying to call Bob you
don't have to go into contact you just
type you know you look at the little
letters under the numbers and type that
way and maybe maybe it's an intellectual
property issue
mm-hmm but you know stock android
doesn't do it so maybe it's an HTC thing
can you think of another I mean the
iphone doesn't do it even so it doesn't
maybe HTC has the patent on smart dial
windows phone 7 doesn't do it unless you
have a HTC devices oh yeah actually I
don't even think it does add if you have
an HTC device hmm just because it's the
all you know lock down by windows that's
suspect yeah well uh are there are there
third-party dialers you can get on like
a sony ericsson device for like an
Xperia Arc sure um I'm sure there's
something in the android market I
haven't really looked that much I I've
used something on iOS but it was it was
horrible and it was even a paid for a
penis kind of upset that I paid for it
but um perhaps her stuff on the android
market maybe I should find something in
a yeah let's post but let's both look
and if we find something I mean this
will be very helpful to a lot of people
who find it frustrating to not get smart
dial in the dialer cool already so let
us move on to the next thing so Dan you
have a focus right I do yes and it just
updated just did let's see when it
update I think was last week on Tuesday
perhaps maybe I'm off yeah I think I
well I updated on tuesday because that
was the last time that i use that phone
and is it everything you hoped it would
be um you know what there really hasn't
been much change other than the the
market and the copy and paste but i
guess there was other features that were
added to the AT&amp;amp;T devices i never use
hot spots i always leave things on 3g
yeah or you know just use Wi-Fi at my
house I've I don't think I've I think
the only time I've ever used a hotspot
for ATT was added McDonald's in a
parking lot just because I wanted to see
what it worked how
how it work just to do a speed test how
did it work it was okay I mean it wasn't
the fastest i mean my thing like 3g was
even faster than that than the AT&amp;amp;T
hotspot so well you gotta go inside the
mcdonalds get some fries sit down and
then you'll get faster speeds oh no yes
so you know this node 0 update was a
rather minor it basically brought forth
features that should have been there
from the beginning and we're hearing
more and more about mango and we talked
about mango last podcast but this last
week we made a post which was actually
one of our most commented on posts in
pocket now history talking about nine
missing features from mango and I'll
just call out a couple of them and then
I want to read a couple of comments that
some of our readers wrote in about so
mango as far as we know by the way these
things might happen this is just what
we've heard so far no Wi-Fi and USB
tethering no screen capture no flash
support in the browser no support from
front facing camera and video chat no
turn-by-turn text-to-speech navigation
with offline support no third-party
keyboard support no landscape support
for the Start screen no sharing options
for video and no smart dial yeah so I
think the biggest ones of all these is
probably the Wi-Fi and USB tethering
because almost every smartphone that
comes out on every other carrier is you
know allowing users to access these
these features so they can connect their
other devices like their let's say their
kid is in the back seat with a PSP or
something and they want to go on to the
PlayStation Network well here you can
just access it online on your phone you
know on your PSP let me connect my phone
or or someone needs to use their laptop
really quickly well here you go you can
use that if you don't have a connection
somewhere right another big thing for me
is screen capture because if you don't
know if you've noticed but every photo
that I that I've gotten for the window a
windows phone 7 app roundup has been
offline or off of the zune marketplace
just because
I can't capture anything from the device
itself so they're kind of a stolen
pictures if you could say and I think
for others the flash support although
you know apple says that flash is going
away but but flash is a great thing to
have I mean I think that's why are
people with Android devices loved
browsing the internet so much is because
if you have android 2.2 or higher than I
mean you get all that flash support on
the internet it's just like being on a
computer so so yeah how important is
flash to you you know I it depends on
what I'm going to be using it for I use
flash um pretty regularly I've even
installed the fresh on my iphone 4 just
because I wanted to see how it worked
and it did not work as well as it does
on the Android devices let's see like
you know there's just so many websites
that use flash so yeah and you know it's
just the current state of the web right
now but but certainly I think the
consensus from all sides except for
adobe is that html5 is the future so
here up here are a few comments there's
there were a lot of comments for and
against our article saying you guys are
crazy stop trying to be critical and
other people saying yeah you know I
totally agree with you here are some
other features the windows phone 7 could
have so I'm just going to do a small
sample here this is from Mikado whoo
then pronouncing that right being a new
windows phone user I freaking love this
phone and say I'm so happy at long last
to drop my droid here is what I would
like to see added honestly put in the
musts I don't understand what that say
but you're here is a must or the musts
more bulk stuff bulk SMS pictures video
and so on so you can do more actions at
one time custom ringtones which actually
will be in mango by the way full zune
experience create playlists and smart DJ
zune has a lot of really cool features
the zune HD that Windows Phone 7 doesn't
have so I understand that and of course
he brings up smart dialing here are some
good ones things that
phone needs hdmi output windows phone 7
doesn't support it this is kind of om
specific USB on the bottom what's with
this side crap messes up my dock in my
car that I made no need for ashtray nice
what do you think then USB port on the
bottom of the side I would probably say
the bottom the focus hasn't on the top
and it's rather annoying yes we are the
top is thumbs down for that I mean I
guess it matters what you're doing with
your phone I've heard the the argument
about the the car dock Adam also made a
car dock and he puts the the jack in the
bottom which makes a lot of sense so the
one on the side is kind of weird it
looks like HTC is going towards side too
so people were gonna have to get used to
that finishing up this comment he said
things that can wait front-facing camera
we are two years away from this being
really mainstream cool to have but not
needed yet tether he said okay this
could be nice however I've rarely not
been around an access point and when I'm
not I should not be on the net anyway
it's a good point here's here's a really
good list from Philip Jones and then
we're going to move on to the next topic
let's see here ability to save location
in being mapped better camera settings
and have the ability to take photos with
a touch of a button or have a timer to
lower camera shake that's a good one
this is interesting the office software
is worse than on windows mobile 6.5 why
what do you think about office on
windows phone 7 10 I've only used it a
few times it's okay if you're going to
open up documents to create new
documents it's kind of a pain I couldn't
see anyone ever using it to create a
PowerPoint document but to create a word
document really quickly if you just need
to type something up it works pretty
good it's nice to be able to change some
of the fonts and let me see can you
change the parts i think you can you can
yeah yeah you can change the font and
you can increase the size and stuff but
other than that I can I
see anyone you know creating a super
rich powerpoint presentation on their
windows phone 7 device and i don't think
i don't think that's what anyone wants
to do nor what microsoft and has
intended Becker but I don't think it's
worse I think it's pretty similar to
what it was before plus you know they
have a pretty robust commenting engine
built into it which is handy when you're
collaborating with people I mean there's
a lot better now that you can copy and
paste yeah ok so here are some others
make the keyboard whiting wider when
typing in landscape I believe you get a
menu item on the right when you're in
landscape and typing and then there's a
black bar on the left so that makes
sense support for dual-core processors I
think that Microsoft could potentially
beat Android to this be Google to this
because android of course doesn't
support multiple cores right now
honeycomb probably does let's see in a
couple more DLNA and Bluetooth 3.4 oz be
on the hardware level a file explorer
with the ability to transfer files via
bluetooth we're never going to see a
file explorer in Windows Phone 7 it's
very anti what they're trying to do and
native micro as addy support yeah I I
agree with that do you remember the
whole fiasco dan with the microSD you
know the focus happened to have a
external microSD port but you had to be
careful with it yes and I used a card
that was not that great I think it was
like a class 2 was 16 he go gigabytes
and the phone would freeze constantly so
I had to switch back to a higher class
of 8 gigabyte car just because the other
card I don't know if it was a failure in
the card itself or what was going on but
it really does matter which kind of hard
to use just because the focus was able
to you know you could switch the cards
out and a lot of the other devices you
can't but I think that they should allow
people if they want to upgrade the
memory I think that would be Intel
on their part just because I mean rumors
are true the iphone 5 or 4g or 4s or
whatever it will have like 64 gigabytes
of memory and you know a lot of other
devices are able to use a 32 and when
they come out with the newer technology
I think it will be able to go up to 128
gigabytes on an SD card with that it's
amazing yeah and it's also a big cost
savings for the OEM to have the option
to put in a diminutive amount of memory
on the phone like on the key of Secrets
Sarah echo there's like 500 megabytes of
storage but I mean who really cares
what's inside on the device if you can
if the device can come with a storage
card that's that's the best case
scenario or if you can go and buy a
cheap you know 8 16 32 gigabyte microSD
card I mean it's a it's very necessary
nowadays given how costs are to have a
have an external microSD slot I agree
yes very good let us move on I don't
know what kind of accent let's move on
to our next story um the sony xperia
sony ericsson xperia arc which is what
you reviewed right then yes awesome
device awesome does asus it was a really
great smartphone other than it being
made mostly out of plastic it was nice
and thin it felt good in hand it took
phenomenal photos I couldn't believe how
great the photo quality was in both the
video and just regular you know still
photos hmm so you must be excited that
it's coming to the US yes and I do
appreciate that sony ericsson is going
to you know unlock the bootloader so
that you'll be able to access things
that most you know most androids aren't
able to do just because there's a
lockdown yeah yeah that is very what's
the word it doesn't seem very open
source like you who wanted the Android
operating system to be I mean if that
makes sense yeah purpose of it was to be
open source so I mean if they keep
things locked down then
it's not really to open to everyone so
well that I think that part is just up
to the OEM Google really can't control
that I mean they I'm sure that Google
wants the all of these hot pieces of
hardware to come with unlocked
bootloaders but the the OEMs don't want
to get calls to their support line
constantly saying i bricked my phone
because i installed something i did
explode nice mom it also the screen on
the Xperia Arc was really really clear
you couldn't he couldn't see it in video
but watching watching videos on the
device I mean it was like watching them
on an HDTV just because it was so clear
and the transitions from frame to frame
was just so smooth I mean it can't even
explain how how clear the device was
just because of the Mobile BRAVIA Engine
so you think that made a big difference
I think it did um I believe that it
turns on when you're doing a graphic
rich media and stuff like that so and it
would turn off if you're just using the
home screen isn't like that it it must
be cuz when i was at CES and i did a
hands-on of this I basically went into
the settings it was off and I flipped it
on and I said nothing's changed this is
stupid but but it sounds like I should I
sort of shortchange the arc and that the
bravia magic happens we're actually
doing something that would take
advantage of it yeah another cool thing
that sony ericsson incorporated into
this device is you are able to connect
it because it does haven't made a
micro-hdmi port on it you can connect it
directly to a bravia television and it
will even turn the TV on I have a bravia
tv and unfortunately I didn't have a
cable I wanted to try it out I didn't
have a micro HDMI cable so I did see
videos online showing that it was able
to turn the TV on and you know show
exactly what was on the screen on the
large screen so that was great if you
want to share things I don't know how
practical that would be to a lot of
people but it was nice to have the
option so so it will turn on your TV
just by plugging your phone into it yeah
if you have a bravia powered television
it'll turn the TV on what are the other
advantages well it was great because you
could show the impact it would it would
convert I think it would change it to
also portrait and landscape depending on
which way this the phone was and you
could share videos and stuff like that
huh so I don't know how many people
would use that I guess if you were going
over to Grandma's house and she had just
gone over just gone to Hawaii and wanted
to show you our slideshow then there you
go grandma has a tube TV with bunny ears
I don't think I this isn't going to
happen here nice anyway so yeah so the
artist coming to the US which is Grange
the great phones then this summer on a
gsm carrier so there are only two
choices for that all right let's uh
let's move on Apple is suing Samsung and
it's over a lot of things but most
notably and most understandably is the
the appearance of not only the this
galaxy estan the whole galaxy s line of
devices the fascinate the what are the
other ones there's like 15 the epic the
captivate and the fascinate did I ever
seen that I said that and and the icons
just how the the icons look next to each
other and sunny Businessweek did an
article showing side by side you know
the iPhoto application with the Samsung
photo application the Settings icon with
the Settings icon on the other thing and
they are so similar I understand why
this lawsuit is happening that's exactly
what I thought when I got the galaxy s a
year ago I was like wow this is a 3gs
and the iphone 4 just came out I was
like are they going to copy the iphone 4
and apparently they thought that was a
good idea to also but the weird thing is
like why would Apple be suing them when
they were the manufacturers of their
processors before so
I mean I don't know it all depends on
who wants money i guess but yes i agree
they do look very similar to one another
i mean even even the you're right even
the apps look like iOS apps I mean
they're just the same shape the rounded
corner square and I mean it looks very
similar you know Apple has trademarked
the daisy flower representing their
photos application they trademarked a
flower oh yeah they did um I do not know
that they were among many many many
other things so so if you look at the
the galaxy s photo application there's a
flower in the background and so I mean
why couldn't they put a dog or not a sky
your sunshine or something or smiley
face I mean maybe someone has a smiley
face trademarked already walmart perhaps
well uh yeah but you know fortunately i
guess it doesn't really matter to the
average consumer because this is
probably going to draw on for years and
years but the new version of TouchWiz
coming to the galaxy s2 is very
different than iphone they've redone it
quite substantially well that's a very
intelligent move on their part so they
don't get sued again but we'll see the
if i can remember the form factor looks
really similar to the iphone for me it
was a you know kind of like a square
device yeah what with the flat edges
yeah i mean i mean it's hard to avoid
that iphone look I mean it's you're
right i mean i'm looking at now it does
it looks like the original Galaxy S
which looked like the iphone 3gs but
what are they going to make a triangular
phone hear me yeah yeah and um I don't
know it's it's weird on Apple's part
that they should be so offended that
people would want to be similar to their
devices yeah yeah um
that I guess the the question at the end
of the day is has Samsung's actions to
make their product appear to be like an
iphone then detrimental to iphone sales
does someone go into a you know a
verizon store and see the fascinate that
and see the interface which kind of
looks like an iphone and says hey you
know I can't I can't I get the iphone
it's much more expensive but this
fascinate is hundred dollars less and it
looks like an iphone so I'm gonna get it
and forget the iphone yeah i doubt it i
think if someone's gonna get an iphone
they're going to get an iphone I've had
friends that actually had a past me and
they wouldn't got the new iphone for
verizon i was because they wanted to use
it and I was like I was like that's cool
i mean the apps are great for iOS course
but but yeah i don't think people would
confuse the two i think i think if they
try one out and they like one they're
going to choose that one opposed to the
other so i don't think i don't think
they would be confused by the the form
factor or the applications on each or
you know the platform on each yeah good
point well we'll see what happens with
that as you implied Apple and Samsung of
a tight relationship they provide you
know samsung provides formerly formerly
processors and I think the solid-state
memory comes from Samsung right I think
so if i can remember correctly so it
seems weird that you know with a
partnership that you would want to see
them that would be like you know if i
was to see you which would be really
stupid um okay oh yeah like if you're
gonna see like one of your friends I
mean yeah yeah yeah no it's a good point
ya see what happens with that let's move
on to more iphone stuff so we saw this
video around 19th of April showing off
what might be iOS 5 point and the the
folders looked a little bit different
but what was most striking is that when
you double tap on the home button you're
taken to a zoomed-out card like view
that gives you a preview of the open
applications I guess the question here
is is this is this iOS 5 is this
something Apple would do you know I
think that's a jailbreak option I've
heard that you can get that just by
jailbreaking your device and then using
Cydia to find that hmm that's
disappointing yeah and uh yeah I think I
was a good vietnamese video that came
out of a white iphone with iOS 5 but uh
the settings that iOS 5 so we'll have to
see yeah we should find that if you can
find that uh that said yeah I'll look
let's see solo we'll see yeah but um I
mean it's kind of a cool idea right now
you DoubleTap and you see icons it would
be probably a little bit more intuitive
if you were to see a little live preview
of what yeah the contents of the app it
could be neat alrighty let this move on
just a couple of more things to talk
about here so we've been talking about
how the iphone is probably not going to
come out in time for its typical release
cycle june july and reuters has come out
to say that it's actually shipping in
September Reuters is a very you know
accurate source and so you can you can
you can take that to mean what you will
but it makes sense because there's also
rumors that the ipad 3 is coming out as
soon as September and they're doing this
to align the release dates of their
their products i mean the the new ipods
always come out in in september-october
in time for the holiday season and why
not all of their products so they can
you know stop doing this Jill this you
know April for ipad and june july for
the iphone um I guess there's not much
else to say about that yeah other than
people might not want to shell out
thousands thousands of dollars in in one
month when / months they could they
could do that you know let's see what
kind so the ipad comes out in april and
then you can get an iphone in june and
and you know an ipod in September if you
wanted to for a friend or something
destiny so yeah to have all of them come
out at the same time I mean it makes
sense on their part just because I don't
believe that the iPhone 5 is going to
come out in June just because we haven't
seen anything and in the past we've
always seen rumors unless they're just
keeping everything so tight oh you know
just so tight that they're not having
any people have any of their prototype
devices out there or anything like that
so after what happened last year that
yes probably i doing yep so uh you won't
be finding an iphone 5 and a bar this
year that was that was an epic situation
in the tech community really was amazing
can it you know it didn't even look like
it was going to be the iphone 4 like you
saw and you were like okay is this a
mock-up because it was just so different
from the previous builds of the of the
device so yeah it was nice it was nice
that it came out like that because the
iphone 4 was was a pretty sweet device
so yeah it is this it was and it is all
right let's move on final thing we want
to talk about today remember the Samsung
Infuse 4G West which was announced I
think at CES remember that phone yes it
was a big phone I mean I'd like what
like a four and a half inch screen and
it was super amoled yeah so but it looks
it looked like a really great phone to
have so yeah yeah so as you said 4.5
inch screen which is the biggest the
biggest I guess you could say the dell
streak was the biggest at five inches
but that was how it's just so big like I
couldn't see people using that as a
phone it would be like if you were to
use a galaxy tab as a phone so that's a
funny sight yeah I don't think anyone
used to streak as a phobia of just a few
people but the infuse 4g has that large
super amoled the biggest super amoled
screen in fact i think it's the super
amoled plus
okay well even better yeah this thing's
going to be a monster 1.2 gigahertz it's
basically the galaxy s2 but on a TNT
with their non-existent hspa+ network
plus a bigger screen yeah what's up with
that y is 8 why did AT&amp;amp;T release devices
when their network wasn't able to you
know cover it so uh oh here we go I know
I know that you've had a 4g device on
ATT and have not yet seen any hspa+
network speed is that true yeah what
about you over in Washington and you
know I haven't used a 40 device on a
teensy just just because I've heard that
you know it's not available I mean it
could be in the metropolis of Seattle
but I don't think it's out here where i
live i live in lake tapps so it's a
little bit south of seattle i think it
exists in a cave in arizona somewhere
there's there's one tower that is
underground almost if you crawl into
this hole and it's hard to get in there
because the size is kind of small so you
have to maybe lose a few pounds before
going this hole but once you get in
there you get crazy HS b plus speeds on
18 d nice then you could just go over to
verizon user LT yeah you could but at
the same time these you know the atrix
and the inspire and I think the infuse
are very thin devices which makes them a
little bit more compelling than say
verizon where the thunderbolt and the
the LG revolution and the upcoming droid
stealth are pretty thick because they
have the cdma modem plus the the LTE
modem to separately two totally separate
components whereas these AT&amp;amp;T phones
have the you know the same sort of modem
plus I'm not even sure if there's much
more hardware needed beyond that
probably not it's probably just the
processor does everything they don't
need a separate a separate chip like
they do in the 4g devices on sprint and
verizon
there's got to be some modification
because if it was just a matter of the
you know existing internals though they
would be able to flip on hspa+ for you
know like the captivate for example but
there's some hardware that's got to be
involved but we are not we're not
electrical engineers so well it doesn't
it doesn't really make sense to even
call hspa+ for DS but so so there you go
I don't know Dan I don't know if I three
I mean hspa+ in optimal conditions
especially if you've got like a tmobile
g2x can do wicked fast speeds I mean
they could rival where LTE is today yes
but the term of 4G is no fourth
generation technology and they're only
using like 3.5 g if you think about it
cuz you know in Europe they have the
hspa+ networks but they've had him for a
while and it was just think just call it
3.5 so I don't yeah from a technical
standpoint I agree I agree with you but
as a consumer I pull out a thunderbolt I
can get 10 megabits per second down if I
pull out a g2x or another maybe the
mytouch 4G I can get around there
sometimes a little bit less sometimes a
little bit more so to me I guess I'm
fooling myself I really don't care what
it's called it's getting these
incredible fast speeds that does make
perfect sense it shouldn't be what it's
called it should be based upon the speed
that you're getting and unfortunately
we're not getting those beats from AT&amp;amp;T
anymore there's only one podcast where
we don't talk about this okay we could
edit this part out if you want um
actually today I ran a speedtest here we
go again I ran a few tests on my on the
inspire 4G I got a pretty good 3
megabits per second down which is about
as fast as you can go around here with
hsdpa and then I did the upload test and
again it was like 600 and then I went
into about network and I I always do
this I check because it'll tell you if
you're on the hspa+ network and I was on
dpa so see maybe they maybe they do have
hspa+ in my network because on my iPhone
I get you know five mega bits per second
speed so I don't know well you're on
loading the iphone is in queda has has
the hsupa unlocked unlike other devices
so I think what you're experiencing is
just a really fast hsdpa I mean the
theoretical maximum is pretty more you
practical maximum is what you're
describing around four or five yeah so
it's definitely not 4g I know that but
yeah we'll see we'll see well that will
conclude our podcast and it was really
great having you I think we we had a lot
of fun here and it's good to have you on
thank you very much I appreciated it and
it was a blast let me tell you very well
I hope everyone enjoyed the podcast and
we'll talk to you or see you or you'll
hear us next week thanks for listening
