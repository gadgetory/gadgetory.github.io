pocket now calm and this is a look at
Android 2.0 point one that's Eclair
running on an HTC touch diamond2 a
device that comes with Windows Mobile of
course the guys at XD developers have
posted an emulator that will allow this
to run very smoothly it's very easy to
use - I'll push the link on
pocketnow.com you definitely don't want
to use this as your daily operating
system a lot of things don't work or I
should say most things don't work the
general software experience does work
but Wi-Fi and the phone just don't
function so let's take a look at what
it's like running on this device
okay so we'll unlock the screen and we
have the standard Android interface here
we can go to the to the left we can go
to the right we can tap and hold to move
the widgets around on the screen we can
bring up the application tray here and
we can flip through all of the
applications here of course not all of
these work only the ones that don't
require internet internet access like
the calculator and we go back to the
home screen by doing call end and
sometimes there's a lag in doing that
okay here we are
and we can go back into the application
tray let's go to the calendar which
probably won't work this is going to ask
to synchronize with a Google account
yeah and there it's a sign in with your
Google account we can't do anything
there let's go back to the home screen
go back into the applications let's tap
on something like let's go into this
program I lighter it should work doesn't
require internet access looks to be
working quite well and I oh I see you
can flip open oh that's pretty neat and
you can flip close the lid I guess you
can light the lighter it's kind of a
novelty but it works you can move the
flame around very neat let's go back to
the home screen and of course we can
pull down the notification shade the
window shade of course we have no
notifications but it does recognize that
I'm on 18 T that's good I tried to make
a call but couldn't because the phone
dialer failed let's go into settings and
sort of what we have here so we go
through the standard Android settings
privacy and I'm not sure which one of
these is the back button it should be
this but that doesn't go back so you
have to go back to the home screen as
far as I can tell to actually go back so
we can go to say a sound and display
turn on silent mode turn off silent mode
all this stuff works for the most part
and then we can go into applications and
really there's not too much you can do
in here
also you can check off if you want
applications from unknown sources you
get the pop-up now it's checked off and
you get the point so really not too much
that you can do but it's really fun to
actually run it and see it working not
too bad on the on the HTC touch diamond2
certainly any application that requires
internet access won't work but a lot of
things actually surprisingly do work and
not too bad so this is the gallery
application and got some pictures here
that we can tap on hopefully it'll go
fullscreen we can maybe swipe to the
side or actually tap the arrow we get a
little slideshow we can set as wallpaper
see if that will take and here's here's
an example of the errors you get the
application camera has stopped
unexpectedly please try again so that
did not apply the wallpaper so again if
you want a taste of Android 2.0 point
one on your HTC touch diamond2 we'll
post a link on pocketnow.com
on how to get it to run that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
