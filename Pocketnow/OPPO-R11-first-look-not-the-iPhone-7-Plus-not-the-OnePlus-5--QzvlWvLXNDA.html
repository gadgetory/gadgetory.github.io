and I'm in China specifically camping
out for a couple days in Shenzhen to
spend a little quality time with the new
Oppo our 11 a follow-up to one of oppas
most successful phones the design is
sleeker the cameras are improved and the
phone is running the newest mid-range
chipset from Qualcomm the r11 gives off
a nice first impression
well machined pushing antenna bands to
the corners and edges and the matte
black model makes those bands really
discreet this seems to be the final
evolution of this style as other
companies are pushing boundaries in
other ways we wouldn't disagree from the
comments we're short again about this
phone and similarities with other
devices a significant focus has been
placed on camera improvements which
always make me happy dual shooters are
all the rage and Oppo is serving up a
standard view and a zoomed sensor 20 and
16 megapixels respectively the two can
work in tandem to produce a pretty
bouquet background blur mode the
portrait processing here feels familiar
and worked well on the Oppo show floor
even when shooting blind on a rear
camera selfie you shouldn't have to rely
on shooting blind though as the
front-facing camera is also a 20
megapixel shooter and Oppo has a solid
reputation for delivering on the selfie
game I'm just terrible at testing out
selfies so yeah moving right along
Oppo has worked with partners closely on
this phone reaching out to welcome to
help improve image processing so we're
looking forward to testing image quality
claims and the speed of image rendering
first impressions are on point
highlighting the feature is most likely
to resonate with consumers beauty
filtering high quality 4k video a fully
stocked manual mode increasingly all the
camera stuff we should expect on nicer
phones we can't dig too deep here though
is this is still early software and a
few gremlins like white balance while
zooming need to be ironed out but we're
confident Apple will address this before
release a quick look at software the
color OS skin has received a bit of
polish but if you're not a fan of making
Android function more like iOS this
won't win you over again early days but
it is a simple layout and the phone
handles
with that issue this could prove to be a
great time for upper mid tier chipsets
Oppo claims a healthy bump in
performance while also taxing the
battery less the Snapdragon 653 was
notorious for running warm but newer
chipsets like the 625 have proven to be
consistent in power efficient performers
we're very curious to see if the 660
will continue that positive trend the
combo of 1080p display in 3000 milliamp
hour battery should help this chipset in
keeping this phone powered all day long
the R 11 plus was also unveiled
increasing the form factor with the
6-inch display taking the RAM up to 6
gigabytes and bumping the battery up to
a four thousand milliamp hour capacity
expecting this should definitely be an
all-day battery runtime champ I'm not
always the biggest fan of phablets but
the strategy of big phone little phone
seemed well executed here in my opinion
and there you have it folks
Oppo score to hit with the r9 they're
hoping the r11 will build on that
success and we want to hear from you
does Apple have the right package to
excite consumers is it the right
response to increasingly cutthroat
competition drop us a comment down below
