letter from bargain a comma we've got
God Allah here and we've also got Mike
and we've got the samsung galaxy beam
and they're trying to beam me up Scotty
but ok trying we gonna do what we can
because you know wanna see ya white on
white it's not going to be a good idea
but tell me about the phone tell me
what's great about this galaxy beam I
mean we've been hearing about pico
projectors for a long time but first
time we really see an implementation
tell us about it first thing to know is
that you can project anything you want
you can project from videos that you
already have here due to videos that it
download and see at the moment features
you can even a project something like a
paper that you have in your hand hey you
have like a vacation through the camera
there you go so if you have a paper in
your hand like a contract whatever
you protect it I'm sure whoa okay then
you have a ambience mood settings like
you can set the alarm for you can wake
up with a video whatever you want you
can also go to sleep watching a movie it
lasted three hours the battery so it's
really good that you can see the full
movie and you can also switch it off
with an alarm like so you make sure that
even even if you sleep what should be
the optimum distance from the phone to
the wall to meet you to get the highest
quality okay its a 50 inches 50 inches
ok how many lumens does this pico
projector 1550 moving surface the dlp
imaging technology and it has a1g God
will core dual core processor yeah what
other specs how many gigabytes of RAM
and storage uh it has 8 GB gigabyte yeah
painter capacity of 32 ok you also have
was I can say oh it's it's going to be
lounging on the first half of the year
photography going to be gingerbread
first but it sir tell me about the ice
cream sandwich ice cream sandwich they
don't have a date yes ok hold it
probably show it around after lunch ok
so we've got a front facing camera here
speaker grill got a home button here
with capacitive comb no capacitive venue
and back when you reject your
application let's try to get there ok
hello projector where are you know what
do you have are you we've got the galaxy
s2 here's applications nice comparison
ejector
yeah there you are everything I
explained is here projector you have the
ambience mood here if you are up seven
yeah well this is the alarm good okay
the protectors up here I guess yeah and
also different of electrons you can do
the quick back ok big fat if you have a
PowerPoint presentation you want you
have a pointer okay did you cannot just
you know you point here with your finger
and interesting a little project itself
over there somehow it back and then you
have a pen that you can you know
underline within the presentation will
be showing all off at the top you can
change the color the thickness then you
have an eraser that you can erase
everything that you have done before
okay okay then if we go back to the
settings
there's some you can also turn off the
screen it only thing all user conducting
to save battery life yeah and you know
that I don't know if I have said that
already but you only have to if you want
to switch it from a like picture to
landscape like a vertical horizontal you
just have to press you okay that button
right chitwan and then you met next time
you press you hold it and it's going to
switch this compared to the gs2 okay
we've got the galaxy s2 in the thickness
comparison here
a little bit thicker but obviously hey
it's got a pico projector here and so
it's kind of understood yeah it's kind
of understood we got the power button
the microSD slot at the top pico
projector here and then over here off
the side we got the volume rocker the
sim entry here in 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and then we've got
microUSB what kind of battery do we have
here how much time does it last with all
the speaker projector with that if you
put the whole thing I mean there's an
accessory like pika bones and everything
yeah it's three hours left to enough
removing okay one of the things people
aren't necessarily watching movies with
these yeah as much as you're like oh
check out my facebook update I did last
time look at this YouTube video I family
and they're sharing it for impromptu
there are ends like on the wall at
school or whatever getting this mainly
has an entertainment device for more
like as a business it could be both it
can be pricing and pricing up for the
phone what do we have a price for the
farm diet progressing well it doesn't
look cheap and it doesn't look it's
going to be here it looks good in
assuming yeah it looks mid tiered but
the nice thing you know definitely you
know if the price is right this could
definitely not be a novelty I mean
probably Samsung place it on the market
initially we'll see about that but well
thank you very much god allah and mike

bargain now calm
