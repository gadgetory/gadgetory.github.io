there you go so if you have a paper in
your hand like a contract whatever
you protect it I'm sure whoa okay then
you have a ambience mood settings like
you can set the alarm for you can wake
up with a video whatever you want you
can also go to sleep watching a movie it
lasted three hours the battery so it's
really good that you can see the full
movie and you can also switch it off
with an alarm like so you make sure that
even even if you sleep what should be
the optimum distance from the phone to
the wall to meet you to get the highest
quality okay its a 50 inches 50 inches

farm diet progressing well it doesn't
look cheap and it doesn't look it's
going to be here it looks good in
assuming yeah it looks mid tiered but
