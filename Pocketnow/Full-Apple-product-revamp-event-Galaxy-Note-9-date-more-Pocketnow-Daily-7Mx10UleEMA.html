this fall when it comes to products
including some long overdue changes we
got new renders of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 along with when to expect them in
stores and they've you're into
blockchain like all three of you HTC is
definitely cooking up something for you
I'm Jaime mater Iveta and I want to
believe that Croatia is gonna win the
World Cup oh my god
this team has surprised everyone such a
great World Cup this is pocket out daily
beat official news today begin with
deals as Amazon's prime day is also
going to include some deals when it
comes to honor devices if you're into
the EU 10 for example it's give me $100
off 399 that phone is a really
compelling deal in addition if you're
going for the honor 7x that's just $30
off the phones already crazy cheap so
either one of these devices as
compelling you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about other
deals now this time from B&amp;amp;H I mean if
you're into an LG g7 think you it's
currently on sale of you want the unlock
64 gigabyte variant but probably the one
that surprises me the most is the dual
pixel to excel there are cases where you
can find the front to half off as they
restock definitely oh my god the pixel
to excel why is it so cheap this phone
is really one of my favorites of the
year and last year again more
information in the description now for
all three of you that are into
blockchain in addition to everybody on
Twitter that claims to be an expert you
remember that HTC blockchain phone that
we heard back in May and then we really
didn't care much about other than the
fact that it was buzz worthy we hear
that this phone is still under wraps the
company is still working on it we should
expect something soon haven't don't have
any dates probably I'm just oh my god in
the comments please what exactly is this
phone going to do because probably the
funniest part of the news is that it's
going to also focus on gaming so crypto
currency in gaming like WTF man now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy Note
9 I cannot wait for this event in early
August I can't wait to be a part of it
I'm definitely looking forward to the
note I am a big fan we see more renders
with the same design changes that we've
seen let's just assume that this is
to be the final product which for me and
my opinion is great but more important
for those of you that want to know when
you can buy it apparently the rumors are
August 24 so set your calendars prepare
your wallets definitely oh my god I have
become a big fan of the galaxy s 9 plus
s it is so just to add the functionality
of the S Pen and better battery life
which are the rumors would be awesome
but we'll see and finally the hot news
today have to do with Apple and yes
everything that we're gonna expect to
see this fall I mean we've heard we're
getting iPhones but apparently this
event is going to be crowded we hear
refresh is for the Mac Mini for the iMac
we hear that that affordable MacBook Air
is also going to make a launch we hear
that Apple plans to make the Apple watch
larger not necessarily in the size of
the chassis but in the size of the
display up to 1.78 inches it seems or I
think that number is wrong but you get
the picture it's gonna get larger so
yeah what exactly we are going to get in
these changes is hard to predict but my
god in today's question let us know is
there any particular product that you
would like to see get a refresh this end
of the year from Apple because honestly
in my case what I would love to see
Apple of you're listening is a quad-core
13-inch MacBook Pro the only reason I
use the 15-inch MacBook Pro is because
of the quad core processor it's just
better for performance and rendering
video so I would just like a more
portable 13-inch MacBook Pro to be able
to do that that would be me leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier full of us I'm
