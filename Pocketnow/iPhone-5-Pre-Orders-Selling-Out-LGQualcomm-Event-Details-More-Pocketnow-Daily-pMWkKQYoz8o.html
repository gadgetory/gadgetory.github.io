schedules that are meant with Qualcomm
and Verizon and Sprint won't get the
iphone 5 you're expecting I'm hi
Marietta hating midnight pacific time
and this is pocket now daily apple's
iphone 5 new ipod nano a new generation
ipod touch started pre orders as of
midnight pacific time and the expected
happened the iphone 5s pre orders pushed
availability from September 21st to
shipping in two weeks just two hours
after launch so do any of you have any
bets as to when the iphone 5 will pretty
much sell out i bets are set at 4pm now
LG is just sent out invites for an event
along with qualcomm on September 19th
and the only thing we can think of is
that the optimus G is making it to the
United States before we thought and the
reason why is because the optimus G is
LG's first smartphone are pretty much
the world's first smartphone to run on
Qualcomm's new quad core processor on a
system-on-a-chip so the only problem we
have with this is wild why do OEMs all
match on their event dates because HTC
has another event on the same September
19th now Google's recent move to make
google wallet opens almost every credit
card has literally begun to pay off the
reason why is because apparently they've
doubled in usage in just one month
according to google now whether that's
going to make Google Wallet the
mainstream service or payments is yet to
be seen but so far it does seem to be
working Microsoft has recently
backtracked on asking current windows
phone customers what they want from
windows phone 7.8 the reason why is
because apparently after the forum post
went live the feedback was so intense
that microsoft ended up sending an
apology and stating the no they didn't
want to know what we wanted from when
those films have been pointed all they
wanted to know is what we wanted from
future versions which seems kind of
awkward but still it does seem that
microsoft ended up just pushing back
because well the feedback was too
negative to bear and finally with the
iphone 5s launch a couple of things were
discovered first of all is that the
carrier unlock variants are going to
have to wait sadly
second of all is that Apple is actually
working on three iphones the first one
to work on AT&amp;amp;T and Canada's LTE the
second one on verizon and sprint LTE and
the third one to work on Europe and
Australia's LTE so call us the next
nightmare now the biggest problem with
this verizon and sprint variant is that
it won't be able to do 3g calls and 4G
LTE simultaneously for data which makes
you wonder if Apple really understands
the whole reason why 4G LTE came to be
so this leads me to the question of the
day do you use data and call
simultaneously because I do a lot huh
leave us a comment down below now if you
want an earlier school of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
pocket now calm please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Nev any better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
