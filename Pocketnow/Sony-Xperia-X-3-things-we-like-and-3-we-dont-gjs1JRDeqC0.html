Xperia X we thought we'd take a minute
or three to share some of our early
impressions using sony's streamlined
smart phone experiment here are three
things we like and three things we don't
hot design beauty is in the eye of the
beholder but we're happy sony didn't
skimp on build materials whether you
feel this design language is getting
stale
we can't fault sony engineering for
producing a high-quality frame not hot
battery life it's tough to work around a
smaller battery even with a 1080p screen
and 600 series CPU battery numbers on
the Xperia X are on the lean side with a
two thousand six hundred and twenty
milliamp hour cell this phone is best
used in short screen on Sprint's hot
stereo speakers will always be fans of
pointing the speakers in the right
direction namely
at your face and we know many of our
viewers will agree phone speakers will
never be audiophile experiences but
watching videos and playing games is
certainly more enjoyable with
forward-facing audio not hot headphone
playback for as good as the speakers are
headphone audio is about mid-pack
analyzing test numbers we're seeing
nearly identical performance to the
Galaxy s7 which means we're likely using
the DAC provided in the Qualcomm chipset
and this is one of the weaker amps we've
tested this year hot performance
concerns over the Qualcomm 650 processor
were quickly put to rest after the first
day of use this little CPU outperforms
last year's Snapdragon 808 this tier of
product won't appeal to folks who play
graphics intensive games but it's more
than capable for just about everything
else you might do on your phone and we
think it will age well over the next
year not hot overall camera performance
no one would deny that Sony sets the
standard for camera sensors this 23
megapixel shooter is paired with a tack
sharp lens but the overall experience
leaves us underwhelmed from mediocre
macro performance to the buzzy shimmer
produced by Sony software video
stabilization to twitchy and reactive
focused tracking we find ourselves
fighting this camera more than nailing
the shot we want someone should tell
Sony than a manual mode
means more than just exposure and white
balance controls you can only adjust ISO
when you reduce resolution to 8
megapixels but that's still kind of
useless without some control over
shutter speed and it's a strange feeling
turning to Samsung for more even-handed
image processing so there you have it
folks three things we like and three
things we don't do the pros outweigh the
cons drop us a comment below and we'll
publish our full review of the Xperia x2
