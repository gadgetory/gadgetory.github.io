a pretty picture for flagships Oppo
announces a bevy of improvements the
hardware that we'll see later and lease
of the HTC One em 10 showing more of a
familiar face I'm high metal Iveta and
you know the topic of debate today is
what day is it because jet lag is just
lovely
this is parking out daily from Barcelona
for those of you that are interested in
the Samsung gear s2 in its classic
barians and also wanted the 3G model we
actually receive a sport one it is
extremely thick but I know some people
that actually do want this feature so
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have just announced
that it will begin pre-orders as of
today you actually can pick it up as
soon as March 11 which if you have not
noticed this also the same time you get
the galaxy s7 so great timing even
though the price tags are rather weird
links to the description you'll get more
details on that counsel the spotlight
over to Oppo as the company has just
made some very interesting announcements
at MWC we were expecting some sort of
hardware but instead we received the new
features that will come to hardware in
the future starting with a new book
rapid charger which is much faster than
the previous one that was even possible
it could actually charge a 2500 milliamp
hour battery in 15 minutes from zero to
full which is great and obviously
depending on the amount of wattage of
the other batteries you'll get different
performance but what was even more
interesting was this new smart sensor to
bring optical image stabilization to the
sensor not to the lens again links in
the description you'll get more details
this is definitely very cool and
hopefully we will see in hardware very
soon now let's return the spotlight to
the whole iPhone in the San Bernardino
case and the fact that the FBI wants it
to be hacked somebody very important in
the industry Bill Gates just pronounced
himself about it and he considers that
Apple should contribute and help in the
whole investigation if you think about
it it does make a lot of sense
particularly with how much shootings
have become famous lately but obviously
that is a topic we don't want to delve
into what's important is that things are
progressing hopefully in a positive way
for the investigation to go through
let's talk about HCC within the show
floor the company already announced the
new HTC vibe we actually got some
photographs of it today it looks a
little different to the prevalent that
we saw at CES but other important
details have to do with the company's
HTC One and 10 we were expecting it to
be announced at MWC and it wasn't but
now we got some leaks and hey we noticed
some very interesting champers at the
back so it does look like the one a9 but
then again it doesn't look like it and
that's not necessarily a good thing we
actually like the one a9 stay tuned we
will be covering more and finally the
very hot news that they have to do with
the Sony Xperia X we saw it it was
announced yesterday we do have our hands
on videos already but we thought that
these were going to be premium mid
Rangers and surely the xperia x
performance includes a snapdragon 820
so the specifications are there and now
we hear that Sony is actually planning
to ditch the Zeen lineup or at least we
assume so from some Facebook posts and
it seems that the Xperia x10 you get
which is rather odd as the company
didn't really say this is our new
flagship but hey it leads me to the
question of the day do you think that
the Xperia X performance or the new
lineup has enough on it for you to want
to buy it
particularly with the price tag because
in my case no really
but leave us a comment down below we'd
