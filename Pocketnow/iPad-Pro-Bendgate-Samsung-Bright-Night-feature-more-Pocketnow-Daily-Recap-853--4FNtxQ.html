own fanpage we need to stop these like
I'm is a type of guy it's kind of chokes
behind me owns a t-shirt Museum why
because I've got a lot of them or
because they're old
I hurt punch holes sank the Titanic I
heard that was probably one of the best
jokes that's right it's that time of the
week I am Haim every bit of this is
PocketNow this is the bargain out daily
recap your comments for last week so on
Monday the topic was that Apple is
working on bringing back touch ID to a
certain degree and I asked you like what
would you prefer touch ID face ID both
we had 484 comments give me touch ID and
I'll upgrade from my 6s which has been a
beast for three years straight
I think the iPhone success was probably
my least favorite iPhone but I do
understand why a lot of people liked
touch ID I mean I find that same case
with the iPhone 8 plus which is another
option you've got I still prefer touch
ID instead of face ID I don't use face
ID you know it's funny I don't prefer
face ID up one less year in New York and
cold weather you want to unlock your
phone and you can't take your gloves off
that's when it makes a lot of sense
I want a toe print scanner yeah you
probably have a jealous wife don't you
then on Tuesday we were surprised to see
Lenovo make the hot news because they
launched the phone with the first
snapdragon 855 processor or at least
they announced that it we were gonna get
it in early January and I asked you what
was your top of mind from this company
we have 355 comments meanwhile my laptop
has only four gigs of RAM and yes that's
because uh the news were that this phone
would have between 10 or 12 gigs of RAM
I'm actually saying between 10 or 12 cuz
the news were 12 but I don't believe it
and so I'm kind of skeptical 12 gigs of
ram plus poor memory management that's
probably worse than 6 gigs of ram and an
excellent memory management let's see
what the Novo can do with 12 gigs we've
seen oneplus doing things like using the
extra ram to leave proportions of apps
in order to help them launch quicker
hopefully that's the case more ram is
just making developers less obliged to
optimize their apps which sucks good
point there then on Wednesday the top
was the possible one plus seven 5g
variant that we saw leaked and images
ask you what do you think about the
device we had three hundred and
sixty-four comments it looks like old
Nokia Lumia 1020 yes indeed and I hope
that means that we get such a great
camera that that's the reason why we
have that design 5g is not the way to go
as of now no infra Assam yet lesser
range lesser penetration and will make
phones more expensive oh that's not
accurate like at all but I get your
point
but you have to remember this is still
an LTE phone
so while 5g gets deployed you're still
gonna have an LTE phone dude it reminds
me of Nokia and moto smartphones kind of
yet to be honest really those were
really good designs then on Thursday the
topic was the iPad pro bendgate because
that's a thing now
we found tablets that are coming out of
the box bent Apple responded that this
is normal and we had 564 comments I
asked you what you thought consumer I
just bought an iPad pro and a bent Apple
great job son you're using it like a
real pro yeah because now apples gonna
pretty much claim that they invented the
foldable tablet category right
definitely not a good look for Apple
needs to be addressed now and no not
there everything is fine statement even
if it's simply a little more stringent
in quality control I you know it's not
normal behavior for people to try to
bend their tablets but if a product
bends just out of the blue or coming out
of the box then definitely that makes no
sense
I feel that product should be more rigid
and I feel that in the case of the iPad
pro this new design it has everything to
do where that magnet for the Apple
pencil is plus the fact that it doesn't
have the taper and the borders which
provided more structural rigidity so I
don't know man nothing in life is
straightforward Bob from Apple customer
care yes all right
good one and then finally Friday we
talked about the leaks of Samsung Bright
Knight mode as probably their new Knight
mode I asked you what did you think what
did you want from this feature we had
three
58 comments I just want a great little
light photography and that's about it
I hope Samsung delivers the company has
been doing a really good job I mean I
will have it after the buzz video of the
galaxy s 9 plus very soon was as soon as
we get one you I know was as soon as we
get one you I and one of the things that
I'm gonna show you is just how much
Samsung has improved little light with
software updates over time thanks to the
aperture that already exists on the
phone so another feature with longer
exposure that would be great
should have named the Dark Knight fine
yeah true
I love the name bright and Knight and
I'm optimistic about the camera features
yeah I have to say it man I mean Samsung
has been killing it with their camera
performance lately I feel that they need
to do a better job with shutter speed in
low-light so if they come up with a
bright Knight motor it would take an
initial shot and then you know provide
some software tweaking to make it better
I think that would be a great
combination let's see what the company
ends up bringing so that's it for the
bargain out daily recap thank you so
