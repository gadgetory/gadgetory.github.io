smartphones for the past couple years
odds are this is what you expect to see
generally inoffensive
plastic handheld with a huge screen
trimmed with fake metal and imitation
leather what you don't expect
necessarily is this a smaller thinner
squared-off smartphone with real metal
sides and a real sense of style
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is Samsung Galaxy s5 vs samsung
galaxy alpha our Galaxy alpha review
device comes to us from the folks at 28
mobile if you find yourself watching
this comparison or our forthcoming
review and suddenly salivating for a
Galaxy alpha of your own head on over to
28 mobile comm and tell them PocketNow
sent you like we touched on in the intro
the hardware here is significantly
different on the inside and out now as
longtime viewers might know I'm usually
a form over function guy so I was
instantly enamored with the galaxy alpha
when I took it out of the box in the
hand it's unlike any Samsung phone
that's come before with the aluminum
band giving it a rock-solid rigidity
that the rounded galaxy s5 lacks the
Alpha is also easier to grip thanks to
its almost gummy backplate which
features a more reserved stipple pattern
than its larger sibling does it's also
smaller in almost every dimension which
is a refreshing change of pace the sharp
beveled edges make it a little less
comfortable to hold and talk on but to
me the aesthetic improvements more than
make up for that the galaxy s5 just
doesn't say anything with its design
while the Alpha really stands out on a
tabletop the Galaxy s5s advantages
emerge when you look at its raw
capability the screen isn't just bigger
it's higher resolution to making its
pentile sub pixel arrangement less
apparent around back the battery is much
larger on the s5 and the rubber gasket
on the battery door reminds us that the
higher-end phone is also water-resistant
not so on the Alpha from little stuff
like the IR port and USB 3.0 to bigger
pluses like the microSD card the s5 has
the Alpha solidly beat
it is the flagship after all and it
shows that's true in the software to an
extent though this particular video is
throwing two different processors
against one another Samsung's Exynos 5
octa in the Alpha versus the Snapdragon
801 in the s5 now both of these phones
actually ship in both configurations
depending on market so aside from
reminding me that I prefer the snappier
Snapdragon for day-to-day responsiveness
this portion of the comparison isn't
worth much elsewhere in the software the
Alpha sticks close to the s5 despite the
smaller display which makes typing a bit
more cramped on the Alpha you've still
got the option to do two screen
multitasking with multi window my
favourite advantage of Samsung's
otherwise heavy interface and features
like the photo editing studio showcase
the company's efforts to get a little
more user-friendly which can be seen on
each phone in short if you're used to
Samsung software there are no surprises
on either of these the 12 megapixel
camera on the Galaxy alpha is a small
step down in resolution from the 16
megapixel shooter on the galaxy s5 but
output is remarkably similar at first
glance and after some resizing you might
even think these cameras were identical
look a little closer you start to see
the higher saturation from the galaxy s5
which produces some of the most vibrant
colors of any smartphone camera we've
ever tested whether you prefer to the
s5s supercharged colors or the alphas
more muted output is up to you but the
s5 does enjoy the higher resolution and
it also seems to produce sharper shots
on the whole when the color overload
isn't washing out the fine details that
is video shows more the same outdoors
you can see the s5s tendency to produce
cooler richer colors while in dimmer
indoor settings the level of digital
noise and the rolling shutter distortion
is about equal the s5s wandering focus
is annoying and thankfully the Alpha
doesn't seem to suffer quite as badly
from that particular melody if the
Galaxy alpha has one big disadvantage
relative to the s5 its battery life
while I was able to get about 5 hours of
screen on time per day from the galaxy
s5 I can barely manage
half that with the Galaxy alpha that
should come as little surprise given the
huge capacity disparity here fortunately
this version of the Alpha for SK Telecom
came with two batteries as many South
Korean phones do but you won't get the
same treatment here in the States on
AT&amp;amp;T so you might have to rely on ultra
power saving mode to get your home at
night if you're buying based on battery
life the s5 is definitely the way to go
here but if you're more concerned about
speakerphone quality admittedly it's not
everyone's first thought but if you take
a lot of hands-free calls or you play a
lot of games without headphones the
bottom firing driver on the Alpha is
much more logically placed than the rear
mounted speaker on the s5 it's slightly
tinnier but about as loud
finally there's phone calling as we said
above the s5 is the more comfortable
device to talk on thanks to its softer
plastic edges but the alphas smaller
more pocketable footprint makes it feel
well more like a phone call quality
seemed about equal in our testing
meaning decidedly average but keep in
mind our alpha is a non-us review device
your experience on an AT&amp;amp;T version may
differ take all those distinctions toss
them in a blender and the upshot is this
this is a choice between functionality
and cosmetics the Galaxy s5 is the more
fully featured the more rough-and-tumble
the longer-lasting it's the phone you
get if you don't want to worry about a
case the galaxy alpha is the more
portable and by far I think the
better-looking with its superior fit and
finish that we've seen echoed already on
the new Galaxy Note 4 the Alpha also
feels much more like the future of
Samsung design so get the galaxy s5 if
you want to be able to do more but get
the Galaxy alpha along with the spare
battery if you want to look a lot better
doing it once again our review unit
