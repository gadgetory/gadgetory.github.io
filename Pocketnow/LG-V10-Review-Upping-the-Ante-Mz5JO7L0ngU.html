this year with a phone that has a great
camcorder mode a second screen and a
body to kill for
or rather it's kind of tough to kill but
a lot of everything else well as they
say the more things change the more the
g4 stays the same
I'm Jules Wong with pocket pal and we're
asking what the big deal is with the LG
v10 this is our video review full
disclosure we tested a South Korean demo
unit in Romania for several days and
then also bought our own t-mobile device
and have had the chance to roam around
Greater Boston with it though we had to
replace it once during our test period
and you'll see why in just a second the
LG v10 is a svelte wildebeest a beveled
slab and one tough cookie that cookie
starts with the stainless steel frame
and it's exposed sightings that are
meant to protect vulnerable fracture
points for screens the sides and corners
of phones
that's what LG calls deer guard right
there the top bottom and removable back
of the phone are covered in dura skin
resilient silicon that is able to
withstand some shock you can color it in
black white beige and in two shades of
blue both of those when put together
really get to protecting you can see the
scuffs here the scratches on the sidings
there all those tell of a four-foot fall
while I was begging in the middle of the
street the body battery and covered
sploded onto the asphalt but when put
back together everything worked and that
Gorilla Glass 4 panel stayed intact this
phone has definitely earned its milspec
shock rating though we still don't
recommend you take a facedown fall with
it under the glass it's a quad HD LCD
spanning 5.7 inches along with an extra
bit at the top that adds 160 pixels to
the height all of it is bright enough
and sharp enough to be usable in heavy
doses of sunlight but of course the big
attention
our here is that second screen set up
and sure it makes an ergonomic isense
to move it to the bottom but with the
screen of body ratio already in this
tight it'd be likely that the two camera
units next to that second screen would
have to move down with it and honestly I
don't think selfie experiences have to
be more awkward than they already are
and in regards students cameras one of
them has an 80 degree field of vision
while the other takes in a wider 120
degrees some familiarity as we head back
you see essentially the same camera
flash laser focus sensor layout as we
did on the g4 there with a little mound
around bullen's there's some lovely
texturing on the volume rocker with a
power button that doubles as LG's first
smartphone fingerprint sensor on our
retail unit yes it's easy to get at and
yes it's too fast but both variables are
pretty typical for the smartphone
fingerprint sensor field as has been the
case for most of the G series there's a
removable 3000 milliamp hour battery and
the holy grail of power users the micro
SD card slot LG though is offering only
one disk space option with the v10 and
we think that the 64 gigabyte storage
paired with 4 gigabytes of RAM is
definitely something we can live with
finally
like the g4 there's a Snapdragon 808
processor with all the trimmings and
just to be complete about it here are
the major antennas
LG's general software hasn't gotten any
better or worse from the g4 even though
it has the extra one upgrade on the
Android side there's an aesthetic
cohesion in an interface with the he was
keeping to earth and sky tones and a
whole bunch of circles overall but it
still wouldn't be our first choice for
an Android UI keyboard height toggles
have been moved to a settings menu thus
preventing accidental adjustments we're
grateful also for the customizable nav
bar with a notification trigger and dual
window apps though we'd wish that LG
supported more of them after all
it's 2015 and another Korean om isn't
resting on its laurels of course we'd be
remiss to neglect how that second screen
figures into the UX other than
notifications which have an extra line
of room compared to the typical info
blast there are six screens that can
fill up the space at any given time from
what amounts to a text screensaver to
playback controls agenda display to
OneTouch quick contacts and recent app
multitasking to some attempted and note
features all in all we think it's a
better way of implementing something
Samsung tried to do with its edge
features instead of dealing with an on
body curve the features are actually
tucked out of the way enough so that you
aren't able to mess with them while
using your phone normally the second
screens on when the main display is on
and agnostic on when that is not so you
can get a quick flashlight going the
second screen is a better take on a more
present multitasking experience than
what we've seen before though it still
requires the shimmy or a second hand we
think it's well worth the tap savings
though if you went through even the edge
route
the camera picture hasn't changed much
since the g4 at least physically on the
rear both of those front faces are 5
megapixels each the pro viewfinder for
stills remains pretty much the same as
does the audio and simple view finders
and the product these sensors put out
are just as good as the g4 s although we
seem to notice a slight bit more of
watching noise and poorly lit situations
but HDR typically fixes that up focus
can be a little tricky to hunt for in
dim situations with long distance
contrast even with that laser all that
said though in most bright and dark
conditions they're going to get a great
picture the new and neato snap mode lets
you record in stitch video clips from
all three cameras to create a crazy
montage up to 60 seconds long and also a
quick video editor is included with
granular speed controls and automatic
montage condensation these tools are
pretty elemental but it's more than what
the average device offers and we're
grateful for them the pro video
viewfinder is much the same as the
stills one but here there's also a
toggle for the three microphones on the
device controlling directionality
sensitivity and wind noise filtering
honestly the sound isn't anything to
write home about if you're using the
phone to share the serious video you'd
probably bring your own equipment any
other points of granularity like the
framing bitrate as well as a cinematic
ratio for 1080p shooting actually proves
to be very useful for the inner
filmmaker in us oh is and panin skin at
1080p can do wonders for shop tracking
shots if I'm walking and also for most
pans and tilts however like the g4 if
you rock the boat too hard even with
Elias you'll get Warped patches hearing
they're not so good for the queasy
viewer but it's not particularly bad
rolling shutter is handled better than
most other phones and it certainly isn't
a deal-breaker you also have to take
note of the late
see in the viewfinder while shooting
which can be as much as half a second
but the v10 wheel shoots great video if
you take care with it like a regular
camera you can say the same about the g4
but having more control over what you're
shooting definitely helps and to that
it's the v10 that gets the point here
data speeds have been decent cross our
testing in Romania and the u.s. call
quality is of the norm there's 32 bit
DAC support for lossless audio files but
on our judgment with studio monitors we
haven't been able to tell any
superiority in clarity the speaker on
our retail unit is adequately loud but
it has a tendency to ebb in volume for a
few seconds especially if you've been
blasting the unit for a while it's a
peculiar and rather disappointing bug
that hasn't shown its phase in our
review
so take that for what you will on the
software side the device does pass our
gaming tests with flying colors
heat is better dispersed throughout the
massiveness of the v10 and it helps that
the grippy silicon pattern keeps your
cock in the face of sweat enough about
your endurance what about the phones in
a word man our South Korean review unit
was plagued with issues that hobbled
screen on usage - barely an hour our
american retail unit was a little more
forgiving with very frequent usage and
either a lot of streaming radio or video
shooting we've gotten three to four
hours of screen time per charge there
are a couple of ameliorating factors
here one of them is quick charge 2.0
where the best that we've seen it fill
an empty tank
is about an hour there's also that
removable battery which you can replace
it with a fresh extra and while there's
no built-in wireless charging as our
michael fisher showed us with the g4 and
from the looks of the v10 s cover
there's a quick and cheap hack you could
fix up t-mobile selling the v10 at $600
full retail well at AT&amp;amp;T it's more like
$700 the death star is promoting it as a
productivity tool but really that's the
note series big magenta is propping up
the video features and if you're an
indie filmmaker well that's great but
while it helps you me and the rest of us
a pocket now to frame the phone for one
special use though certain niche would
come - we think that LG had a great base
line for a phone that it added a lot of
thoughtful features - everyone can use a
little more drop insurance in life
everyone could afford to save a bit of
app hassle and everyone would definitely
like more time off the wire now you
could save at least $100 and get a moto
X or HTC One a9 and not get any of those
features and if you spend an extra few
bucks you'll be getting a base-model
note or iPhone and there isn't anything
base-model about the v10 at a Midway
price point you're buying the most you
can get out of an LG smartphone and
that's certainly no compromise this
review has been a long time coming and
we certainly thank you for being patient
with it if you liked it well give us the
thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
already also follow us on our social
media pads where we are at pocket now
and I'm at Greenpoint Zero on Twitter
for all the PocketNow team I'm Jules
long there's more later
