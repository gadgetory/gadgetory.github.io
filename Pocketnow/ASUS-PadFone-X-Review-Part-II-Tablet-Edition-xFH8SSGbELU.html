series the smartphone half of the Isuzu
PadFone X delivers an Android experience
just about dead center of average
fortunately things get a whole lot more
interesting in tablet mode which makes
the PadFone something worth considering
for those in need of an all-in-one
Android solution and best of all you
don't pay a single extra penny for it
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our soos headphone X video
review part 2 tablet Edition the
official name for this device is the
PadFone station and it's aptly named
because like any dock it's useless
without the smartphone it accommodates
think of it as a magnifying glass for
the handset its LCD screen isn't as
sharp as the phone's but at 9 inches
it's almost twice the diagonal size the
battery within is almost 5000 milliamp
hours and it features a micro USB port
on the side so you can charge it
separately from the phone if you need to
about the only downgrade from the phone
is the front-facing camera which is 1
megapixel to the phones too
the handset slides into a receptacle
dead center of the backside held in
place by a combination of rubber teeth
and a sturdy docking interface that
doesn't let it fall out but it does
allow for enough movement to make the
whole thing rattle slightly when shaken
in docked configuration the device is a
heavy 664 grams and eleven point six
millimeters thick it's fairly awkward to
hold especially in portrait and it's
wobbly on a tabletop streamlined
simplicity this is not on the bright
side a soos provides a flip cover for
the phone that can be left on even when
the phone is docked to the tablet and
it's exposed position means the phone's
camera lens is open for use in tablet
mode fortunately you don't need to rely
on the phone's puny rear firing speaker
when it's docked the PadFone station
includes a pair of front firing speakers
flanking the display
it takes in time to adjust to the
reality of the pad phones interesting
approach to computing in a software
sense the tablet isn't just a companion
for the phone it is the phone docking
the to instructs Android 4.4.2 to use
the pad phone stations display audio
equipment buttons and front-facing
camera and just like in the commercials
there are hints of real seamlessness
here plug the phone into the dock feel
the buzz and a few seconds later you're
looking at that webpage or photo or
spreadsheet on a much larger canvas the
pet phone is smart enough to switch
display modes when you dock to the
station so instead of just a scaled-up
smartphone interface you get the tablet
mode that's true most of the time anyway
some Android apps coded exclusively for
smartphones will force you into portrait
mode a decidedly awkward experience and
there's another huge caveat here Google
Play apps like Gmail hangouts etc won't
automatically transition between modes
instead they'll throw an error that
requires you to restart them if you
switch between phone and tablet while
they're open this isn't a massive
inconvenience but it is a bump in an
otherwise smooth road of more concern to
us is the considerable bugginess of the
asou interface on the whole which the
company informs us should be fixed by
the time the pad phone is made widely
available starting June 6th one of the
things we dinged the pad phone handset
for in part one of our review was
battery life well thankfully that's one
of the strong suits of the PadFone
station you can set the phone and tablet
to maintain a balance or you can force
the tablet to consistently replenish the
phone the latter is our preferred method
due to the phone's small battery on one
of our first test days we put the
combined pair through mixed use in both
modes for about 16 hours once the phone
was down to 4% we stuck it back in the
dock for another 90 minutes of usage
finally running the tablet dry and
kicking the phone back up to 35% so
while the combined pair probably won't
get you through an entire weekend of
heavy use if you leave your charger
behind
it's definitely handy to have the
tablets power reserve available
especially considering how easy it is to
just drop the handset in and pick up
right where you left off a soos also
provides some tools for managing
communications when docked you can start
calls through the tablets onboard
speakerphone or you can set the software
to prefer Bluetooth and you can also
automatically transition the call to the
phone just by pulling the handset out or
vice versa and those speakers while
quieter than we'd like are great for
viewing media or of gaming in a quiet
room AT&amp;amp;T is offering the PadFone X
package which once again includes the
smart phone tablet dock and earbuds all
in the same box for $199 on a two-year
contract and that's the real story of
the PadFone x value it's not just that
you're getting a highly Specht
smartphone and a tablet in the same box
there's also a recurring savings here
because AT&amp;amp;T doesn't require a special
data plan for the pad phone you're
paying the same amount for data that you
would if it was just a standalone phone
so while it is true that the pad phone
handset is little more than average and
the PadFone station is big and unwieldy
just look how much you're getting for
the money that's even true if you
consider the Bluetooth keyboard dock
from a soos it's very heavy and it's
pretty pricey and it's made some
questionable choices with regard to its
apostrophe key but combined with
everything else it results in a
near-total
low horsepower computer replacement for
someone willing to part with an extra
$100 would this be our first choice for
the ideal Android experience No would a
dual device lifestyle be more polished
with say a nexus 5 alongside a nexus 10
absolutely but even on a contract the
price tag would be much more prohibitive
for students penny-pinchers are really
anyone shopping for a smart phone and a
tablet at the same time it was not too
worried about looks and looking to get
the most for their money the asou SPAD
phone X offers good specs and almost
unbeatable value unless you're really
averse to contracts or dead set against
AT&amp;amp;T
