in smartphones right now one that you
can definitely love or hate simply put
there are so many of them coming out and
so fast as well 20-19 have seen the
release of like a dozen flagship phones
already and we're not even at the
halfway point yet but with all of these
phones coming out it is easy to overlook
some of the earlier contenders so I
wanted to look at one in this video and
you know what you should still pay
attention to honors most recent phone
because at a pretty affordable price the
view 20 actually set a couple of bars
that other phones are working on right
now this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody this
is an honor view 23 visit now the reason
why this isn't a true after the buzz is
partially because of all the damn phones
that are coming out so fast it's hard to
actually use a phone for an extended
period of time at this point because we
have to move on to the new ones pretty
quickly so I wanted to get back to the
on review 20 use it for a little while
and focus on a few key aspects of course
the phone is still high-end in the
current smartphone climate with the
seven nanometer Kira 980 graciously
sourced by Huawei this phone is very
quick and has the storage on the RAM to
back it up even though the fixed storage
could get filled up pretty fast because
of all of the big pictures and the 4k
video recordings having 128 gigabytes of
space and the base model is still
appreciated and then there is the
supercharger 84,000 milliamp hour
battery that is still more than enough
for all-day usage now all of this powers
the magic UI system looks a little bit
like emui but it is still far from a
stock Android build in both look and
feature set there are a ton of things
you can do with this phone including
creating a private space in which an
entire second user profile and space can
be created this is a software feature
that I'm actually using right now this
on review xx is not my personal unit I'm
borrowing this one from TK Bay and it's
a way for me to illustrate the private
space I'm basically using what can
amount to a partition that is entirely
mine with all of my accounts and my data
after starting from scratch now you can
tell that this is the case because if I
go to the storage a lot of it is taken
up and that's all TK's data but they are
tucked away behind a lock screen and a
code that I don't know this is a useful
feature if you want to have two
different spaces personally for let's
say work or play or in my case you need
to let someone borrow your
for a little while and once I got to the
phone you know I put some gaming on it
right away
I got in a couple of my current
obsessions and have enjoyed speedy and
worryfree gaming experiences already
part of the reason for this as the
high-end specification XI but also a
couple of enhancements that are only
found on Huawei and honor phones
especially the view xx you have
something called GPU turbo 3.0 which
recently came out to magic UI and uses
the NPU processing to figure out power
consumption between the CPU and the GPU
ultimately pushing the GPU in supported
games so that you can get an even better
experience I wish that I could tell you
I actually feel the big difference but
in supported games like pub G mobile and
Dragonball Legends I'm just having a
good time
however fortnight was just added on to
GPU turbo 3.0 and it can get up to 60
frames per second play which is great
for phones like this there's also a
cooling system that helps much of the
phone to not get too hot so credit goes
to honor for putting their best foot
forward for gamers honor also put a good
foot forward with their display hiding a
small hole punch in the top left that
was the first of its kind that was
widely available
I remember honor talking about how small
the hole is compared to competitors but
let's be real by the time the Galaxy S
ten was announced we knew that it didn't
truly matter how big the hole is as long
as it didn't cut into the content after
using the honor of u-20 first before the
galaxy s 10 I was at least ready for the
fact that hole punches were going to
become prevalent and you know what I
don't hate it it's undoubtedly better
than the notches but I have to be honest
there are other ways that companies have
gotten around this whole cutting of the
display that I do find a bit more
exciting but where honor does hit the
mark and sets another bar is with its
cameras the view 20 is not the best
camera package out there let's just
start that off it does not have a wide
angle like many new recent flag ships
but what you do get is the latest Sony
IMX 48 megapixel sensor that hasn't
appeared in many 2019 phones yet in at
least one other phone we've already seen
how high megapixel counts means better
detail but honor took it a step further
by putting in the AI ultra clarity mode
the already powerful sensor takes a
bunch of photos in a four second time
span and puts them together to add
further detail to the original shot this
sounds like the knight mode from Huawei
phones which does appear here as well
but
this mode makes it clear that it is
meant for good lighting conditions
so clearly owner expects the ultra
clarity mode to be a peek stills
photography mode you might be able to
tell from all of the pictures that I'm
showing you already that I decided to
put the mode to the test after all high
megapixel counts can help for a move
that we don't really do a whole lot
anymore and that's photo printing good
detail in a small photo is one thing but
I wanted to set out and try doing a
large print to adorn one of my walls
here in my office I'm still going on and
taking more pictures around Los Angeles
to have some good choices but then you
can see the result over on my channel
once I get that video done that little
experiment did prove one thing to me
though detail is King in the honor of
u-20 making the 48 megapixel ultra
clarity mode one of the funner modes to
use because you just want to see how
dope the photo might turn out the rest
of the modes including the selfie modes
aren't bad in fact video is actually
pretty well stabilized but the more
conventional smartphone photography
experiences here don't truly rival the
top Co cameras we've seen since the v20
was launched it's all about that
high-powered sensor and how on ER did
something unique with it and with that
we have a look at some of the best parts
of the on review xx now my main take
aways here are that the hole punch the
gaming forward features and the uber
camera sensor are still great selling
points for what is actually a pretty
affordable phone a quick thanks to honor
for helping make this video possible but
further appreciation to them for pricing
the view xx at lower than many of the
flagships we're seeing now it's actually
around the same price as the oneplus 60
that puts this phone in an affordable
high-end category even while sporting
features that no other flagship still
provides do you have an owner of you 20
let us know what your experience has
been in the comments down below and for
everyone else let us know what you think
of honors most recent phone we wanted to
take another look at it because the
current deluge of phones makes it easy
to forget some of the gyms that we've
already seen this year so a revisit felt
kind of right but in any case we're
gonna go ahead and call it on this one
thank you so much for watching look
forward to more content from us here at
pocket now and subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already you can also
follow me at youtube.com slash Joshua
vergara so you can see the results of
that little experiment that I did in
using the 48 megapixel AI ultra clarity
mode to try and create a nice looking
large print of one or maybe up to three
of the photos that I took out in Los
Angeles and I want to be able to put
I'm up on my Wallis here in my office in
any case look forward to that over on my
channel and then come on back to pocket
now for even more and with that we're
just gonna go ahead and see you in our
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
