what we're showing you right now is the
motorola droid bionic from verizon
wireless USA this is a 4G LTE capable
phone and what we're showing you right
now is the video recording capabilities
this is a 1080p camera what I've shown
you right now are just some little
flowers in my front yard for those of
you who haven't seen my previous video
sample recordings before I like shooting
flowers to show off the capabilities of
the camera because there's so much
detail and so much contrast in those
come over here to this one where it's in
the shade so it helps show off the
capabilities of the phone you've got to
get in really close to do some macro and
how does it look when you pull back how
does the autofocus work all that fun
stuff so those of you who've seen my
videos before know why I do that let's
go up and look at some other stuff over
here like I said this is a 1080p camera
and it is set to 1080p out of the box so
you can just pull it out and start
shooting it's getting into the autumn
time so I've lost most of flowers off my
rose bush there there you can see that
will do a quick pan maybe some distance
stuff see how the auto zoom auto focus
rather works overall it's looking pretty
good from what I can see on my end we've
got some traffic sounds in the
background so we'll see how my voice
works compared to those in the
background but overall I'm impressed it
looks gorgeous on the screen if it comes
out half as good as this when we upload
it to YouTube that'll be great now one
last note is when we do record these
video samples we record them on the
phone we upload them straight to YouTube
we don't do any post production we don't
do any color treatment we don't do any
noise reduction we don't do any branding
or anything at all we just upload the
straight video so that you can see it as
close to and what you're going to get
when you get this phone as possible so
definitely let us know what you think
about it in the comments you'll need to
make sure that you set your YouTube
player up to
nadp to see it in all of its glory but
I'll be interesting to see what it does
if you like to see this kind of video
make sure you give it a thumbs up if you
haven't yet subscribed to our video
channel make sure you do that so you
don't miss out on the upcoming videos
we've got some hardware and software
reviews regarding the motorola droid
bionic but really kind of fun showing
off the capabilities of that phone for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
