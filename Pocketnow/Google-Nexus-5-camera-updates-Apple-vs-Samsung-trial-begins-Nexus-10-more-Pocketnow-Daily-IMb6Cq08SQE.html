rumored to be in the works the apple vs
samsung trial has begun and enhance
companies using Steve Jobs emails and
with milk is event happening tomorrow
some odd rumors have begun I'm hi Mary
that I and I swear on my favorite
barcelona jersey that there are no way
Pro fool jokes on this video really this
is parking out daily let's totally off
with some official new Sampson has yet
again launched another line of tablets
that you'll probably not care about this
is the Galaxy Tab 4 but then it's that's
seven point oh eight point 0 and 10.1
and these tablets are well designed and
everything it's the samsung tablet just
like every other but sadly the
specifications aren't that great little
description for full details on these
tablets we do not have pricing yet and
you wonder how are these going to be
stacked decide those tablets that we saw
CES now it's all about Google one of the
biggest complaints that a lot of people
have of the Nexus 5 and even the gold
edition smartphones is the fact the
camera software it's not really the best
out there and as it turns out we've got
rumors that the companies already
working on a new viewfinder and
interesting apparently they are working
on quality but they're also working on
adding things like filters uh which we
don't know what for but hey if they're
bringing them along and they do improve
the camera then why not and speaking of
Google one of the biggest unicorns to
set foot on rumor mill for the past
couple of years is the google nexus 10
refresh we've been having the same
tablet for years and it's been sold out
for a while and we're expecting for
there to be a refresh though we don't
really see anything happened until now
we get some rumors and some listings in
the Google Play Store that there will be
a sequel to the Nexus 10 though
obviously Google pulled that so we
should expect this to happen soon as
this is actually the first time that it
gets leaked on the website so hopefully
let's just see if it's better than what
we had before it wasn't bad now let's
talk about nokia we know that
microsoft's built conference is
happening tomorrow and the nokia event
should happen tomorrow in the afternoon
we'll definitely be covering everything
as it happens but even more interesting
is the fact that we were expecting the
nokia lumia 930 to be launching this
event and rumors from very trusted
sources say that it won't happen and
that only leaves the Lumia 630 which is
terrible news but then we're also
hearing that Windows Phone 8.1 should
reach current handsets by May so it's
not all lost let's just see what we get
tomorrow afternoon make sure you stay
tuned to our cover and finally for the
very dramatic news of the day the apple
vs samson trial has begun today and
Apple wants two billion in damages over
the fact that samson is benefited in its
way of designing building and just about
everything that has to do with making a
smartphone after apple launched the
iphone that's apples allegation but then
on samsung's court they still continue
allocating that even though they didn't
respond what Apple said what they did
was pull out an email from Steve Jobs
talking about how you know Steve Jobs
wanted to go thermonuclear on Google on
his biography and current emails within
the company staffing saying that this
was a new holy war so as it turns out
Samson continues allocating that they're
just being a victim which is really
interesting but anyways that leaves
these are the question of the day who
would you want to win this trial apple
or Samsung Apple wants to billion bucks
Samson 16.9 million because they do say
that some patents weren't fringed on
their part as well so in our particular
case I'll be honest with you uh I don't
know I mean Samsung has been building
smartphones for years they've done a
great job so I wish that nobody want i
wish that these whole patent problems
would not happen but leave us a comment
down below what do you want and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
