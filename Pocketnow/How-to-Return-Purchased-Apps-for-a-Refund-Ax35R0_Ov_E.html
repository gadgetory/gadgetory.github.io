today we're going to be looking at the
android market and i've got a tip here
that a lot of you apparently don't know
about what's really cool here is you can
buy an app whether it's $0.99 or $99 try
it out see if you like it or even if it
works and then return it if you don't
there are a couple of catches let me
show you how to do that let's go take a
look okay so we're gonna tap on the pure
grid calendar widget in the market and
that's gonna bring us over to the
description great I've already decided
that I want to buy it so I'm gonna click
on the Buy button it tells me that it's
going to have access to modify and
delete SD card contents it's gonna have
that the ability to acces the network
and it's going to read my personal
information specifically the calendar
all that sounds ok to me so I'm gonna
say ok and right now it's going to load
up the shopping cart since this is
secure it is going to take a moment but
what you see here is it's asking me do I
want to buy this using Google Checkout
for 1.29 gyro which is oh look at this
the exchange rate is a lot better than I
thought it says that it's approximately
at dollar 59 u.s. so that's that's
really nice I like that I can see what
the price is in my own native currency
but the developer can offer it for their
native currency so they don't have to
worry about exchange rates and luckily
with this approximation need to do I now
I can pay for this with a Visa card or
another credit card sometimes you even
have an option to use your your carrier
account so it'll bill it right to your
phone I recommend against that
yes it's very easy but some carriers may
not allow this return process to work so
for the context of this video we're
going to go ahead and use a Google
Checkout to pay with my Visa card we're
going to buy it now and it's authorizing
the purchase this is going to take a
minute there you go my order is complete
okay my order is complete and it took a
minute for the download to start but it
has and I have just gone in here and
checked the pure grid calendar widget is
now all loaded I got a new email you can
see right here almost immediately from
Google Checkout saying that I have a
receipt for that amount and that the
widget successfully installed looking at
this you can see it's got the typical
instruction set it says it's a widget
and how to use it and whatnot okay I'm
all done and now I want to go back over
here I've got a nice big empty screen
that I've reserved just for it I'm going
to tap and hold add a widget and the
widget that I choose this should be in
alphabetical order is the pure grid
calendar and I am going to choose four
by four extra-large one month and it's
got a whole bunch of configuration
options so I'm just gonna go through
here and accept all of the defaults of
course you can fix this
customize that however you want I'm
gonna go ahead and just save and exit
with the defaults just like the other
widget you can continue and skin it if
you want for now for this demo we're
just going to go ahead and put it on the
page and there you go you can see a nice
full screen widget showing every day
that I have an appointment I can click
on say tomorrow and you can see a look
at that it's my wife's birthday good
thing to know anybody who wants to send
her birthday congratulations please do
so to Natalie at Levis e.com send her
like a thousand of those if you can
birthday cards whatever keep it clean
she's my wife if you offend her I will
hunt you down so just be forewarned
back to the video so you know what I
love this personally but for the case of
this demo we're gonna say that we don't
no offense
we're just gonna say you know I don't
really like this so I'm going to tap and
hold and throw it away and then we're
gonna go back over to the market now
this is where it gets cool see this
little button right down here it says
uninstall and refund I can tap that and
I think it'll uninstall and refund let's
find out
I'm gonna tap on that and right there it
says it's refunding my money it also
said kind of quick that it was
uninstalling the app and then it's
asking me the same questions that I get
whenever I uninstall an app why did I
remove this unfortunately I don't have
an option in here that says I'm just
recording a demo don't take offense by
this so we're just gonna say that I'd
rather not say it's not in the list so
there we go okay we're done now
come back in here to our email and you
can see here I've got my Google Checkout
but you'll notice it's been updated it
says my order has been cancelled just
like that I'm done that money was
temporarily taken out of my account and
then put right back in I can do that
anytime within 24 hours of buying the
app and I'm good to go
a couple caveats if I decide I want to
download this app again I can do that
but I'm no longer qualifying for a
refund so I can't download it use it for
a day uninstall it get a refund install
it the next day run for it you can't do
that kind of stuff and I can understand
why but if you've got an app that you
want to use and you're seeing all my
personal information there so hey great
if you've got an app that you really
want to use but you're kind of hesitant
about paying the money for it go ahead
and do it the worst that you're out is
just the time that it took to download
it and that little amount of time where
the money wasn't in your account anymore
but you can put it right back in by
uninstalling and refunding just as
simple as that so any Android phone that
has the stock Android Market 1.5 and up
should have this capability so long as
your carrier supports it and so long as
the app developer has not unsupported
that I don't know of any who have and I
don't know why any would because it's
really a no hassle way to say I like
your app let me try it and in fact I do
in fact I'm probably gonna go back here
another few minutes off-camera and
reload that calendar app because I think
it looked really nice and I'd like to
play with some skins on it but there you
go download apps from the marketplace
with confidence get your money back if
you don't like them if they don't work
another reason why Android
is awesome so showing you how awesome
the android market is i'm joe for
