pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the Microsoft
Office hub in Windows Phone 7 series
Microsoft Office is a very important
product to Microsoft and obviously they
want to have a really good office
experience on Windows Phone 7 series
devices we've been questioning sort of
how the interface will look because the
Metro interface is not really conducive
to sort of creating content you're going
to see what I mean in a second and we'll
see how Microsoft has addressed this
let's let's start off in the Microsoft
Office hub which is of course where you
come to be productive so we can swipe to
the right to see the different panels we
have a quick link right to sharepoint
and you'll be able to see all of the
files that reside on a sharepoint server
very easy if you know your coworkers are
editing documents and you want the
latest version you can pull it down from
the cloud quite easily going to the
right we see Microsoft OneNote talk
about that in a moment and to the right
we have Microsoft Excel and Microsoft
Word let's talk about both of those and
how they've been changed since windows
mobile the legacy version let's start
off in word so we're going to type we're
going to go into a new document quite
simply we get a blank screen here so I
can say hello everyone and there's a few
things I can do there's a lot of things
I can do the first thing I can do is
click on this little color wheel here
first I want to select a word I click on
this color wheel and I get a variety of
formatting options obviously this is
going to be spruced up a lot when when
windows phone 7 Series is released let's
make it bold for now so quite simply
it's bold let's change the color to say
sort of read their simple edits another
thing that is new with Windows Phone 7
series and word is commenting features
typical scenario is your coworker or
your your friends send you a microsoft
office document you want to add some
comments you can't do that in windows
mobile right now but in but in this
version of a word you can so we select
the word we go down here to this
commenting feature and we say this looks
good and then what you can do is sort of
click out of it and now you can see that
it is has a little speech bubble around
it so presumably when somebody gets this
file on their desktop it will integrate
with words commenting features though a
lot of people use so very cool there we
can press the eye to get some
information although some things don't
work we're going to try to go back we
can expand the application bar to do
other things we can undo redo find basic
stuff we can send right from microsoft
word which is really great so that
quickly you can send this to a friend
after you've made changes you don't have
to go into your email application and
attach you can do it right from here we
can do new open save as things like that
we can also go to personalize and you
can set a profile for certain users
apparently you can have multiple users
on the device doesn't really make sense
and right here you get a little bit more
elaboration on the commenting feature so
let's go back into the application bar
see if there's anything we missed of
course we can save this as a file called
hello everyone and there is so let's go
back to the office hub so you just saw
word let's look at Excel a big problem
with Excel mobile on current windows
mobile devices that looking at a big
spreadsheet is so difficult you various
zoom levels but it's not easy to sort of
see an overview of the spreadsheet on a
small screen we still don't know how
microsoft plans to remedy this this is a
very early build it also doesn't have I
can't use multi touch on it obviously
I'm not on the touch screen device right
now but we can play around with some of
the features now you can see these these
icons down here are very ugly this
version is nowhere near complete but we
can use it we can do something like name
over here and your age and we can input
some things in there let you know Bob
age 25 and some things get a little bit
wacky as you can see there's some things
we can do here we can hit this button
which will actually let us switch
between different worksheets quite handy
click the
back button this one will create a new
spreadsheet this one will find see what
else we can do here we can sort so let's
select see if we can select let's make a
column with several different numbers
and see if we can sort them all right so
I'm going to try to highlight these it
may not work too well okay I'm just
going to select column C maybe that'll
do it and then we get a sort button here
which is pretty cool so this is actually
a format option not a sort so I'm going
to go back let's do sort a to z sort
options column C sort order descending
ascending more options okay so we can
change the sort order some more advanced
stuff than you then we've come to to
know we can go to format cell so we can
click on a cell see this type of format
options that we can have so we saw this
before we can make a chart we can change
the font color very basic options but
then again you're not going to want to
build out a full spreadsheet on your on
your mobile device you're just going to
want to do sort of basic edits let's see
what else we can do here we actually
have a file menu which is really strange
so this is not congruent with what we
saw in word there was no file menu so
again they're really working on this
trying to get it right and from here we
can open we can send it we can save it
as something and you get the idea from
their very basic Excel it's still not
quite what we pictured in terms of a
robust mobile Excel client let's go to
the next thing we're gonna hit the back
button to get back to the office hub and
let's go to OneNote mobile a lot of
people use one note on current windows
mobile devices it syncs very well with
one note on the desktop so if you take
notes in class we're in a meeting you
can sync everything right to your phone
so I can add a new note and it says I
can't sink it's not set up and I can
just type here you know you well and you
know it
hello and then I can click the back
button that will actually should save it
yep there it is and then we get the
Metro interface to pan around and access
the different sort of content so here
are all the pages that i have and i can
also go to the notebooks which is which
are really compilations of pages to help
organize them and we can click around in
some of these things we can mail it
quickly wrap the text we can edit it and
from this edit screen we can record a
voice note take a picture you know stuff
that we did see in the windows mobile
version of OneNote just a different
interface and hopefully they build in
some some better features so let's go
back more time to the hub we still have
to look at Power Point which you may be
disappointed by for now in PowerPoint
you are never able to make presentations
which kind of makes sense because most
people aren't going to make a
presentation on their phone they're just
going to look at it well sadly so far in
PowerPoint mobile for windows phone 7
series you can only view powerpoint
presentations you can't make them it
would be nice to have the capability in
case you know you only have your phone
and you need to get the presentation
ready for Monday but it doesn't look
like we are getting met so that was just
an early look at microsoft office on
windows phone 7 Series it has a long way
to come it shows some promise in giving
some more features that we didn't have
in the windows mobile version which
hasn't changed in 10 years but we'll
keep an eye on this and we'll post more
about this as soon as there's something
new to talk about be sure to subscribe
