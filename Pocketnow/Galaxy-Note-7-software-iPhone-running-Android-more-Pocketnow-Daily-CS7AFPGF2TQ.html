a pretty picture for Android n moto Z
teasers begin to show us a lot of colors
for the trim and believe it or not
somebody figured out how to run android
on an iPhone I'm hi Mary vera and this
is the way I remember the Ninja Turtles
not the fat blobs you currently see on
TV but doing the fact that these are
green they'll probably look either blue
or yellow on the video this is parking
out daily
we always try to begin our official news
with deals and this time it's up to the
Google Nexus 5x probably one of our
favorite smartphones of last year mainly
because its stock Android on a budget
and if you're still on a budget right
now it's currently at 275 / on ebay
links and information in the description
and speaking of deals one deal that went
all right and then all wrong was
definitely t-mobile Tuesdays it is no BS
harrowing Adam Lane actually went to
claim his pizza but the biggest problem
was that there was so much demand for
the app that it ended up crashing a few
times it is now working and apparently
you can still order pizza tomorrow given
this whole debacle that just happened
it's great to see the t-mobile is
actually delivering and it's also great
to see that there is this much demand
because in the end that does mean that
people actually like the idea hope I
don't forget this name ten digi I think
I got that right is making headlines
today mainly because they figured out a
way to run android on an iPhone and this
is interesting so it's a case that case
has a lot of computing under it it's got
a ton of ports and then you connect it
to the iphone through the Lightning
connector and it displays Android 4.7
it's an archaic version of Android
that's made for the tablet version but
bear in mind this kind of reminds us of
the app duet where you can connect an
iPad to a Mac and simply mirror your
display it's like if this gadget this
case is simply using the iphone as a
display which again we've seen with
other services so this might not be all
innovation here but it might just be
stay tuned that's the first time we see
Android running on any iOS device and
moving the spotlight over to teazers we
are expecting the next generation moto Z
or moto excellent Nova world that's
happening thursday and well we finally
get some teasers the teasers are of a
very slim profile in different colors
rose gold gold silver meeting those are
the trim colors that Motorola is teasing
for their next moto flagship obviously
we are also expecting some moto
Oh maker treatment as we've seen in
other leaks so yeah it does seem that
thin different color trends including
rose gold or in the package let's just
hope it delivers and finally some very
interesting news today have to do with
the samsung galaxy note 7 we've been
covering leaks all over this time it's
mainly about software as sin trusted
sources apparently claimed that Android
and is not making the cut that all the
official documentation they're getting
for the phone hence the Android sixth
auto one marshmallow which is extremely
weird this would be the first time that
a samsung galaxy note smartphone doesn't
launched with the latest version of
Android usually this is the phone that
brings that version through Samsung's
you know whole TouchWiz user interface
it could mean that Android and will not
be ready by then it's a probability it
could also be that we're getting the
galaxy note earlier as previous rumors
claimed whatever the case may be it
leads me to the question of the day but
the lack of Android n be at the turn for
you to buy the galaxy note 7 or not in
my case no not really but for me the
only deterrence will be what innovation
are we getting that the galaxy note 7
and hopefully not just have it be a
larger copy of the galaxy s7 leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get these losers
