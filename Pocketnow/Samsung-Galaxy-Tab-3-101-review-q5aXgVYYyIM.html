third-generation Galaxy Tab 10.1 but is
it worth the upgrade or the $400
introductory price I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is our full review of the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 the Galaxy Tab
3 10.1 hardware is exactly what you
would expect from a 2013 tablet from
Samsung like the two previous 10.1 inch
Galaxy Tabs it follows Samsung's
virtually universal design language the
back side has a hyper glazed finish atop
the polycarbonate back the trim is a
bronzed foe brushed metal and despite
its size and landscape nature it even
features the same exact button
configuration as every other recent
Galaxy device a physical home button in
the middle flanked by capacitive menu
and back buttons unlike its brethren
however this configuration
doesn't make a lot of sense on a device
this size yes it will primarily be used
in landscape but on the occasion you
have to rotate into portrait which often
happens due to applications that do not
support tablets the buttons are sideways
and awkward to use in essence this
device is like a giant galaxy s4 which
can be taken to one of two ways if you
have no qualms with Samsung's excessive
use of plastic the Tab 3 10.1 may not be
so bad on the other hand if you're a fan
of exceptional build quality and design
the entire Tab 3 lineup will leave you
feeling empty and well bored it's
certainly not much to look at but we can
applaud Samsung for holding some
standards such as physical size and
weight the IR blaster along the top edge
is a nice touch and the speaker grills
along the sides which mimic the machine
drilled speakers on the Nexus 10 look
nice however they're fairly easy to
cover up and it's easy to muffle the
audio on accident and just like its
appearance the specifications aren't
terribly impressive either the 10.1 inch
TFT display features a meagre resolution
of 1280 by 800 pixels which is
unfortunate the color reproduction is
nice and although it's not up to Super
AMOLED standards the contrast isn't bad
but the pixelation is quite noticeable
the processor is quite simply the best
thing about this tablet in fact it's the
only thing about this tablet that even
remotely sets it apart from similar
devices
it's powered by a 1.6 gigahertz
dual-core Intel Atom chipset which is
quite powerful
but it's hindered by only one gigabyte
of RAM the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 also comes
in either 16 or 32 gigabyte models has a
microSD card slot for expansion a 3.1
megapixel primary camera 1.3 megapixel
front camera and a 68 hundred million
power battery the worst part about the
Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 the hyper glaze finish
it's bad enough on a 5-inch phone but on
a 10-inch tablet the entire device
becomes a mirror fingerprint and scratch
magnet and it's literally impossible to
keep it clean using a cloth to wipe off
the oily fingerprints only seems to
smear them around and create swirls in
almost every way the Tab 3 10.1 feels
like Samsung thought well this worked on
the galaxy s4 so it must work on the tab
3 as well unfortunately it doesn't and
the end result is a flawed and
conflicted unpolished product and the
conflicted nature of the Tab 3 10.1
carries down into the software
kudos to samsung for shipping the Tab 3
10.1 with Android 4.2.2 this brings
features like daydream and lock screen
widgets and if you're an existing Galaxy
device owner you'll feel right at home
in the tab 3 10.1 it comes with the
latest version of TouchWiz there are
pre-installed Samsung applications like
watch on chat on Smart Remote from peel
s planner etc the home screen uses the
same icons widgets and wallpapers as any
other TouchWiz version but the software
on the tab 3 10.1 is half-baked and
reveals just how much time and effort
samsung put into this tablet will give
you a hint not nearly as much as this
older more mature sibling the Galaxy
Note the first indicator of lack of
optimization is in the notification
shade unlike on stock Android tablets
the 4.2.2 notification shade on the tap
3 is full screen meaning visually that
can be like into applications not
updated with tablet support a single
notification spans across the entire
display and swiping to dismiss feels
silly also the quick toggles at the top
of the shade all display in the default
view unlike other versions of TouchWiz
you cannot scroll this bar left and
right however there is still a button to
show all toggles in the top right corner
and landscape it does nothing but hide
the brightness slider and notifications
which is useless it only works in
portrait the lack of settings toggles is
a telltale sign that more is going on
than initially meets the eye naturally
being a Samsung tablet we searched high
and low for the multi window feature
but it's nowhere to be found and more
are any of the recent TouchWiz features
such as air view air gesture or smart
Paul's only smart stay and smart
rotation are included we were excited to
get our hands on the tablet since it
equips an Intel Atom chip with two cores
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz we didn't
expect it to be the most powerful chip
in history but it was quite snappy out
of the gate applications open quickly
scrolling was smooth and even task
switching happened quickly but it didn't
take long for the Intel chip to get
bogged down and the one gigabyte of RAM
didn't help matters either multitasking
left much to be desired as such
synthetic benchmark scores were a hit or
miss neither bad nor terribly impressive
the 6800 milliamp hour battery in the
tab 3 10.1 is one of the tablets more
positive qualities no it doesn't offer
the best battery life ever but it should
get you through a full day of use even
on heavy days pulling two email accounts
one Twitter feed Google+ updates and a
few instant messenger accounts it
managed only drain about 6% over a full
eight hour night in spurts of heavy
usage like gaming or streaming videos
the battery will drain rather quickly
but at the very least it should last a
day and a half to two days on a single
charge and normal usage just remember to
keep the brightness down finally the
camera if you're looking to use a tablet
for taking pictures or videos we would
be hard-pressed to recommend this one
the 3.1 megapixel rear camera is nothing
to get excited over worst of all its
fixed focus so don't expect much out of
close-ups in great lighting and at short
distance it can capture mediocre shots
with little detail washed out colors and
a little contrast and the video quality
is quite bland as well plus a little
shaky we hate to be harsh but the Galaxy
Tab 3 10.1 simply doesn't make sense
other than the Intel Atom chip there
isn't much to talk about and it's not
terribly impressive either point-blank
the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is a tablet built
to 2011 standards with 2011
specifications yet Samsung is selling it
for moderate 2013 price at $400 there is
simply better options and for $100 more
you can buy a much better Samsung tablet
with a lot more value proposition the
Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 isn't necessarily a
bad tablet but it certainly isn't great
it's middle of the road in every way and
instead warrants a price tag in the 300
dollar range we give the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 a 6 out of 10 that's all for now if
