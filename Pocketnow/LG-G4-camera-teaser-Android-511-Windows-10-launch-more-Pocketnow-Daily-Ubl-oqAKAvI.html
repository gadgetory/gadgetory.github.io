using the LG g4 and this time with its
camera we hear the possible launch date
for Windows 10 this summer and Microsoft
seems to love the Apple watch more and
more lately I'm hi Mary there and if I
sound funny I apologize guys I just
picked up a monster cold this is parking
out daily the official juice it have to
do with Google as the company has just
made Android 511 official factory images
are available for download and yes Nexus
devices are getting it but even more
interesting is that the nexus player is
first to get the update for reasons we
don't yet understand obviously we have
to wait to be able to get it give it a
try and let you know what changed but
yeah all the end audio latency stuff is
barely dealt with in this update will
keep you posted as we learn more and one
company that clearly loves the Apple
watch probably even more than Apple is
Microsoft just as the company launched
its support for the Apple watch on one
driver you can now view photos and stuff
like that you can now do the same for
PowerPoint presentations you can now
control powerpoint presentations from
your watch move back and forward you can
see how much time is lapses you started
the presentation how many slides are
remaining and the only catch here is
that yeah the Apple watch only works
with the iphone so yeah you would have
to be streaming your presentation from
the iphone but hey that's something
we'll see how it involves eventually
other official news have samson applying
desperate measures in order to gain some
mindshare in japan just leave you an
idea apple owns 51.1 percent of the
japanese market compared to samsung that
has five point six percent and we didn't
get that wrong and the way they're going
to do it is by eliminating the samsung
brand on the galaxy s6 nothing says
Samson on the phone or anywhere now it's
just going to be that the combo galaxy
s6 or the AU galaxy s6 even Samsung's
facebook page changed its name even the
Samsung wireless charger changed his
name is samsung says that the galaxy
brand is very popular in japan enough
for it to go on its own but we know that
the perp is another one
it seems that I don't know why Japanese
people don't really like Samsung but
yeah this is what the company is doing
we just wonder if it'll work and for
those of you that are wondering exactly
when Windows 10 will be launched I get
it a lot on Twitter well Andy CEO just
came on record in a conference call for
quarter results the claim that Microsoft
is launching it in July by the end of
July and that was an argument as to part
of the company's strategy so even though
this is not a Microsoft with real
statement AMD is a very big partner for
Microsoft so yeah it seems that
Microsoft is focus on trying to get some
back-to-school love from customers by
launching Windows 10 at that time so
yeah it seems that that is going to be
the deal we just wonder if it's going to
launch first on hardware for you to bite
and then the upgrade will go live after
back to school we'll keep you posted on
that way and finally for the very
interesting news of the day LG continues
to tease the g4 this time they have
professional photographer Colby Brown
which I've never heard of claiming that
the LG g4 has an amazing camera that
point one aperture is so significant
hence galaxy s6 compared to the 1.8
aperture of the LG g4 yes makes such a
difference that yeah this makes for much
better photos and the manual controls on
the LG g4 also something that is great
for him and he compares to twist
professional lenses and stuff like that
and yeah according to him this is the
best camera he's got coming from a
professional photographer that's hard to
believe and it leads me to the question
of the day what do you think about this
way of LG marketing its camera do you
think that it sets the bar so high that
once we review the phone it could
probably disappoint people in my case
I'll tell you this much LG is not the
first company to do this so yeah we're
used to it and the LG does have good
cameras we did test the g2 the g3 these
were good cameras and we are expecting
the g4 to be even better and we want to
test it but leave us a comment down
below what do you think friends you know
the drill if you want to get it was
early over for this video is Phil
machine follow us on pocketnow.com is
described change of channel as well you
me on Twitter Jaime underscore Lavetta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am high memory
that I thank you very much for watching
