what's going on everybody I'm coming to
you from Zurich in Switzerland where
they are having the launch of the Oppo
Reno now actually have a chance to check
out to the Oppo Reno for this morning
right before the event so we're gonna
walk around the immediate area here in
Zurich maybe go downtown a little bit
take some photos and then we see if I
can do this kind of hands-on a little
bit differently I'll give you my
thoughts as I'm using the phone during
this morning speaking of which I am
including this clip in the general
hands-on for pocket now but I just
wanted to say that all the photos and
videos that you're seeing in this
hands-on are also being done in a real
world camera test over on my channel so
if you want to check out a video that is
entirely made up of everything the Oppo
Reno can do you can head over to my
channel youtube.com slash right off the
bat using this phone well we have a
pretty high spec list you get all of the
good internals I glued in the snapdragon
855 which I actually used in order to
get a little bit of gaming done now
quick caveat for this hands-on what I'm
actually using here is the Chinese
software edition of the phone so the
operating system here is not going to be
final software nor is it even going to
be one that many of you would actually
end up using if you get this funk
outside of Asia but that said the color
OS still looks pretty good so Xian this
full HD plus display and the display
itself even if it has that slightly
lower resolution than some flagships it
actually looks really awesome I was able
to play a couple of videos on here
checked out a little bit of YouTube
using the web browser since I can't
install YouTube the actual app on this
phone but gaming has been a pretty fun
experience on here already because it
has those high specifications it has a
cooling system and also has something
called the game space where you can
actually dump a lot of the memory and
then overclock or rather put the phone
into a performance mode so you can get
even better performance out of your
games a lot of what you might already
like about oppa phones returns here
there's a large battery in here just a
smidge over 4,000 milliamp hours but
then of course you have luke fast
charging that's now in version 3.0 and
you can top up the phone
you quickly whenever you need power so
if you're running out of juice you could
just plug this into the charger that
comes with the phone and you're able to
get some power back real quick I have to
say this is a pretty beautiful device
class on glass design doesn't have a
camera hump but that does mean that the
phone is a bit thicker than you what you
might expect after all you have the
three cameras on the bag and depending
on what version of the phone you end up
getting you can have a 10 times optical
zoom you can have a wide-angle lens but
all of the opal Reno's of course have
that pop up camera on the top I call it
the peekaboo or as you saw at the
beginning of this video it is the baby
shark phone at least I thought that was
a pretty funny reference to make for
this phone but overall it feels like a
pretty nice device it feels a lot like
the Oppo find X which of course had its
own pop up camera it's just a little bit
bigger with a six point four or six
point six inch display depending on the
version you get once again that
motorized front-facing camera also hides
the earpiece and that earpiece kind of
emanates from a tiny little slit that's
at the very top so it's not like you're
going to lose out on a call speaker when
you're not using the camera or when that
flap is not up finally made it down to
the city centre ish we're right outside
of z√ºrich HB The Hub done topped bahnhof
and we're taking a few pictures next to
this body of water here's Lake I want to
say it's a river maybe but we have some
shots here that we can use the 10x zoom
on and that's really the crux of this
whole opera know this 10x zoom version
you have a wide-angle lens
you have a telephoto lens it's the
periscope line that allows for up to six
X optical zoom and then 10x hybrid serve
so you can get pretty far with your zoom
and it's something that we wanted to
test out with the zurich map with the
mountains around this area I mean after
all we're in Switzerland but
unfortunately they're a little bit far
away so we have to make do with the
architecture around us
one thing that I feel is easy to forget
about this phone after all you have that
motorized camera you have all of the
lenses on the rear all the capabilities
and the camera app it allows for a
number of different modes including
slow-mo capture so there are a lot of
options so you can really have some fun
with the cameras here but one of the
lenses actually the main lens is is the
new Sony IMX 48 megapixel sensor so I
did take a few 14 megapixel shot so you
can see some of the greater detail you
can get in there but yeah it's actually
easy to forget about it because you have
to go way into the settings to actually
activate it but there's this tiny little
nub here on the back center where you
would normally find the fingerprint
sensor the fingerprint sensor is in the
display and it's a good it's a good
working one so far I've only been able
to use it for a little bit but it's
still reliable to get into the operating
system but in place of where that
fingerprint reader would be on the back
is this little nub and for a while I
would just kept like picking at it to be
honest it kind of creates some
separation between the table that it
might be resting on and the cameras they
can are way back to where the venue is
going to be to our hotel and then to the
benefit right now the main takeaway so
that there are a lot of things that this
phone is doing right now very low screen
to body ratio very small bezels so the
phone itself is beautiful no camera yes
does feel very premium and oh by the way
he said whether he goes from the thing
is and this is something we're going to
have to see if it's fixed in the final
your units they're not that many options
you can't use all of the lenses for all
of the modes it's a little bit of a
bummer so being able to use the zoom or
the wide-angle for video for example
that would be a great addition but again
that has to do with hopefully software
updates coming in the future so we'll
see where that goes once we get our
hands on the reviewing it but for now
we're gonna go ahead and call it on this
kind of a new type of way for me to do
these hands-on videos I figured since I
have the phone on me right now and the
both of us were able to take a bunch of
the pictures and photos with it I might
as well do something like on the fly so
let me know what you thought of this
format of the hands-on video on location
here at the launch in Zurich peekaboo or
baby shark like what what what's your
what's a better title
well then baby shark it is alright thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
