a new and interesting feature that makes
them more prosumer we get some leaks of
the huawei mate 20 pro and it looks
pretty good and for tonight should
already be available for Android devices
depending on certain conditions I'm
Jaime Rivera and definitely remember
this video is not just available here on
YouTube it's also a podcast in addition
it's also in Spanish you can learn more
about everything in the link in the
description this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for pixels it seems
that it's about that time for you to be
able to buy them because they're $200
off and obviously there are some project
5 conditions here but 649 for the pixel
to excel and 64 gigabytes and then it's
just $100 more if you want the 128
gigabyte variant which is the one that I
use and obviously again there are some
benefits with project 5 that is actually
the carriers that I use and I highly
recommend them you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about for
tonight for Android as of today it
should be available to everyone
obviously it's like a sort of an
invite-only feature where this is still
a beta so you will participate and not
perfect software but it is for tonight
I'm not saying that it's actually worth
it to play on a phone but it's that I
don't think you lose anything giving it
a try to learn more about the process of
the description as well now let's talk
about the huawei mate 20 pro as we've
got some leaks of the display the knotch
seems to be significant but apparently
the reason why is because there is 3d
sensing as the iPhone will not be the
only phone to bring that feature in
order to be able to help you unlock your
phone that's fine and dandy we also here
specification skerin 980 processor which
is the one that's been rumored with a7
an ohmmeter process that should be
awesome stay tuned as we can't wait to
see when we'll get it and I can't really
tell you that I'm excited about Motorola
phones lately but it seems that the Moto
z3 is not going to be the only phone
apparently the company is also working
on that iPhone like phone that we saw in
leaks earlier it's dubbed the p30
brings a notch brings dual cameras at
the back and it looks pretty much like
an iPhone in so many ways let's see
exactly what is going to be the
different selling point here as in the
case of the z3 it was literally the
by stacking that was it and finally the
hot news today have to do with the
iPhone 10 10 plus an iPhone 9 we don't
know which of these devices will have
the leaked feature that's apparently
going to be the new cool thing we've
always wondered like why have a plus
phone if you can't use things like the
Apple pencil which is something that
Samsung does with its Galaxy Note lineup
rumors have it that this is something
that will be a capability on the next
generation iPhone not exactly sure if
it's only gonna be a plus feature though
it makes senses you have the larger
canvas but in today's question let us
know I mean would an iPhone 10 plus with
Apple pencil support be enticing to you
because in my case I am a big fan of the
galaxy note I like using it and the
Apple pencil is awesome on the iPad pro
so I would say yes leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know what you
think friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us on packing
