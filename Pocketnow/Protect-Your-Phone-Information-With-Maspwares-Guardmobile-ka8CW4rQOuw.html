hey everyone Daniel Webster here at pacu
now calm and today I'm going to show you
a cool application that's going to allow
you to find your phone in case since
ever lost or stolen and the program is
called guard mobile and it's my mask
where and the program isn't that
expensive you only cost about ten
dollars and it is a pretty good
investment if anyone has heard about
that diamond to that was stolen from CES
2009 this year apparently this phone was
stolen from Microsoft and it had windows
phone 6.5 installed on it will about
Microsoft did is they sent a signal to
the phone and actually did a hard reset
of the phone and delete that information
so no one was able to steal that
software okay so I'm just going down
here to menu and settings going to set
it up real fast so over my pin which is
1111 entered okay so right here you can
see this is where you actually able are
able to change your pan and give your
device a name so it's just 1 1 1 1 and X
period because that's what this point is
so if you ever want to uninstall the
program you'll need to select this
without this button selected you will
never be able to uninstall it I've tried
so take my word on this one okay so
right here is where you give your client
restriction you have up to three numbers
but the first one is where first one is
the number that's actually going to get
a text message in case your phone is in
case the sim card has ever replaced in
your phone so we'll just save those
settings I'll go down here into menu and
client ctrl + enter our pan again
and right here is where you're going to
designate the phone number of who you
want to have control of your device
certain features of this program allow a
user to actually lock your phone well
let's go through them you can locate set
a key lock turn on the alarm turn off
the alarm lock your phone unlock your
phone which these lock features they
can't be turned off and the our alarm
can't be turned off either a soft reset
hard reset just in case you do have very
sensitive information that is worth more
than the phone a call back feature which
allows you to get the phone number of
the SIM card that called you and an ICC
ID number which is the SIM card ID
number and you have three presets than
you can predetermine those so we'll just
close this and what if you click on one
of these buttons it'll send an SMS
message on how to activate this feature
so we'll just close this right now okay
so now I have another phone that I can
use to set up those predetermined client
controls but first I need to activate
the program so I'm just going to
activate here enter my pin
and now it's now active ok so now i can
show you how to do those certain
features so what you need to do is
you'll need to set up pound then your
pin number whatever the pin over you set
up on your client control and then pound
again and then whatever feature you want
so like if i wanted to locate and i'll
show you that and click send
your Xperia guard mobile says device
position is and then it gives you a
longitude and latitude but you can't see
that of course because I don't want
everyone to know where I live okay so
now I'm going to show you how to lock
the device just pound then 1 1 1 1 pound
locked so send that and as you can see
here it's now locked in nothing will do
what a thing will do anything to turn
this off I can't hit n I can't hit talk
nothing even even a soft reset won't
won't turn off this lock so I'll show
you how to unlock that okay so the same
thing pound 1111 pow and unlocked and
they'll send that and here we have the
devices unlocked and went to the panel's
ok and the last final feature i'm going
to show you is actually alarm on and
it's the most annoying feature of this
program because if anyone was to
actually get your device in their hands
not only would it be locked and you find
their GPS coordinates and you'd have
their ID number from their pit from
their sim card and their phone number
but you also have this really annoying
alarm so I'll show you that okay so once
I send this it's going to be very loud
not actually hold my hand or the speaker
because it's almost too loud so send
that okay so as you can hear the alarm
is very annoying and it will definitely
Drive someone that very mad very quick
so I'm just going to hit send alarm off
and it should turn off in just a second
okay and finally the alarm turns off and
it will also send you a confirmation to
your device if you can see this here
it'll show you a confirmation of what
the Xperia says it says oh here comes
another one so it says the alarm has
stopped so it does many different
features and it's well worth the ten
dollars i would suggest downloading i'll
post a link on pacquiao calm afternoon
