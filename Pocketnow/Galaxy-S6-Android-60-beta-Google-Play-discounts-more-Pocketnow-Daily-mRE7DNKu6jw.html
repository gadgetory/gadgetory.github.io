already begun in certain areas google
play store deals make it compelling to
consume a little media this holiday
season if you thought the iPad pro would
so well think again I'm high muttering
that I and all I wanted for Christmas
was a day off but wouldn't that be
boring this is parking out daily the
official news today begin again with
deals as google continues to raise the
ante in this department if you're
interested in buying a few music albums
right now some of these are fifty
percent off right now if you're
interested in renting a few movies as
well some of these are 75 percent off as
well the titles are actually not that
bad but I would bore you with details
links in the description full details on
what you're getting and for those of you
that are really diehard blackberry fans
interested in deals on the Trib think
again we've got some official news here
that confirm that the company is not
considering any price tag drops from
those crazy seven hundred dollars
unlocked apparently the company is
waiting until after mwc for us to see
anything and if you thought that the
more affordable blackberry Venice that's
being rumoured would be the option if
you want to pay less apparently that
device won't be ready until later this
year after mwc so yeah that's the way it
goes now certain leaks that we've been
rather skeptical about have to do with
the Moto X 2016 particularly because the
fact that was leaked recently was just
horrible it's really hard for us to
believe that this is the future Moto X
but then again yes this is a Lenovo
company now so anything can happen but
then again Lenovo is really not that bad
at smartphone design but we've got other
leaks up the back again this time
flipped over and we see a
heat-dissipating pipe meaning that
probably the processor will be in me of
this it could be a Snapdragon 820 not
necessarily sure what we're getting here
since we're just too far away from when
this product will be launched anyways
and even though we still cannot
understand apples logic for rescuing the
tablet market with the iPad pro I mean
this is a more expensive tablet that is
obviously larger a little more
cumbersome and certain things and not
necessarily as productive but yeah it
seems that the
sumers are already reacting to that as
we're sure that Apple was expecting to
sell it crazy amount of these tablets in
China and as it turns out both the ipad
mini 4 and iPad pro barely make a small
fraction of what the ipad air 2 cells
and since the ipad air 2 isn't really
selling well either it seems that the
whole ipad market isn't really growing
or going anywhere anytime soon let's see
what apple points to do about that and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the fact that Android 6 title
marshmallow is already being beta tested
in Korea for the galaxy s6 and galaxy s6
edge this is major news because we were
expecting the galaxy note5 to be the
first device and yes this will be the
device that gets the official build
earlier but it's cool that consumers
have the option to be able to test the
latest build of marshmallow exactly sure
if Samsung plans to expand this beta
test outside of Korea but it seems that
the company is gearing up for a launch
of this update very soon hopefully
before the Galaxy s7 just to you know
drive more fidelity from consumers but
it does lead me to the question of the
day for those of you galaxy s6 users out
there what would you like to see in this
marshmallow update in my case obviously
the basic marshmallow features but in
addition to that how about some
optimization particularly with battery
life leave us a comment down below what
would you like to see here friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the dozer Lee ER before this video
is filmed make sure you follow us on
