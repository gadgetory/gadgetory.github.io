calm and we're going to take a look at
our hardware tour for the HTC surround
first off you got your screen here
that's a 3.8 inch screen and inside
we've got one gay Hearst processor like
most Windows Phone 7 devices and 576
megs of ram and so let's take a little
closer look up here we have our HTC and
ATT logos at the top we've got some
light sensors in there you can kind of
see them right there your speaker grill
nice little silver rim silver room goes
all the way around the edge and there's
our capacitive hardware buttons the
start menu of the back button the search
button and they're all nice and flat so
that you can't feel them and at the
bottom we've got a micro USB port and
this is just a little slip for you to
pry the cover off the back so that you
can access the battery will do that in a
minute over here we got nothing just
some little chrome the top you got your
power button and headphone jack and over
on this side we got your volume toggle
up and down plus a minus and your camera
button right there okay and on the back
I got some fingerprints there already
and you got your 5 megapixel camera with
an LED flash a little speaker grille and
logos SRS Dobie so those are some nice
speakers and you got a windows phone
logo there we go so if I slide it
there's our special speakers and there's
a button over there we'll see what that
does later and what else is on back here
that's a kickstand
nice little angler so that'll let us
stand it up that's pretty cool okay and
you gotta remember to flip it back down
because if you slide it that's going to
get caught so we're gonna do that all
right let me see if I can get the
battery off battery cover off it's kind
of a kind of pry it come on there we go
you got it it's force there under here
we have our battery I believe this is 12
30 million per hours let's take it out
get theirs and you got your sim card
slot right there this looks like it
might be a microSD card under there but
you're not allowed to get there okay
let's put that out so there's the HTC
surround and stay tuned we'll turn it on
and test it out that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
