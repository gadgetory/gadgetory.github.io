be the first folks to pack the seven
nanometer process some very credible
pictures of the oneplus sixty's box have
emerged then we like what we see and
Samsung is even bringing a triple camera
to its Galaxy a line this year or next
I'm Jaime Rivera and back on the green
screen back in New York I know this face
is jet lag as it oh my god I can't even
start this is pocket house daily the
official news today begin with leaks
that became official the vivo v11 is now
live obviously in Asia to start but what
makes this phone special are a couple of
design changes like that teardrop design
that we've seen in the Oppo f9 the fact
that there is an on display fingerprint
sensor which is great and specifications
of a premium mid-range err I'm not sure
it's gonna leave Asia anytime soon but
you can learn more about specs in the
description and the most of you that
remember the whole April Fool thing of
five camera lenses on a Nokia phone that
apparently would rotate this and that it
seems that the company actually took
that joke seriously up to the point
where apparently there's a prototype out
there we're not exactly sure if it's
like what we saw in the joke where the
camera actually rotated to a certain
degree I think that would be the best
design this one actually looks very
weird it looks very sci-fi but hey you
never know
and speaking of the trend of more
cameras on your smartphone we hear that
well Samsung LG Apple all these
companies are working on bringing triple
cameras to the future but apparently
it's not just going to be to the
high-end phones it seems that Sammy
wants to bring that to it's a lineup as
well we actually heard rumors very early
on this might happen now it seems that
it could even happen this year stay
tuned for that there's one of the
spotlight over to one of the phones that
I'm looking forward to most lately
that's the one plus 60 we've covered so
many rumors and the whole vivo design
actually could have something to do with
the one below 60 because the leaked
photos that just emerged show is the Box
show was a stringed literature that
points to that teardrop design in
addition to an on display fingerprint
scanner that can be great but we're not
exactly sure if that's going to happen
or not
we'll see as well and finally the hot
news today believe it or not have to do
with iPhones we are just the week away
from the event and we've just been
surprised by the fact that apparently
this processor for the next generation
iPhones
is bringing the seven nanometer process
and I just came from Berlin where Huawei
touted that they were the first at 7 an
ohmmeter which brings 30% more
efficiency and etc but apparently the
iPhones will launch before that made 20
Pro that's gonna bring that processor
that's all fine and dandy we will see in
the end what happens just keep in mind
this is probably that best time for you
to do something about your current
iPhone or for you to consider buying a
current iPhone that's already on its way
now you can find devices like the iPhone
aids for 419 bucks at swap and this is
probably also the best time to link your
device at swap as well you learn more
about that in the first thing in the
description and today's question let us
know what do you think 7a no meters of
technology do you think that Apple has
everything it needs to make that iPhone
succeed because in my case I feel that
if they get a better camera and bring
the headphone jack would be great but
