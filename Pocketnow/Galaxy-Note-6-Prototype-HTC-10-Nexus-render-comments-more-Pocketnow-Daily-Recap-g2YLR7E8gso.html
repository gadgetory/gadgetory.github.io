daily recaps yeah why not how many use
those bags into your eyes for grocery
shopping you know i'm going to start
laughing in about three two never mind
when Jaime loves drinking what Jaime
hates jet lag and I think I'm not the
only one in that department alright
we've read your comments we know you
wanted this back so here we go again I'm
home it'll be better with pocket now and
this is our pocket I'll daily recap for
last week on Monday the news were about
some very interesting renders of the HTC
10 that looked a lot like a nexus we do
believe that these were just made on
reddit but we asked you would you like
for the future nexus smartphones made by
HTC to keep the HTC 10 design we had 587
comments for that HTC + Nexus take my
money and you know I do believe that if
that combination comes back just like in
the case of the nexus one it would be a
great combo it would just depend on the
implementation I feel that the tens
hardware is amazing we just have to see
what the Nexus will look like as Google
does dip a little in that HTC nexus
without sense looks nonsense you know
it's funny when I wear your comment at
first i was like no you're wrong but
then again yes i do love that combo that
was made with HTC Sense and stock
Android applications I do believe that
this launcher looks better but then
again that's my opinion I would like
another company to do the next Nexus
Sony for example a lot of people would
like Sony to try into the Nexus we don't
know why both these companies don't work
together and it's just funny it's it's
it's hilarious how Sony does android
phones but you notice that their
relationship with Google is like really
bad up to the point where you don't see
any sony products anywhere that has to
do with google it's just like if they're
just using the OS for themselves and
that hasn't really paid that off that
well tuesday the topic was the LG g5
friends i asked you are getting the new
LG g5 mainly because of its friends we
had 287 comments if i had the g5 i would
only buy the deck audio is life audio is
love you know I still don't understand
why LG built the deck into the v10 and
not the g5 it just doesn't make any
sense the friends are cool but I really
only care about the extra battery which
is a
son you know I do care about that extra
battery i love the Wits waffle and
everything but I would love for the
battery life on the g5 to be a little
better the only reason not to upgrade
the g5 is because of the next Nexus
we're a little far off for the next
Nexus anyways Wednesday the topic was
the future of Samsung Galaxy smartphone
cameras we saw a few pence over what the
company wants to do and I asked you what
would you like to see in future
smartphone cameras out of that we had
341 comments more megapixels better
low-light performance optical zoom yes I
would like all that combination but I
don't think that more megapixels and
better low-light go together right now I
think that'll take some time Galaxy s7
camera is the best but I would love to
see better zoom slower slow mo wider
lens option without ugly dual camera
design and also a thermal option my god
you want that thing to talk to I want a
proper shutter button on samsung
flagships like Lumias I would love for
every single smartphone camera in the
business to do that like seriously I
don't care about double tapping the home
button or double tapping the volume
button or double swiping to the bottom
it's ridiculous just add an extra button
if you want to make smartphone cameras
about smartphone cameras you have to add
a button it just it's necessary on
Thursday the topic was Microsoft's
quarter results we talked about how bad
the company was in smartphones how good
it was doing in tablets and I asked you
what kept you away from getting a Lumia
smartphone this year now that we do have
black ships we had 138 comments look at
an s7 and you'll understand why people
forgot about lumias yeah I kind of get
it because there is literally no reason
to buy windows phone over an iphone or
android phone you make a compelling
point there is no real benefit in owning
a Lumia you know the operating system is
stagnated there are no applications that
are relevant the ones that were are
slowly leaving the platform and it just
stops being compelling what's the point
about going for a microsoft phone if
even microsoft forgets about its own
platform all the hardware is better than
the new ones so it's software i really
miss windows phone 7 and 8 my god i
really miss Windows Phone 6
Friday the topic was the galaxy note 6
we heard about some prototypes some of
these had a larger battery but then I
asked you in the questions would you
prefer a replaceable battery or a larger
battery in the next Galaxy Note 6 we had
919 comments we need a removable leather
back on the note 6 with a metal frame
best phone period we had pho leather on
the note for that didn't work it was a
replaceable battery it wasn't popular
but I do think it was because of the
quality of the Luminum and the champers
which looked terrible over time so yeah
why not why not pull a galaxy note 6
with the galaxy note 5 design and just
add the removable back that would make a
lot of sense if only there was a way to
make your battery come out of the
unibody metal and glass phone LG
breathes heavily yeah that would be
awesome it would be awesome for a
company to figure out what LG did but
with a you know better sort of hardware
design the problem of the g5 wasn't
really even the design it was totally
the you know the choice for design
materials the phone just didn't really
feel premium bigger battery even if it
makes the phone a little thicker that's
the compelling point about smartphones
for the longest time companies continue
wanting to go thin and light and then
users don't even care about how thin and
light is true we have to remember how
thick phones were about seven years ago
so that made a point years ago today we
want phones to be more useful over time
so I wouldn't mind the phone becoming
thicker I just want the phone to perform
better over time as well I agree that's
it for the bucket out daily recap thank
