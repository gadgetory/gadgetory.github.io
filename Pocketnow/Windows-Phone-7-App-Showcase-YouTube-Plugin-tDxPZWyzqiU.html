pocketnow.com a youtube plugin was just
released for windows phone 7 devices
it's available for free on the
marketplace and it lets you watch
youtube videos that you find on the web
let's take a look so this is a very
simple plugin it does exactly what you
think it would do and let's demonstrate
it here so i am going to go to pocket
now calm did a miss press there so slide
down i'm going to go to the full desktop
view and show you a page with some
videos in there so here we go to the
desktop version of pocket now jump into
landscape real quick and let it load up
ok here we go and let's go to a post
with a video such as this one jump right
into that let's zoom in on the screen a
little bit and so what we're going to
see is a little play button kind of like
you get on the iphone or an android that
will then launch the YouTube player so
we scroll down a little bit to a space
where there should be a video and you
can see that it's almost unloading there
and there it is you get the thumbnail of
the video and a play button if we hit
play it will launch into the YouTube
player works pretty fast would be nicer
if it was in line but you know can have
everything here quality is very very
just probably do not HD quality there
are no settings associated with this
program so you can't change the quality
but it looks like we're getting the 480
stream not the low end or not the high
end right in the middle now there is an
application associated with this so we
swipe to the right and go down to the
bottom you'd think that this will launch
a windows phone seven style YouTube app
and instead it's just a link to M
youtube com which is ok I guess but I'll
be nice if there's a dedicated app for
Windows Phone 7 so a must-have plugin
for this platform so that you can look
at youtube videos while you're browsing
the web it's available for free in the
marketplace and that's it for now thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
