about audio we started a new series here
at pocketnow.com called the real audio
review to complement our real camera
review we kicked this series off at the
iPhone 7 and Apple's controversial
decision to remove the headphone jack we
got a number of comments and replies to
that first real audio review we want to
take a little time to address some of
the concerns in our testing process
explain what that testing process is and
what we're going to be doing moving
forward to make sure that we've got sort
of an even playing field for all of our
gadgets the number one issue to address
many Apple fans felt we were being
unfair to the iPhone 7 because we
weren't testing this phone with
third-party headphones that connects to
the Lightning adapter the idea being
Apple got rid of the 3.5 millimeter jack
to encourage other manufacturers to
include better signal processing
Hardware on headphones and that's really
what's going to improve the overall
quality for consumers that we shouldn't
be judging the iPhone quality through
this adapter we can only judge the
quality by buying more expensive
accessories after we purchased the phone
at that point we have a very basic reply
if that's the case then we're no longer
reviewing the audio quality of the phone
we're just doing accessory reviews for
example I could say my laptop has
amazing audio quality oh but not through
the headphone jack built into my laptop
it's because I've invested thousands of
dollars in high-end recording equipment
that I can plug into my laptop is that
fair to the people who watch our videos
trying to understand how these things
work we don't think so out of the box
this is what Apple gives you so this is
what we have to test just like out of
the box all of these phones have a
headphone jack that we could listen to
and measure the output from I mean why
should we even bother telling you that
the Galaxy headphone jacks have been
kind of disappointing this year you're
just going to go out and buy really
expensive headphones that plug into a
micro USB port right and for some of the
people complaining who obviously didn't
watch our video review of the Moto Z and
the Moto Z force we handled the
Motorola's exactly the same way we
reviewed what came out of the box which
that brings me to my next point
once more headphone manufacturers start
building the DAX directly into the
headphones there's going to be very
little that we can test after that point
on a phone with a headphone jack I can
plug this directly into my workstation
using line and patch cables to get a
very
clear sample of what's coming directly
out of the phone once I plug lightning
headphones into the iPhone what can I
really measure here I've got one of two
options I can try and get mics and line
them up with the little drivers on these
ear pods ignoring the fact that the ear
canal is also partly responsible for
creating the soundscape that you're
listening to and that recording these
tiny little drivers out in the air does
a huge disservice to how these things
really work or to I suppose I could try
to cut the drivers off of these cables
take these lines and then solder them
onto some sort of 3.5 millimeter Jack
which I can then plug into my
workstation but honestly my soldering
skills not that good moving forward for
the real audio review we got a couple
other comments from people requesting
that we provide some kind of baseline
product that we can gauge performance
against some products that are gonna be
better than our baseline and some
devices that are going to be worse than
our baseline over the weekend I invested
in this adorable little fee okay one
this is a USB powered 24-bit headphone
DAC this is a really discreet small bus
powered device it can connect to a
number of different devices from phones
tablets laptops desktops to improve
headphone quality it works great on an
iPhone while also working on a number of
different Android devices just as a
quick tangent though to get it properly
working on an iPhone you do need the
camera connector kit in addition to a
USB cable so you end up with this chain
of adapters versus the $3.00 USB see two
micro USB cable you need to power it on
an Android phone
but I digress this is a handy little
gadget produces great audio quality and
does bump us up to 24-bit 96 kilohertz
playback a nice improvement over what
Apple delivers out of the box on the
iPhone 7 for all of that rambling the K
one improves upon the iPhone and
delivering a wider frequency response a
wider EQ range lower distortion numbers
and a lower noise floor we think the K
one is pretty keen but it still loses to
some phones which still feature built-in
headphone jacks but we'll have to save
that analysis for a future video as
always folks thanks so much for watching
be sure to subscribe to this channel for
more audio commentary more real audio
reviews and help us out with some

some gadget guy on twitter and instagram
and i will catch you all on the next
video
