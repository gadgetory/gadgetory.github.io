now calm and in this video we're going
to take a look at fennec 2 point 0 alpha
for Android this is another web browser
also known as Firefox for mobile does a
lot of cool tricks let's get to it okay
so as stated this is an alpha it crashes
a lot but it does some cool things that
gives us a glimpse of what Mozilla is
thinking for Firefox for mobile going
into the future they used to have a
windows mobile version of this it was an
alpha it didn't work really at all so
they've shifted focus to Android now so
hopefully we can have finally a real
Firefox for mobile experience on Android
now one of the coolest things that it
does and we'll start off with that is
that using Firefox Sync on your desktop
browser it's an add-on you can actually
sink tabs passwords and bookmarks with
your mobile client which is perfect so
you can have the same internet
experience or kind of a continued
internet experience on your mobile
device so on the start page here I can
tap taps from other computers and it's
going to synchronize with my desktop or
my account I've already put in my
username and password for my Firefox
Sync account and here you can see four
tabs that I have open on my desktop
computer so I'm just going to tap on the
tap the top one here and it's an XDA
link and it's going to open it up just
like I've had it on my desktop okay and
let's see how it is to move around on
the page just going to swipe down a
little bit choppy this is not the
fastest browser it doesn't do multi
touch or at least most of the time it
doesn't you saw just moved in a little
bit it's not the most smooth browser but
again this is an alpha it's not meant to
be terribly fast it's very jumpy and
sporadic okay and you just saw the tab
management feature if you swipe to the
right you get to see your tabs kind of
an interesting way to see the tabs that
you have open a lot of other browsers
like the stock Android Browser put it in
a separate window but Mozilla made it
really easy with just a swipe to the
right so we can multiple manage multiple
tabs here I'm going to press the plus
button and go to another website let's
go to Google by the way this does not
have
flash support okay we've got a mobile
version of a site here let's open up
another tab just to get a sense for how
things feel extra we'll just go to
Amazon so there is a shortcut right at
the bottom of the screen again swiped
left for tabs or swipe right for tags
and then swipe left for other options
and so here we are on Amazon again it's
alpha it doesn't work very well but it's
kind of a proof of concept here and we
can add as a favorite with the start or
we can go to the settings here and quite
simply we can determine if it should
show images enabled JavaScript allow
cookies remember password and my device
name here is B minimun that's my
username for sync Fenech on linux linux
is Android we can go to the right and go
to the downloads manager and then we go
to the right again and this is where all
the add-ins come in so of course you can
have presumably in the future have
adblock and Twitter integration and all
sorts of other great extensions and
add-ons for your mobile client just like
you have for firefox on the desktop and
they give you some suggestions of
add-ons that you may want to add don't
want to talk too much about that because
as it is the the browser is not that
stable don't want to add too many
add-ons now there's a cool another cool
feature if we tap on the menu button we
get this drop down and we can tap save
as PDF now imagine being able to save a
website as a PDF be able to read it
later when you're offline great idea it
doesn't work too well it brings up this
bio manager and it's not really usable
so we have to go cancel actually click
the back button sometimes it freezes in
the screen and here we are in Amazon the
pinch to zoom isn't working can't decide
if it actually has pinch to zoom because
sometimes it works sort of and most of
the time it doesn't so fennec on android
is on the right track it's very much
alpha right now definitely not usable as
your day-to-day browser you definitely
want to stick the stock android browser
or if there are other Android browsers
out there that you can use that our
third party but the promise of fennec to
be able to synchronize your bookmarks
and your passwords and your tabs
with the Firefox that you have on the
desktop is a great idea being able to
save as a PDF is a great idea and
another great idea is having add-ons
that we've become accustomed to Firefox
on regular computers so hopefully
Mozilla continues to develop fennec
please thumbs up this video if you liked
it and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
