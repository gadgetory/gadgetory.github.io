as positive as we thought we get some
new rumor is on the future version of
Windows and yes the HTC one of nine plus
is now official but not for everyone I'm
high Meadow iveta and if you don't mind
please share your thoughts on furious 7
I might go watch it tonight with the
kids this is pocket out daily there are
a lot of official news today starting
with Apple as the company has just
launched iOS 83 for the masses and yet
they even launched at OS 10 10 10 3 as
well for the mac and in the case of a
top three we already knew it was coming
here we heard of new enhancements for
Siri we also heard of new emoji icons
with a different skin tones in addition
to other major performance enhancements
and app launches third-party keyboards
and a lot of stuff actually the list is
quite substantial so mixes description
to read that and in the case of OS 10
you get a new photos application in
addition to the emojis as well other
official Lucia they have HTC finally
launching the One m9 plus though bear
with me here not everything is positive
we do get the quad HD 5.2 inch display
we do get the 20 megapixel dual lens
camera we do get the fingerprint scanner
what we don't get as a phone for our
region's it's not available in the
United States or Europe it's only
available for China right now and you
also get a MediaTek processor for
reasons we don't understand but other
things if this phone are great and you
can always buy it at other stores and
just ship it to yourself if you want one
now as we get closer to April 10th which
is the pre-orders for the Apple watch we
do see Google already ramping up
competition they just posted a full
article of all the watch phases you get
for Android wear and you also get to
deal watch band options in 20 millimeter
format because most the Android wear
smartwatches have that form factors so
if you want a better watch bands from
the three different manufacturers or you
want different Android wear options
there's a bevy of that in the licks
description now let's move the spotlight
over to Microsoft the stress that
sources are claiming that we already
know what the next version of Windows
code name is now it's being called
whetstone
and if you play minecraft you know what
we're talking about merrily microsoft
plans to make this a major update for
2016 even though Windows 10 is not even
close to being launched yet not exactly
sure what microsoft plans to enhance but
apparently it'll have a lot to do with
functionality between form factors but
again the list is long and we're not
really sure how credible this is at such
an early stage considering this is for
2016 and finally for the skeptical news
of the day if you were planning on
pre-ordering the Apple watch to have it
shipped to you that might not
necessarily be the best idea even though
we're not sure the store option would be
even better considering what Apple is
doing to pull people away from the
stores but it seems that if you order
specific Apple watch units specifically
stainless steel models it seems that
you'll have to wait between april twenty
fourth and may eight to get it but there
are some variants that are being
estimated as a six-week wait after april
twenty fourth by the way so we're not
really sure how much time are you going
to have to wait but it leads me to the
question of the day if you were to buy
an Apple watch and I know many of you
won't I know many of you don't want to
but if you would buy one which one would
you pick because in my case I really do
like the stainless steel links Apple
watch that cost a thousand dollars but I
guess that's the reason why I like it I
have that sort of taste he was a comment
down below what do you pick friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is Phil
machine follow us on car cannot comment
subscribe changing channel as well you'd
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore to
be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am

much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
