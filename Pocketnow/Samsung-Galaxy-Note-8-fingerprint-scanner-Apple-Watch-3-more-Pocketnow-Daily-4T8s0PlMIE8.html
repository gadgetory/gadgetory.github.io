scanner is also making its way to the
Galaxy Note 8 the next generation Apple
watch might find itself a new display
technology and we finally get details on
the next generation moto Z I'm Jaime
metal Iveta and I apologize for the
crazy video schedule I'm trying to cram
as many videos as I can with the
festivities this is focking out daily
everyone if you can hear the noise I
apologize there is rain outside and
there's a roof right outside the window
can't fix that anyways let's start the
day off with deals yesterday we covered
some Galaxy s8 deals that were good but
today we've got others that are better
actually $640 will get you a dual-sim
Galaxy s8 on eBay and for those of you
that haven't really tried it out I do
recommend that dual SIM it's actually
very practically and speaking of deals
of you want its closest competitor the
LG G 6 right now it's currently
available at B&amp;amp;H for $550 which is a
good deal on its own but here's the
thing if you go for the LG watch style
you can pay for both at 600 bucks that
is a crazy deal not a really big fan of
the LG watch scale but you get a
SmartWatch for $50 you really can't beat
that I'll start out the Moto Z - we
already saw the Moto Z - play but we
haven't really seen its flagship say we
find some benchmarks that show us the
essentials the fact that it's going to
support the snapdragon 835 processor and
that's pretty much all we know right now
what is this film going to be available
it should over the next few weeks we'll
keep you posted now as well the
spotlight over to the next generation
Apple watch as we hear that Apple might
implement a new display technology micro
LED technology is obviously going to
take up less space it's going to be
perfect for wearables and hopefully they
use that extra space for battery
apparently Apple wants to innovate with
this technology but we're not exactly
sure if that's going to happen on the
next generation Apple watch we'll keep
you posted as we learn more and finally
the very interesting news that they have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
mainly because apparently you're not
going to get an embedded fingerprint
scanner on this phone now bear in mind
we're really far from its time of
production
apparently synaptics even though was
planning to be
this phone is dealing with some issues
that have to do with security we can't
really confirm what these security
issues could be but apparently that is
the main reason why Samsung doesn't want
to launch this technology on such an
important smartphone given everything
that happened on the note 7 debacle it
makes sense but it leads me to the
question today do you think it's
acceptable for Samsung to not figure
this technology out when the rumors are
that the next iPhone will bring that or
do you think that Sam since you just
fixed the placement of the galaxy s 8
fingerprint scanner in my case hey fix
the placement and I'll be fine with it
