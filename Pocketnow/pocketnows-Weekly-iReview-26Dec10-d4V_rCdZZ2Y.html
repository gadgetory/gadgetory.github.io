gang crazy this holiday season scared
too soon land video calls on iOS and
wait verizon and our jailbreak future
seems a little grim with some deft
teamers fighting over some leaks all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi I'm Adam Yvette and
welcome to the pocket now I RB the show
we go through all this week school and
then I so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices first of all happy
holidays for those who celebrate them
thanks very much for your concerns for
those of us who wrote to us because i
was on medical leave for a couple of
weeks but we're back so let's start off
with the cool one of the cool things
this holiday season its sales and
definitely a mobile has taken it really
seriously because they're offering most
if not all of their games at 99 cents
now one of the cool things is having
gameloft and even Namco going just as
crazy a couple of days later offering
almost all their games at 99 cents
apiece to now while they fight this war
themselves i'm going to move a little
side and go get me a couple of games and
i suggest you do the same too because
we're not really sure how long this is
gonna last now it was only a matter of
time before skype figured out how to
bring video calling to the iphone 4 and
the ipod touch 4 there's a front-facing
video camera now one of the interesting
things is that we found it to have a
little verizon logo and some inner
documentation out there now this means
two things number one it's obviously the
fact that it's going to come soon number
two is the fact that the iphone 4 is
going to get to verizon but you know to
add a third thing is house the iphone
going to figure out how to have data and
voice work simultaneously over CM a
network that's going to be really
interesting one thing we'd really love
to see so could it be LTE coming on the
verizon iphone that's going to be really
cool to see eventually hopefully next
month and while continuing on with games
lots of really cool games got updates
this week first of all r h HD got
gyroscope support game center a lot of
really cool things Infinity Blade got
another gear another guy to fight with
and more levels and then angry birds got
50 more levels and the mighty eagle a
weird eagle or whatever it's called but
anyways hit them up they're really cool
really great updates and a lot of
stability issues fixed
with these new updates one of the rumors
out there is the gang center will bring
an update on the next iOS release
probably iOS 5 or iOS 4.3 or something
like that in which it will synchronize
the recent state of your game so let's
say you're playing infinity blade on
your iPhone and then you stop playing
and then you want to continue playing on
your iPad you could just pick off where
you lift off on your iPad through the
game center sync now there's nothing
confirmed just yet again this is just
the rumor not really sure if it's going
to be iOS 5 in the next couple of months
probably April May of next year or iOS
4.3 you know or 4.4 something like that
on january or something recent we're
really not sure what to make of it but
it would be really cool to have it so
let's see what happens and while the
apple remote application just keeps
getting better and better as it just
received an update and now it includes
airplay support you also get internet
radio control through your iOS devices
on a computer and pretty much lots of
bug fixes and everything again this is a
free application that allows you to
control your computer and your itunes
playlists through your iOS device from
anywhere as long as both are connected
to the same Wi-Fi network so really cool
its free go out there and get it
well that doesn't for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool it
seems that our jailbreak future for you
know future iOS devices is not really in
a nice state right now because it seems
that the shatter exploit that really
makes things possible for that team to
be able to jailbreak future devices with
the a4 chip is been leaked now why is
this bad while it seems a shatter
exploit was so good that it would take
apple new hardware to figure out how to
get things done and we had the Deaf
teamers muscle nerd and plastics ninja
arguing over the fact that it got leaked
Comics comes in and says that he has the
real thing and that what was leaked is
not the real deal but he could be
bluffing we're really worried about this
because you've noticed that it's taking
the dev team every time more time to get
Jill bricks working on iOS devices right
now we're working tethered on iOS 4.2
point 1 and they still haven't figured
out how to unlock the phones yet except
for the iphone 3gs obviously so really
not good news we really don't don't know
what's going on with the dev team you
know probably they got hired by apple or
something anyways let's hope they get
their act together if they don't want to
continue doing it fine just have
somebody else come in and fix it because
we still want jailbreaks and well the
appalling after this week is nose dial
it's an application that does just that
it allows you to use your nose to dial
phone numbers on your iPhone with a
really cool no support of you I sadly
the iOS UI is not really built for
nosing but and I really don't know how
I'm not going to cross my eyes while I
do this but supposedly it's cool if
you're out there in winter timing you
don't want to pull your gloves up it's
just bad that you know capacitive
displays make you have to use your
fingers and not use gloves to be able to
touch the screen and everything but then
again for a dollar for something like
that you know weird application I'd say
the you know add based services would
have been cooler but then again ads are
not really knows supportive either so
anyways and well just as it came in it
came out the WikiLeaks application that
allowed you to go through all the
documents you know no comments on that
it sadly been pulled from the app store
with a no particular reason we really
don't know what's going on we really
don't know what sort of infringement it
did with you know the apples terms of
services but it's pulled so don't look
for it anymore and just go to the
website you know anyways that's it for
today's I review thank you very much for
watching be sure to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw and again
happy holidays for those who celebrate
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
