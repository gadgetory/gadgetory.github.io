geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which review five applications
and very same each so let's get to it
while it may be easy to find a cab in
the middle of Manhattan just by waving
out your arm cat for me is a free
application available android market the
legend call a cab directly from your
location so here if i want to call this
cat i can just click here and now will
show me all the cab companies in my area
and ought to just click on of these call
them and see if they have an available
time slot to come pick me up i can also
go back to the math and view with other
cabs that are in my area and also search
through companies i can also click on
the Help button and get other services
that are available in my area we camp
here is a paper application available on
android market that will help you find a
campsite in your area or wherever you're
venturing to so here if I want you just
click on this campsite and I can view
the name of the campsite and get
information and also directions to their
so here if I want to go to a state park
I can just click on there I can call
them and see if they have a reservation
available by clicking on the info button
we get much more information about this
campsite so they have full hookups water
and electric and other utilities
available for your camping needs
livingsocial is a free application
available on android market they will
help you find great deals and adventures
and other things in your area so here if
I go to daily deals it will show me
which deals are available so here I can
view some of the deals and if it like I
can click on this wild vine bistro so
click on there so this deal is pretty
good you can say fifty percent purchases
for twenty you to spend 40 we can view
some of the escapes available Sophie CC
sweet so a savings of sixty-eight
percent that's pretty good and it gives
you a lot of information down below as
what's included doodle droid is a paper
application of Ilum android market this
app is very intuitive because it uses
both speed and pressure to a distinguish
between what kind of artistic flow you
like so here I draw a really slowly it
shows a darker line if I draw a fast it
shows a more a thin line you can see how
it's more transparent and change the
colors down here so if the one choose a
different color I can go over here and
choose a different color and it so we
have other tools we can choose from we
can also change the back
if we like if we like this image we can
just go down to the menu and save it
share it and do whatever we want a game
with balls is a paid-for game available
in android market the odds of the game
is to defend your little cannon by
shooting balls out of your vicinity so
you can use two fingers to a maneuver
larger objects out of the way so we want
to bounce them out of the trajectory
from our little cannon here so we want
to bounce them a little bit further and
it looks as though I lost that level so
now I've unlocked 30 balls so here we
have a really large object and our power
meter moves up and down on the side so
we need to move this large drag norma's
object out of the way so this has been
another episode of the android
application weekly and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also add some comments down below
the name of this live wallpaper is
called notification bubbles and there
are two versions available on the
android market a free version which has
limited settings and a donate version
which costs around 99 cents so the cool
thing about this live wallpaper is we
have these icons that we can have its
bubble so these are be our favorite
people so the logging just click on here
and it will show me a call icon any
message icon I can also just deselect
from that by clicking back and I can
also view my unread SMS or email so here
I can launch my gmail and I'll show me
my gmail account thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
