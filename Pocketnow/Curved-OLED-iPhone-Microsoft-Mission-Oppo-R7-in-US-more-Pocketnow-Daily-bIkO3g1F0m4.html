long-term plan for Apple Microsoft CEO
satya nadella lays the company's mission
statement and you can start getting some
carplay and android auto love from
kenwood I'm hi Mary vetta celebrating
Thursday's as I should the drink and you
should too this is parking out daily the
official news that I start with Oppo as
the company has just begun pre-orders
for the Oppo r7 in the United States you
get it for 399 unlocked which is a
fairly decent price for phone in this
range and given the fact that our review
unit has just arrived and we've just
spent a few days with it I'll tell you
this much so far I'm really liking it
I'll let you know more in our review
other official news have microsoft CEO
satya nadella stating the company's
mission statement according to microsoft
the company will empower every person
and every organization around the planet
to achieve more and that's been what
Microsoft's been able to do for years so
far they've been doing a really good job
on during Adela's administration let's
see how that goes and for those of you
interested in either car play or Android
auto on your car without the need to buy
a new car can what has just begun
shipping its two units to retailers and
even though they cost the 900 950
dollars respectively um the price tag is
actually not bad when you think of
everything you can do first of all
they're better than the Pioneer units
because with these you can choose
between either car player Android auto
not one or the other which is great
that's one thing then the second thing
is hey you get a bevy of things from the
fact that you can connect the DVD player
to it to rear cameras and just about
everything you can think of bluetooth
etc etc make sure this trip for full
details if you can't stand the facebook
but you do like the company's messenger
as of today you will not be obligated to
connect depending on which country
you're in its working in the United
States Venezuela and other three
countries which are in the links of the
description and yeah you won't need a
Facebook account anymore just your phone
number to be able to register which is
great it's a great way to be able to use
the services that we actually like and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day it seems that Apple is
working on two very important things
number one bringing OLED displays to the
iphone as it seems that things went
really well with the Apple watch and
second if it seems that they want to use
these curved OLED to be able to bring an
iphone with a curved display now hold
your breath right there it's not going
to happen right now we're not sure if
i'll let this place will happen soon but
curved OLED might not come to the iphone
until twenty eighteen or twenty
seventeen depending on the iphone cycles
really sure what Apple plants to do here
but it does lead me to the question of
the day do you think that Apple should
launch a curved iphone do you think that
that's something that has a benefit in
my case honestly I have not found any
benefits to the curves on the current
galaxy s6 or I don't know Galaxy Note
edge the only phone that I find benefits
to is the LG G flex particularly because
you could sit on it and not break it
that's the only benefit I find but leave
us a comment down below what is your
case friends you know the drill if you
want to get the nose earlier before this
video was filmed make sure you follow us
on Pocket out our comment subscribe to
our YouTube channel as well get follow
me on Twitter Jaime underscore iveta
