know behind the camera we are here at LG
in Barcelona and we are looking at the
other curved phone it's not the G flex 2
it's the LG Magna as you can see from
the profile it's got a 300 millimeter
radius curve it's not that of a big of a
curve like on the G flex 2 but LG says
that it feels good in hand and they are
right you can see it that on that can
really see the curvature but once you
flip it to the side you can see that
there's a slight curve towards the front
and the back as well now in terms of
specs don't expect something huge
something flagship though LG says that
these are flagship RT phones on a budget
price tag the phone has a 5-inch HD
display with a 294 ppi rating and is
powered by 1.3 gigahertz Qualcomm
processor it's running Android 5.0
lollipop out of the box and we're going
to double check that right now go into
software information 501 now it's got
LG's own UI overlaid on top of it so if
you're using the g2 the g3 the G flex or
the G flex 2 you will be familiar with
LG's way of doing the notification shade
as well as the tabbed settings menu for
network sound display you general
business as usual on the front we got
your earpiece we got the sensors we got
the front facing webcam LG logo on the
bottom nothing on the right side as you
can see on the back we got the signature
LG backside of the back mountain buttons
for power volume up volume down we've
got the camera which is an 8 megapixel
unit with LED flash the front phaser is
a 5 megapixel unit nothing else on the
back aside from the speaker grill and
turning it of course to the other side
you will see nothing cuz of course the
buttons are on the back 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack microphone and an
additional microphone on the bottom so
this is a quick look at the LG Magna one
of the four phones LG has announced at
this year's MWC
stay true to pocket now we'll have lots
more including
the two watches did you watch urbane and
the G watch urbane LT if you liked this
video give us a thumbs up thank you very
much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
