mozilla has just released a new version
of firefox mobile beta for there's a lot
of speed and stability improvements and
in this video we're going to talk about
all of them let's get to it all right so
we'll put a link up in the description
on how to get this free browser and
let's go into firefox mobile here and
talk about how that fares overall as a
web browser then we're going to get into
some of the advanced features that makes
firefox mobile unique so of course in
firefox mobile you have tabbed browsing
accessible with a swipe to the right and
this is one of the best features because
it allows for superfast tab management
so we can just bounce between these
websites it handles multiple websites
loaded in tabs very very well so here we
have a page let's just take a look at
how it does with panning and scrolling
so we've gizmodo let's flick down the
page quickly and see if we get any
checkerboard no checkerboard but we do
get a blank spot firefox mobile
oftentimes has trouble keeping up but if
you move a little bit more slowly it's
just fine and it does have multitouch
support so you can pinch to zoom in you
can double tap to reflow a column in and
out looks quite good let's load up a
page and see how long it takes you'll
find that firefox mobile isn't as fast
as the stock froyo browser yet but it's
definitely quite usable and quite fast
overall so here it's loading probably
going to take about 15 seconds maybe a
little bit less and here we have some
flash video and it says click here to
download plugin curious to see what
happens if you actually do that because
firefox mobile does have extensions
looks like nothing's going to happen
fair enough okay so that's tabbed
browsing it works extremely well and
it's more stable than ever here in the
latest version of firefox mobile so
let's talk about some of the other stuff
let's go to another web page let's go to
google when you tap the address bar you
get a lot of cool options starting on
the left it shows you all pages so this
will query recent pages that you've gone
to to the right you have bookmarks so
you don't even have to dial into a
separate screen it's all within this one
interface when you tap on the address
bar very handy if you go to history you
can quickly dial down by your history
and this is super cool you can't see it
because it's shade
but desktop so this will actually look
at the pages that you've recently looked
at on your desktop if you've got firefox
sync setup that's one of the best
features of mozilla firefox mobile is
that you can sync up passwords bookmarks
and history with your desktop computer
and your phone super cool if you are a
Firefox user so instead we're going to
go out of here and talk about some of
the settings and here's on here's google
to get to the settings we swipe to the
left and then we get over here bookmark
icon and down here is setting so let's
dial into that we've got four tabs along
the top about Firefox language here's
the sync settings so if you are using
Firefox Sync on your desktop you plug in
your account name password and sync key
and within seconds you've got all your
data on your phone synchronized at all
times really cool feature if you use
Firefox show images in April JavaScript
to the right we have a download manager
to the right we have a Don so just like
Firefox for the desktop you can get
add-ons and extensions for firefox
mobile now in the past there haven't
been that many add-ons and extensions
many of them didn't work but the library
is growing let me show you so down here
we go to go to page and we can browse
the extensions and take a look at what's
available for Firefox for mobile okay so
here we are this is actually a special
site you can visit this site on your
desktop computer if you want to get a
sense on a big screen for what is out
there so here are a bunch of different
items that you can download let's go to
the categories and drill into a category
and actually install a plug-in so I'm
gonna go to performance
okay so here's a bunch of plugins saw
one pretty cool over here that would be
fun to download called hold for tab so
this will allow you to open up a page in
a new tab I've yet to install it so
you're going to see it live here if you
want to open up a page in a new tab you
tap and hold on a link pretty handy to
have especially with this awesome tabbed
browsing that's actually kind of one of
the annoyances of Firefox for mobile is
that you may accidentally bring open the
tab drawer without meaning to so we'll
go to add to mobile you click that
button says this add-on has not been
updated to this version so I'm going to
click install anyway and see if it works
so it's going to proceed to download you
get a notification up here in the tray
it says hold for tab cannot be installed
because it's not it doesn't work for
this particular version so let's try
again with another plug-in and see if we
can get something else to work we have
URL fixer low quality flash adblock no
script some weird behavior the page is
flicking in and out tabs utility hold
for tab lazy click
let's do this one find in page that
looks really handy to be able to search
for text within a page maybe this one
will work all right zoom in here add to
mobile yeah it probably won't work here
a lot of these haven't been updated for
the fourth beta yet so they're probably
not going to work but let's try this and
see if it works fine if age could not be
installed because it's not available for
this version so you get the point there
are a lot of addons right now they just
need to be updated for the new version
of Firefox so that when they are updated
you'll be able to access them here
through the add-on manager and
presumably there will be a lot of really
creative ways to plug into this mobile
experience through add-ons which will be
great and finally over here on the right
is beta tester tools so you can give
feedback you can learn more about this
beta you can see the particular bill
here it's for point 0 b 2 and force
add-ons compatibility that may actually
be something that we could check and
maybe get the add-on stork let's do that
real quick okay so we're back here and
let's try fastest scroll we've added the
force add-ons to work option here in
firefox mobile maybe this will allow us
to check out this particular plugin here
okay so i'm confirming here that it is
installed here fast to scroll in the
West not in the world so we're loading
gizmodo here we're going to see if we
can flick really quickly down the page
with this new extension add-on for
Mozilla mobile so here we go seems to be
okay it's done loading so let's see if
we can get down to the page really
quickly so I'm going to flick really
fast and it's going to clear up and
we're actually at the bottom of the page
already so the extension works pretty
neat to be able to add extensions to
mozilla firefox mobile beta 4 so again
it will put a link up in the description
on how to get this for your android it's
almost good enough to use at your daily
browser as awesome tab management it
works with firefox sync and of course
you can add extensions to your mobile
browser which is awesome please thumbs
