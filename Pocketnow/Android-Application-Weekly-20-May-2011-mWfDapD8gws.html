now and this is another episode of the
android application weekly in which
reviewed 5 applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it bluetooth gps is
a paper application across one dollar 83
cents on the android market and there's
also a free trial available what this
does is it turns your android device
into a gps receiver which you can use on
your computer so i'll show you that now
okay so here we are on our computer not
have to do is go to tools and get gps on
google earth and go to real time and its
start and it will begin communicating
with the android and find my exact
location and there is who will earn
application you can also use this on
other programs that allow you to use
nmea gps link it is a light and paid for
application the object of the game is to
position these little pearls so that
they aim at various objects and one
another what you have to do is to
connect the beans from one from the
green one all the way back to the green
ones so let's hit your brain pearl and
we've completed this level by bouncing
the beam off of the mirror and onto the
other pearl and back up to the green one
so the game continues on like this
there's other objects to avoid so we
want to avoid the rocks because if we do
hit a rock we lose the love in at once
you hit a rock you can either try again
or go to the little photo is a free
application available on the android
market a cool thing about this is you
can either touch the screen or you can
also use a volume button if your device
doesn't have a dedicated camera button
so let me just take a picture right here
to stay picture this charger and now i
can change it if I like adding multiple
effects so let's try a heavy I'll see
what that looks like that I don't really
like that one try to wipe shine and that
looks pretty good so click on there and
go back and add some other effects and
use tools and rotate and save the
picture if you're planning a vacation to
an amusement park this summer you may
want to consider drive hopper this
application is great for anyone that
wants to know the wait times a various
attraction so I can peek one of these
countries
like I'm just going to go back to the
United States because we have quite a
few themed Bry California it's quite a
lot of theme parks there and let's try
it Disneyland and now we can be the wait
times of Disneyland directly from my
android device so if I want I can avoid
this astral orbiter try one of these
other rides that has a shorter wait time
I can also view shows and hours of
operation webmd is great application for
people that want to find more
information about an acute or chronic
condition so what we can do is go to
conditions here and Camille a top
searches or an A to Z list and just go
back maybe drugs and treatments so we
can top search can also do drugs and gay
pill identifier so we can you first aid
information and local health listing so
this is great if you need to find a
physician or pharmacy or hospital in
your area so just keep current location
family practice and I'll find family
medicine physicians in my area so this
has been another episode of the android
application weekly and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up

floating image and it is pretty on the
android market what it allows you to do
is import your photos and string them on
your live wallpaper directly from a
image hosting website such as Picasso or
Flickr and you can have them float on
your screen and they'll update
periodically to get the down of
information for all these applications
