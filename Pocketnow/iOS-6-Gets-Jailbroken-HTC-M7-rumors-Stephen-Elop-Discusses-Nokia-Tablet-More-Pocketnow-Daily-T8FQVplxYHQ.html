evasion the HTC m7 get some good and bad
rumors and stephen elop discusses a
nokia tablet I'm hi meri behna after a
very long day jailbreaking all my stuff
this is out daily that's right
evasion for Iowa 6 has finally been
released and it provides a full
untethered jailbreak to any iOS 6
compatible product it has slammed
service as many as two hundred and
seventy thousand downloads have happened
in just a couple of hours and to be
honest with you it's actually quite
quick and easy it's even easier than
going to starbucks and paying for an
expensive latte but don't let me boring
with the procedure please hit the links
in that description they'll give you
full details and our tutorials on how to
get a jailbreak on your iOS 6 device now
the t-mobile roadmap for the spring has
just been leaked and get this we get a
blackberry z10 we get a galaxy exhibit
that I'm not actually going to claim as
a victory but we also get a galaxy s3
with an LTE radio and this means either
of two things one well LT is coming to
t-mobile quite soon but the bad thing is
a lot of galaxy s3 shouldn't that be a
galaxy s4 but anyways we'll keep you
posted the dates are March 27 so stay
tuned now let's talk about the HTC m7
we've got some good and bad news when it
comes to rumor mill on the good side the
HTC m7 will apparently not only be a
beautiful device apparently it will also
bring a new camera with new technologies
called ultra pixel but they don't really
specify why and well this is still a
rumor right but on the bad side sadly a
pally verizon will be the last carrier
to get the phone it kind of makes sense
because the droid DNA was pretty much a
verizon exclusive but when you just want
the m7 to be on verizon as well now
let's move over to nokia we already knew
the rumors that no cat was branding
their PureView 808 technology as EOS for
nokia lumia devices and apparently that
would come to future lumia devices
sometime this summer but new rumors have
it that this cos technology will
actually bring the full 41 megapixels in
the sensor for whatever flagship Lumia
devices coming we thought that they were
going to crop it down but hey what do
you wanna pixels is going to be awesome
for those of you that wonder
why you need 41 megapixels on a camera
try doing digital zoom on any current 8
megapixel camera that's the reason why
41 megapixels really work so stay tuned
the summer could be the day and finally
for the interesting news of the day
Stephen Elop was recently interviewed
and they were asking him about noget
tablets even though he wasn't specific
as to whatever plans nokia has on
tablets for obvious reasons he was very
clear on the fact that this is a very
big point of interest for nokia in the
future it just begs to wonder if we will
be getting a tablet being launched at
mwc 2013 since we do have an event we're
just wondering what operating system are
they going to choose hopefully it's not
Windows RT because we know how terrible
that is but that leave it to the
question of the day would you be
interested in a nokia tablet i could
only imagine that beautiful milkha
design coming to a tablet and then just
having to wait minutes and minutes for
Windows RT to load leave us a comment
down below what do you prefer and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
parking out on comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you

we've got a lot more jailbreak iOS 6
