announcement official press invites are
in our hot little hands at the same time
might Samsung faced some unexpected
competition from LG in the first half of
the year
we're finally getting more word on the
red hydrogen one smartphone at the same
time or ISO saying goodbye to a handful
of tech companies and early in the year
but we've got a lot to talk about so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode 2 8 9 recorded January 26th at
noon pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets tablets and wearables when you
were a kid you know red hydrogen sounds
like it would have been the perfect
Russian and the system
I'm fond trailers back now senior editor
at pocketnow.com joined as always by
plucky podcast producer mr. Drew's wrong
on the East Coast how's it going sir
well I mean it's the Russian a bomb
really like when you go all the way back
into the 50 is it's just that threats
that seems looming overhead this is just
nuclear warfare that's right which is
which is the perfect and we have the
perfect solution with the uberman dr.
Manhattan Cooper blue to carry on truth
justice in the American Way as we
deconstruct our superhero myths gonna
say vests apparently with with Holograms
and whatnot right well in mmm in the
Holograms and that's that's that's how
we're gonna that's how we're gonna save
ourselves Tegan and Sara is always gonna
be a great alternative I think we should
stop before we really go down that
rabbit hole welcome back to another
episode of the PocketNow weekly we've
got some really cool stories on tap for
you today some really hot news coming
coming down the pipe and some stuff that
I think you're gonna be very interested
in hearing Jules I just want to say how
was your week
III feel it was great up until yesterday
when I was trying to catch a train and I
was a
Cafe and and I was just hanging out and
you know compared to the you know you
know ten degree days that we've been
having recently it was twenty degrees
yesterday it's yeah it was pretty nice
so and I made the mistake of you know
taking off my little vest jacket thing
apparently a lot of stuff drops out of
it and one of the things that was
carrying in my jacket was my pixel -
yeah that's and and I had to rush to
catch the train and I found myself going
without it fortunately though I was able
to call the cafe and they have the pixel
to for me so as long as I can get there
at some point this weekend during the
morning which will be hard because in
this out-of-the-way place that is really
hard to get to I'm doing it by train or
you know taken a long bus ride so this
will be interesting and they're only
open during the morning in an earlier
like lunch but I mean like you know in
the most hipstery way possible like
we're only open on Wednesdays from 3:00
in the morning till 7:00 a.m. i the i
guess the nice thing is though that
someone did find it and they did the
right thing as good Samaritans and just
holding it for you so so that's kind of
nice though well lady was like you know
I called up the cafe and like she's yeah
yeah I'm sorry I'm gonna I have to bust
this other customer yeah accused of
chocolate croissant and okay so let me
just put there on this stick it now
Jules it was it Ju will yes and here's a
phone number okay that's great I'm gonna
away some cakes now by but again I you
know for for however brusque she might
have been I'm just glad to hear that the
the phone was at least found I know like
my wife had a phone stolen because she
set it down for a second at a Costco and
like someone just yanked it in like it
took her a full minute to kind of
realize like oh I
just set my phone down on these like on
this pile of jeans and now my phone is
completely gone you know what ridiculous
I was actually using my new Eevee which
you know apparently they're promoting me
to say stuff no they're not but like I
was like I has stylus and I was using it
in my friend's car and we were driving
and I dropped it you know like it was in
the car but it took about an hour for us
to find the damn stylus because when the
car was messed up to all oblivion and -
there are just too many nooks and
crannies and we spent oh I'm looking the
same ones because futility is kind of a
the horrible thing about humans trying
to find fine things imposed clean you
know what's not futile the march of
technological progress in the mobile
arena is we're gonna get and I want part
of it yes that's right and you can do so
on Twitter you can join the conversation
as we always have the conversation up
it's on a Twitter hashtag P and weekly
send in your tweets through that and
we'll be able to respond to them and to
mention them by the way if you want to
do it via email with this would have
been the end of the month mailbag
episode but apparently there's there's
not much activity going on keep it up
though we want you to send your emails
in to podcast at pocketnow.com and we
will continue addressing you through
those mediums as well definitely all
right man i you've got the top news
stories for the week why don't we jump
in there because I think we're finally
getting some autumn news according that
week there could be like the most like
the least interesting stories of the
week that is that is factually correct
and yet it is absolutely wrong because
these are the most exciting stories of
the week and most excited about being
that is how believe you for one for the
week of January 22nd 2018 this is all
the news that's fit to podcast
saying the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus On
February 25 likely in Barcelona prior to
MWC 2018 plenty of renders have appeared
to show the device changing little in
design from the s 8 we'll talk about
that in two minutes the LG G seven
meanwhile may not launch at MWC but it
is on schedule
that coming from the company's pr2
Engadget refuting rumors that the
electronics division of vice-president
had ordered the reset of the design
process for the spring time flagship
three iPhones are coming to us in 2018
if supply chain analysts are to be
believed to will start above $1000
apparently and the mid-range device
apparently which will have a an
aluminium body instead of more durable
stainless steel and an LCD instead of a
more vibrant OLED display will cost
somewhere between 700 and $800 for
reference the same model the iPhone 8
equivalent $6.99 this year cinema camera
maker red is teasing his companies well
it's teasing it's company's first phone
the foundered is actually the hydrogen
one pre-orders went up in July just
below $1,200 and we'll have all the big
specs of 2017 including in it Snapdragon
835 that means we're following up on
that with Qualcomm as we speak we also
see a 4,500 million power battery and it
will need to be that bag in order to
supply power to the hologram generators
or the holographic generator excuse me
India will see on a February 1st the new
and improved Moto X for the device which
launched in November is getting a big
upgrade in the big spec line from that
is six gigabytes of RAM and Qualcomm
Snapdragon 636 the first in the lower
tier of the 600 series to feature the
cryo cores which is
modified our make in terms of Google IO
happening that has been announced to me
eight to ten there few puzzles have been
released over the course of years from
Google in terms of its big software
developer conference but apparently this
one's just a little more straightforward
tickets a coming of course we're talking
about title to net neutrality and what
it means for AT&amp;amp;T
apparently it wants to have some
regulatory certainty and is vouching the
foreign internet bill of rights and it
says that it is willing to work with
consumer groups as well as legislators
on this of a bill but in terms of that
it's still up to the FCC on how it wants
to enforce the Internet's and so far the
repeal of title two protections is the
law of the land for now and finally we
have something a little bit funny I mean
it's a little bit of pride for the
company called integral memory it says
from the UK and it has claimed the first
512 gigabyte the card taking the 400
gigabyte card from SanDisk which was
released sometime mid last year and just
rub it in in their faces and just
kicking dust there they were pretty
grandiose in the press release and if I
can pull it out I want to be able to
quote it but I mean we're just getting
up there
I do remember them mentioning that and
the external memory is more important on
mobile now more than ever and yeah it's
just they're just having fun with it
well again it's don't you think it's so
funny when we we were starting to get
into 128 gigabyte cards and the
theoretical maximum was something like
multiple terabytes of storage terabytes
that's the big like thing that expanded
but like we'll never see that in a micro
SD and now like we're actually
a quarter of the way there which is
crazy pretty much yeah so Swedes and
lose a laptops worth of story it's I
mean yeah well depends because well was
a the four hundred gigabyte card was two
hundred fifty bucks
so we don't know where this will launch
just yet it's gonna be out next month
here's the quote here europe-wide memory
specialist integral memory plc has
beaten all competitors and entered aggro
need for increased capacity on mobile
devices so loud and proud just just go
at it definitely we already gotta have a
few tweets coming in here from from the
pn weekly hashtag from Renate Laporte
even though phones have software locks
to prevent people from using a stolen
phone at least in europe the market for
robbed phones for om parts is huge so
you were very lucky indeed
Jules you were very lucky indeed indeed
indeed
alright where's the deed I would like to
have that maybe it's the warranty for
the pixel - indeed is it's a word
extended warranty the the Google device
pretended warranty deed is that what you
think indeed stands yeah indeed they're
like it's a combined word but like it
was a cup it was the conjugation I don't
think you know so you know 512 gigabytes
of storage that sounds fun we should
probably try and unpack some of this 18t
stuff with their internet Bill of Rights
we want to pack that instead that's 9 oh
I will I want to kind of build back to
the s now what ability that's gonna be
the more fun conversation so let's save
that for the more fun part of his
podcast I mean they're just asking for
legislation and between now and then
they get to jockey their position around
and hopefully that's is going to be the
case where you know consumer groups
might be able to eke out something and
Senators and Representatives are
actually going to listen to the other
side and we've already seen that
in terms of bills overturning the repeal
of the of the FCC's decision to repeal
threat ability protections that has been
said you know it's been a glowing kind
of a little bell for those Democratic
senators who are aching for them in in
any form here in Congress but face
challenges from it's a Senate bill so
they're gonna face challenges from the
house as well as don't I think I think
one of the reasons why some of us are so
cynical about this move from the AT&amp;amp;T
CEO is suddenly asking for rules to kind
of be locked into place now with an FCC
that has already demonstrated that it
has no interest in being a regulatory
agency for those types of companies or
working in a way that might actually
regulate those kinds of companies so it
feels a little disingenuous like well
now that we've got an FCC Chairman who's
all about you know gutting net
neutrality now's the right time to make
sure that the Senate and the Congress
are getting on top of those rules and
sort of cementing them in stone making
them harder to alter before the 2018
midterms where historically the party in
power has difficulty holding on to to
the house in the Senate well I mean this
I would I would assume that this would
be a years long process given the spirit
of the internet and the interest
inherent in that so this is not really I
don't see this as a issue of you know
trying to get things in before the Bell
as much as it is Ma Bell trying to you
know ring the bell and something else
and I think I think we've used Bell too
many times I don't know
I'll be curious to see how this flies in
the face of initiatives at the state and
local level you know where several
states are already trying to enact their
own variance I think Pennsylvania
already got something on the books that
that they're trying to enact basic
consumer protections that are aligned
with a net neutrality policy it could be
really interesting something now people
want immediacy especially after that
vote because the
feel so fresh and it feels so so much
more painful especially as you go deeper
into the threads on you know reddit well
well again I mean that's not to say that
there isn't like like that libertarian
subculture on reddit which is very much
against net neutrality but I think one
of the things that's getting a little
obnoxious in all political debates we
could be talking about net neutrality we
could be talking about healthcare for
example we could be talking about tax
reform where every presidential
administration comes in and I be from
the George W Bush days to now it's
whatever presidents in power now we just
have sort of a flip-flop with one party
trying to you know govern rule or write
legislation all on their own which means
every four years we get a pendulum swing
in the exact opposite direction where we
never really build towards really fixing
these problems we just get this like
flip flop back and forth you know more
stability in any given market is gonna
be better for that market but this is
also where I feel that fight for net
neutrality is so precious because it
took us over a decade to get to some
basic consumer protection handled by a
woefully underfunded and understaffed a
regulatory agency just pulling pulling
the rug out from under that and then
going back to something that really
wasn't working for most consumers before
then doesn't sound like the right well
yeah yeah and to that yeah it's all it's
always fun to see with these a political
up swings and down swings that when you
realize that your neighbor might be
voting the opposite way that you are
you're still neighbors and you still
have to live with that unless you know
you're able to so how magically just
move away and that's not easy at all so
live with rules right rules well and
with that sir cities like I don't I
don't feel like we necessarily exist
right now in a political climate where a
majority of the people who have been
elected in the office have any desire to
actually govern or lead or or work to
try and arrange an equitable outcome you
know what I mean like that's that's
we're not sort of in politics we're just
sort of an obscure
honest policy right now which isn't
necessarily the best look for the United
States but let's move on to something
that's way more interesting we've
already been getting a number of tweets
about the red hydrogen one finally have
some real data on that thing some some
real specs some something to actually
the meat release yeah so just more into
the numbers the a 35 X again we're
trying to suss that out forty five
hundred hundred million power battery
dual SIM slots headphone jacks quad HD
display for 2d viewing and better than
3d images in four V holographic mode
lots of window jim ago and are there
carrier support is unprecedented
unprecedented i'm not sure if they'll
get carriers but it just seems like Jim
Jannard is really hyped up and he has
right to be so darts off another
discussion where I feel we left off 2017
kind of like those of us in the tech
space not necessarily reflected by
general consumers but those of us in the
tech space getting more excited about
the prospect of more specialist phones
the note making a tremendous return to
the market the V 34 content creation the
BlackBerry key one as a Productivity as
another example of a different type of
productivity or even down to the razor
phone you know some stumbling there with
razors marketing on this is not a gaming
phone it's a phone for gamers what who
like to play games but uh that that that
type of approach to not trying to appeal
to a general consumer demographic you
know red has I don't think they have any
illusions or any pretense that they're
going up against the iPhone right the
they don't seem to be interested in the
slightest about going up against the
Galaxy S nine this is a completely
different conversation on mobility and
productivity and being a compliment to
someone's work flow in a very
specific way well it's only one form of
productivity and that's if you're
working in high-grade media that's
Wheatley and I mean we've seen the
drawings the patents and all that none
of that has been fleshed out in what
Denard just said in his little you know
happy pants post but there's just I mean
that's that's only one form of
productivity that will be supported it's
been the most obvious choice when it
comes to the smartphone industry we've
seen how smartphone cameras have turned
around and produced great films and and
you know Shawna and iPhone and all that
kind of branding and marketing around
that and it seems like now it's just
hyper pegging the smartphone camera
neish into this one isn't that one of
the things that they're kind of that
they might potentially be trying to
address is we have another manufacturer
that seems interested not necessarily
positioning the entire aesthetic or the
idea of the phone on this idea but they
seem interested in rejoining the
conversation on modular design and if
you've ever worked with a red camera
those things are just a scattering of
transformer parts that you cobbled
together exactly the rig that you're
trying to achieve do we think that that
might be another vote of confidence
in a notion of trying to find ways of
tailor fitting because I was very
specific in the words that I chose you
know one specific example of
productivity that red is looking to be a
companion device to a very particular
kind of lifestyle and now with a more
modular design or the potential for a
more modular design does that mean that
we might be able to rejoin a
conversation even for consumers that
your phone is not the perfect phone for
you here are companies that can help you
make the perfect phone for you this
would have been a great ground floor
idea this would have been great ten
years ago I don't see it it would have
been but I was like the tech 10 years
ago sucked for this I mean you have that
little you know neato hinge
that the t-mobile g1 had right I mean we
were just getting out of what like 600
megahertz
xscale ARM processors like firewire that
we would have also been able to create
sophisticated enough software for mobile
devices to have like built-in driver
support for different pieces of hardware
is that's fair that's fair but again
there should have been something that
should have been this huge bulky mess
that would have been impressive at CES
28 2008 and then this would have built
into a more refined thing the smartphone
craze died down from all the trade shows
that you know we participate in so well
that's a part of it too is like not the
expectation that the things gonna
outsell the iPhone I think I think the
victory of Apple and Samsung right now
is being very good or I mean from being
good enough to very good in just about
everything they do but they're not
necessarily tailor fit to the individual
user we have a couple tweets here using
the p-n weekly hash tag from Andrew sis
lack I would love to have a red phone
for the camera and add-on capabilities
but don't want to pay the price tag
associated with the rnt in production of
the holographic display
I'm sorry Andrew those kind of go hand
in hand man you know like I want amazing
technology but I don't want to pay for
it that if this is I mean yeah oh go
ahead Jules no no I was just only going
to say what Apple CEO Tim Cook said
which is it's a value price in that you
get inside and that innovation costs
what innovation costs yeah I was gonna
say if this is an idea that takes off
you know if this is something that
general consumers start to find
desirable then probably around the
five-year mark after red launch is it
then you'll you'll see it showing up in
less expensive consumer devices but you
know it's just like any other industry
if you want to be at the bleeding edge
there's there's a cost associated with
being on the bleeding edge and this is
also one of the things that gets a
little frustrating for me personally in
talking about tech is some new exciting
idea come out and then it'll get sort of
hammered like oh it's too expensive or
oh it's not mature enough or oh it's not
working right
and and we never really see the
follow-up to that because it sort of
died a million echo-chamber
cranky comment deaths on the internet
and this is why we get stuck in a
holding pattern or why text starts to
feel a little bit stale from Peter hatin
using a hashtag P and weekly whilst I
love the idea of niche phones like razor
and red do you think they will really
work as a major investment especially if
they are not good with support and
updates I feel to be truly modular we
need a clear commitment to software to
make it worthwhile mmm software is a
part it is like it's a component to it
and I think people have a hard time of
being able to visualize that as a part
of it that you can just click on and off
or whatever because in addition well if
you're talking about software in terms
of features like there are so many
features that you can add on and take
off in terms of the base software in
terms of OS that's that's harder to
define for most people and I guess the
company could get away I could not a cog
NIH's that's that's a that's something
that needs to be prioritized oh I I
wonder though if the conversation is
properly targeted at the right
demographic what what those concerns
will actually what concerns will
actually materialize if the design of a
red phone is to somehow try and pivot
mass-market I mean we can we they didn't
quite make the news roundup this week
but look at a company like oneplus who
is yet again having problems with the
credit card theft the the hack on their
their system and that there's also
anecdotal evidence to support that there
might be another service on that phone
that's trafficking user data to a cloud
account in China again they are trying
to pivot to being a general consumer
brand out of just being an Android
enthusiast brand that's a really tough
pivot now with red or with Razer
focusing so specifically on very small
demographics it means those products are
going to be more expensive
you know when you are D and you machine
and you build these devices you can't
exercise the same sort of market forces
to bring costs and lower but if they're
demographic cares about the right
companion device for a red camera and a
red phone is the right companion device
to that then I think the discussion on
software support takes on a very
different look than what consumers are
apt to expect you know just for like
Andrew orient updates or something like
that yeah yeah well one thing that we
can expect from Apple is reliable and
ongoing software updates and one of
three things that we can expect this
year is an iPhone that is kind of like
an iPhone eight might be in another
world it could be an iPhone nine we'd
call it instead of like an eye you know
so we have this like regular iPhone we
have like the sequels to the X and
there's gonna be a plus version too and
we can assume that those costs
mmm thousand dollars plus here with the
mid-range err I'm wondering what the
heck this is good because this is KGI
this is kji securities Apple analyst min
cheek whoa a lot of people want him as a
reliable source as a reliable or teller
of these things and yeah reality is
track record it is more like you know 60
70 % which is better than you know it's
yeah it's better than just guessing yeah
but you know I mentioned earlier that in
we saw the iPhone 8 at $700 starting
price is Apple really going like this
this innovation is this taking scaling
down parts or innovative designs or
whatever the heck is that innovation in
itself worth paying for
well hearing that you know given you
know the scale you know price
competitiveness is not price
competitiveness I think if you're in the
iOS ecosystem you you aren't comparative
shopping iPhone to Android I think they
have a tremendously entrenched user base
that is
only gonna really be interested in price
comparing iPhone to iPhone that's also
why I think the iPhone 10 is doing as
poorly as it is right now I don't think
the thousand dollar price tag is what's
holding it back more that there are
eight iPhones that people can currently
shop which offer very granular
differences between the various lines of
iPhone and I think that's actually
taking a bigger chunk out of the iPhone
10 market share than any potential
competition from outside of the Apple
ecosystem and so interesting - I keep
back on the story we've been seeing a
number of a number of editorials and
vlogs and and news posts about the death
of the iPhone 10 and really to me I
think this is just gonna be can Apple
get back on top of a branding exercise
that makes sense you know the iPhone 10
might end up just being an Apple watch
edition right you know a singular
one-off phone that was produced they'll
claim it was a singular one iPhone that
was produced for the 10th anniversary of
the iPhone and moving forward this is
the tech that we're really going to be
focused on for our you know like our
general consumer releases and that'll
help clean up the lines on you know
having an iPhone se 6s 7 8 and 10 all at
the same time but that still it's just a
branding exercise like I do not
understand
I kind of went off I did the Jason T
Lewis he does painfully honest tech I
did his podcast and I kind of went off
on I'm getting real tired of people who
cared that much about what the name of
the phone is you know like well the
iPhone 8 is not really an iPhone 8 it's
really an iPhone 7s like it doesn't
matter it really doesn't matter the way
the apples lines are going right now
they need a reset the the number letter
combination that they've fell apart when
the iPhone 6s design carried over into
the iPhone 7 their entire tech strategy
this is the thing about Apple is because
you know they are the largest company in
the world and thus they have the most
freedom of narrative here they get to
create their own reality definitely so
you know what is a computer hello
if you haven't you mad though you don't
see the ad for that iPad pro and if you
want to talk about just you know if they
want to be able to we you know lead the
market in that way I mean there's I
still think that there is going to be up
to a point where people are just like
alright really this is this is where
we're going here and there and I reached
it yet but there has to be that point
and I think Apple at this point is on a
rate to surpass to surpass the
acceptable limit of that I'll be curious
to see where the limit might be I think
some people have reached the limit and
you'll see a lot of people I was on set
with um one of the cameramen on Newegg
now still has an iPhone 5
not even an iPhone 5s like proof he
loves his phone that is his phone he
might consider swapping over to an
iPhone se if and when that phone
completely is non-functional but he has
no designs anytime like it does
everything it he needs to get done and I
think Apple this is this is why the
Apple slow down throttling story was
such a bad look for Apple was there are
a lot of people that hold on to their
iPhones for a really long time and
haven't been inspired by newer products
that apples been putting out we have a
couple tweets here on the iPhone this is
from Andrey thick klore swift PN weakly
holding out for iPhone se to the iPhone
10 is an overreach in pricing I you know
again the the market will will bear
whatever the market will bear but I am
totally with you I would love to see the
iPhone se continue on as as their entry
level experiment you know generational
chipset keep the iPhone 5 form factor
and just keep refreshing the guts and
you'll have your world phone entry-level
solution emerging LTE market solution
that would make me so happy I like that
be great to have a network for us I mean
in terms of the other markets the iPhone
the current existing iPhone se is pretty
much the only option they have and that
is affordable and that is from Apple so
yeah that it's that it's a great phone I
mean it's still I think one of the best
implementations of sard where software
software and hardware synergy I said
Lord where it's so sore sword where I
just tom brokaw had the heck out of that
and this is from Peter hatin IP and
weekly I agree 100% with your point on
the iPhone 10 what they really need to
do is streamline and get back to the
consistent obvious purchasing decision
for those who want a new iPhone each
year I think if you simplify the lines
and and you're you're more readily
willing to ax the older version or make
it you know sort of the under the radar
free on contract solution for someone
who wants to shop an iPhone but you're
not putting it up front and center just
getting back to a simple iPhone landing
page on Apple comm I think would do
would be a huge benefit for Apple in
terms of marketing right now I think
what Apple fails to realize is that's
the once a product goes a year out it's
I mean the third-party eBay suelto all
those markets can have their way doesn't
really matter that you have that 100
dollar discount it opens up the room to
more depreciation and whatnot so totally
dies that's a great point and they so
they don't have to do that anymore they
don't and then with the rumors about the
iPhone 10 going away without that
discount without without that pear egg
think they would have more room more
authority in terms of being able to say
that this iPhone is this price period so
yeah I kind of feel like Apple and
Google are sort of guilty of this market
over Curt overcorrection overreaction
you know there was a story that came out
one of the the former Google engineer
talking about just you know the culture
at Google right now isn't isn't super
great but you you know it's said his
account reads like sour grapes but you
you look at some of their more recent
business decisions their problems with
messaging platforms what they're trying
to do in terms of building their own
hardware but then also having
difficulties and keeping features on
things like the Google home many and
there's a lot of it feels like there's
some truth in what this engineer was
talking about that Google just seems to
be
acting to whatever's popular as opposed
to trying to have a coordinated vision
for the entire health of the company to
lead the discussion in the markets that
they're in are you talking about the
iPhone yeah exactly
Apple with the iPhone feels very similar
right now what is the market leaning
towards we're gonna be late to the
market with the solution we're still
gonna claim that we're somehow driving
the innovation are driving the
discussion but we've all sort of arrived
at the same idea and the same outcome
for what a smartphone should resemble in
2017 and that's a tough place for a
company that is also so successful at
creating a lifestyle image behind their
their their brand it it you need to have
some kind of excitement or some kind of
buzz or some kind of exclusivity to
drive the desirability of your product
and if people think well this phone is
gonna go away in a year you won't be
able to buy it in something new will
come and that's exciting too but you go
back and you're like well I can go all
the way back to the iPhone se which is a
refresh of the iPhone 5s and Apple's
stable right now that doesn't make I
phones feel exclusive or desirable well
as Pontiacs slogan back in like the
early 90s we drive excitement I was
gonna say it was it yahoo la la in any
case define aren't the word schedule for
me
I think schedule gauge or yes speaking
of authority and narrative and this
destiny okay because I think you're
you're leading me towards wanting to
talk about LG as oh yeah but but what if
you Webster's dictionary schedule is a
plan for carrying out a process or
procedure giving lists of an intended
events and times so that's how its
schedule is plant intentions okay we the
LG has not made their plans nor their
intentions about the g7 exactly if
public
up until this point and that's where
I'll give LG most of I guess the credit
here in terms of saying in terms of the
reports that it's electro ever did is I
can't I can't think of his name but use
it alright let's do a reset of the g7
design process and going against
traditions here alright so you know a
mint from the company to engage in full
some stories have reported that LG's
mobile division is delaying the release
of the g7 in order to reevaluate its
performance and design this is an
accurate watch of the g6 is so the
successor are on schedule
LG intends to focus on creating products
that will result in meaningful results
rather than launching new products on a
schedule based solely on industry
expectations and traditions the release
date for g7 is currently under
consideration and will be announced when
the time is right
so scheduled release date under
consideration consideration which means
that there's a part of the schedule that
is indeterminate and therefore on the
schedule is kind of but also the fact
that you know industry expectations on
when to like I can get that but
traditions for the past at the g6 and g5
were launched at MWC and I pointed out
that the g4 was launched in late April
the g3 in late May and the GT was all
the way back in August so it doesn't
really like line up with the Galaxy S
releases - so - that they do have a
point in terms of hey we're trying to
match the competition here and we're
trying to do this and that and I while I
do believe that having the headspace the
the room to navigate and to express
themselves is is important in terms of
marketing
they've used that very poorly they've
been throwing money in the marketing
machine and have come up with basically
nothing and they've tried to defray
those costs year after year after year
so what they want to do is design their
marketing better and reevaluate the
performance of though that definitely
sounds like damage control on just them
trying to address the market to say
there will be another smartphone from LG
I don't think that this really
dissuades me from some of the the
hypotheses that we had been working with
before that this could be a later
release this could be some merging
between the V and G series brands they
could be coming up with a whole new name
you know so when they say the release
date for g7 is currently under
consideration it doesn't necessarily
mean we're getting a g7 it could mean
we're getting the icon or the iconic or
whatever buzzword e name that they
decide to try and real able and rebrand
with if that's the path that they head
down it just sounds like it could be
that's what LG has told that yeah but
what LG has told us in prior years is
that they play their cards pretty with
it with an open hand and a really pre
announced to us that this is the way
things are going to be that this is the
name of the device and that this will
have certain features and that's pretty
much it
so so you're absolutely correct that
that's what they've done in the past and
everything we've seen might might mean
again this is complete speculation and
we have no official word from any of our
LG contacts on on what's happening here
but this to me also means that they
could be re-evaluating just even how
they announce and and and name their
products I do not think it's it's likely
that we're going to see the same GV
launch that we've seen in years past I
think we're probably gonna see some
slightly more coordinated effort at
getting LG streamlined and offering a
big a big little smart phone release
that's closer to what we would get from
a galaxy s 9 and s 9
hmm because they they went a little bit
crazy with the diminutive stuff the q6
and the ldg six plus you know they've
played around with that successful at
the entry in the mid range I mean you
see the the LG what is it the LG stylo
quite a bit out in real life yeah does
get a lot of spread so III could I can
totally appreciate where it was the same
problem I think like Microsoft and Nokia
had what was the most success successful
selling phone oh is the Lumia 510 of
devices in the five six and seven
hundred series we need a new flagship
now we'll wait three years on that so
how do you see all these like LG KS + LG
Q's and these various like sort of
permutations of the entry and mid-level
like that makes sense to me from a
corporate standpoint it bugs the crap
out of me as a consumer because I would
like to see them streamline this process
I think most companies in this space
especially one struggling with branding
would do better to streamline and focus
on each tier with a very specific
product to address that tier when it
comes to the flagship in the high-end
because they've just been getting
roasted in the market lately I
I really do hope that what we see is
combining their top end products into
one line of phones and use that to come
right out swinging against the next gen
of iPhones now from our last story now
is the right time to try and take a stab
at Apple's market with Apple also
potentially going through some similar
kind of market correction for the number
of iPhones that they carry well didn't L
do you try that with its x-series I mean
they had like the dual camera version
like they had like little niche things
that they targeted with each device and
what ended up happening was that very
few or none of the carrier's the prepaid
carriers wanted that and just said hey
give me some of your regular their stuff
or at least the closest to the regular
stuff as you can offer us as possible so
well and and I think that's we're gonna
see more of that who was the the
who is the MVNO was it virgin that they
went iPhone only Virgin Mobile yeah so I
mean that makes sense to me they don't
want to stock a whole bunch of parts
especially if they've got devices which
are underperforming or they can't sell
or they can't move off store shelves I I
think for a lot of manufacturers who
aren't Samsung and Apple getting after
direct sales unlock sales and improving
your own brand reputation on the ground
floor is gonna be key over the next
couple years if we're gonna keep
pretending that smartphones are a
competitive and dynamic market space I
you know if you can't build a
relationship directly no carriers gonna
extend a ton of support and a ton of
marketing and a ton of ad dollars to
help your brand up when they don't have
to do that to sell an iPhone yeah well I
mean it's iPhone against LG and we're
talking about fifth largest brand versus
largest brand by far is LG what have you
looked up the stats recently I I didn't
even think LG was in top five worldwide
anymore mmm cuz because I always keep
thinking about the US stats and they
they're always all I think I think they
are top five in the US and they might
even be third place in the u.s. right
now yeah
but worldwide there they're there
they're getting just eaten alive by
Chinese manufacturers yeah its Huawei
Oppo and vivo that are third fourth of
that's right vivo vivo is is taken that
fifth place spot which again that's a
terrible look for a company that that
puts out hardware as nice as as LG yeah
yeah well I mean we've been dancing
around the number two position here so
you want to get into that well we should
we should move right on up the food
chain Galaxy S nine invites in our hands
they're talking about the new phone the
camera reimagined what what are your
expectations do you think we're gonna
see something phenomenally different
than the s8 variable aperture is going
to be on a wider scale if rumors are to
be believed so
that's that's a good thing that's what
you been focused on like very you know
paper-thin focus ranges before and now
we're like do you know control that bad
and you know just the lie hopefully the
ISIL cell is gonna be largely it's gonna
have enough sensing capacity to put in
as much light into those deep trench
isolation great things now you're just
throwing around buzzwords yeah no that's
that's a it was basically the buzzwords
that we got from the site it's a dual
pixel super PD autofocus three stickers
fr-s high-speed video 484 8-0 FPS Full
HD and all this stuff here and what it
you know you you want to be able to
produce results you want to be on the
best light or as much light as possible
to work with within a reasonable size
because apparently I'm not sure it's
like the like the slim part because
they've been doing weird things with
their ISO cell sensor branding I really
think they're gonna move down in sensor
size I really think that they're
probably looking at at getting closer to
to that one third of an inch sensor size
think so well I mean you were talking
about the this slim size that that's the
recent patent that they put out on the
the two newest ISO cell camera sensors
very good makes great camera sensors I'm
even going back to my my interchangeable
lens cameras samsung has tremendous
expertise there but with the variable
aperture you have to have a lot of glass
to make sure you've got the highest
quality glass the sensor occupies the
highest quality glass in the center you
kind of have to like waste lens in a way
is why people get cranky about like
moving back to four by three the
truthfully the best rectangular shape
for a circular lens would be a square
you know like very much if you wanted to
occupy the absolute best part of a lens
and not have like fringing and operation
as you creep out to the corners
that's what that that's it you know you
have flat glass in everything so when
when we look at making the mechanism to
control the aperture and also making
sure that we've got the best possible
lens clarity in the center of the lens
for a sensor it would make sense to me
that they would be moving down in sensor
size to minimize the physical impact of
building a dual sensor device into the
back of their phone III really think
it's likely that we're gonna see them
taking a step towards better software
processing computational photography
tools while then giving us some some
some hardware features like that
variable aperture that that to me that's
that's my hypothesis that's what I think
we're gonna soft wear side of things and
this is from venture beats Evan blast
here so apparently he was able to
confirm that
super slo-mo video captured which is the
four 480 fps at 720p capture will
trigger it will actually trigger from
any rapid movement detected in frame
gonna create a separate files that kind
of you know even as you're recording in
4k 60fps like is that going to be a
separate thing how many has the ISP
gonna work on that
and it'll be interesting to see if we
can get like subset video streams going
on there that could be kind of cool and
and also whether or not we see Samsung
follow Apple on taking the taking the
transition over to HEV C because if
we're working with insane frame rates or
also like you know 4k at 60 frames per
second and you don't want your phone to
melt down in your hands processing and
storing that that that quantity of video
data one of the best ways to help
minimize the impact on storage is also
just save less file you use a better
type of compression to archive your your
video so there's gonna be this part of a
v1 that's the thing right well maybe you
know like again
been seeing Google was reticent to jump
on board when the world's third largest
smartphone manufacturer switched over to
HEV see
but when qua way and Apple were in the
space suddenly HEV C works on YouTube
gasp shocked the other thing that I
think could be really interesting is
seeing Samsung following always
footsteps for computational photography
by utilizing the AI core that's going to
be built into the 845 in the same way
that Huawei has their NPU that image
recognition works surprisingly well I
don't know exactly what it's doing in
terms of altering the settings on a
camera and the post-processing on your
photos but when you point the huawei
mate 10 pro at an object it's really
good at identifying what that object is
if anyone can can push that into a more
consumer friendly space is a company
like Samsung and if they have the
hardware from welcome to do it and doing
do it in a meaningful fashion then that
could also be a really exciting aspect
for a photography I'm thinking it'll
depend on where the surface for that is
based in because if they wanted you know
go go all pick speed and stuff like in
though I mean it's great that they're
able to do deep app integration but I'm
wondering if any kind of you know if
there's any like architectural problems
that may come into that if they do have
to roll at it that's why I'm I'm
actually kind of positive on this turn
I'm uh I'm wrapping up our Galaxy s8
after the buzz hour a little late on
that one but you have Bixby in the
camera app on the essay and it's useless
I mean it's there I can find no reason
to point a camera at something have it
scan what that thing might be and then
try and search the internet for similar
looking image like it's so cumbersome so
slow and it doesn't provide me any
specific benefit kua way solution with a
dedicated piece of machinery for on
device image recognition does give me a
benefit in the auto mode post-processing
and image acquisition like it
streamlines what you might want to do to
make something look
based on millions of other images that
Huawei has scanned so if Bixby wants to
take an evolutionary step up I think the
best way they could do it is emulating
what Huawei and Leica have done with
their MPU well III think I think I think
you're right on that aspect in terms of
being able to wrap this around the whole
device itself what else
I mean Bixby is gonna get a bigger push
overall and I mean we saw introduced
last year it's gonna be bigger this year
and the fingerprint sensor is moving to
below the cameras so where it always
should have been
you know in a comparator print sensor
was a good idea then I think we'd see
Samsung keep moving with it but I think
it's pretty clear the s8 and the note
eight fingerprint sensors were just a
reaction to other tech not being ready
it may be like a 0.5% increase in this
screen to body ratio I don't know you
know don't don't you think from the from
the photos that have come out like
especially digging through the looks
super much like the sa just engine and
like always like detects the holy blurry
stuff you know renders like it still
doesn't there's no scale to it and
there's no real gonna say that is
especially with the way that renders are
produced the lines on the front face of
the s8 look a little bit more especially
the side bezels look a little bit more
like a V 30 so that's also why I'm
taking some of these designs with the
grain of a huge grain of salt because
it's it's tough to get a handle on what
a device like that's gonna resemble and
so you can really physically hold it in
your hand but III think there's a huge
benefit it could also okay from s7 to sa
we got this major change in display form
factor and that's what I think really
made the s8 feel like something really
fresh over the s7 but the actual
operation of the phone evolutionarily
not too big a departure from what we
liked about the s7 and the s7 edge I
think the s9 is gonna feel very similar
to the s8 but
gonna have a lot of these little
refinements moving the fingerprint
sensor to a more organic position
dual-camera sensor on the larger s9 but
really what I hope Samsung can get a
grip on and this is actually echoed
Peter hatin using the PN weekly hashtag
I really think they want to push AI
especially with VIX be around there is a
huge opportunity right now Google
Assistant Google home it's not Google
isn't winning there's competition in the
space and Bixby has been updated to do
some really cool things with like
connected home IOT and macros but
they're slow the si+ is really slow when
you want to do something like you say
hey Bixby open up Instagram and post a
photo and it chews up that request for a
while before it spits out a result I
mean in comparison comparison to me just
opening Instagram myself and posting a
photo vics be is a is is a bridge too
far for waiting for my phone to
recognize that so for the future of AI
making more of this on device making
more of it local actually brings in my
opinion could bring a security benefit
too so less of your queries are being
sent up to a server to be analyzed for
your voice print less of your data is
actually migrating off the device more
of this content being recognized and
acted upon on the device could be a
really exciting step forward for
security that to me could be enough of a
benefit over the SA say that the s 9
could be a fresh new phone I mean if
it's on the device you like you would
more likely have to actually obtain the
device itself in order to get it so yeah
that's that tolling your your usage your
phone learning about your usage isn't
something that happens on some sort of
cloud server basis like some of the
issues oneplus is facing and collecting
user data for these like improvement
programs and then shipping it off into
some Chinese cloud account your device
should learn about you in the context of
staying with you and if that data stays
localized that to me is is a big thumbs
up that's me is is worth paying
attention to what we're doing in machine
learning right now
at the very least if it has to be sent
encrypted properly you know just like
well I mean obviously but we also know
that so a number of companies have
fallen down on that vision improperly
protecting our our data so that's not a
good yeah all right I feel like charting
this podcast down but I mean PocketNow
down right that's the trend right yeah
that's I mean PocketNow is closing
goodbye
like dark city you know the others like
shut it down shut it all down
the lights fade out and it's closing
time you hear supersonic wail on what no
that's not that's wholly wrong song it's
not the totally but yeah you're the
totally wrong song know what we're
talking about some interesting stories
over the last week from companies that
are leaving the text face tech companies
that are shutting down early in 2018 I
wanna start this off this one kind of
took me by surprise cuz I thought in my
brain it had already shut down I was
surprised to learn right and you mean to
beam was this is a me beam this was a
well the it was it was turned into an
operation was transformed with that was
issued by Casey nice dad started it in
2016 it was an app where you could it
was social video sharing and the way
that vine once wasn't in that you had to
hold your phone close to you your your
like your chest basically walk the
proximity sensor and then you'd you know
you'd be in the moments and you be like
capturing all this stuff without having
to think about what to shoot and whatnot
so there's a tease and yeah and between
that and it's somehow it got acquired by
CNN somehow Casey night's that wasn't
well tonight he came over to them and
with his co-founder for the app
this worked on trying to get in into a
daily news show a four-day week kind of
thing going on
based on crowdsourcing based on panels
they had they had people just reacting
to news stories and or people who were
involved in it
like involved in the local news stories
who were just you know living through it
they're shooting video and they're you
know telling how they feel and none of
it really got anywhere well I mean so
much so I I did not know that it still
existed I thought it had already folded
yeah I mean it was it it's there it was
transported from its Russian olkhon
except but and it was starting to get
there but it CN n lost money on the deal
it was a twenty five million dollar deal
apparently and and the digital
operations were in a budget hole of like
20 million for the year as well so that
you know just having to write down that
will just make sense gonna sting you
know yeah but in terms of that's Casey
himself has said that he wasn't doing
anything for CNN that was turning up
anything of value and he just felt he
you know was it was just a failure on
his part but yeah it's not so
interesting in the thought of the how
they structured it because they thought
they they pulled something that was sort
of a wacky attempt at a new social video
service you know this aesthetic of like
you hold the phone to your chest to
record video so that you're still in the
moment kind of a thing is is very
esoteric idea behind interacting with
with media and they tried to tarnish it
with normal has yeah especially when
case like you you know this was back
when Casey was still Casey and you know
it was like okay
be still Casey I think he's still doing
fine oh yeah it quickly but you know
when you went Kate with when the Casey
the you know was more imbued into the
app and it was no noise
yeah that's true yeah it was like it
when he himself was already you know
doing these things doing you know having
a big routine on his daily vlogs but I
think what sucked all the wind out of
the sails is that CNN's attempt at this
just felt like we want to buy Casey nice
that's sort of a tacit endorsement of a
news platform neither does he have any
interest in in what this service was
trying to accomplish while every single
like local news agency now has their own
news story sharing app you know like NBC
LA you can record video and use their
app to send them a hot tip on a new
story or something like or just email
the video for something like that yeah
yeah this was supposed to turn CNN into
the the you know the hip new destination
for kids to get their news from the
cable news network by the way what's
cable I have this box over here that so
yes from Renato Laporte using PN weekly
the PN weekly hash tag can't really
understand the interest of CNN in the
app though traditional media is trying
too hard to reinvent themselves and it
never works and he's got a funny chip of
a newscaster sort of just like slinking
from the frame
yeah the BBC had their problems with
automated cameras whoo I can't wait till
they get drones terror in the streets
[Laughter]
Sheldon's gonna be really happy to see
those drones episode put our next story
up there I think you were doing it just
to hurt my feelings
and rub salt in wounds because I was
actually thinking of going back to
revisit my pebble but we are getting
word on the official support for pebble
ending in June and last it is unofficial
it is official it's going to become
unofficial that's right officially
unofficial with official support and
developers trying to find backend ways
around pebbles server-side functions but
yeah it looks like my beloved SmartWatch
the best SmartWatch ever made is is
finally going to be dying the last death
of the middle
in papercut deaths that it's been dying
over the last two years you know all the
services all the apps all the things
that rely on the Internet are gonna be
gone and yeah that's it's just the
Fitbit not Fitbit but pebble OS the base
stuff is gonna still be there so in
terms of the best SmartWatch ever made
going over to may be the ugliest
SmartWatch ever made will you take up
its offer for $50 off the ioniq no not
not at all that no hope no chance I am
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be cutting a
little mini review I might even just
post it on Twitter I might not even like
post it up on YouTube I'm cutting a mini
review of the honor band 3 and it's a
decent little fitness tracker I don't
think it quite stands up to some of the
newer like pebble or Samsung smart bands
but I want to watch I want full
notifications support I want good
interaction for voice-to-text
communication so if I get a tech message
text message in on my wrist I can reply
with my voice to reply and not have to
pull my phone out I want good filtering
for what notifications I get and in a
smart way that I can easily sort of
customize that myself and I also still
want some of the fitness tracking GPS
support and all-day heart rate
monitoring and it like the ionic is
gonna give me great solutions for all of
the fitness stuff and it's gonna be okay
for some of the notification stuff and
that just kills it for me my ultimate
dream device would have been a pebble
time with an all-day heart rate sensor
on it multiple days of battery life
great text-to-speech support a great
notification support great calendar
support and then if we could have just
added you know the ability to track
heart rate that would have been awesome
but I still have yet to find that
all-in-one perfect unicorn SmartWatch
and I probably never will public or was
never going to be so yeah that's the I
was so bummed about that it said yeah
and finally didn't end oh is giving
the bye-bye treatment to beat mo its
first mobile app not really a game it
was just more of a place where people
talk to each other with their means you
know if you hadn't we then you had to
create and that's gonna be gone either
May 5th or May 9th differing dates on
different pages but it's good around May
is when we'll see this go away and then
you know Nintendo can really start
focusing on games like Fire Emblem and
Super Mario and all that stuff yeah I
had I didn't even try it you you fired
this up right you were using on five
days Stephen shank who was back around
our team started the pocket now wait did
I or did Stephen I don't remember I just
remember that we we mentioned it at one
point when I had started doing the
podcast and I don't recall talking about
it ever again
we it had its peak like within the first
few weeks 10 million users and they yeah
it was more like 2.5 and ever since then
presumably it's gone down and they're
dealing their last hurrah is doing their
last campaigns hey look at the question
of the day and everyone's just saying
goodbye to each other I guess yeah you
know it's a it's because you know it's
not like a like a RPG or anything
doesn't mean you know there's still that
there can't be gathering together of all
the users and going to don't you know
stovic or you through me with stumble
court because now I wanted to say to say
something to you in Klingon that it
would be really funny I think from like
a black mirror perspective like if
you're me is currently in the app when
the app gets pulled that you're me is
then trapped in in their service forever
I think that could be kind of a fun way
to add more
tality to your digital you know avatar
of what you do no it's just gonna be
like they'll have a new Legend of Zelda
game and it's gonna be replaced with a
copy of link although how great would
that be though is that like one of one
of the side quests in the next Legend of
Zelda game could be to rescue your me
from the netherworld of having miitomo
close and like suckered me into the void
of nothingness it'd be a good side quest
have you played any of the other
Nintendo properties on mobile I have not
I mean you're talking like Super Mario
run and stuff like that yeah I mean that
not III
I fired up Super Mario run when it first
went live on iOS and I think I played
two runs and then put the phone down and
again that was another app that I never
picked up again I I didn't mess with
Fire Emblem I haven't done anything
there yeah I mean Super Mom it was
competent but it was just never kind of
I mean it was an evolved form of why
those kind of just endless runners but
yeah I was way more excited by like NES
classic SNES classic and then I'm still
debating like I think I'm gonna throw
some cash at a switch I'm not doing
nearly as much gaming as I used to but a
switch is starting to really appeal for
sort of a mobile modular idea of gaming
especially with labo
coming out that looks like it could be
kind of cool and my daughter's a little
too young for that yet but I need to
start paying attention to some of that
stuff coming up so that you know I can I
can deliver fun educational techy things
for her get her really interested really
interested in stem and if Nintendo is
gonna be on board that conversation I
want to support it because the Nintendo
could do some really wacky fun stuff
there I think we're gonna go on eBay and
pick up a Neo Geo pocket color
well if you're there shot me an Atari
Lynx and we'll see if we can can get our
right No yeah let's we'll be able to do
that now the home for modern technology
that is pocketable and not the the old
technology that wasn't no wait yep true

excited to be given this run there you
have it folks another episode of the
pocket now weekly has come and gone the
show is over but the conversation
continues on Twitter where Jules is at
point Jules and I'm humbly at some
gadget guy pocket now is around the web
on basically every social media platform
and our home site pocketnow.com so shows
like this cannot exist without your
support sharing the weekly with your
friends who love mobile technology and
dropping reviews anywhere you can review
a podcast because ultimately there
wouldn't be a show if it weren't for our
listeners and subscribers who have kept
this on the air since 2012 the pocket

all kinds of delicious technology
