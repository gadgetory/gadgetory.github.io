challenge so want to be cool if your
iPhone was your personal trainer stick
around for our next app store hello
everybody I'm hi Marilyn and welcome to
the Parker now app store picker we'll be
looking at eye fitness which is a really
cool must-have application if you're
interested in working out and don't have
time for personal trainer don't have
time to go to the gym I've been this has
the idea of operating different workouts
my workouts routines vlogs and other
stuff to help you keep up in shape like
weight monitors body mass indicators etc
each of these workouts has different
options for you to see how you can keep
up with your abs for examples you can
choose different options that will help
you from working with equipment to non
equipment and even offers videos for you
to understand how these workouts work
because oh my god I'm I really couldn't
do that one within the routines you'll
find different programs like for example
beginner programs muscle building
different options and for example one of
my favorites is the business travel
workout so let's say you're out on the
on the road and for example leave the
hot meat options to stay in shape
probably the hotel doesn't have a gym or
something there are options for you to
play with your bags or suitcases that'll
actually help you out in each of these
workouts has a specific description of
exactly what you're supposed to do in
case the video is not offered each of
these also offers the option for you to
add your weight and have a counter for
you to keep up with how many repetitions
you'll be doing and it'll actually tell
you how many sequences and how many
repetitions are expected for each
workout
other options include for example tennis
players basketball players soccer
players can also find different routines
that will fit within what they need
hockey players runners golf players the
worse you name and you'll probably find
them here whenever you add one of the
workouts to be your pole you can
actually add how many repetitions you
did what's your weight at the moment and
yes you could probably relay yourself
three times a day and actually you lock
that into your I fitness application to
keep up in shape and know exactly where
you are in the body mass calculator you
can also add your height and everything
and calculate for example your
different stats like your measurements
if you have the time to measure yourself
one of the cool things is you can
actually backup and restore your
information and also have a specific
profile so that you know that this is
you that's working out you can keep up
with your work as time goes on depending
on which specific routine you chose like
for example I chose weight loss you can
actually tell I fit miss exactly where
you've been for example you can probably
already start with the squats but you
still have certain machining to do you
can actually tell it ok I've done this
one and I'm missing the other one I
fitness works on the iPhone iPod touch
and iPad and it's currently available
for two dollars on the App Store as a
limited time sale that's it for today's
absolute thank you very much for
watching any questions or comments let
