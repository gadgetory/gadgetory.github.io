claim lackluster sales Huawei Nexus 7p
rumors returned and this time with a
kick and that added kick is actually a
problem new operating system by Google
I'm Jaime Rivera and I explicitly asked
for a Super Mario 3 t-shirt but this one
will do actually this is pocket out
daily official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for a
computer you might still be in time to
get a really good deal from Microsoft
the company is now offering the
entry-level surface pro 4 for $150 off
meeting $750 retail which would pretty
much make even the iPad pro nine point
seven inch look really bad yeah I highly
suggest you consider and for those of
you that are wondering exactly how the
iPhone 7 is doing it was rather
interesting that Apple declined to offer
sales numbers over the first week in
something the company has been doing
ever since the iPhone 4 I believe but
anyways the company did not do so and we
kind of get why as the iPhone 7 sales
have expanded and according to trusted
sources an analyst apparently sales are
down 25% it could be that people went
crazy over the 7 plus and couldn't get
the phone but hey we will learn in the
company's quarter results soon I also
moved the spotlight over to Samsung for
those of you that are wondering what the
specifications are for the Galaxy s8
there are some really shady ones out
there that are just probably too over
promising but here this 5.2 inch 4k
display the 4k is something I don't
think will happen but then we obviously
here a Snapdragon processor which pretty
much contradicts the Exynos rumors that
we heard about but in addition to that
we here are 4200 milliamp power battery
whopping but possible as its included in
the active and in addition to that a
probable 30 megapixel camera
this will be a rather interesting change
for Samsung if it does happen but stay
tuned the company does need a boost and
for those of you that are wondering
exactly when Google home will appear in
the scene Amazon echo competitor that
brings you the assistant we've got
rumors that claim that you might be able
to get it as soon as October for
whatever Google's event happens but
rather interesting is we also see some
leaked images of the Google chromecast
ultra and all we still don't know
exactly what that ultra will be what we
do know is that it's a bit larger one
two it doesn't include the chromecast
logo it says everything is going cool
and branding that will be rather
interesting and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with a
probable new operating system from
Google a merger between Android and
Chrome OS rumors claimed the name will
be Andromeda and we hear that those
whole Huawei 7p rumors might point to a
tablet running that operating system in
addition to a separate Google pixel
tablet computer probably that will also
be running the OS now we're not exactly
sure if this means that the tablet
operating system will be the only one
that will run on dromeda but if that
were the case it does lead me to the
question of the day do you think that
the whole Android ecosystem meaning
Android as it is should evolve into a
dromeda and make something holistic a
single operating system or do you think
the tablet should be treated with
something more robust in my case I think
that the more robust approach should be
it mainly because third the holistic
approach already did not work for Google
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
