pocketnow.com and this is a look at the
camera and camcorder application on the
HTC hd2 in the for review that we posted
a few days ago on pocketnow.com we
talked about the photo and video quality
which we decided was not too great
although it's passable so in this video
we're gonna look at these applications
to show you what has changed and sort of
how this camera application works and
how fast it takes pictures because the
Snapdragon processor really helps it
snap pictures extremely fast so here we
are right now we have sort of a
background object in a foreground
objection just to sort of a
demonstration so let's first start off
with taking pictures quickly so I'm
gonna turn off the flash so we don't
have to deal with that and I'm just
gonna take a picture I'm not gonna
really worry about how it's going to
look on the screen and you can see how
fast the camera application is on other
HTC devices or other windows mobile
devices it's really slow to get from the
next to get from the point where you
take a picture and you're an intake the
next one takes about three seconds but
not the case on this device so we have
selective autofocus meaning I can tap
the background to get that InFocus the
foreground will get blurry or I can tap
on the foreground to get the background
kind of a little bit blurry we can
change the flash mode over here we can
have it going to fill light or automatic
and let's go into fill light so you get
an idea of sort of what photos look like
with the flash because the flash is so
extremely bright a lot of the time even
if you are shooting from several feet
away in an indoor situation the
resulting picture just has too much
light and that's thanks in part to this
dual LED flash which I think doesn't
really make much sense I think one LED
would have been plenty of light to
provide to a dark subject if you're
taking pictures so the flash is kind of
detrimental I think to the camera of the
hd2 so let's go through some other
settings what's kind of new about this
device is that we have a zoom bar over
here although this is using digital zoom
which as most people know is kind of
fake it doesn't actually mechanically
move the lens in and out it just zooms
in on the picture and the result is that
if you take a picture that is zoomed in
it will likely be a lot more blurry
then if you were to take one zoomed out
or I should say pixelated not
necessarily blurry so let's zoom back
out if we go into settings we have
another way to switch between storage on
the device or storage on the on the
storage card included before you have to
kind of dig into settings to change this
but now it's quick quick and easy to
sort of determine where you want the
pictures to go of course we have the
standard settings here like white
balance we can change the white balance
to automatic indoors outdoors that sort
of thing there's a night mode we can
change the brightness of the picture and
let's go back we can change the ISO
setting the self-timer if you want to
kind of rest this on a on a shelf
somewhere and take a family portrait or
something like that we can go into
advance and see all the settings here
which are pretty common for HTC devices
so we can change the resolution the
highest resolution is 5 megapixels and
right now it's set at that although we
can go to three two and one megapixels
and if you're trying to save on space
you can always go to just the sort of
almost VGA size so when I hit cancel and
go back we can also decide if you want
have a widescreen photo if not you'll
see kind of the the letterbox or the the
bar on the side I think it makes a lot
more sense to have that nice widescreen
view so I'm going to turn that back on
touch focus on or off and we already
demonstrated that selective autofocus
you review duration and this is a way
that you can get it to take pictures
even faster so we can say no review and
you can get the next picture ready to go
even faster than that going down the
list we've quality and you can change it
from fine to super fine to basic moving
on we can also turn on and off a
timestamp if you want to remember when
it was taken we can determine if we want
to keep the backlight on or you can turn
it off to save on battery life going
forward you have the shutter sound if
you want it to make a sound after you've
taken the picture we can change the
effects to have sort of grayscale you
can kind of see on the side what that
looks like
sepia negative kind of some fun stuff
there metering mode which I can't change
due to the focus mode going over we have
the counter which shows you how many
pictures you've taken this this is
helpful if you have a flash card so you
can determine if you've taken
the pictures are hundred pictures and
you want to see how many you've actually
taken Flickr adjustment it's always good
to have that on auto so that it can
determine if it needs to cut down on
Flickr adjustment depending on what
you're taking a picture of you can turn
on and off a grid to help you align
things on the screen and if we go to
about we see this is version six point
two six now let's switch modes to the
camcorder mode to see kind of what
settings we get there so here are the
other camera modes and we can do a
panorama and a contacts picture that'll
go right to contacts which is great and
here we are in video let's see the
settings that we have here we can change
the brightness again we do have one
touch to change the storage option if we
go into advanced we can change the
resolution this will do up to VGA
recording which is pretty good it's a
it's above average for a smartphone but
it's certainly not high definition we
can change the review duration the
capture format and we can switch between
only two different formats we can change
a recording limit if you don't want it
to record for a very long time going
over to the next side we have keep
backlight on or off we can record with
audio which is always good to have on
again the shutter sound is there we can
change the effect to the same three
effects that we found previously there's
a counter again and you get the point
from there so just as a little test
let's look at the video quality on this
device I'm just going to do a little bit
of a test and move things around so you
can kind of get a feel for how good the
camera is and we're not going to put the
fill light on because that makes things
look not so nice so we're gonna leave it
on no fill light okay this is a test of
the camera or the camcorder on the hd2
we're gonna move things around so we can
get a test or a feel for how quickly how
the frame rate is on this device when
recording and here's an HTC pure alright
let's stop it and see what that looks
like play it's fine
so the quality is pretty good it's not
going to replace your HD camcorder
that's for sure but if you're doing a
quick video this definitely is capable
of helping you out in that way so that
was just a quick look at the camera
application on the HTC hd2 the really
fast processor helps to get from picture
in a picture really quickly so there's
really no weight but the quality of the
photos could be better and perhaps a
firmware upgrade will help with some of
these issues the flash is way too bright
and the pictures come out kind of grainy
and the videos not too sharp but it
works it's a it's not supposed to
replace your camera and it does an okay
job that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
