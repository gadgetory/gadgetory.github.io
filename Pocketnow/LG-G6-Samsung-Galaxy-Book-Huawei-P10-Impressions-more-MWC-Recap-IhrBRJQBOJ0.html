the red backrest I love it a lovely
shirt or like red wedding the fact that
we just woke up yeah I'm on half a cup
of coffee so we know this is going to be
baller good morning everyone this is my
terrible face when i wake up at yours is
worse yeah really bad i look like how he
feels yeah thank you anyways we're
wrapping up mwc i am payment of ivetta
and one Carlos I go and let's go through
everything that we thought about from
the show let start this video off with
the tablet we are surprised the tablets
made such an appearance at the show it
hasn't been the case for the last couple
of years and then the major players
dancing just pretty much took it off
only with tablets I don't know about you
I was really impressed with the galaxy
book definitely I've been using Windows
10 since November I've been
experimenting with premiere pro moving
away from Final Cut is a macbook pro and
so far i would say that oddly my
favorite that computer right now is the
microsoft surface pro 4 so this is like
a surface pro 4 modern version yeah just
about everything that you can like about
it i also like that alcatel tablet yeah
believe it or not even if it's not the
most powerful tablets it is extremely
powerful lower caution it has very well
designed though but we still don't have
that price tag we don't have the typical
alcatel design we're assuming it's going
to be the Lord what about you well the
galaxy tab s 3 the android tablet was a
very interesting entry this year
especially for samsung focusing some of
its note progress on productivity for
these devices so again that was the
common talking point for any type of
larger screen device was can you get
your work done and all the fun stuff is
fun to HDR video that's all great but
you know incorporating s-pen technology
into the s3 I'll be curious to see how
we feel about a glass back tablet down
and think about it don't you see them to
see that trends of the s-pen now works
on every everything so and this is going
to be a standalone product so could it
be that it's going to work on the essay
fingers crossed I know we've been asking
for that for a while oh yes in part two
of the pocket now mission of tablets
smartphones and
wearables one of the biggest talking
points on the show floor was obviously
the huawei watch to kind of mixed
reactions from a lot of people i know
there are a lot of people out there who
are fans of the og huawei watch and that
design is definitely been polarizing in
the comments of our videos but i think
one of the more exciting talking points
was this LG tone pro now this is
something that we covered at CES it's
now getting its international launch
yeah and so LG had some people on the
ground to show these off and i don't
think i've ever seen tony our
editor-in-chief anton look so happy to
try out a piece of gear like this he
looks like a kid on Christmas once we
fired up this wearable speaker but
anyways I don't know this is pretty much
the only wearable we really had way
comes with my fantasy don't worry there
were a few other cases so for me
honestly I don't know about you this
while we watch to is such a step back in
design from the original Huawei watch
yes it's growing on it you know it's
it's it's interesting I was not looking
forward to this watch based on the press
materials based on the press photos
wearing it has been a different
experience this is not my personal style
no and this is a completely different
audience than what the original Huawei
watch was targeted at where I feel that
was a bit more upscale more than evening
dress up look kind of device so I
definitely believe there is a market for
this it's just different it's a
different market than what while we was
originally targeted it's growing on me
and right now it's the only way you can
read where to that up well unless you
rock one of those LG's nothing out there
we don't ask you and let's wrap today's
video with the most amazing lighting we
could identify at an Airbnb to
compensate for my horrible space
smartphones this is the best show for
smartphones yet again we always say that
because it's the show where we always
get the latest galaxy and I don't know
about you I obviously can't wait for
that unpacked event on March 29 but my
favorite bone of the show with the LG G
six it's i tried to love the LG g5 it
if you watch our mwc wrap up from last
year the g5 was my favorite phone
because the units that we held at that
pre-brief felt great and did everything
they had to do and then the final
production was not at all where we got
for concern but he fixes everything the
g5 should have always been a lot of
people say that I feel that way and it
feels that LG has finally found its way
I think that you you put it best LG has
found its way they found a good design
language a good way to be unique I'm
still struggling with the concept of 18
to buy 15 at everybody like 80 by 9 i'm
a 30 x 15 a spectrum I'm liking the
concept I'm liking the diviner please
feel that but the way the borders are
done make it feel thicker than it is but
then once you hold the phone because of
the way the screen fits into the chassis
it is actually smaller than you see on
video I just kind of a camera but what
about you well ive got tiny hands so
that's how we're different no I
completely agree LG i think is now on
that first step of really nailing down a
good brand identity so this that's
really been the exciting story absent a
galaxy now we've got the battle of the
underdogs dual camera sensor phone so it
might take away from the show I'm really
digging the p10 so this this isn't as
grand of departures LG this is a lot
more iterative if you saw the p 9 and
you help this phone up next to it i
think a lot of people would be
hard-pressed to point out the specific
differences between these two phones but
for for huawei this year is all about
refinement it's all about the little
touches and bringing make nine
technology nip into a smaller form
factor and since I'm not the biggest fan
of phablets this is a really good year
for me where I can put down my mate 9
and be 20 and have very similar features
an adjacent deep end yes we will be
reviewing these products over the next
couple of days as they tuned for our
coverage but at least need to the
question of this video let's do it was
your favorite product the Nokia 3310
please tell me why there is so much more
to talk about the question that we have
for everyone but no okay what was your
favorite product of the show you know
it's funny i think that the depth 3320
has been so hard to fill by the way like
the booth is the
so packed that it's picking us forever
to do that guy do just get good angles
and everything but it's funny that that
phone has literally still in the show
lately but anyways leave us a comment
down below let us know what was your
favorite product to show as always
thanks so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel you can catch
all of our mwc videos we're going to
have a lot of coverage coming up on the
gadgets that we're going home with we're
really excited about that 4-pocket now
I'm one Carlos bag now I'm behind that I
thanks so much for watching and we will
see you on the next one very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
