story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the buzz behind that new tool
you might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as important as the moment you
unbox your product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
expensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's take a second look at Huawei's
fashion flagship and see if it still
deserves a spot in our favorites list
I'm Heidi that I would pocket now and
this is the Huawei p10 after the buzz
I think I said it once in a podcast and
I'll say it again today I love the way
Huawei has matured in the flagship space
a few years ago people bought Huawei's
because it was all they could afford but
in 2017 a good amount of my friends
already know what the Huawei p10 is and
they do desire one one of the main
reasons for its popularity is because
let's face it this phone is gorgeous
some do attribute it to its resemblance
to the iPhone and I'd have to agree
partially I mean even the pentalobe
screws are here but you know what I'm
going to say that it puts the iPhone to
shame instead in a lot of ways for
starters there is no camera hump waddle
to deal with and encourages what I'd
call fitting headphone jack into such
thin hardware the only two things I wish
this phone had over my time using it are
water resistance and stereo speakers and
to answer the question of how much time
I've actually carried this phone on and
off for three months or so ever since
MWC during that time the hardware pretty
much hasn't aged and one of the main
reasons has to do with the bundled case
like seriously your case makers if you
could make something this than in fancy
even I'd be willing to use it and sure
this case is a lip magnet but the result
is a phone that's pristine even up to
the champers that are not protected by
the case another reason why it has an
aged this thanks to its internals even
the latest snapdragon 835 processor is
barely as powerful as the karin 960 and
my unit is of 64 gigabytes that includes
expandable storage or dual-sim
capabilities so there is really no way
to go wrong with this much power and the
reason why the amount of power is so
crucial is because I have yet to see an
Android phone perform this well touch
the fingerprint scanner boom slide
within the UI boom multitask between
applications call um the notification
shade like seriously this phone is
sparring on its animations and it just
feels like if there is no lag whatsoever
launch your favorite game and yes not
only does it launch the game faster than
your standard flagship but even within
gameplay there is no
act to report on people they say what
they want about emui
I mean let's face it in the past that
was horrible but version 5.1 pretty much
seems like if it were just the skin on
top of stock Android and to be honest
not even stock Android performs this
well at least in my opinion now to be
honest with you I'm still not a fan of
the unique features like the navigation
gestures on the home button but you
always have the option to just bring the
software navigation keys and use this
phone like if it were pixel and then my
other minor complaint is the lack of
adoption of Android 7.1 not for the sake
of having the update but because of
battery life as I will just call it
decent on the p10 it's not great it's
not bad it'll just get you through the
day and sure you have the fastest
charging available from Huawei but
really sometimes you just want your
flagship to last a little longer and
that's really made nine territory the
p10 will barely scratch the day I also
have to agree with fun in this phone not
being stellar when it comes to audio
even with the existence of the headphone
jack audio performance even on phone
calls is what I call average nothing
really stellar now you know what I won't
call average oh my god this camera combo
there are currently two companies that
are doing dual cameras right LG with its
wide-angle and Huawei with the extra
monochrome sensor these are seriously
some of the most beautiful and accurate
photos that I've taken with a phone
doesn't matter if it's during the day or
at night this phone will always outshine
most of its competition
now the funniest thing is that this is
whenever I choose to take photos in
color see I've fallen in love with
black-and-white photography thanks to
the monochrome sensor up to the point
where before I filmed this video most of
the photos that I had taken were all in
black and white
and then video is not necessarily the
most stable but it does get the job done
for the most part
and then obviously people like selfies
I'm not a big fan of this phone there's
a really good job even in low-light
about the only thing I'd change about
this camera is the user interface as
basics like HDR should not be a mode
that I have to be constantly switching
on overall if I had to spec up my list
of favorite smartphones of 2017 the
Huawei p10 would easily make my top 5
I'm seriously in love with this petite
little package of powerful hardware and
beautiful design and seriously one of
the best camera combos that I have ever
tested on a phone you know I usually
carry two phones with one of these being
a smaller one and the p10 has replaced
the Google pixel ever since I started
using it back in Barcelona if anything
my only wish would be as I said waterand
does resistance in addition two stereo
speakers are pretty much the only
features that make me drift away from
this phone every now and then but if you
are considering buying a Huawei p10 go
for it I highly recommend this phone
even today
