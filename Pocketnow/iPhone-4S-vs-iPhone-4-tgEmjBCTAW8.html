pocketnow.com Apple claims that the new
iPhone 4s is significantly faster than
its predecessor the iPhone 4 is that
true we're going to test the claim in
this video let's go so we're going to
test both of these devices and again the
iPhone 4s is on the right the iPhone 4
is on the left in four areas one startup
time two application load times number
three we're going to talk about the
internet and web speed and number four
we're going to get into gaming we're
going to cover all of those things now
so let's get to it both of these devices
are running iOS 5 the latest versions so
let's do the startup test both of these
devices are turned off and by the way
we've cleared cache in the in the
browser and we've also turned off all
third-party apps from the multitask UI
so here we are right off the gate the
iPhone 4s is a little bit faster with
bringing up that iPhone logo the Apple
logo there so let's see which gets to
the slide to lock screen first it looks
like the forest forest got there first
and the four shouldn't be too far behind
maybe by a couple of seconds there it is
about four or five seconds slower than
the iPhone 4s so let's slide to unlock
here okay here we are let's double check
that there are no applications running
we already have settings running let's
just kill that and make sure that it's
fair here so we've got new applications
running right now both of them are on
the same Wi-Fi network although that
we're going to do network test speeds
both over Wi-Fi and over 3G because
we've got full bars here so we really
should be able to see the maximum speed
so let's open up some applications let's
start with settings ready set go okay so
the 4s was definitely faster there let's
open the calendar next go
ok the 4s was faster there let's open
the camera very important you want to
take that quick shop of course cameras
not loaded into the memory right now so
it's going to take a little bit longer
but we'll still be able to see which one
does it faster ready one two three go
okay the iPhone 4s was faster there okay
let's open the Notes app up
here we'll see which one goes faster
looks like it was the iPhone 4s in that
situation so across the board iPhone 4s
is opening up applications more quickly
which is good to see we want the 4s to
be faster than the iPhone 4
okay now let's test internet speed and
we're going to start off by showing the
same website we're going to do pinch to
zoom and test the performance then we're
going to do Network speed tests by
turning off Wi-Fi so let's jump into the
browser and we'll see which one opens up
first
iPhone 4s was faster so let's load
PocketNow at the same time here again
over the same Wi-Fi network about the
same the four was actually a little bit
faster in that situation another
interesting note is how that iPhone 4s
screen is warmer it's a little bit more
yellowish the original iPhone 4 had a
very very cool screen this was one of
the first iPhone 4s it shipped one of
the first days that they started to send
them out and with it you got that really
cool screen which some people liked but
Apple went to a warmer screen for
subsequent versions let's click on a
desktop version pocket now see which one
gets there first okay the four actually
got there first let's scroll down the
page we get a little bit of a blank spot
there on the four let's pinch to zoom ok
very smooth on both of them let's click
on this link see which one gets there
first
oh god got a little stutter there on the
floor and here it comes
on the 4s a little bit faster actually
the four finished first amazingly the
four is actually beating the 4s let's go
to another website let's go to Engadget
here
okay the 4s killed the iPhone four there
let's go to the bottom and go to the
desktop version hit the wrong button
there we'll go to the desktop version
we'll catch up in a minute and while
they're loading we're going to flick
down the page it's blank on the four
still blank on the floor before us one
of course but it wasn't a perfect test
because we didn't start at the same time
let's go back to the top here and
pinch-to-zoom both very smooth here and
we're going to click on a link same time
4s finish first there let's flick down
the page we'll wait for the four to
finish before we flip down the page
flick down the page quickly pretty
smooth so no real clear winner here the
4s seems faster in a lot of situations
but sometimes the four is even faster
might have to do with network conditions
let's run speedtest.net here to
determine sort of sometimes with a
faster processor you get faster data
speeds just by having a faster processor
so we do these one at a time so that
they don't clog up the network weird
over Wi-Fi right now then we'll turn off
Wi-Fi and go to 3G let's start with the
4s so let's see kind of data speeds we
can expect over Wi-Fi this is a pretty
fast Wi-Fi network that's connected to
very very fast so about 19 down and 22
up let's do the for the router is about
three feet behind me so it's getting a
very strong signal okay looks like
that's 17 down and 18 up so faster on
the 4s in terms of data speeds if we ran
these tests three times I know for a
fact that the forest would be faster now
let's see what it can do in terms of
cellular data speed over AT&amp;amp;T 3G Apple
touts that the 18 T version can get a
theoretical 14 point 4 megabits per
second down over HSPA+ of course that's
in theory that's not going to happen in
the real world so let's jump into
settings real quick and turn off that
Wi-Fi okay and Wi-Fi is turned off let's
jump back into the speedtest.net
applique
and we can run them at the same time it
doesn't really matter here so let's go
begin test let's see what we can do in
terms of data we have full bars here it
looks like the iPhone 4 is actually
doing a lot better than the iPhone 4s
interestingly Wow clocking 5.8 down on
the iPhone 4 and only 3.16 on the 4s and
the upload speed will be higher on the
iPhone 4s at about 1.6 megabits per
second and 0.94 on the 4s real quick
we're going to restart the results
restart the test and we'll come back we
won't make you sit through this whole
thing and we're back with the test
results around 2 and again the same
results almost 6 megabits per second
down on the 4 and half that on the 4s
very interesting indeed if we take a
look at some of the results that we've
gotten with the 3G connection I've gone
up to 6.6 megabits per second one of our
editors from PocketNow Dan Webster has
gotten 10 megabits per second down in
Washington on the 4s most people will be
happy if they see something like this on
the 4 6 megabits per second is quite
fast
ok so let's test out gaming now we've
got a really high FPS game here asphalt
6
let's see which one opens up faster
we're a little bit ahead on the iPhone
for us because we have that pop-up
notification let's skip past this now
where now we're even so we'll be able to
determine speed from here iPhone 4s is
ahead touch to continue touch to
continue looks like a miss the press
there on the for here we are let's go to
a free race if we can get at the same
time
as you can see a little stutter there in
the force let's do a normal race we're
going to zoom out so we can actually
play with two phones at one time fine
work i zoomed out here we're gonna click
normal race want to try to get it on the
screen at the same time and we're going
to click race and we're going to pick up
two phones at once and play two iphone
games at the same time not even sure
this is possible but this way you can
tell the difference between the graphics
on both so here we go a little fly scene
in the beginning they're pretty darn
smooth on the iPhone 4s let's see how it
looks on the four take a lot longer it
still looks very smooth on the four just
loading times are a lot slower a little
stutter there you saw on the four okay
let's skip past all of this stuff
alright so this will still work it'll
not work perfectly but you'll be able to
get the point if you see me crashing a
lot that's because these are not
synchronized definitely a difference in
terms of the frame rate if you look at
the bottom screen it's just not nearly
as smooth it's just butter up top apple
claims a seven times increase in gaming
performance in terms of the graphical
prowess of the Apple a5 chip now I'm
going to focus on the bottom but
definitely a difference can you see how
choppy it is on the bottom not shoppi
but you can definitely tell there's not
as many frames per second as in the top
so definitely in terms of gaming
performance the iPhone 4s takes the cake
so I think the surprising thing here is
that while the iPhone 4s is faster in a
lot of areas like starting up and
loading applications it's not faster in
every aspect like on the internet it's
not always faster but sometimes and in
terms of data speeds and our tests over
Wi-Fi it was faster but over 3G that was
not faster so if you want the fastest
iPhone there's no doubt that the forest
is the one to get it in terms of just
loading applications faster that's a big
enough advantage for most people to
warrant the upgrade but it's not a huge
blow out here it's not a it doesn't feel
like a two times performance increase in
terms of CPU power and a seven times
increase in terms of gaming so keep that
in mind when you're looking at
two phones if you liked this video
please give us a thumbs up and the
review is about to go up on
pocketnow.com
check out the description you'll see the
link to it and you can read everything
about the iPhone for us thanks for
