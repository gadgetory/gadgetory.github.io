and we're looking at the sprint treo pro
from palm and one things is special
about this device is that it's one of
the first windows mobile phones or
phones anywhere that supports flash
right out of the box so we're looking at
the new version of internet explorer on
one does more right now and i'm going to
go to a website that uses flash
there it is
click through
there's something moving down there
flicking is very smooth and press play
button on it
i zoom out the flash actually stops
playing but this is so that you can
navigate easier now one thing that I
don't like it there's no easy way to
stop all this flash from going on you
got a pan and scroll and you got to find
that stop button I wish there was a stop
button in the menu or something we can
also go to youtube I'll show you
something else
see that mouse cursor there you can lose
that with the d-pad scrolls really nice
quickly first slow and then it goes back
now here's a great little feature if I
tap and hold on the flash file embedded
in the web page I can switch it to full
screen and that gives me a lot of room
to watch the video now actually really
nice when you close it like that and you
can see is flame I can still scroll it's
very smoothly very very nice
implementation of flash supporting and
can explore for windows mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
