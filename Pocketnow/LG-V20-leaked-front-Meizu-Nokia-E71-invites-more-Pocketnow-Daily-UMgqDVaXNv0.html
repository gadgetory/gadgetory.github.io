features are coming back the Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge gains some colors and
exclusivity and mizzou has just used the
Nokia to tease an event wait what I'm hi
Mary Vera reporting from another Dark
Side of the Moon and using Voltron this
is walking out daily the official news
today begin with deals from t-mobile if
you are currently holding an iphone and
you want a newer one or you want to swap
the one you have for the other one
t-mobile is offering this trade-in
program or if you have any of the
current iphones or last year iphones
you're only going to pay a hundred
dollars for whatever thing you want in
16 gigs for an extra hundred dollars for
more storage and if you've got older
iphones you'll pay fifty dollars for the
traded which is actually not bad
considering you're getting the full
phone pretty much at half price you can
learn more link in the description
because obviously it includes upgrades
fees etc another very important deals
the microsoft surface pro continues to
be one of our favorite computers not
just tablets computers and if you're in
the market for when i highly suggest you
follow the links in the description for
ebay there's a trusted seller that's
offering two different variants for
three hundred fifty dollars off each
that is a crazy deal and that is a
really crazy good computer that i highly
suggest you buy now the next news aren't
really deals but something interesting
if you're in the market for galaxy s7
edge or galaxy s7 and you want it in
pink because at least this company is
nice enough to call it pink instead of
rose gold you now have the option to get
these phones on best buy their exclusive
to best buy the price tag is pretty much
the same you're not getting any upgrade
to set the color but then again i know
that for some of you that color is
compelling enticing whatever you wanna
call it now in the weirdest sort of news
today we've got meizu sending out press
invitations for September 13 event and
listen to this one the company is
sending out nokia e71 to the invitees
and i already want to know if I'm
getting invited to the event because
sure I do want to go see whatever it is
that may sue has why not but I really
want that nokia e71 that was probably
one of my favorite phones ever but can
somebody chime in the comments
what does the milk it eats have any one
have to do with this we'd love to read
that and finally the very hot muses they
have to do with the LGV 20 we continue
to cruise along this phone because it is
one of the next flagships that we're
waiting for this time we see some League
renders that show was one very
interesting thing number one no modules
again from the front number two it's got
that ticker secondary display at the top
that made the b10 interesting if not
famous but hey I have the lead 10 in the
drawer there i really liked everything
about the phone except that screen i
never really used it but it leads me to
the question of the day if you had to
choose would you prefer modules or would
you prefer that ticker i would love the
modules back again just better
implementation but we'd love to know
your opinion in the comments down below
