Note 9 this time pretty much unwrapped
English we should expect for the battery
new leaks for the sony xperia x III
emerge and we wonder when we will get
this phone and it turns out Samsung's
foldable smartphone might be a little
too expensive for our taste I'm Jaime
Rivera it is finally Friday in theory
this is a pre-recorded video because
today's Father's Day I'm gonna be
celebrating with my kids if you don't
mind
this is parking out daily if I showed
this today begin with deals B and H is a
continuing on their streak of deals
right now we've got options for the
Apple watch Galaxy phones moto phones
and the deals are ranging between $50
and 170 bucks the list is significant
but definitely worth it you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about the pixel book that all expensive
Chromebook that cost too much money and
is so wellspect that you wonder why it
just runs Chrome OS and it seems that
Google kind of figured that out as well
that's at the point where we've got
rumors that they're already working on
certifications for Windows tend to run
on a variant of the pixel book I
actually like this idea a lot I can't
wait for it to happen
I would pay the money that a pixel book
cost of it ran Windows so we'll see now
let's talk about Samsung's Galaxy X that
foldable smartphone that keeps on giving
we hear that the display is going to
range between somewhere around 7 inches
diagonal when you extend it 4 inches or
less when you don't that's gonna be
weird but the weirdest part is the price
tag we hear that MWC is gonna be the
probable date and it will cost somewhere
around 2,000 bucks
so no samson particularly in the case
where you are turning this into a tablet
and tablets don't really sell well and
you can buy a tablet for a lot less
money and a phone for a lot less money
you can buy both things combined for a
lot less money but we'll see and how
about if we talk about the sony xperia
XZ 3 or XZ 2 premium we don't know what
the name is going to be we don't know
what the dates are going to be probably
for hopefully but the rumors are that
we're getting dual cameras but if you
notice the leaks and the image I mean
you could just grab the egg z2 and
Photoshop another ring on that camera
and move it south which is what I notice
that they're doing but I could be wrong
I was wrong about the oneplus leakes it
turned out to be true so yeah we'll see
what happens and finally the hottest
news today are Galaxy Note 9 I am
waiting for this phone and we've got
more credible sources chiming in on
dates as we discussed yesterday we hear
August 2nd August 9th possibilities most
important is the battery size I don't
know how the company's gonna pull it off
but we are hearing 4th
and milliamp hours I am really looking
forward to a battery of that size but in
today's question let us know in addition
to a larger battery what else would you
like to see from Samsung's Galaxy Note
lineup
oh my god cuz in my case if they would
launch a tablet that would be just as
good running Android I'd be happy but
that's just me leave us a comment down
below I know my rumors are a bit
far-fetched or my preference friends
