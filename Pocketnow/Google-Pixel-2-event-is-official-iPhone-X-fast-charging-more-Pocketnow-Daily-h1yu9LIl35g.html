event date for its future Google pixel -
it seems the iPhone 10 does include fast
charging for an extra price tag and
rumors of the BlackBerry Krypton have
just begun to emerge I'm high meta Iveta
and yeah the shirt pretty much describes
me but I wouldn't leave it a deke I
would also add nerd to the mix this is
Parkin out daily if I shall news today
begin with deals the only carrier that
was missing yesterday for deals on the
iPhone 10 or iPhone 8 was really AT&amp;amp;T
and today the company has chimed in we
have a long list of requirements for you
to be able to apply to a buy one get one
free deal you actually have to get a new
phone line on next then it's kind of
complicated but if you want to read the
whole thing there's a link in the
description the thing is there's
actually something now stalk about
blackberry the company sort of kind of
teased that there is another flagship
smartphone to come and we've got the
BlackBerry krypton making its way
through the FCC but the only thing we
can tell us that apparently this device
will not have accurate a keyboard it
seems that this will be a flat slab and
we're expecting this to probably be the
replacement to the D Tech 60 though we
don't have any specifications to claim
that so stay tuned we can't wait to tell
you more now let's talk about the Huawei
codename maintenance 6 and I most likely
butchered it but well it just passed
through a Tina certification and the
specifications look like if this is
pretty much the May 10 we've got the 18
by 9 aspect ratio and the other things
we were expecting but the more you dig
in apparently this is not going to be
the main 10 apparently this is like a G
10 or something like that we're kind of
confused we're waiting and we're getting
close to Wally's event in Munich we
can't wait to tell you more now even if
Apple joined the crowd of wireless
charging one of the biggest questions
that was left is where is the fast
charging from iPhones I mean pretty much
every flagship has a fast charger and
charging the iPhone 7 plus it's kind of
a nightmare now bear in mind Apple
actually came clear and said that there
is fast charging but you will have to
buy it separately apparently you're
going to need a 29 watt USBC adapter and
then a USB C 2 lightning cable I love
this fragmentation from Apple this
is so not the company but anyways
apparently that's gonna be the case it's
almost like $60 and finally the hottest
news today have to do with Google just a
couple of days after the iPhone events
Google comes clear there is a made by
Google event happening on October 4 set
your calendars we will definitely be
covering it live and obviously we're
waiting for the next batch of pixels
hopefully there is more than just the
pixels we're waiting for an HTC made
pixel to an LG made pixel XL 2 which
actually also passed by the FCC today so
there's a certification thing I guess
and yeah we're expecting major
differences between both of these phones
and Google's ad is claiming that this is
going to be the phone that'll solve all
the needs of consumers and that's all
fine and dandy but it leads me to the
question today do you believe that
Google can deliver that particularly in
2017 we've got amazing offerings from LG
with the V 30 with Samsung's Galaxy Note
8 and the galaxy s 8 lineup Apple's
iPhone 10 which is pretty much different
to anything we've even got an essential
phone leave us a comment down below I
can't wait to see what Google brings and
it hopefully is better than everything
