pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the hardware on the
verizon motorola droid 3 so sit back
relax and enjoy the show after spending
a couple of days with the droid 3 i have
to say this is actually a very
reasonable device I don't know that it's
a must-have or a powerhouse sort of
device there are a couple of items will
go over in this hardware review that I
found to be kind of concerning but
really the let's just go right to the
the most important thing the battery
life on this today I ran it completely
by itself running all of my
communications through it all my email
that sort of thing and if we take a look
here under the batter and battery and
data manager twenty percent right now
I'm burning running for 13 hours we're
just now getting at ten-forty at night
the fifteen percent or less battery life
remaining and I got the battery right
now that this displays on full
brightness specifically for this review
but as you can see here normally the
display especially on my epic 4g is
right up at the top for the percentage
usage and it's cell standby that's the
the number one item there so really
battery life has been outstanding I'm
gonna do a little few more phone calls
and I'll update the review with any more
information there as we get it as for
the keyboard itself I found it it's nice
and backlit it's it it's a little swishy
I mean I'm going to move that the device
up to the next the microphone so you can
hear this so that's what you get when
you are listening to typing on this
device a lot of swishy almost like
you're wearing corduroy pants while
typing it's not too terribly annoying
unless you're have problems with those
sort of noises the other thing I found
with this keyboard while it's pretty
easy to type on I'm finding that I'm
hitting the V button more than the C
button probably because I'm used to the
epic 4g
and this particular the tail over here
actually causes my hand to be shifted
over slightly so it's a little different
to type when things aren't lined up
exactly where I want them I keep wanting
to push my hand over further to line my
fingers up with the keyboard a little
bit better since my epic 4g does have a
top row number keys that's not it hasn't
been too big of an issue between myself
but compared to the other droid devices
this is a very handy keyboard and
actually a pleasure to use considering
call volume and call a call reception on
this particular device has been received
very well by the people who have been
listening on the other end I haven't had
any complaints and personally I haven't
had any dropped calls at all not
surprising with a verizon phone they're
usually very solid the one thing i did
find with the keyboard is that on this
particular device and I did go and check
on another device at the verizon store
that it steams to stick right there it's
a little harder to force there and if if
you've got a web page up and you are
trying to push this up any angle other
than very the tips of your thumbs you're
going to press keys like this if you're
used to being able to slide this open
there's no spring load mechanism for
this on the store demo unit it was very
very smooth all the way through no
complications or problems on that device
so it may just be this review unit the
other thing I found is that while it
locks very nicely up here so there's if
I put a little pressure here it doesn't
collapse automatically when I put this
in my pocket I often find the device
when I pull it out is a bit like this
slightly askew and I've also found that
at this depth right about here the
screen does wiggle a little bit now this
is normal for a slider phone in my
opinion well the epic 4g does this
wiggle as well that the oreo effect is
as it's called
so wish there was a little bit more
locking mechanism down on this end
battery cover we talked about before is
just extremely difficult to get loose
but there really hasn't been a reason to
pull the battery other reviewers have
complained that they've had to reboot
the device I haven't had that anything
like that happen with this particular
reviewing it so that's that's a positive
power button has been pretty easy to use
it's a little different spot that I'm
used to with the epic 4g but it hasn't
caused me problems the volume rockers
and the volume on both the media and
calls have been outstanding headphone
jack on the top has also been caused no
problems the headphone jack their head
phone plugged in very easily no problems
with Bluetooth connectivity we'll get
more into Bluetooth and some of the
voice commands that it has when we get
there charging on this device has been
very fast actually compared to the last
review I did with the LG revolution this
device charges up very nicely which I
appreciate greatly especially when
you're here on the road and need to get
your device back up to full charge a
couple of other items of note with the
droid 3 there is no gyroscope on this
device and it's a bit of a surprise
considering there's a lot of games that
can use that functionality there is a
seller ometer up here with their sensors
you've got the light sensor you've got a
multi-colored LED which you can see
blinking here it does change color
according to what the alert is but
there's no way at least in the software
that I've been able to find yet to
change that manually we talked about the
vga camera and we'll go into that a
little more depth when we talk about
cameras in the full review and then on
the back we've got an 8 megapixel camera
interesting about this may megapixel
camera is that in order to be able to
use the Amite megapixels you actually
have to choose the square framing rather
than the wide frame in wide framing mode
it's actually six megapixels so you have
to set that yourself in the software but
we'll go over that more later in the
software view weight wise
this device is actually heavier than the
epic 4g by about 30 grams which in the
hand it doesn't feel too terribly
different in the pocket it doesn't feel
too terribly different so it's not well
it's not that much of a deal and while
it is thinner than the epic 4g it is
heavier by and large it is also longer
than the epic 4g by just a smidge due to
the tail down here side by side really
they're about the same depth let's take
a quick look at the screen differences
here between these two devices the epic
4g and the droid 3 the colors on the
epic 4g are much more brilliant and
accurate the Reds here are truly red and
may be hard to see in this video but in
the droid 3 screen they are noticeably
purple in hue and the greens in the
background are not the green at all
they're there they're actually very
muted compared to the original photo
that I took so even the black so you can
see here they're kind of a gray maybe a
little bit difficult to tell in this
picture but in the droid 3 the blacks
are not really black they're kind of a
light gray Motorola does a really good
job of kind of hiding this fact in the
main menu and a lot of the menu options
by creating kind of this hashed pattern
effect in the background now that's not
to be confused with the qhd pixel the
pintail sorry pentile display that this
device has and if you're wondering what
pin tiles display does it's still a
little difficult to see in this
particular view but if you look in the
high-def version of this image here in
the text and also if we look up here in
the clock section there's a lot of other
I images online that can demonstrate
this
pixilation that happens there there's
kind of you can see the detailed pixel
edges which when you're looking at a
screen full of text makes it extremely
difficult to focus on it it's really
hard to actually look at the text all if
you're scrolling very quickly compared
to a Super AMOLED screen again that said
we're probably seeing a lot of the
battery life savings in this device
because of that pin tile display well
it's difficult to see here the back keys
are the home row buttons the buttons in
Android and the menu home back and
search are backlit it's just that the
sensor to make them backlit is really
super sensitive it has to be almost
pitch-black for them to light up same
thing with the keyboard backlighting
going into the another item that it's
important to note on this device is the
haptic feedback which is extremely
strong it almost shakes the device every
time it comes on when it's when you use
the keyboard or when you get a
notification or when it just decides to
vibrate when you slide across the screen
it's super super intense there doesn't
seem to be a way to turn that down in
any way shape or form it just shakes the
device almost like the it's akin to a
gaming pad losing its functionality with
a vibration function shakes audibly and
almost wobbles device it's so strong
that wraps up the hardware review of the
motorola droid 3 from verizon if you
have any questions or comments leave
them down below and we'll get back to
them as soon as possible try to answer
those for you otherwise thanks for
watching
you
