pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to show you the dual sim card
functionality of the acer d x 900 so
this will actually allow you to have two
phone lines on one device and we're
going to go through that now so so far i
haven't installed the second sim card
and let me show you what it looks like
if we look in the upper right corner and
this device runs spb mobile shell will
see a 1 and a 2 the one is the sim card
that has the internet connection and
then the two is the auxiliary sim card
that will only make phone calls so if we
go back to the home screen we can
actually see more about this it says no
sim 2 and up here at the top there's a
little sim card picture with an ex that
has a number 2 implying that you do not
have the second SIM card installed so
I'm going to get it installed and I'll
show you what that looks like in a sec
okay here we are behind the battery and
there are two sim card slots so I put
one in one and one on the other alright
so now we've both sim cards in the
device and let me show you how this
operates basically there are two fronts
that this works phone calls and text
messages right because text messages
actually go through your sim card rather
than through the internet data plan that
you have so much turn on the device and
the first thing that you'll notice here
in mobile shell in the upper right
corner we have two system notifications
or to network notifications to is
actually the auxiliary sim card or the
secondary one that doesn't have any
internet data and number one is the main
sim card that does do the internet data
and you can see individually which one
has the signal strength and it's kind of
interesting because both cards that are
in right now are on the same network and
yet one card has a lower signal strength
and the other which is kind of strange
and by the way in theory you could have
a tmobile sim card in here and an AT&amp;amp;T
sim card in here there's nothing keeping
it from doing that as long as they
operate on the correct frequencies so
we're going to go out of this screen and
go over here and we can see the two
names of the two networks that we're
using now what happens if you want to
make a call well just like on any
windows mobile device you press the call
start button and you're taking to the
dialer but what's different here is that
there is a talk one and a talk two
button so quite simply if you want to
use line two or
the auxiliary phone you would dial the
number press talk to simultaneously if
you want to use the main sim card you
talk press talk 1 it's very simple but
what about when you get a call in how do
you know which line it's coming in on
well I'll call my device now and you'll
see how that looks
all right so it's dialing I'm just gonna
cover up the screen for security and
what you see it says phone one at the
top and so just like we had and so just
like we had when we were making a call
when we receive a call line one or two
is designated by the number one or the
number two and that is how you determine
between the two lines now when you're
making a text message you actually get a
choice on whether you want to send it
out on the first sim card or the second
SIM card so I'm going to go into the
messaging application and here's
something that's kind of neat you
probably can't see it let me zoom in on
the screen but you can actually keep
track of which account you're using to
send the text messages for example on
this one from jon rettinger there's a
one but on this one from this guy
appeared there is a two and that's how
you know who you are getting the message
from so if I tap on this person and I
reply
and I type a message and I click send I
get an option to use sim card 1 or sim
card too so overall I'm generally
impressed with how well the acer d x 900
can handle two phone lines whether it's
receiving a call and being able to tell
which phone line it's going to or making
a call and being able to tell the phone
whether you want to go on line 1 or line
two that said it would be nice to be
able to differentiate better between
line one and line two perhaps the device
could allow you to designate a word like
home work personal business so that you
know you're getting a phone call to your
business phone rather than to line two
so if you're looking for a two line two
SIM card device you don't have many
choices and the and though the acer d x
900 does a really good job at handling
to two phone lines at once as we're
going to find out later in the software
tour this device has issues with
software in terms of lag eNOS of
software and other build quality issues
that we're going to talk about so we'll
be back next with the software tour
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
