Pacquiao com we recently took a look at
the hardware of the HTC droid incredible
so in this video we'll be giving you a
glimpse of some of the software you can
expect out of verizon's latest Android
device I think you'll see that HTC has
worked hard and finding ways to enhance
the Android experience through the sense
interface widgets and other
customizations they have done a
fantastic job and it really seems to go
a long way in making the experience more
enjoyable for users so let's get started
so first off we have HTC's custom lock
screen which displays the time date and
notifications if you have any let's drag
this far down to unlock and we're
instantly greeted with this amazing
weather animation for current local
conditions right now we have some clouds
but if it was raining you'd see
raindrops if there was a thunderstorm
you'd actually see some flashes of light
mixed with the clouds it's really an
awesome unobtrusive way to keep updated
with the weather so starting at the top
we have HTC's combo clock and weather
widget let's go ahead and tap on the
clock and it pulls up these handy time
related tools notice the sweet looking
slider down here at the bottom for
navigating between all these items
you'll actually see this a lot because
it's something you can find throughout
the sense experience as you drill into
different widgets and programs so right
now it looks like we have a clock for
your desk moving over we can look up
times throughout the world settings for
your alarms a simple stopwatch and a
timer so a really nice way to move
through all of these different tabs here
so let's go home and we'll click on the
weather we get this nice extended view
of the weather
and if you had more cities added you can
go ahead and flip through those let's go
back again so here we have the calendar
widget and we can pull up the next
appointment or clicking on the date will
actually bring up this beautiful
calendar right now it's a month view but
we can switch to agenda and if we go to
menu we get some other options like week
view let's go home down here we have
some shortcuts here's the messaging app
and again this nice slider for all
messages text messages and picture mail
or voice mail let's go to mail same
thing with that received conversations
group unread and attachments people for
all groups online directories and call
history so rather than having a simple
app tray like on stock android 2.1 HTC
has this a larger menu bar the app tray
can be pulled up from the left and the
dialer can be pulled up from the middle
let's go ahead and go home and the +
button will of course add different
widgets shortcuts and folders of course
you can add delete or move widgets and
shortcuts around seven different screens
unfortunately this can get a little
tiresome because there are seven screens
instead of five like on android 2.1 the
stock version of it so HTC has decided
to add a new feature called leap so if
you pinch on any of these screens you
actually get this nice little overview
of all seven screens at once now you can
jump from one side all the way to the
other side so it's very convenient so
for people who like one-handed usability
there's good news HTC has also made it
so you can access the leap feature by
pressing the home button when you're at
the home screen so again really
convenient for users that are big on
one-handed usability so let's go to the
first screen and will actually take a
look at the rest of the HTC widgets here
is the weather widget and we've seen
what it looks like inside of the weather
program so let's slide over this is one
of my favorite widgets which is the text
messaging widget and we get the preview
of the message with functions to reply
to or delete the message right from this
widget we can flip through all of your
text messages drill into the messaging
application or compose a new message
slide over same thing with the emails we
get the previews and the functions at
the bottom we've already seen these
here's a large finger-friendly widget
for bookmarks
and here's a new widget called french
stream which is basically like HTC peep
which I'm sure you've heard of if you
happen it's a HTC's Twitter client this
is actually not only for Twitter but
this aggregates also Facebook and Flickr
into this nice stream of updates so
let's actually go into here and here we
have all updates status updates photos
and links let's go over here here we
have the music player so we can cycle
through the different albums and songs
let's go ahead and tap on it we get the
nice cover flow view and here we have
again the sense interface to sort
through artists albums playlist songs
genres composers and purchased okay and
those were widgets that I had set up on
my layout of sense I wanted to go ahead
and show you some more HTC widgets so I
cleared out my screens and I'll click
the plus button go to widget and we
already took a look at this bookmarks
widget but we can get another view it's
more of a traditional list view of
bookmarks so that may be a choice for
some people same with a calendar we have
a larger calendar view here's an agenda
view and the view i was using
and here we have some clocks there's the
one I was using there's a travel clock
compact clock and a bunch of analog
clocks to round them out HTC footprints
this is for geotagging photos and
viewing them through the widget I'm not
sure if anybody still uses this but it's
an option french stream mail and
messaging widgets the music widget
here's one for notes you can write on a
notepad and then flick through all your
different notes let's go back to the
widgets here's a widget for contacts you
can have this large grid for your
favorite contacts or you can slide over
and pick this one column favorite
contacts widgets if you like photos
here's a photo frame widget or even
better you can use the photo album and
you can basically flick through all of
your photos this guy kind of looks lost
let's go ahead and tap on one and we get
to view our picture album I kind of wish
you could use the 3d picture album you
get with android 2.1 but this isn't so
bad
let's go back to widgets and we'll go
down here's a google search bar here's a
widget for stocks there's a large view
smaller view and an even smaller view so
here's a tip calculator today in history
here's HTC peep the Twitter widget and
the widget for weather and finally with
so many different features to choose
from it's really hard to pick that
perfect layout so that's why HTC has a
feature called scenes which you allows
you to set up different layouts and save
them so right now we're on custom one
let's go to custom too and as you can
see I set up an analog clock I have a
different live wallpaper and of course
you can add different widgets and
shortcuts so if you have a layout you
like during work hours you can set that
up and then when you come home you can
switch to something you set up for
leisure time or maybe for the weekend so
that about does it for the tour of HTC
Sense interface although android 2.1 is
perfectly usable in its stock form i
think HTC brings it up a notch with some
very stylish and cool features that's it
for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
