comparisons are now live Apple sends out
their official invites for WWDC and
android 5.0 key lime pie is rumored to
be delayed I'm hi meri beta and after
too many days editing our galaxy s4
videos this is pocket out daily let's
start the day off with some apple news
the company has just sent out their
official invites for WWDC to happen on
jun 10th and the reason why this is hot
is because almost every iphone has been
launched at this event though the past
two generations were launched in the
fall and if we don't get that we'll
probably just get iOS 7 and well given
the fact that some cook just came on
their results call yesterday and confirm
that we're getting new products by the
fall we never know iOS 7 would be good
enough at least now let's move over to
hcc the company has just issued a
software update to their HTC One to
improve the ultrapixel performance we
haven't been able to confirm this just
yet so if you've got an HTC One please
confirm the comments down below but I'm
the bad news site apparently new
unconfirmed rumors state that the One X
has reached its end the software updates
we know that Peter Chou just came on
record recently saying that the HTC One
X is getting sense five point out but
that doesn't necessarily mean we're
getting key lime pie so I'd sell that
phone if I were you now let's continue
talking about Google apparently the
company is working on some sort of
gaming platform and we'll probably see
this happening at Google i/o the problem
is the untrusted source has not been
able to confirm it we will be getting a
gaming console like the Xbox or will be
getting something close to Game Center
just for Android whatever the case may
be there are a lot of people that play
games on Android anyway so a game center
a game console it doesn't matter let's
just hope that the games from Android
work on this thing and this is not
another nexus q and speaking of google
and google i/o we've got some other
unconfirmed reports that apparently
android 5.0 probably key lime pie will
be delayed esperance launched at Google
i/o and given the fact that the event
happens next month we have seen cases
where microsoft announces something in
january and launches it in november so
it could be the fact that will get an
announcement of the software will
probably get a couple of demos of
unfinished
software and then get it by I don't know
the next couple of months so stay tuned
as these rumors unraveled but this is
not very like Google usually they
announce something at the event and
they'll actually give devices with the
software to developers right there so I
wouldn't holds himself on that and
finally for the hot news of the day yes
it's taken us a while to be back on the
air because we've all been under embargo
with the whole galaxy s4 we've got a ton
of coverage we've got our full review
we've got a comparison with the HTC One
in comparison with the galaxy note 2 and
with the galaxy s3 and we are not done
yet we've got a full more week of other
coverages coming on this phone and so
far well it's been a good phone it just
hasn't been as groundbreaking as many of
us were expecting it to be so that leads
me to the question of the day are you
getting a galaxy s4 right now or are you
still thinking about it in my particular
case given the fact that i've got a
galaxy s3 and a galaxy note 2 it's kind
of hard to think of the galaxy s4 is a
great upgrade but i'm probably thinking
of the HTC one now so leave us a comment
down below which is your next phone of
course it's always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet achieve follow us

youtube channel as well you can also
