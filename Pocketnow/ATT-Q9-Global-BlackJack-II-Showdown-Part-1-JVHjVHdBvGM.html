pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video showdown between the q 9
global on the blackjack two both on the
AT&amp;amp;T network both very similar devices
in the same kind of price range but
there's going to be one true winner at
the end of this first let's compare the
devices the q9 is definitely thicker by
thicker I mean wider so if we kind of
stack them this way you can see that the
q9 is actually a quarter of an inch
maybe even a half of an inch wider and a
little bit taller they're about the same
thickness but that's deceiving let me
show you why I'm going to take out the
battery of the blackjack to the massive
battery it's 1700 milliamp hours it's
huge and right now I actually have the
standard battery in the queue 9 and the
standard battery is pretty small it's
only 1130 milliamp hours now let's see
what happens to the thickness when we
put in the massive extended battery on
the q 9 this is 1800 milliamp hours even
bigger than the blackjack and so it
slides in like so and then it comes with
another cover that you can place on here
Wow and it should snap into place here
looks like it's stuck okay we finally
got the cover on mm-hmm now it's quite a
different story between the thickness of
the blackjack two compared to the q nine
whoops wrong back here we go now it's
the blackjack two is definitely the
winner here in keeping its thinness with
a huge battery so if you're worried
about the size of your device the q9 is
absolutely bigger if we flip over to the
back and you can see the all of my
fingerprints here on the q9 are on the
blackjack two I should say and the q9
has a rubbery coating on the back and it
feels really good in your hand when
you're typing because it doesn't feel
like the device is going to slip out of
your hands because it's really smooth on
the back both of these have stereo
speaker phones so down here there are
two speakers and up here there
two speakers the cameras are both placed
at the same place right at the top of
the phone although the q 9 has a flash
that goes on constantly if you turn it
on rather than flashing when you take
the picture the blackjack 2 does not
have a flash so let's go to each device
and take a look around the entire going
to clean it off a little bit so many
fingerprints and take a look at the
entire entire device here on the front
we have several dedicated hardware
buttons on the keyboard one for email 14
camera here for silent mode the black
check one also had these buttons
although they've added a few so here's
cingular video I'll never use that
here's another one for AT&amp;amp;T s homepage
I'll never use that either and you can't
change the function of any of these
buttons and we can see that the the
number buttons are clustered in one area
rather than being spread apart as with
the original blackjack and here we have
a rotary thumb wheel in the front
instead of one on the side these buttons
to our very fingerprint prone they are
the same layout that you would find on
the original blackjack the d-pad is much
bigger thankfully if you had a blackjack
one you know that the d-pad was very
difficult to press because it was so
tiny you would often miss press it when
you went to go and hit one of the soft
keys so that's good turning over to the
side we have a slot for a proprietary
Jack a volume up and down button nothing
on the bottom on the other side is a
slot for the microSD card these these
flaps by the way are more resilient than
they were on the original black check so
I don't anticipate these falling off and
a power button at the top on the cue 9
of course we have the fantastic keyboard
much larger than the blackjack 2 we have
some dedicated hardware buttons two on
the bottom I love this this is a
shortcut to your speakerphone so instead
of having to hold hold in the the green
button for two seconds you can just
press this I found that to be a very big
convenience you have a shortcut to the
camera button music application and some
other things over here
for phone book and calendar this is
absolutely unnecessary and I wish I
could change the function of this this
also takes you to the ATT home page
again something I would probably never
use because there's nothing there that's
useful to me turning over to the side we
have another proprietary jack but
Motorola is smart they give you a
converter jack that converts to mini-usb
very nice and further they give you a
converter jack to a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so that you don't have to
use proprietary headphones as you do
with the black jack the motorola was
thinking there on the bottom we have an
ATT branding on the other side we don't
have a scroll wheel if you've noticed
that this isn't a scroll wheel this is
actually the volume up and down button
but you can use it to scroll through
pages and it goes kind of slow so I
really wish this had a scroll wheel
here's a back button and a select button
on the top we have nothing I'm not sure
what that is it looks to be possibly a a
hole for your for a lanyard so you know
doesn't fall off when you're holding it
and that is the q9 so to wrap up part 1
here I want to choose a winner which
phone has the best hardware based on
basically an aesthetic standpoint and
the answer is the Black Jack to its
sleeker it's sexier without the need to
to make the back larger by adding an
extended battery because it comes with
the extended battery it's not as wide so
it feels better in your pocket and it
feels better in the hand it really does
as you'll find out soon the keyboard on
the q 9 is far superior to that of the
blackjack two but you can't have
everything right I just wish that they
had used a different coding on on the
blackjack 2 because as you can see it
gets dirty quite fast and you may want
to carry one of these around with you to
keep it clean although sometimes that
doesn't even work alright that's part
one see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
