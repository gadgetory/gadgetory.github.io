pocketnow.com and we're gonna do
something a little bit different this is
called the pocket knife throwback we're
gonna take a look at the old eye pack
3650 which may look familiar to those of
you that have been using windows seee
based devices like the pocket pcs of
many many years ago this is actually a
nine year old device that came out
obviously in about 2000 and it really
set the world on fire in terms of
bringing handheld computing power to a
small device like this this was a
revolutionary device today obviously it
is pretty much worthless doesn't have a
phone as a slow processor if you let the
battery die on this device all of your
data is erased they change that model
later in the years in Windows CE II but
this model has that old version of the
Pocket PC operating system Pocket PC
2000 is what they call it so in this
video series we're going to take a look
at how Windows Mobile has changed how it
really hasn't changed and take a look at
one of the devices that really started
it all in terms of the handheld space
that is now huge and is really
characterized by smartphones so let's
take a look at the size of the iPAQ 3650
the HTC Touch HD if you've ever held it
is a large device it feels large in hand
it's very wide it's pretty thin but it
feels big in the pocket because the
screen is so large next to the iPad 3650
de Touch HD actually looks pretty small
if we stack them up we see how much
wider the eye pack is and obviously it's
a whole lot thicker this is not a pocket
friendly the device but in 2000 when it
came out it was amazing that you could
fit a computer the size of sort of your
hand but much larger inside your pocket
and even next to a device like the
samsung omnia to the iPAQ 3650 looks
much bigger so in terms of
specifications this is running a 200
megahertz strong ARM processor it's
obviously got a QVGA resolution screen
that's 320 down and 240 across as
mentioned it runs the Pocket PC 2000
operating system it's got a stylus up
here
it has 32 megabytes of RAM and 16
megabytes of ROM let's take a look
around the device down here we have a
d-pad which actually doubles as a
speaker and then we have a cue button I
don't know if that does I kind of forget
a back button and it looks like a
calendar and a contacts button over here
is a button to record voice notes that's
where you've charged the device and
here's the syncing cable and you can
have these expansion sleeves for the
iPad to do a variety of things you can
actually attach a PCMCIA card that you
use on a laptop to your iPad using a
special connector that probably people
that use the eye pack had on the other
side there's nothing and on the top we
have a little button that shoots out the
stylus which is plastic non collapsible
we also have a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack a lot of devices today still don't
have that so that was a quick look at
the iPad 3650 we're gonna do more video
coverage actually turn it on go through
the applications and see what the Pocket
PC operating system which is the
precursor to Windows Mobile looked like
back in 2000 when this legendary device
came out we'll be back soon with more
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
