different on a phone that comes
pre-installed with Facebook home I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
this is facebook on the HTC first the
HTC first announced a few weeks back at
the facebook event in california
officially went on sale friday April
twelfth the device although not marketed
officially as a facebook phone so to
speak is the first to come with facebook
home pre-installed when you power the
device up for the very first time it
appears no different than any other
Android smartphone but the typical
Android setup process is interrupted by
a prompt to login to your Facebook
account and once the initial setup is
done you are brought to your home screen
a gorgeous display of your facebook news
feed and all of your friends recent
activity scrolling to the right reveals
friends updates one at a time with a
related image as the background for
example if a friend shares an image to
facebook that image becomes a temporary
wallpaper for your home screen if a
friend shares a link or simply text with
no image their cover photo becomes the
background visually facebook home is
gorgeous and it has a way of naturally
boosting your level of facebook
interaction if you like a status or
photo simply double tap the home screen
and a large thumbs up logo appears
commenting is only a tap away as are
your notifications tap in the lower
right corner on the status activity or
in the lower left corner on the comment
logo to leave a comment tap on a blank
space on the home screen and your most
recent notifications will appear
bringing up your notifications also
reveals your own profile image which can
be dragged upwards to open the app
drawer to the left to quickly open
messenger or to the right to open the
most recent application facebook was
sure to make every interaction super
simple and fun everything is just a tap
or slide away the application drawer is
quite simple there are two states a full
app drawer and your favorite
applications the user is able to arrange
and set up the favorites list as they
please and the app drawer itself lies to
the left displaying all the installed
applications above the user defined app
drawer sits three quick compose Facebook
shortcuts status photo
or check in
the other new addition to Facebook's
growing list of mobile services is chat
heads built into the facebook Messenger
app chat heads or pop-up conversations
that freely float atop the interface in
any application a new Facebook message
comes in and the cinders face appears in
a bubble on your phone's display tap the
chat head and the entire conversation
loads wherein you can reply and carry on
a conversation without ever having to
leave the application you were
originally in tap the head again to
minimize the conversation and if the
chat head gets in your way simply flick
it to the other side of the display to
close the conversation flick the head
towards the bottom of the screen where
the ominous x button will pull it in and
disappear if you close a chat head by
accident don't worry you can reopen an
old conversation by opening facebook
Messenger long pressing the conversation
and selecting pop-out chat head you can
have up to five chat heads open at once
and minimizing them will collapse all of
them on top of one another it's a very
quick and simple solution for carrying
on a conversation while doing other
things from your phone and it's
certainly quicker and less arduous than
switching back and forth between apps
officially Facebook home is available
for download for only six devices the
HTC One the One X the One X plus a
samsung galaxy s3 galaxy note 2 and the
galaxy s4 over the weekend however our
own Tony reported a hack by modaco that
enables Facebook home to be installed on
virtually any device in any region so
how is the software on the HTC first any
different from a device that doesn't
come pre-installed with Facebook home
the differences are quite small the HTC
first is only slightly more integrated
with the Android experience for example
the notification shade is mirrored on
the notification view of facebook home
meaning all of your notifications will
appear on your home screen with the HTC
first on say the galaxy s3 or HTC One
only facebook notifications appear on
Facebook home another minor difference
is the addition of a google search bar
in the application drawer on the HTC
first other devices do not have this
search bar in the app drawer if you're
an avid Facebook user there is little to
complain about with Facebook home
there's hardly a better way to enjoy
your friend statuses but even if you're
not a fan of Facebook it's hard to deny
that Facebook home is a bold move on the
company's part one that we wouldn't mind
seeing other services
apps make that's all for now and if you
like the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
and stay tuned for more HTC first
coverage there's plenty more including a
full review and comparison videos
throughout the next week I'm Taylor
Martin and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
