shouldn't throw stones but what about
people who carry glass phones I'm Joe
Levi and on this episode of the pocket
now power user we're going to talk about
the glass that covers your smartphone
tablet or wearable okay now power user
is a series of articles and videos
that's aimed at taking the average user
giving them information and bringing
them up to more of what we would call a
power user today's topic is glass let's
jump right in almost all of our
smartphones tablets and even wearables
have a screen on them of some sort some
are large some are small they all have
different things that they need to
account for watches for example need to
be a little bit more rugged and stand up
to being knocked against a wall whereas
a phone needs to stand up to the rigors
of being dropped into a pocket and taken
out several times a day I'll have
something in common you look through
them at the display beneath each one of
those displays has its own unique
challenges and its own unique way of
overcoming them so let's talk a little
bit about the materials that go into
those screens and the benefits and
disadvantages of each Christophe is
plastics plastics are relatively
inexpensive they're relatively easy to
make moldable into virtually any shape
and have a lot of beneficial properties
some plastics are even self-healing
though the self-healing ones aren't
transparent so we can't really use them
as a screen not yet anyway the advantage
of plastics are well endless they're
great but they're very very scratch
about almost everyone back in the
classical era of PDAs you know palm
Newton pocketpc almost everyone back
then either had a scratched up screen or
a screen protector and they usually had
a screen protector over scratched up
screen there had to be a better product
for it and in fact there was glass glass
is a great thing to look through after
all we're looking through a glass panel
at a screen on our mobile devices it
only makes sense that we've used the
same material that we use to look out
into the real world whether that's from
an office
building your home or even your car it's
glass glass is great it's very hard it's
relatively scratch resistant but it does
have some downsides it's more expensive
than plastic a little bit more limited
has to be substantially thicker than
plastic to accomplish the same job
scratch resistance is a problem there
are various different manufacturing
processes and brand names like corning's
Gorilla Glass 2 and 3 and every version
that they'll come up with after that
that adds some new level of scratch
resistance or other feature benefit to
their product other devices have non
name-brand glasses sitting over the top
of their display that try and accomplish
the same thing the downside they're
still scratch abul although scratch
resistant and just like the glass in
your car door or the glass in your
window they break they shatter and it's
not good sometimes it even causes
personal injury next up is sapphire now
as far as hardness goes we're told that
sapphire is like number two on the scale
of hardness materials number one being
diamond and I don't think we're going to
see a diamond display anytime soon
though that's not out of the realm of
possibility sapphire is significantly
more expensive than glass sometimes on a
factor of 10 to 30 times more expensive
what does that mean means devices that
are going to start coming out with
sapphire displays are going to come at a
premium cost the advantages sapphire
cannot be scratched and I'll put that in
air quotes by anything other than
another sapphire or a diamond hopefully
this means it will be the end of our
scratches realistically probably not
however scratch resistance is a very
good thing sapphire is a very cool line
item to see on a spec list but chances
are you're going to be paying for that
line item more than you're paying for
the benefit of the screen itself last up
or coatings coatings are some kind of an
application some material that is
applied on top of a screen that can take
the form of either an oil phobic type
coating which
shayla phobic means it repels the oils
that are naturally found all around us
we touch our devices with our fingers we
touch our devices with our palms we hold
our devices up to our faces and get oil
against them which causes smudges and
blurs and it's just gross oil of public
displays aren't friendly to that kind of
repels the oils and keeps your devices
from having smudges and fingerprints and
all kinds of stuff on them there's
another benefit to that I'll come back
to next up our antimicrobial and
antibacterial coatings these are
coatings that when applied to the screen
aren't friendly to bacteria and microbes
since we have these all around us every
day would be nice if we could keep our
screens nice and clean and not being
little petri dishes for growing icky
things on them if you keep your device
clean it's probably not going to be an
issue and this is more one of those
things that you just find on the line
item to help you feel better about the
device without doing all that much but
who knows maybe it's a good thing after
all these coatings whether oil phobic
microbe antimicrobial er whatnot they
also serve another purpose because they
are literally repelling things from the
screen when you have stuff that's the
technical term that would otherwise
scratch the screen these coatings stand
as a dividing layer between those items
and the display itself that means when
something is pressed against it it has
to go through the coating and down into
the actual display to make that scratch
with my nexus 4 that never happened that
oil a phobic coating did a very good job
at repelling more than just oil and
everything that would normally have
scratched it just slid across the
surface and off the other side and I
didn't have a problem with it some of
the later devices like the Nexus 5
haven't been quite as slick and I really
really missed that about the nexus 4 in
this episode of the pocket nail power
user we talked about the material that
covers your smartphone tablet or other
wearable it's only part of the equation

so you don't miss out on part 2 where we
go into the guts of what's behind that
class also if you liked the video make
sure you hit the thumbs up and while
you're at it why not tell your friends
about this series and everything else
that we offer on pocket now using any
one or all of your favorite social media
networks pocketnow helping you
understand what goes into the devices
that are in your pocket I'm Joe Levi
