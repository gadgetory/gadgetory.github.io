lineup and the price tags which are kind
of crazy we also got leaks of an oppo
phone with a record-breaking display and
also a knotch it seems that HTC is
trying to come back into the game sort
of I'm high metal Iveta and this space
you see here is that of a guy that just
got off a plane after a 10-hour flight
but has to get you the news this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with product launches for those of
you that have been waiting pretty much
more than enough for the LT variant of
the Microsoft Surface pro it is now
available for $14.99 and you're getting
a 256 gigabyte of solid-state drive a
gigs of ram we're talking about a core
i5 and obviously LTE capabilities I
don't know exactly why Microsoft took
this long but yeah the product is out
there right when this temp dragon always
connected computers are coming now let's
talk about the next generation Huawei
watch as well we were expecting to see a
product announcement with the P series
in Paris but it turns out that Richard
you just confirmed that there won't be a
SmartWatch not now
he didn't confirm exactly what in
according to him it's because there are
no rush and I still love my Huawei watch
classic I just can't wait to see a
refresh whenever Google figures that
part out
it's not about Oppo as the company
continues to bring innovation to its
main market of China and we've been
covering a ton of their phones mainly
because I love their FC Barcelona
variants but anyways we hear that the
company plans to innovate when it comes
to display it seems that we might be
getting an oppo r15 yeah I think we're
already buy r15 we are and the main
difference here is that we have a 90
percent screen to body ratio which
according to the source is going to be
something groundbreaking a
record-breaking which is odd because
that azusa zenfone 5 z pretty much has
the same screen to body ratio at least
didn't claim I don't think that's really
the case but anyways it's also got some
really great specification so you can
learn more in the description
when are we getting this phone is the
question and why are we all so getting a
notch like really and for those of you
that have been waiting to see what's
going to happen to
she see in the near future we didn't
really see anything in MWC but we've got
some sources claiming that there will be
an HCC u12 we can expect the
top-of-the-line specification Snapdragon
840 five six gigabytes of ram in
addition to a phone that starts at 128
gigs of storage options for 256 dual SIM
options as well we also hear of a desire
variant out there when when are we
getting the phone is the question we'll
see and finally the most interesting
news today has to do with the Huawei P
series the P 20 P 20 lights P 20 pro yes
Pro is apparently going to be the final
name according to a British carrier most
important we have price tags somewhere
around 600 something euro for the
regular P 20 then we hear that the pro
is going to cost the crazy 899 euros and
then the light is going to be costing a
crazy 369 euros huge contrasts and price
tag we're not exactly sure what the
differences will be between each of
these phones for me the most shocking
part is the price I mean Huawei hasn't
always been famous for hefty price tags
May 10 Pro being the exception so in
today's question let us know do you
think that the company is overdoing the
prices or do you want to wait and see
what we get for that to help you define
if it's worth the price or not leave us
