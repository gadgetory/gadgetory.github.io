what to expect for the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 speaking of galaxies the new
Galaxy Tab s 4 just went to fishel and
it has some interesting features and we
get alleged specs of the huawei mate 20
bro and that phone looks to rock I'm
high metal Iveta and would you look at
that we were celebrating New Year's just
recently and now we're already in August
stay tuned for more this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for Apple
products and reberty getting close to an
update back-to-school deals have just
begun at B&amp;amp;H and they are focused on
Apple particularly Apple watch Series 3
is $90 off if you're getting any iPad
pros those are 180 bucks off now I
depend on iPad pros for a lot of what we
do in the channel so yeah I have to
recommend them same case for the Apple
watch now let's talk about the honor no
10 as well the phone was just announced
today and we were expecting a
Productivity device and instead we get a
gaming phone care 970 processor options
for 6 or 8 gigs of RAM options for 64
gigs of storage or more probably the
craziest part are two things the battery
is five thousand milliamp hours which is
a first I believe four phone
oh my god the second is the price tag
the phone and Chinese currency is
starting at four hundred nineteen
dollars the equivalent and I believe the
most expensive is like 525 i I'm hoping
we got the numbers right cuz that's
cheap
that's crazy affordable for such a very
such a powerful phone like seriously now
let's talk about why way since we
already started talking about honor we
hear that the company is already working
on its huawei mate 20 pro and well the
specifications look crazy
keren 980 processor and this is not just
the number bump apparently this is the
seven nanometer process making it to
mobile devices I don't think it's even
available on pcs yet I believe this
would be pretty much the first seven
nanometer process processor in addition
to six IG's of RAM options for different
storages depending on whatever option
you get I believe it'll start at 128 and
then battery 4200 milliamp hour but we
also hear that there is wireless
charging
finally why away in addition to other
bells and whistles this phone looks like
a beast oh yeah in display fingerprint
scanner we're wondering if we get the
triple 40 megapixel camera options we'll
see now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s 4 it was just announced our
own Adam Lane was part of the
announcement we have hands-on photos and
everything you want to know in our
website and the link in the description
so far you would say yeah it's just
another Android tablet but it's not
actually what Samsung did here is
something genius you remember back in
the day when Google didn't allow Samsung
to play with the operating system when
it came to tablets well now that Android
tablets have pretty much died out it
seems that they're allowing Samsung to
use their decks user interface to be
part of this tablet so it actually looks
like a very good productivity tablet
here and that's the vault priced at $650
you can learn more in the description we
will keep you posted as soon as we have
a unit for content and finally the hot
news today have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 we continue getting leaks
we are just a few days away from the
unpacked event and I cannot wait to see
what we get
now there is a leaked video already on
the internet showing pretty much
everything we should expect from the
front it doesn't really look much
different to the current Galaxy Note 8
which is not necessarily a good thing
it's not that I didn't like it it was
just I don't know boxy and it's design
and then the back seems to only change
in the placement of the fingerprint
scanner which is okay in my opinion I
mean so long as it's reachable I don't
really care but anyways we'll see in the
end what happens for those of you
holding on to a Galaxy Note 8 just
remember this is probably the best time
to list it on swap ax as it's been
proven that whenever we're close to
events the value of phones is still good
enough for you to be able to get a good
resale value you can learn more about
that in the description as well and in
today's question let us know what do you
think do you like the design of the
Galaxy Note 9 or not again in my case so
long as it doesn't tear my jeans as I
mentioned in my after the buzz I'm fine
fine I'll buy better jeans leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
talking out our comment subscribe to
