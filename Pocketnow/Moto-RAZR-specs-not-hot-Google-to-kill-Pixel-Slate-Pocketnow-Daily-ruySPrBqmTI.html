which sounds kind of disappointing for
the type of device that they're planning
Google will be stepping down from the
laptop and tablet market to evaluate
their position according to what we see
and read is also reevaluating their
position and taking new leadership in
the hydrogen project
I'm Jaime Rivera and yes this is a crazy
week but it's Wednesday we're getting
close to Friday this is PocketNow daily
sponsored by the honor of u-20 the
official new should I begin with deals
if you are in the market for Hulu you
might want to use your Spotify Premium
account it'll pretty much give you Hulu
for free and it's from now up until June
10 I believe you can register so yeah
it's actually a really good service a
really good combo you can learn more in
register in the description now let's
talk about Apple and what the company
plans to show us in their show time
event according to trusted sources the
company is going to launch its own TV
streaming services and a lot of people
were expecting that for the billions of
dollars that the company has already
spent in original content it would
launch with a lot of it but apparently
according to the source no that's not
gonna be the case there's gonna be
little to no Apple original content
instead it's going to push a lot of HBO
stars and everything and then eventually
it'll evolve to whatever we'll see later
so I don't really understand what the
benefit is here now let's talk about the
red hydrogen one that phone that I
actually am not complaining that I
didn't get a review unit for because of
nobody really liked it it was wonky and
well Gingin are just pretty much noticed
that up to the point where they're
pulling the plug from the red hydrogen
one actually they pull the plug on the
modules and it seems that the company is
working on a whole new device so for
those of you that spent a crazy amount
of money on that phone Adam Lane
included according to Jim Jannard they
will take care of you at some point
hopefully the experience is better than
how long it took them to sell the device
now let's talk about Google and well
their tablet project Chrome OS and
everything it seems that the company's a
department in charge of this is now
being asked to look for other positions
temporarily within Google or alphabet
and that's rather sad I mean the pixel
book is probably one of our favorite
computers of last year well two years
ago but then the pixels light was not a
lot of us really really wanted to love
this product and just didn't so it seems
that they want to reevaluate themselves
and I find that really interesting
mainly because we were expecting fuchsia
OS and the future of Chrome OS and so if
anything this is not the time to do that
but we'll see why and finally the
hottest news today have to do with the
Moto razor a device we also want to love
but I don't know man
we've got some leaked specifications
apparently the code name is Voyager the
file name will apparently beep the razor
but the problem is once you look into
the specs holcomb Snapdragon 710 with 64
128 gigs of storage four or six gigs of
ram and then the display has got this
like weird resolution and then the outer
display is another weird resolution and
you know that's all fine I mean I could
put up with that we've got that out
folding design and everything the part
that I don't understand is when you get
this like premium mid-range spec device
being priced at $1500 according to the
source let us know in the comments what
do you think I mean do you think that
this product will actually be worth it
or not because I my god if we've got
medium range specs on such a hefty price
tag I think it's gonna be dead on
arrival where we've got devices like the
mate X which surely is 2300 but you've
got 5g and all the best specifications
so I mean come on man this is me let us
know what you think in the comments down
below and folks this episode of the
pocket out daily is sponsored by the
honour view 20 this is proven to be one
of our favorite phones of the year
thanks to a gorgeous and unique back
design a whopping 48 megapixel camera
that brings an awesome night mode along
with an ultra clarity mode for better
photos in all scenarios it's one of the
first with a time of flight center for
state of the art 3d sensing and better
portraits it was also one of the first
with a hole-punch design and a selfie
camera and one of the smallest we've
seen in the market priced this plus it's
powerful here 980 processor just $600
and this is why it's really hard to beat
