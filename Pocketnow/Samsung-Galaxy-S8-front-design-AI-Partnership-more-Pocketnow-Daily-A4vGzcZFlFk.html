ations of the samsung galaxy s eight
companies have decided to bring some
order into the future of artificial
intelligence and Facebook has just taken
a dr plans to the next level I'm high
meta data and according to my older son
line natural highlights are kind of
getting in the way of my reporting this
is clocking out daily the official dish
today begin with deals if you are still
debating if the next I've has are going
to be announced soon use deals to know
that we've got a very interesting one
from bestbuy where you can get an ipad
air 2 150 dollars off but there's a
catch that means you'll have to get it
with applecare+ meaning you'll have to
raise one hundred dollars on the price
tag but then again you get two years of
warranty accidental repairs you name it
it's actually worth it but it's only a
fifty dollar deal that I would still
recommend even if the next iPads are
around the corner and fine I got a lotta
name and correct right portuguÃªs is not
my first language but for those of you
that were kind of shocked over the news
of him leaving Xiaomi including me well
it's just been announced that he is
joining Facebook the company is taking
its VR plan to the next level with aloe
vera and I'm actually very optimistic
over what's coming although hasn't made
an amazing job at both Google and show
me I can't wait to see what the company
brings the first time that Facebook t is
what they're doing with VR it was at
that Samsung Galaxy s7 haven't unpacked
i was there personally up let's see what
this company brings to the table because
vr is kind of a niche products bill now
the fact that oval left shall me is kind
of being shown and the fact that the
company is not going to be available at
mwc and this is something we don't
understand i mean if shown me is
expanding internationally lwc is the
place to be so apparently we are not
getting anything meaning there is no me
mix the pro variant that we were talking
about the updated version with
Snapdragon 835 and everything apparently
we're still gonna have to wait for that
and that me six that was also being
talked about a couple of days ago is
also going to wait could it be that the
company's plan
something exclusive for Joe and as for
other interesting news set your
browser's two partners on a i dot org as
we've got companies like Apple Google
Facebook Microsoft all joining forces
and controlling the future of AI it
seems that they want to avoid the whole
Terminator thing and this is not a skype
plug or anything but yes it does make a
lot of sense for these companies to look
into how a I can fit in society and how
it can't as you rarely see anybody
talking to theory or talking to the
Google assistant why because it is kind
of weird for you to be doing that in the
subway and finally the very interesting
news they are again of the samsung
galaxy SI because that's the hottest
phone that's big announced soon we've
heard rumors renders we've seen leaked
images that thing looks gorgeous but
apparently there are some changes
obviously there won't be space for the
navigation keys that is going to become
a software button and that's something
google has been asking for and like
forever specifications are also being
listed and rumored it seems that we're
still sticking to four gigs of ram and
hey if sam stein can figure it out great
i just i don't like how the galaxy s7
edge performs right now so i would
suggest boosting the ram samsung but
anyways probably the most interesting
part are the display sizes we hear five
point eight inches on the small galaxy s
86.2 for the larger variant that thing
is going to be a behemoth but then if
you think about it with the screen to
body ratio no bezels it makes sense it
leads me to the question of the day you
think that's a smart move for the phone
to get so large when it comes to the
display size if samson can figure out a
way to make it petite in my case I would
say yay I want to see that thing then
