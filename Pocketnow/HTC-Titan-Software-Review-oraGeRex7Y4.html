pocket now calm the HTC Titan is the
first Windows Phone 7 device to come out
with a faster than 1 gigahertz processor
it's got a 1.5 gigahertz processor it's
a Qualcomm Snapdragon does that mean
it's smoking fast in this video we're
going to find out we're also going to
cover the software on this device talk
about web browsing speed and all that
good stuff relating to software let's
get to it
the HTC Titan is a big device as we
found out in the hardware review and
we'll put a link up on the video now and
at the end of the video if you want to
jump back and see everything about
specifications and size and all that
good stuff it's got that 4.7 inch screen
which is absolutely huge
but largest we've ever seen for Windows
Phone 7 and it really brings video and
pictures to life but it's also a little
bit of tiny bit grainy if you have very
good eyesight because the pixel density
is low what HTC did is they stretched a
screen with the same number of pixels
effectively making the pixels bigger but
again it's not that big of a deal unless
you have incredibly good eyesight and
you can see pixels usually on whatever
phone you're using right now so let's
talk about Windows Phone 7 here and talk
about how fast this device is in terms
of web browsing and gaming and all that
good stuff Windows Phone 7 is always
fast so the 1.5 gigahertz processor is
just icing on the cake it's of course
not clocking at the full 1.5 gigahertz
at all times
you just have that extra 500 megahertz
for when your device demands it previous
Windows Phone 7 devices all of them were
clocked at 1 gigahertz so again you get
that incremental 500 megahertz there so
of course Windows Phone 7 buttery smooth
this is the mango version so we get fast
app switching when we tap and hold the
back button plus we get a lot of little
tiny enhancements pretty much everywhere
one of my favorite here is is the Scout
feature so wherever you are it will pull
up a map of places to eat these places
to drink things to see things to do
places to shop and highlights just a
really cool feature here that makes
using the device all that more
interesting especially when you travel
and you're trying to find the nearest
place to grab a bite for example let's
go back to the Start screen of course if
we select swipe to the right we get the
new search tool and so we can search for
HTC apps for example and here are three
HTC apps that come on the device and we
can go to the HTC hub you've seen this
before just a really pretty weather
display that shows you the forecast and
you can click on various days and get a
more granular forecast and if we go back
over here and search again we will
see the other HTC apps like HTC watch I
got to tell you the 4.7 inch screen
makes watchin videos really fantastic
and the the fact that the loudspeaker on
the Titan is extraordinarily loud
compared to other devices makes it all
the better we just wish that there was a
kickstand on this device because you
really want to prop it up on a table a
lot maybe you're showing your friend a
YouTube video or you're using HTC watch
to rent and on-demand movie
so here's HTC watch got that beautiful
Metro interface and we're just kind of
flipping around on trailers and what we
can do is click on a trailer and we can
watch it and of course if you have HTC
watch you're able to download and rent
on-demand movies for three or four bucks
depending on the title and as you can
see the quality is great the sound is
great a fantastic device for watching
movies really smooth really high FPS
here everything looks good the colors
are crisp and clear with the super LCD
screen they did a good job with the
display and so let's go back to the
Start screen now we're gonna get into
some gaming so let's go down to games
you know with with a higher speed
processor you should see improvements in
gaming so let's go to fruit ninja and
see if we see some good things there and
you can watch this in full time to see
how fast it is it's relatively speedy a
little bit choppy at times
oddly so it's pretty smooth it doesn't
seem to be as smooth on an FPS basis
then say you get on Android or iOS but
it's still quite good so let's go back
let's play another game real quick just
you can get a sense for them the gaming
prowess here so we'll go into games
let's play kromagg rally
kind of a classic racing game one of the
first to come out in the era of apps by
game
all right here we go let's play some
kromagg so quite smooth not a dramatic
improvement over what you get on say a
Samsung Focus or an HTC surround you
really get to experience the faster
speed when you're in the web browser
we're going to jump into that next and
you can get a sense for how fast things
get in the web browser because they get
very very fast certainly so let's jump
into the web browser here and it's gonna
open Engadget let's close the tabs and
start fresh and we're going to bring out
the galaxy s2 which in our tests has the
fastest web browsing performance we're
actually going to run it on opera mobile
because Opera Mobile has better
performance than the stock browser in
most cases so we're really going to put
the HTC Titan up against the best of the
best so let's go to engadget.com
and we'll just go to HD engadget.com
since it's there in the memory and we'll
get this guy pointed there too there we
go let's see which gets there faster
both over the same Wi-Fi network it
looks like we got a little stutter there
and we'll actually have to bring this to
the desktop version ok now we're on the
same page so we can move down the page
on both see very buttery smooth let's
get to the same image and do a pinch to
zoom very smooth on the galaxy s2
extremely smooth on the the Titan it is
like a butter if I can borrow that
analogy and we're going to click on this
headline at the same time see which is
faster and they're both off a little bit
slower on the first response on the
Titan and watch the progress here and
here okay the galaxy has to finish first
there here comes a Titan not too far
behind actually you can flip flick down
the page and we can see all of the
different images you can zoom in very
smooth indeed very big browsing
experience here on the Titan thanks to
that large display
let's zoom in and get another try speed
boom okay galaxy has to finished first
here pinch-to-zoom very smooth
pinch-to-zoom
not as smooth actually as the Titan it's
just it's just incredible how smooth it
is on the Titan that feels potentially
better than the iPhone even which kind
of invented this pinch-to-zoom thing but
just very very smooth let's do one more
link here and to test the speed before
we declare a winner here in the web
browsing performance category at the
same time gonna watch a progress bar up
here and down here finished first on the
galaxy s2 not too far behind on the
Titan so the Titan is absolutely no
slouch when it comes to web browsing
when you get the page actually loaded
that's where the Titan really shines
that's where things get extremely fast
the pinch-to-zoom is fantastic moving
around the page to go into landscape for
an even wider view it just it gets even
better than that because you can see
more more width there so fantastic web
browsing performance definitely that 1.5
gigahertz processor gives it a leg up on
say other Windows Phone 7 devices that
have a one gigahertz processor so high
marks indeed for web browsing on the HTC
Titan the large screen makes it even
better because you can just see so much
on the screen in such a large area
that's something else we want to cover
is the camera because HTC has done some
unique things to the camera who launched
the camera through the camera app but
why not just press the dedicated camera
button here on the side and you've seen
I've pressed it and nothing's happened
well finally something's happen a little
bit of a delay there when you press the
camera button even when you're inside of
the camera application I'll show you an
example let's take a box here it's the
Kin box and we'll take a picture of it
and I've pressed it it's got a little
bit of a leg and you really didn't see
it right there but there have been a lot
of missed moments because of shutter lag
I think it just has something to do with
the button on the tight
but who knows maybe it's a software
thing we've got some cool feature so we
can switch to the front-facing camera so
hey how you doing let me go back to the
rear facing camera we can go into
panorama mode which is really well done
actually and this is kind of an HTC
thing it's a panorama shot so I'm going
to move the camera up so you can see
what that looks like so just a really
crude demonstration here you'll line it
up with the horizon you press the button
you say hold you move it to the next dot
and it will automatically take the
picture when it's arranged at the next
dot and before you know it you get a
really cool panorama you can actually
show you one I've taken already and so
here's a panorama I took earlier just
look at how beautiful the color is
the sky is crisp and blue the trees are
green it does a really good job with
panoramas photo quality in general is
actually kind of mediocre which is which
is a shame because HTC really touts the
camera on the Titan it's 8 megapixels
it's got autofocus it's got all the
bells and whistles but when it gets down
to it the photo quality isn't that good
the 720p video quality is is mediocre as
well you'll see full camera and and
picture samples in the upcoming review
on pocketnow.com be sure to check this
site for that
so overall the Titan is a great Windows
Phone 7 device it's fast just like every
Windows Phone 7 device the fastest mango
device you can buy right now it'll be
out on AT&amp;amp;T in the US but if in your in
the UK or in Europe you can buy it
unlocked right now for about 410 British
pounds which is around 650 dollars you
can get it over at clove cote UK if you
liked this video please give us a thumbs
up and be sure you watch out for the
four of you on pocketnow.com coming up
soon the HTC Titan might very well be
the best Windows Phone 7 device out
there right now and of course that could
change tomorrow thanks for watching
that's it for now
