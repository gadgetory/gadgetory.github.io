pocket cast podcast that's a lot to say
three words we should shorten it next
time on the line is a guy you've been
waiting to hear from on a pocket casts
show Levi our Android experts say hi Joe
hey everybody how you doing awesome and
yeah so this is fun if I sound a little
bit more clear today that's because I
got one of those snowball microphones
they're so big they're the size of like
a softball and I know it's gonna stop
him here but I say this but they also
smell really weird Joe how does your
microphone smell I'm lucky enough to
have my microphone built into my laptop
and honestly I've never had the urge to
smell my lap we're good there but on the
snow front yesterday we had like 60 70
degree weather out here and last night
we got like two three inches of snow so
hey welcome to Utah so why did you why
did you move to Utah or did you boil it
there I grew up here my whole life this
is home I've got lots of places but i
always keep coming back here very good
um I wanted to elaborate on the smell of
new electronics do you know that certain
smell when you get a new laptop or a
phone and it's got that smell yeah it's
all the stuff they use the manufacturing
process off gassing giving you cancer so
is that anyway you may not want to smell
stuff that closely really usually when
they run a PCB through like the
soldering process they it's really cool
process to watch they kind of solder
everything all at once they stick all
the little components onto the board and
then they run it through a big soldering
bath and solder sticks where it's
supposed to and doesn't where it's not
supposed to and then they have to go
through wash off all the extra stuff
that might have stuck where it wasn't
supposed to and when you start running
into electronics that all gets nice and
warm and evaporates off and that's the
kind of ozone II smell that you you have
when you first open a new product and
start using it
man I should stop sniffing uh phones
phones and glue two things you shouldn't
say well yeah anyway so let's talk about
phones shall we um so we've got a lot of
things to talk about here and we're
gonna start off with something that we
posted about on 28th of March about you
know Apple's Worldwide Developer
Conference is coming up on june six and
there will be a keynote of some kind but
it may not be for the iphone 5 it might
be for iOS 5 that's something that
everybody's kind of leaning towards uh
it's gonna be a little bit of a letdown
for a lot of the fanboys out there who
always expect to see new hardware new
components new whatever at these key
notes but you know we've been seeing iOS
updates go in just incremental points
for 142 and whatnot to see a jump up to
iOS 5 there's got to be some more magic
inside that build than than in the four
points that we've been seeing in the
past so even if we don't see new
hardware i think you know big jump in
operating system version will likely
include some some neat toys and
hopefully some stuff that the apple guys
out there have been waiting quite a
while for yeah that's a that's a big
that's a really good point that the jump
to five point 0 is really leapfrogging a
lot of the sort of interim versions that
are usually reserved for small feature
upgrades but going to five it kind of
reinforces the idea that my head feels
just got unplugged that will see a new
kind of notification system and maybe
some use of the home screens um which
makes the question Joe you are not in an
iphone fanboy however I'm sure you
equally get very excited when this time
of year comes around and the new iPhone
comes out no absolutely you know i'm not
a big apple fan at all and that comes
across my writing and I kind of like to
to make fun of the other side and I
expect that the other side kind of makes
fun of me too and it it's just a nice
fun banter but the thing we've got to
remember is Apple changed the game
and they're really really good at doing
that both with you know smartphones and
tablets and desktop computers so even
though I'm not a big fan of their
solutions I'm a fan of what they do and
that's pushed the entire playing field
forward that's windows mobile that's
windows phone 7 that's Android that's
android tablet they're the ones that are
doing the driving and making all of the
rest of the players stand up and take
notice and not rest on their laurels and
then and then you've got android which
has the most amount of market share
right now so at what point do android
phones start influencing the next
generation of iphone or is that just
thinking about it differently well i
think and i kind of hope that we'll see
this with iOS 5 android has really
pushed the user interface we have
widgets we have you know a lot of neat
things on the smartphone version of
android we've got an entirely new
interface over on the tablet version of
android and it kind of input that in
comparison with what we have right now
and where I OS came from and iOS is
looking a little bit old it's looking a
little tired and it needs a refresh so
I'd kind of like to to hope that we're
we're going to see some major UI changes
and hopefully some widgets support in
iOS 5 and I think that'll be a cue
they're taking directly from Android and
to a lesser extent the live tiles from
windows phone 7 you know widget seems
like a good evolution but I want to see
them do something better than widgets I
mean there are problems inherent to
widgets which of course they sometimes
don't load in time they use cpu cycles
they wear down your battery life when
you have a lot of them it wouldn't
surprise me if Apple sort of leapfrog
the concept of widgets but what do you
have after that I think that's the
perfect question widgets fill a hole
that was left out in an apples big list
or big grid of icons this kind of been
become synonymous with what iOS
is widgets fill that and yes there are
some inherent drawbacks because
essentially with the widget you're
either running a full version a full app
or at least a miniature version of that
app that can tie into data and that does
take up cpu cycles and that does take up
you know some some screen real estate
bigger than what just an icon does but
what is there what's next I really don't
know live wallpapers and widgets
together maybe could have some kind of a
love child that Apple has got their
creative minds wrapping all the the
creative juices around to see what they
can come up with but that's a question I
really don't know I can't answer how
would that look if you were to interplay
live wallpapers of widgets well the the
downside really to live wallpapers is
you can have a live wallpaper that does
one thing and that's it that's all a
live wallpaper does it so it's a white
it's a wallpaper that has some level of
interaction interactivity to it if you
take a wallpaper and whatever that is if
that's a you know a picture of your kids
or your dog or just a nice landscape
picture and you add some type of context
awareness to it so that then that that
wallpaper that background and it doesn't
really become a wallpaper it's it's more
of another layer to the interface can
then be aware of whatever you want it to
be whether that's whether we're less
traffic your friends who may or may not
be an online or offline view of whatever
type of chat or instant messaging method
you want to use or somehow brings all of
those together and kind of just subtly
lets you know all of this information in
a somewhat ambient kind of way rather
than right in your face with a little
notifier on your icon or overall widget
you know doing that elegantly and
simplistically so it's really something
someone can pick up and get what it's
doing that's the hard part and if they
can if they can pull that one off I'd be
really impressed I think you either just
defined
a really new and interesting way to
think about a smart phone home screen or
you just described widgets or a little
bit of both you know which it is very
very specific in what it does and a live
wallpapers very specific in what it does
but if you could combine those two into
you know like I was to coin a phrase I
guess would be an ambient aware
background layer if you will I think
that may be a natural evolution of where
we're going this might be a good
editorial to write by the way I'll put
that on my list nice yeah that's an
interesting idea um let's uh let's jump
to the next topic so we're talking about
the xperia play we reviewed it this week
hopefully you all had a chance to see
our review dan webster gave it a 4 out
of 5 sort of to summarize he what he
liked about it was a good battery life
you could actually play real PlayStation
games on it the stereo speakers were
allowed which is rare for a phone of any
kind the screen was big it was bright
the software was stable but he didn't
like about it it was the front-facing
camera was kind of crappy the scream was
plastic which is amazing um its large
and heavy and game selection is limited
at this time and then we ran a story on
April first and this wasn't an april
fools unlike most of the other things
post on that day and with word that sony
ericsson is going to launch 60 titles 60
playstation phone if you will specific
titles and I mean it's pretty impressive
the selection of games or at least the
quality of the games because the
selection is kind of bad right now but
you can legitimately play playstation
games on your phone I'm trying to look
for the list that Dan has here we go
crash bandicoot fifa 10 * battalion the
sims 3 that's it's just really
impressive stuff Joe do you think this
device with its ability to play
playstation games under a plastic screen
is going to be
it's going to be big well yeah
absolutely a couple things we need to
keep in mind we're coming from a PSP
which was a relatively large relatively
heavy device and a lot of that was
because it would played optical discs
Sony just they're trying and trying to
get the mini disc to take off i renamed
the UMD renamed the in whatever and
that's what we had in the PSP well the
PSP had a lot of features and a lot of
capabilities and one of those was the
ability to connect to Wi-Fi and in fact
to run skype which then kind of opened
the door if you can run skype over Wi-Fi
on your really your portable media
player then why not make a playstation
phone so taking that in mind you know
we've got the xperia play which is just
that it's it's essentially a phone that
has playstation but or PSP capabilities
built into it now it's a first
generation and i think they're still
trying to figure out exactly where that
the happy medium lies is this more phone
than it is a portable portable media
player and a game player or is it the
other way around and for a first stab at
it you know they have some some growing
pains that they're obviously going to go
through but I think they've got a very
solid device up front I'm going to pull
some words out of my my apple hat here
it's a first offering and they don't
want to give everybody everything in
that first offering whether that's you
know to try and sell more of the second
generation device or whether that's to
find out what to put into that second
generation device do that that may just
be semantics but for what they have now
it's a very solid platform it's a good
direction and whatever the second
generation devices is going to build on
that and I think all of these
shortcomings that we see in this device
are going to be gone away with the with
the Xperia Play to or whatever it may be
call yeah this was obviously somewhat of
an experiment and you can tell by the
sort of how it was leaked in the
beginning and then it
announced a lot much later and now it's
got an identity crisis is it is it more
so a gaming device or is it more cell
phone I think where they got it right
though was designing this to make to
look kind of like a PlayStation a PSP I
mean when you slide out that gamepad its
character Harris what's that word
characteristically uh-huh
characteristically a PlayStation device
I mean you see the triangle the X the
zero or that should circle a square and
I think they got it right with that and
it really makes a compelling I mean
picture you know going to a coffee shop
seeing some some teenager or some 40
year old guy what have you playing with
this thing I mean it's going to turn
heads especially if you're a game well
yeah there's a lot of brand recognition
that centers around not only the
playstation portable but also around
just play station in general the control
pad is the same just adapted for the
platform for both the game console and
the portable and they wanted to carry
that trade dress over on to the xperia
play as well it makes sense for them to
do that and again finding out how that
how that works out you know obviously
it's built on android so it's a phone
first and a a game station second but
that really is just in the details you
can modify the interface and make
adjustments as need be to to cater to
whatever it is the audience wants all
right so let's move on the next thing on
our list Sprint is officially opposing
the acquisition of t-mobile by AT&amp;amp;T duh
you know if if this happens Sprint will
be the smallest carrier right now their
number three out of four what will
happen to sprint do you think Joe if if
this goes through well I think you hit
it right on the head with the the hold
da moment Sprint is in my opinion
they're kind of backwards with
technology sprint and verizon both
they're both cdma which seems
more like the history than the present
and we know that there were some rumors
that t-mobile and Sprint are in talks
regarding a merger and we just kind of
scratch their head and wondered how that
might work out a GSM carrier and a cdma
carry carrier and how that could
possibly work out in in any stretch of
the imagination but the question you
know what's going to happen to sprint I
think sprint being an underdog is really
going to to excel you know they've had
their their ups and downs they're going
through some growing pains and some some
political internal wrangling with wimax
but their position to be the company to
go to if you don't like one of the big 2
which is really all it's going to be you
know down to you know you're going to
have AT&amp;amp;T NT or AT&amp;amp;T mobile whatever
we're going to call them and then
verizon and if you don't like either one
of those two who else is left you've got
one of the little teeny tiny carriers or
you've got sprint and sprint right now
they've got really good devices I you
know they've got that wimax that if they
can get over the clearwire problems
could really be the go-to place
especially with their unlimited
everything plans that they have lined up
in fact I think I'll I'll see quite a
few t-mobile people go over to sprint
just because of that do they like going
to the underdog and they like the the
feeling that they have in dealing with a
smaller company than just being lost in
the crowd when you're with the nation's
largest it's so funny how long
perceptions last sprint used to be sort
of a laggard they had no interesting
devices and then they came around with
this $99 everything plan they were first
with that and then they started to do 4G
first they had the evo 4g which was a
big hit and all throughout 2010 they had
some pretty cool devices and into 2011
they're gonna have the evo 3d which
everyone is going crazy over there going
to have the kyocera echo which we're
going to laugh about in about 10 minutes
they're going to have the the nexus s 4g
a really great phone + 4g it's even
better
so sprint kind of has a has a bad rap
and and you know well let's not forget
will also see sprint coming out with a
new iteration of push to talk over cdma
I you know all of that what was it the
next hell next technology yeah I mean
we're gonna have that on Android devices
coming out pretty soon which is
something that hasn't been done before
and really that's something that I don't
see any of the other big carriers is
having a me AT&amp;amp;T had a push-to-talk that
really didn't go anywhere so if you want
an instant connect sprint may be your
only option did you do you know anyone
that still uses push to talk do I have
any friends that use it or have ever
used it I'm not that I'm willing to
admit but you know I've done quite a bit
of work with all kinds of different
contractors as far as you know wiring
whether that's telephone when that's
internet even electrical and all those
guys seem to have push to talk on their
phone it just seems to be the technology
that guys who get their hands dirty
actually hooking up all the stuff that
us geeks use that seems to be the tech
that they go to and they like well then
they've got to be taken care of those
are truly the ones that are hooking up
our our lines I remember back in high
school when my friends and I were
starting to get cell phones most of them
got nextel phones and that chirp sound
was the most annoying thing and I never
could understand why they wanted their
conversation to be public I didn't care
what they what they were talking about
in the middle of class or its you know
if they didn't have recess in high
school they had lunch um but it was it
was so annoying and I think since you
know five years ago the push-to-talk has
become a very niche product for people
in the construction industry especially
management and not so much you know the
the teenagers the the people like you
and I who can communicate quickly with
other methods yeah I mean when you're
talking about dispatching someone or a
group of someone's to do a job
uh when you have that bulk broadcast or
it's very simple you push one button and
you're talking to your entire team that
was kind of a tongue twister but when
you've got that functionality it that's
what else does that you might be able to
send a group text but for somebody who's
working with their hands they can easily
listen to their phone but they can't
necessarily pull it out of a holster on
their hip and and read a text message
and then reply to it you know if they're
in the middle of spice splicing a cable
or hooking up a power line or whatnot so
there's that niche and I don't think
it's going to go away and we might see
that continue to grow especially now
that it's coming to cdma and it's coming
to devices we presume that have
operating systems that the rest of us
use yeah I guess I guess it's one of
those features we're kind of like video
chat where it looks it can be cool on
paper under the rice right use case
scenarios but of course the other people
that you're communicating with have to
have that same capability on their phone
well not only that but you have to have
your hair done just right and for the
female listeners they also have to have
the makeup done before they answer the
phone so that's something that not
having a picture broadcast kind of helps
out with do you use video chat by the
way outside of the experimentation that
that I've done for my videos the only
time I have non video chat was over the
Google Talk gmail plugin with my
mother-in-law and that was more just to
to get it up and running for her so she
could talk with her brother who's out of
state so they could keep in touch it's
not on their phone she doesn't have a
phone that can do that but she can do it
over a computer and that's that's really
the only experience practical experience
that I've had and you know outside of
business trips where you're away from
your family you know I don't see it as
being a real big necessity for that
you've got your laptop yeah um and this
is certainly a digression from what we
were going to talk about but it's
interesting because they've had video
chat in Europe for so long and Tony that
who writes for pocket now of course has
used video chat in the past and I've
grilled him on this back in 2005 2004 I
was fascinated so what happens when the
other person wants to answer but they
don't want to show their face and all
these kinds of questions and at the end
of the day he said he seldom seldom used
it and it's just it's just a thing that
doesn't it doesn't make sense it's the
most probably inefficient way that we
can communicate with a mobile phone
unless you're traveling on business as
you imply or as the Apple commercials
try to try to create an experience
around you know baby's first step or you
know see the look on grandpa's face when
he sees the baby being born it's just
there's not many use case scenarios oh
yeah absolutely and that was that was a
sentiment was mirrored by a lot of our
readers who are commenting on some of
the articles that we ran this has been
around in Europe and Singapore and in
other places for quite some time and it
really came into vogue for you know a
month but two months six months maybe
and then okay great the network can
handle it the novelty's worn off let's
move along but then over here in the US
where we haven't had that our networks
haven't been able to support it now all
of a sudden it's it's new it's neat it's
fantastic until we really get our hands
on it and then you know it just isn't
all that phones our phones and they're
there to to talk on or to text on it's
really not a video device and maybe
we're in our infancy and will grow into
it or maybe that's just something novel
and unique but to your point about the
the baby's first steps I've got a
smartphone on my hip right now that has
a 720p video camera on it why am I gonna
do a video chat and not record that on a
video that I can put on YouTube or
Facebook and then keep that for forever
why do I want to have that moment just
lost that's a good call yeah you do kind
of lose the moment I guess the idea is
that you use it for four instances where
the situation can be sort of recreated
but that's not how it's really portrayed
in the you know the facetime commercials
what i got an iphone 4 back in i guess
it was jus
of 2010 I stood in line for 11 hours not
that that's relevant to the story but
it's just shows how crazy I am and yeah
what's that Metro's devotion oh yeah
devotions devotion of pocket now uh my
friend and I got he was there with me
that day he pre-ordered so he was out in
two hours and we we facetimed a little
bit in the beginning it was really cool
it was so futuristic just like the Apple
promo videos advertised but then then
the awkwardness hidden I I would call
him you know on a Monday morning with
the facetime turned on and his face
would pop up he'd be in like his pjs
with his hair messed up doing he was
doing work and you know he he looked
awkwardly into the lens said uh you know
it was just that it wasn't a good
experience past the novelty so do you
think that we are going to see cameras
go away from the front of smartphones in
the next few years I think that the
front facing cameras going to be with us
for the foreseeable future and I think
that's gonna stick around primarily
because right now we don't have video
calling we have video chat whether
that's FaceTime whether that's one of
the other services i like to call it
kick some people call it quick it's just
video chat it's not it's not really
video calling for example we're using
skype right now and when you called me i
was given the option to either answer
you using keyboard or answering after
using the microphone which is what we're
doing now or answer with a video call so
if you're presented that type of
interface when someone calls you where
you can answer with a video call or
answer with a you know just an audio
call i think and especially once it
becomes ubiquitous so me on an android
you on an iphone we can both talk across
separate networks using this video
technology as part of a telephone call i
think that's really what it's going to
take to make it become mainstream but
we've got so much marketing hype around
it now that's not panning out i wonder
if
that will ever become a reality yeah
that's really key cross compatibility
over network so do you remember when
Steve Jobs said that facetime would
become an open standard so other
companies can use it absolutely and I
thought this would be great for Google
with their their video chat
functionality to be able to tie into
that like they tied in with AOL Instant
Messenger and I don't the open standard
I think means that you can use it on a
mac too yeah I I feel like they actually
truly intended to make it available to
google motorola and all those other
purveyors but something got in the way
kind of like the white iphone for
something that in a way it could be or
they may not have had enough unicorn
bones to grind up to make it work haha
alright well let's move on to the next
topic here I might actually jump to the
kyocera echo um so the key is sec
kyocera echo landing on April
seventeenth it's my birthday and I
turned 40 and haha just kidding and I I
was really curious about whether anyone
was excited about this device and I
don't know if you saw Joe but wirefly
did an unboxing of this a couple of days
ago I haven't seen their unboxing yet
but for those of us who aren't familiar
with the the echo of course that's not
including me um what makes the echo
stand out above all the other devices oh
you're asking I'm asking you so that our
listeners can know as well the echo is
the first okay let's let's do a couple
first year it's the first smartphone
from kyocera to run android and i'm
ninety-five percent sure of that it is
the first duel screened android phone um
I think I'm running out of first so it's
got these two screens we looked at this
when we went to the launch event I went
with Adam in February or something like
that and the device was interesting in
concept but very poor in execution the
build quality is poor the thing was
unreasonably large thick heavy hard
edges the phone
now he was clunky they're going to open
up a some sort of software developer kit
so that developers can take advantage of
the split screen functionality anyway
it's it's a cool concept that makes
headlines for sprint and for kyocera and
for Google and Android but I was curious
if anyone's gonna actually buy this
thing and so I sent out a tweet recently
I said is anybody you know pre-orders
start on April seventeenth is anyone
going to pre-order these are the answers
I got the first one was hell no second
one was now um the next was no why have
two screens um next one nope does not
look promising next one is nope nope
nope and here's a here's one plan on
picking this HD split this then you make
sense Oh plan on ditching the HTC hero
for the echo so that's one yes um
somebody just replied with the word
sprint which could mean many things
here's one I got my echo reserved I'm
not in 4G land and I think the phone is
going to be what I need the echo is not
not 4g so overall the consensus in our
unscientific survey of pocket now
Twitter followers is that it's not going
to be that popular of a device and it
kind of makes sense well what do you
think of the the echo based on what
you've seen Joe well other than desktop
computers dual monitor or multi monitors
really haven't picked up you know if I'm
sitting at work and I have code on one
side and an article on the other side
having two screens really make sense and
it it's nice it's logical it's easy to
split my work up across the two when you
talk about on a laptop with an auxiliary
display I know Microsoft tried to do
that it really never picked up they
built the API it's in windows vista and
windows seven but nobody has really used
in fact outside of the launch event i
don't think i've seen a single device
that uses that auxiliary monitor thank
you madam light show right I or side
shine show yeah
which all kinds of cool stuff that you
could do that nobody does we even have
an Android device that has a secondary
little screen down at the bottom that
you know nobody's really picked up and
the reason is it's not standard on a
smartphone it's not standard on a laptop
up until very recently it wasn't
standard on a desktop in fact still at
work I'm on one screen because corporate
can understand why I would possibly need
to have more than one screen to do my
job so now you talk about the echo which
is a smartphone that has two screens
that they can do some cool stuff first
of all you can flip that thing open and
have a soft keyboard that's kind of like
a physical keyboard but not which kind
of negates the utility of it in my
opinion the reason I like having that
physical slide out keyboard is for the
tactile experience which this isn't
gonna have it's still going to have a
nice big screen to be able to type on
but it's not going to have that tactile
response so that's one potential that
they could really hit but I don't think
they're gonna do well which leads me to
the the last really Pro that I have for
it and that's this could potentially be
a tablet in a smartphone form factor
when you fold that thing open you have
two screens that are essentially you
know about the same size as a small
tablet so you can start getting more of
a tablet based interface and possibly
even a honeycomb-like interface where
you have one screen devoted to say a
list of items and like Gmail for example
where you have all of your inbox listed
and then the other screen devoted to
just showing the one selected item the
current email for example so there's
some potential there but again the API
isn't part of Android it's something
proprietary and you have to code
specifically for it to be able to use it
which is something you've got to get
buy-in from developers and speaking as a
developer you know I really unless I'm
being subsidized by the cell phone
manufacturer sprint I kind of question
whether I'm going to get any paid act
for the time that it takes for me to
figure out how to do that do it
elegantly
and then actually coded into to my app
that hardly anybody is going to use
because that's just one phone out of a
sea of many yeah this the API situation
or SDK whichever is the right
terminology it's a very fun PR thing to
do for a company and if you look back in
history a lot of technology companies
have offered an API or whatever so so
that the the third party developers of
the world could you know deploy their
resources and everyone could contribute
and it would be great but I think
developers are smarter than that and
they realize that this is one device on
one carrier with a company that has no
track record on a on a device that looks
half baked and so they're not really
going to spend much time working on it
that said I think that if you
fast-forward two years and you task HTC
with making a device like this so two
screens four inches each maybe super LCD
qHD resolution so if you combine both
displays you get doing math you get 1920
by history ridiculous 1920 x 1080
resolution I hope my math was right ah
you've got dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor with a dedicated GPU a really
thin form factor perhaps the displays
are even flexible who knows and they've
they've modified the software so deeply
to where you can literally run one app
simultaneously with another the echo
sort of does this it puts one of the
apps in hibernation mode unless it's a a
special kyocera app so i think given the
right circumstances which we don't have
really the capability for 2011 a dual
screen android phone could be awesome
imagine Joe looking at your email on the
bottom screen while browsing the web on
the top screen I mean it's it's that
same dual screen paradigm that that
makes desktop computing with two
displays so highly productive absolutely
or even look at two different
communication media where you might be
looking up an email and chatting with
someone else
or if you want to take things over to
the scientific realm of the
xda-developers hey you've got two cores
here you can partition awesome space why
not run android on one screen and
Windows Phone 7 on the other hey what
would be the advantage to that can you
imagine side-by-side comparisons on the
same device that was oh it's one of
those white because we could I devote
one operating system to one core and the
other to the other one and you know
you're gonna have some problems getting
to the cell phone radio or the Wi-Fi
radio or whatnot you know but we figured
out GPS sharing so maybe we could figure
out some some type of sharing between
those but just one of those cool things
that maybe you could do it or maybe even
iOS on I'm one of the screens wow you
really go and fire out there oh I'm
curious as to why iOS hasn't been ported
to anything really as it Apple has
really good lawyers I mean that's that's
the big thing you have mac OS that has
been out available on some non apple
hardware but every time you get somebody
that does that they get shot down I this
recent turn it took quite a bit quite a
bit of time before they finally had to
pull I forget the name of the company
you remember off the top of your head
hmm I just yeah just some generic
desktop computer company who was buying
legitimately licensed copies of Mac OS
and installing them on their generic
hardware and Apple eventually shut them
down because to make it work they had to
bypass a copy protection scheme so why
haven't we seen iOS port it to anything
else i I'm pretty sure it can be done
but the people that are doing all these
ports and all this hacking really are
anti apple and i don't mean any offense
by that but you know the only reason
that they'd want to do that is just to
tuck under their belt that they had it
all done that they did it that they
could be the one that that accomplish
that and I think those types of people
are more interested in all the various
jailbreaking apps and utilities to to
unlock the iOS devices and make them do
what their competition can pretty much
do out of the box hmm that makes sense
it's just it's curious that we have seen
you know windows phone 7 on an hd2 and
no one's selling this stuff obviously
it's just it's provided in the community
and yet no one's ventured to do iOS on
an hd2 for example granted it might be
because as you imply there's not that
much love for for apple products in the
hard core developer community but we can
fund it fuzzy I think that's a challenge
to anybody out there listening see if
they can do it that's right that's right
all right let's move on um there was
news on 30 March like to read the date
backwards sometimes that the the HTC
Thunderbolt had been overclocked to 1.8
giga hertz now Thunderbolt has a single
core Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 8655 and
I've got a I've been using the inspire
4G a lot and I know that that can be
overclocked what is your experience with
overclocking and what's the fine line
between gaining performance and killing
your battery all right so let's get some
mod some history overclocking with
desktop computers which one we're
talking smartphones today's smartphones
are pretty much desktop computers that
fit in your pocket when you overclock
the desktop computer in days gone by you
have to do an awful lot of deep down
nuts and bolts heavy hacking you had to
adjust voltages and frequencies you
usually have to do that with jumpers or
with switches on the motherboard I
remember with some AMD's who even had to
draw a pencil line between two two
little dots on the top of the the chip
itself and that graphite trace was just
enough to bridge those two connections
to unlock extra voltages that's me not
yeah it just blows you away but the
reason we did that is you had a
processor that ran at a specific speed
and that was
what the manufacturer released its new
but we started to learn that
manufacturers were putting out generic
processors generic cores that could
handle other stuff they could handle
other frequencies they could handle
other voltages and run significantly
faster than than the one you bought so
essentially you could buy a new one 88
hundreds processor and run it at a
gigahertz or or even twelve hundred
megahertz without a problem I'm just a
little bit more heat and of course she
ran the risk of a frying components if
you did it wrong so if you fast forward
it to today talking about this in
smartphones these cores these processors
are not just a CPU like you think about
in a desktop machine it's not just one
chip that you're overclocking whether
that's with frequency or voltage of both
it's more of a system-on-a-chip where
you have these one or two chips that
handle everything on on the device and
they're really made to be extensible so
when we talk overclocking on a
smartphone generally speaking these
these components are designed to do that
they're designed to have a wide variety
of frequencies at which they operate and
to operate it a relatively wide variety
of voltages and by doing that you can
sell one component to a dozen different
manufacturers who stick them into their
phone and do radically different things
with them and that's not necessarily
overclocking when the manufacturer puts
that chip in their device and another
manufacturer puts the same chip in their
device but they both have different
speeds and different capabilities and in
specifications but now they're running
the same chip but when we talk about
overclocking what I think about is more
you've got your device you want it to
run faster and that gets back to the
core of your question first of all I
overclock almost every device that I own
every smartphone at least my g2 sitting
over here is running at 1.5 right now
and it came stock at 800 on I'll come
back to some trade-offs that
has in just a minute but my wife is
running a nexus one and that came out at
one gigahertz and she's running it a
little bit shy of 1.2 so not that big of
a clock difference but you know it's
enough to make a noticeable difference
in performance so getting back to the
question performance is increased
obviously the faster you run something
and I'm going to put a little asterisk
after that battery life is generally
decreased when you run something faster
especially if you're over voltage
something you're putting in more volts
to get more speed you're going to chew
up your battery life faster now coming
back to the asterisk when you are
running something faster generally
speaking it takes less time to do
whatever you're trying to do so it has
to spend less cycles running it and
theoretically you could have a
performance savings there as long as
you're not throwing more power into
doing it than that then what your
payback is so the other little sub note
there is we're getting to the point
where our processors are fast enough
that we're outpacing the operating
system or the apps that we're running so
even overclocking almost double what
came with that g2 originally I'm not
seeing that much practical use you know
we've got a lot of very vocal readers
out there who who either like or dislike
running benchmarks utilities for a
variety of reasons but in practical use
I don't see that much performance
difference between 800 and 1500 even
though that's almost double in speed so
coming back around to battery life what
I've done is I've got my phones both the
nexus one and the g2 set up so that they
are dynamically scaled they will clock
up or down depending on demand which
adds a little bit of overhead there
because you have to wait for that demand
hit before it scales up and scales back
down but I've got my device over here
set to run at 256 megahertz at the low
so when it's just sitting there idle
it's running really really really slow
and that extends my battery life out
significantly but then when I need the
extra
boom out of it when I'm loading an app
or when I've got a very
resource-intensive app it can scale all
the way up to 1500 and go from there so
if you're smart about overclocking
especially now that there are apps the
app that I use is called setcpu for root
users and I think it was what three or
four bucks so not not much at all when
you're using an app like that you can
set it up intelligently to mitigate any
battery loss that you'd have by running
that processor faster than it was
designed to do with running it slower
than it was designed to do as well in
fact you can also go in and set up
profiles and this is the other half of
overclocking it usually generates more
heat than stock you can set up profiles
that will monitor how hot your device is
getting and scale back the speed as it
gets hotter and hotter and hotter it
will start running slower and slower and
slower which is actually something that
I believe they took from Intel pending
force who will dynamically scale the
speed of the processor down when they
start to get hot yeah I was gonna say
don't the the modern chips for
smartphones of today the snapdragons and
the ARM processors don't they already
scale on the flight I they don't scale
so much on the fly as far as I know and
I'm sure if I'm wrong one of our
listeners is going to let us know from
what I understand it's something that's
configured by the manufacturer and they
kind of lock that into place
traditionally inside the colonel that's
why we do so many articles on when a
manufacturer releases their kernel
source code into open source so that
custom developers can go out there get
into that kernel and they can start
messing with those voltages and
frequencies to to start either
overclocking underclocking or open up
the ability to do it dynamically through
an app like sex you can you write all
this is making me want to really see at
what point my device starts to melt you
know I like I said I've been running
this g2 all day long what from about six
seven o'clock this morning and here we
are in mid-afternoon and I've streamed
some pandora
I've listened to some apps or some apps
some music over the amazon cloud player
app you know I used ways on the way to
and from work and on the way to and from
lunch and I still have 36 odd percent of
my battery life left the phone itself is
a little warm but you know it usually is
after you've been running GPS anyway so
overall overclocking Fermi's worked out
really really well and and on a cold
night you can snuggle up with your warm
smartphone yeah you just launched a
really resource-intensive app a game or
whatnot and you can just tuck that thing
into your shirt pocket and it's great
interesting well we should remind
everyone that in order to overclock you
need to root your device which is
slightly risky but if you've got a
little bit of patience i'm sure you
could figure it out quite quite easily
not only that but overclocking if done
wrong or even done a little bit too
aggressively can literally burn out your
components not just your processor but
it can overheat your battery which
theoretically could lead to explosive
results so this is one of those use it
your own risk and kind of be smart about
it not that I'm trying to pimp the app
but setcpu for you root users has a set
of built-in profiles it will actually
detect what device you're using and if
it's got that in its database it will
automatically set up the the minimum and
maximum scaling for you just so you're
going to be less likely to cause
physical damage either to the device or
to yourself so a good idea would be to
use the avoid explosion profile and
set-piece cpu they don't have that just
yet but I think we're gonna send an
email to the developer to to include
that as a profile would be great very
good well that's very interesting stuff
let's move on to Firefox four-point-oh
for Android Joe do you remember the
early days of fennec absolutely I
remember fennec on windows mobile and
yeah that's how far back it goes and how
excited I was to finally not have pie
pocket internet explorer on my windows
mobile device in fact I think back then
it was a an AO 7 or in a 701 by some
company I don't even remember anymore
but they sure have come a long way
haven't they yeah it's it's so funny
because how often is it that a company
releases a new product and starts at at
version four point oh not one well yeah
they have to fit in with everybody else
really when you look at at Chrome
desktop Chrome is up to version 10 in
fact they were at version 9 just a
little while ago and we did some math
and it was just ridiculous in the next
two years I think they should be up to
like version 27 if they keep this
development cycle going I can't wait
before yeah version numbers are just
ridiculous anymore but coming out with
Firefox 4 for the desktop browser and
Firefox 4 for mobile browsers was kind
of coincided so that they could have
some co-branding there you know you're
running Firefox 4 on your desktop or
laptop you love it it's great and by the
way there's also a lighter version of
that that you can run on your mobile
device too it's like Windows Phone 7 and
Windows 7 yes absolutely it really
should have been windows phone one
shouldn't it it should have been yes so
that the browser is interesting that I
like the tabbed interface the way you
swipe to the right to get your tabs a
big problem I think with um mobile
browsers is that they have yet to
capture the ease of tabbed browsing on a
desktop what I like about the inspire 4G
and any HTC Sense device is that you've
got that really cool pinch gesture that
will zoom you out to the the tab view
but performance in that tab view is
really bad so they've got half of the
equation right but here in firefox four
point oh very easy tab management you
can add plugins it's not the fastest
browser even though they're claiming it
to be I you know we did test and it
wasn't not that you know they were the
most scientific test ever but it's a
reasonable choice what what browser do
you use Joan you know I've used
almost every browser available for
Android out there and they all have
benefits and they all have their
advantages and specific use scenarios I
keep going back to the default built-in
browser which is a chrome variant and in
my video of browser browser which is
chrome versus I forget which build of
Firefox for it was but you know I
compared the two and as a web developer
I look at browsers that are very very
standards compliant and usually trend
toward those for my personal use and
Firefox was beating chrome hands down in
some cases Safari beat chrome hands down
but I keep going back to the ease the
simplicity and really the elegance that
is built into the stock browser and you
know HTC Sense devices use kind of an
HTC modified version of that stock
browser they're trying to improve upon
it whereas Firefox doesn't use that that
rendering engine at all they have their
own so it adds quite a bit of weight to
to the application it adds quite a bit
of weight to the what you have to
install on your device but they've done
phenomenally well and I'm glad that
there's competition out there at the
very least it's going to put Google on
report and let them know that there is a
more standards compliant browser
available for their device that is kind
of pushing the the user interface
envelope if you will they're handling
things a little bit differently whether
it's right or not whether you like it or
not they're doing things differently and
that has to be sending a message back to
Google letting them know hey you've got
to continue to innovate or you're going
to get passed up just like Microsoft got
passed up in the browser wars and
eventually Firefox being passed up with
low Safari and chrome as well and now
they're playing catch-up with firefox
for for desktop it's interesting that
you say that you you tend to use the
most standard compliant browser for me
it's all about speed I really can't tell
much of a difference
between how you know internet explorer
and chrome displays a page I can't tell
much of a difference between how firefox
four point oh four mobilen and chrome
for mobile display a page I'm just
curious to to know what other people
think about that whether its speed for
you or maybe it's tab management or
maybe it's flash everyone seems to you
know care a good bit about flash
although I find in using a mobile
browser it's easy for me to avoid flash
content and not to have a worse
experience because of that avoidance
well yeah absolutely um flash you know
again I'm a web developer and I think
flash needs to die a quick and painful
death however there's an awful lot of
Flash content out there so before
everybody gets all upset with me saying
that flash is with us and it's going to
remain I agree entirely and there is
definitely a place for it that current
technologies are trying to replace and
adobe is in all honesty doing a very
very good job trying to keep up with
those new technologies but like you I
like speed I couldn't tell much
difference between the two browsers when
I was running the benchmarks yes there's
a difference absolutely and that's going
to get us back into our benchmark debate
but it's for me as long as I have a
student significantly fast enough
browsing experience and as long as that
browsing experience is friendly enough
to me is the way that I think that it's
supposed to be I'm not going to know the
difference between one browser and
another and I really shouldn't it's the
same internet it should look the same it
should feel the same it should function
the shame but going back to flash I like
going into my browser and setting it to
prompt me if I want to play the flash
that way I have a placeholder I can get
into I can look at the flash if I want
to but I don't have to because flash is
really a desktop or a laptop experience
it's not a mobile friendly experienced
and Adobe still
working on that and I have to give them
credit for it and their latest versions
that the 10.1 and 10.2 have made some
significant advances they still have a
ways to go and by the time they get
there I think that a lot of other
technologies will come out that that
make flash less relevant but for the
time being you're absolutely correct we
have to have flash and any browser that
doesn't support it even if flashes in
the part of your regular daily diet
surfing the web you're going to miss it
if it's not there and they're going to
go to a browser that does support it or
dare I even say a platform that supports
it don't use such words Joe very very
interesting we need to wrap it up
because we're pretty much at the 60
minute mark we try to keep these around
60 minutes but thank you so much Joe for
joining us and we'll have to have you
back on the podcast in the in the near
future absolutely it's been wonderfully
fun and to everybody out there who's
been asking for me to be on the podcast
thank you for your words of support
they're very appreciated we just had
some scheduling issues that kept me away
from before and we're going to continue
to work through those and hopefully
we'll have half a dozen of us sooner or
later on the podcast all with a whole
bunch of different and varying opinions
and we'll all be talking at the exact
same time you so you won't be able to
hear anything but we can split up into
multi channels and then you can just
listen to whoever you want to are you
volunteering to do that way I'm willing
to listen to all the voices at once uh
fine all right well thanks everyone for
listening and we'll see you soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
