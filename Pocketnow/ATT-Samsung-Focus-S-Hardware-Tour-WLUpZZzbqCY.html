calm next up we're going to take a
hardware tour of these samsung focus s
now on 18 alright so first off for all
the specs i'm not going to just sit here
and talk check out the link in the
description for all the specs on the
focus s here and first we're going to
look at the benchmark results so here's
a windows phone bench and you can see
the focus s SGH i 937 is very high
scoring i'm going to show you next to
the original focus and let's look at the
display and see in the gradients we have
a little banding a little bit of banding
there and the colors looking pretty good
I think the original focus that's kind
of brighter a bit brighter over there
and let's look at viewing angles you
shouldn't see you too much color
changing there except for maybe the
reflection of the wall so that looks
like a really good display pretty much
the same as the focus s alright and
let's look at the hardware so there's a
lot of changes here with your screen
totally different design the new focus s
of course has fast processor we also
have a front facing camera up there and
pretty much the same buttons at the
bottom different shape on the side okay
volume controls the bottom of the focus
has of the micro USB port you can see
that their camera button power button
the top is the headphone jack and on the
back I still have to stick around just
so you can see tells you how to open it
up so you put your fingernail in there
and it kind of see how that peels it's
very bendy so that pops open as your SIM
card and your battery there's no microSD
card slot like the old Focus which I'll
show you here there's the old focus and
we slap there oh it is a different
battery
and there's your 8 megapixel camera with
a flash now this feels very similar to a
lot of the other Samsung devices I'm
just anymore here's the infuse 4g and
it's also very very similar to the
galaxy s2 now just for haha's let's see
how the screen compares with the radar
4g so even right here we can see that
the focus s display as much blacker
blacks and the HTC to this
but actually the grayscale coloring
looks a little cool right this seems
closer to the white let's look at the
whites
is your color gradients let's try this
one so overall really great screen on
the same time focus s as you would
expect from Samson some great features
one of the fastest windows phones around
and very nice and thin light device one
thing with the Samsung phones it feels
kind of cheap it doesn't bend or
anything but normally this is pretty
good build quality should be able to
drop it in it'll stand up to a lot
anyway that's it for a quick hardware
tour of these Samson focus s now
available on ATT it was a thumbs up like
this video and that's it for now
