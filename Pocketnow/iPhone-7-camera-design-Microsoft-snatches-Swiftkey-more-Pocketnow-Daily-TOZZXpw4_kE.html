detail on what to expect with the camera
HTC sales don't paint a pretty picture
but the company's forecast does and
believe it or not Microsoft has just
acquired or beloved swiftkey I'm hi Mary
vera and whoever said yesterday in the
comments that my name should be used as
a tongue twister was kind of right this
is parking out daily if there is one
company that's done a lot of really good
acquisitions lately and just hasn't
really performed that well afterwards is
Microsoft and don't let me even start
about nokia but then again not
everything has been bad and one of these
acquisitions right now that's a major
deal of swiftkey probably one of the
best keyboards out there for Android and
iOS apparently now joins Microsoft for
around 30 million dollars reportedly
we're not exactly sure but hey this
could be great for swiftkey or it could
be really bad stay tuned other very
interesting news about Microsoft have to
do with the company surface lineup we
heard that analysts weren't predicting
the company to sell more than 4 million
units as it turns out it seems that
there are as many as 6 million units and
these are just preliminary figures we're
not exactly sure but it's great to see
that surface is selling well I'm sure
the surface book has a lot to do with
that even with all the flag bugs that we
heard about these are still good
computers not necessarily just tablets
now a company that is not enjoying its
quarter results as HTC we did see a
positive slump a couple of quarters ago
but now they are down a hundred million
dollars in losses which is just terrible
we hope this does not mean that the
company will continue as a vibe company
and just completely kill the smartphone
business is no get that for example that
would be really unfortunate and
obviously it's hard to confirm but the
fact that we don't have any invites for
an HTC event to happen at mwc as of the
recording of this video is rather
concerning at a time when the Galaxy s7
is coming abeta and for those of you in
the market for the next generation Apple
watch we've got good and bad news if you
have a current Apple watch you'll be
happy to know that the next variant is
apparently going to be an S variant
meaning it will be an Apple watch s
better internals over the same design
which is a good thing there was nothing
really that wrong with the
current generation Apple watch when it
came to its design probably its
functionality was bad and if you had
better internals and that's all good
news we just hope that the price tag
changes at some point we will keep you
posted for that March event finally the
very hot news did they have to do with
the iphone 7 it's so great to breathe
away from galaxy s7 rumors this time but
the iphone 7 is the next thing out there
as we now hear two things that continue
gaining traction number one is that
apparently the camera on this iphone 7
will be flushed to its design which is
great news hopefully that means that the
phone won't get any thicker but even
more interesting we get more traction as
well over the dual camera possibility of
the iphone 7 plus which is not
necessarily bad news of apple is able to
pull that one off without affecting the
design which actually leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about dual camera designs we've seen it
for years in the past with 3d cameras
and then with the HTC One m8 and now
with the LG v10 in that dual camera
design at the front do you like this
design or not in my case I don't really
mind the design I just hate the fact
that it's never been implemented well I
wish somebody figured it out leave us a
