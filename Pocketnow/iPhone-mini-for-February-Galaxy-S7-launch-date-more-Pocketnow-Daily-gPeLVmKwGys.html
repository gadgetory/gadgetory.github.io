iphone mini launched new Galaxy s7
rumors also bring information on a
possible date and believe it or not more
customers keep ditching Android over iOS
I'm hi meri behna and how are you liking
the news earlier these days we'd love to
know in the comments down below this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Samsung as the company
has just announced its new Galaxy a7
galaxy a5 and galaxy a3 4 2016 and these
phones are not cheap change particularly
the first to the a7 and a 5 I mean they
got specifications that look a lot like
the galaxy s6 their designs look a lot
like the galaxy s6 we've got optically
stabilized cameras here 1080p AMOLED
displays we've got a fingerprint scanner
and options for samsung pay and
expandable storage we should learn more
about these phones by mid-december but
and these phones are really cool other
official news come from Motorola for
those of you missing those glory days
when you would get software updates even
earlier than nexus phones well it's not
the same story now but we've got
Motorola claiming that the Moto X 2015
should be getting marshmallow very soon
there are soaked tests being conducted
on the update and we should probably get
it by next week of all the tests go well
we'll keep you posted and moving the
spotlight over to rumors and returning
to Samsung the biggest question we have
is when are we getting the galaxy s7 and
even though we had sources that were
claiming that it would happen in a trade
show and then the rumors return to that
it would now we've got some very trusted
sources planning that it will happen at
a trade show but we're in specific as to
whether it would be CES or mwc whatever
the case may be the galaxy s6 was
announced at mwc so that is most likely
going to be the case and we hope so as
it would be rather cool and speaking of
hot phones that might happen early next
year the iphone mini is another one of
them and trusted sources claim that it
could happen in February but this is
where things get confusing as a these
rumors are actually talking about the
iphone 6c which would retain the 4-inch
display which might bring
different color options but we're not
exactly sure if it will mimic the iphone
5c or the iphone 5s this for things
again get confusing we should learn more
as rumors continue to evolve we might
even get two phones by the way and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with how many people switched
from Android to iPhones this year last
year was big news with the launch of the
iphone 6 10 cook made a big deal out of
it but even though Apple hasn't really
said anything we've got analysts
claiming that this is the year when that
happened most it seems that twenty six
percent of iphone 6s customers came from
Android and according to these customers
that had a lot to do with the iphone 6s
plus but it leads me to the question of
the day why do you think that people
continue switching from Android to iOS
do you think it's lack of stability do
you think it's lack of options because
if anything Android has a lot more
options than iphones but we would love
to know what you think in the comments
down below because i really can't figure
it out especially with the cool android
phones that we got this year friends is
always you know the drill if you want to
get the Rose earlier before this video
was filmed assure you follow was

YouTube channel as well and follow me on
twitter hein underscore Yvette are on
