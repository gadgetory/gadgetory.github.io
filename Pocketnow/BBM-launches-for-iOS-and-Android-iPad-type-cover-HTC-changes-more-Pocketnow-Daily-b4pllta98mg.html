that apple's event tomorrow emerge HTC's
chairwoman to give a helping hand to
Peter Chou and turning the company
around and yes finally you can all
download BBM on iOS and Android but
there's a catch I'm high memory vetta
and after inviting all my 1000 Facebook
friends to BBM it seems that nobody
cares about it anymore this is parking
out daily Lester's day off with the
official news is HTC's chairwoman chair
Wang which is also a company's
co-founders just confirm the she'll be
taking over turn of the duties of Peter
Chou in a way to help him out Xiao will
remain as the CEO of the company but
he'll be more focused on product and
engineering since he is an engineer and
then chair Wang will focus more on
marketing distribution which are great
changes it's great for the company to
actually take over whatever they can and
hopefully this will mean a good
turnaround for HTC next year and better
Robert Downey jr. ads next up let's talk
about nokia as the company is now lick
even more information of what to expect
for their nokia world event tomorrow and
so far we've got the Lumia 1520 with a
snapdragon 800 processor that thing is
going to be a beast but actually in the
full sense of the word because it's a 6
inch display phone and judging by Lumias
design this thing is not going to be
small at all which I wonder why but
still we've got some more leaks of the
nokia guru along with other things to
expect on the links down below so make
sure you read everything and hopefully
you'll catch all our coverage tomorrow
let's see what to expect from nokia now
let's talk about apple since we do know
that they're holding their event at the
same time as a nokia is for no
particular reason whatsoever apparently
the company is even bringing us a tight
cover tomorrow for their ipad not just
what we already know as their smart
cover which is really interesting since
well obviously this is something we
already see in the Microsoft Surface
let's just see if this moves away from
rumors and actually becomes a reality
and make sure you follow us tomorrow at
one p.m. eastern time 10 a.m. pacific
for our live coverage of everything
that's happening at that ipad event
hopefully we will be surprised with more
than just a cover then we have some
leaked renders of the sony xperia z1s
which is actually the global variants of
the xperia z1f that was just launched
exclusively in japan
and the reason why this phone is
important is because this is actually
one of the first phones out there that
is not big and that has the same exact
flexib specifications of its bigger
brother which is the Xperia z1 these are
actually great news that we still don't
know if it will ever make it to the
United States under that mentality that
Sony's staying away from the US market
so stay tuned for that even a global
variant of this phone would be hot and
finally for the interesting news of the
day yes you can finally download BBM on
iOS and Android and it looks exactly
like what you get on the z10 only on
your current smartphone which is great
though a lot of people are not really
caring about BBM anymore which is kind
of interesting the company took so long
to launch these things and obviously
there is a wedding list it seems that it
is popular in some parts of the world so
yeah there are people that are having
trouble registering or the servers
extremely slow as of today but that
leaves you the question of the day are
you willing to leave whatever I'm
service you have right now we're
messaging service for BBM in my
particular case I don't really see
myself leaving whatsapp because I'm so
used to it after so many years but leave
us a comment down below what are you
doing and Prince is always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
