we're gonna take a look at two
voice-command applications that come
with the Samsung intrepid on Sprint's
wireless network the first is voice
command which is the vault by Microsoft
and has been around almost as long as
the platform has been around and the
second is tell me which is made by a
Microsoft subsidiary and is also
pre-loaded on this device so first we're
going to take a look at voice command
and what it does and then we're going to
take a look at tell me and evaluate
which one is better in certain scenarios
so let's go ahead and take a look at
voice command voice command allows you
to do a number of things we're going to
run through the features by groups the
first group of features that we're going
to run through our system statuses and
notifications so voice command actually
speaks out those notifications and
statuses to you such as battery strength
signal strength and then you can also
set the ringer volume so let's go ahead
and take a look at those what is my
battery strength that ringer to medium
you can also ask it for the time your
next appointments and also you can open
applications as well what is the time
what is the date what is my next
appointment or in Excel mobile
you can also use voice commands you call
contacts by telling it to call and then
stating the contact name or to dial a
number dial three one zero five five
five one two one two
Ansel voice command will also announce
incoming calls and read your incoming
text and email settings based on your
own personal preferences as well so you
can set it to only read high-priority
messages so you can set it to either
read all your messages or only the high
priority one and what do you know we
have actually a text message that came
in so here John Smith call or if texted
us and then it read the text message to
us you don't even have to look at your
phone
the next features that we're going to
take a look at do with media so you can
actually tell it to open Windows Media
Player play your tracks by album genre
or artist so let's go ahead and take a
look at some of those play you to so
here you to is the artist and then you
can also say play and then the album
name or the genre so that's some of the
features of voice command there are a
lot of other features that we didn't
cover today but this is just a brief
overview of that so let's go ahead and
take a look at tell me we received a
message that was read aloud by voice
command so let's go ahead and try and
reply to that would tell me because
voice command doesn't allow you to
actually reply
text John Smith does take a while to
think and then you can tap the left soft
button and speak in your message running
late to the meeting we'll see you there
that will do and then it will send a
message for you you can also use Thome
to actually call your contacts as well
or dial a number so let's go ahead and
try that call John Smith and it will ask
you if you have more than one numbers
say for that contact which number to use
tell me will actually also allow you to
search the internet and pull up
location-based search results if your
device has a built-in GPS so let's go
ahead and take a look at that we're
going to search for the nearest
Starbucks to where I am and see what
results it pulls up Starbucks Starbucks
and then it actually pulls up with being
mobile what your results are let's see
if it understands and can search for
pocket now pocket now yes I didn't
understand that one but the main
difference between tell me and voice
command is that voice command actually
allows you to navigate more of your
phone by allowing you to open
applications check system statuses and
it will read email and text messages to
you as well as announce incoming calls
tell me on the other hand allows you to
use your phone without your hands such
as search the internet and pull up
location-based search results compose
text messages and also make calls like
voice command voice command actually is
a native application that resides on
your phone it doesn't require a constant
internet connection whereas Thome does
require you to be connected to the
Internet and those are some of the major
differences let's go ahead and I'm going
to go ahead and call this phone from
another phone and see how voice command
actually announces the incoming call
so voice command Ashleigh announces the
name of the caller as well as the
location number so here at sighs call
from John Smith at home so that's a
quick look at voice command and tell me
and this is Chang Winn thanks for
