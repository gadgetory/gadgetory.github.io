Developer Conference to happen in June
rumors of the Sony Xperia z5 emerge even
if we're still waiting for the z4 and
Huawei is reportedly poaching around for
some talent I'm hi Marietta desperately
missing my moto 360 already yeah I know
this is out daily official lucid
I have to do with Apple as the company
has already made it official to
developers that Worldwide Developer
Conference for WWDC it's happening from
june eighth to the 12 and yeah the
keynote is happening on june eighth and
for those of you who don't remember WWDC
is when apple announces its next
versions of its operating systems
meeting iOS and also OS 10 so we can
expect a future version name and
everything about Wes 10 in addition to
iowa's night which is rumored to be like
snow leopard was for OS 10 meaning this
is really a fallback for Apple to work
on fixing all the bugs that we currently
deal with and that's something we're
waiting for and speaking of software
updates Apple has just the seed at io s
8.4 beta to developers we're waiting for
the public beta still but yeah just a
couple of days after iOS 8.3 and there's
a lot of change here in one particular
area only in its apples music player
lead a teaser we're getting and it is a
complete revamp to the bare-bones music
player that we saw with iOS 7 and iOS 8
it is really worth seeing there is a lot
of really cool here link to the
description there's a full list of
everything we're getting with the update
now let's move the spotlight over to
Sony as those of you waiting for the
Xperia z4 will probably have to wait
indefinitely because well we have a
batch of rumors that says that this is
really the Xperia z3 neo meeting a new
XIII and that Sonia is actually working
on the Xperia z5 and they'll probably
skip a number and a lot of companies are
doing that lately it means that we're
getting a big revamp with this new
Xperia z5 seems to Snapdragon 820 in
addition to four gigs of ram a quad HD
display as well which is something that
Sony has been late on indeed but we
don't know what to expect for this is
III Neil there is a lot to wait for and
we hope you don't have to wait
wait to FIFA in September time in the
huawei doesn't really make it that often
to the pocket out daily it's time for it
today as the company is merely poaching
employees from Samsung and listen to the
divisions number one the X and O's
division which is fine Huawei works on
its own chipset and they do really
decent job with it but they're also a
bully employees from TouchWiz and we
don't know if it's because Samsung is
letting go of employees that are being
hired by Huawei where it's because
Huawei wants a little of TouchWiz which
would be extremely unfortunate
specifically for a company that has a
lot more popularity that even Samsung
right now according to market share at
least for the last quarter there's a lot
to expect for whatever Huawei will bring
to the table but we will have to wait
for Aoife to know and finally for the
very interesting news of the day and hcz
executive has just announced that
they're working closely with Microsoft
on a Windows 10 device he didn't mention
phone or tablet's we're not really sure
if it's a phone or tablet but we do know
that the company is waiting to see what
happens to Windows 10 and apparently
they will launch a product with it and
it's really hard to predict up what
we're getting is another Windows Phone
variant of the current flagship meaning
an HTC One a ninth for windows which
could be unfortunate for some since the
one about is really not the best phone
out there right now even though HTC is
working on it but it leads me to the
question of the day if you had to pick
what you want an HTC One m9 for Windows
or will you want a new windows film
designed by hcc like in the old days
because in my case I would like a new
phone like the HTC 8x from back in the
day or hey HTC pretty much was the best
partner from Microsoft when it came to
the old windows mobile days as an odm so
we would love to see another hd2 or
something like that leave us a comment
