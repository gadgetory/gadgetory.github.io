an inexpensive smartphone gone are the
days of laggy forgettable throw aways
replace with powerful handsets that give
even top dollar devices a run for their
money
two such phones have been in the
spotlight as of late but which one is
the best for you let's find out I'm high
on to houston with pocket now and this
is the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 versus
the asou then phone to the idol 3 in the
zenfone 2 each feature of 5.5 inch 1080p
display paired with an all plastic
construction and roughly the same
footprint but that's really where the
similarities between the two phones end
the idol 3 occupies part of its display
with virtual buttons whereas the zenfone
utilizes capacitive keys underneath to
save space I prefer my controls on
screen personally but this is all
subjective the zenfone 2 goes to a
greater length to emulate brush metal
and even carries over the added heft of
the material at 170 grams and nearly 11
millimeters thick
this is a beefy phone by contrast the
idol 3 at 141 grams feels almost as if
they'd forgotten to install the battery
it's thin and lightweight without
feeling cheap or fragile neither phone
has the most exciting design we've seen
but each comes with its own charm the
zenfone 2 features rear mounted volume
controls and a dual SIM layout
underneath its removable backing that's
absent from our Idol 3 though a dual SIM
variant is available the idol 3 is
backed by JBL for both the front firing
speakers and the phones included earbuds
and despite the Zen phones impressive
looking grille on the back there's no
contest here a Suzy speaker just sounds
bad it's quiet and horribly tinny and
it's wildly overpowered by the idol 3s
offering
the idol 3 also brings a significantly
better display both use IPS technology
but the idol 3 has a more vibrant
display that gets much brighter and it's
easier to see outdoors when it comes to
specs it's important to note that both
of these phones are available in
different configurations and we've been
using the top-end model of each of them
with that in mind the spec sheets on
these phones make it hard to believe
that they're each available for $300 or
less the idol 3 is theoretically faster
with its eight core Snapdragon 615
chipset versus the zenfone 2 squad core
Intel Atom offering but a seuss packed a
whopping 4 gigabytes of RAM into its
product doubling that of Alcatel
OneTouch the software experience is
provided by a sous and Alcatel have a
lot in common both feel a lot like stock
Android with some added features that
mostly benefit the user features like
the zenfone theme ability or the idol
threes fully rotatable interface they're
both terrific ly fast and clean a nice
change from back when using similarly
priced phones felt like pulling teeth
I like the il 3s miniature widgets like
the weather app and the Zen phones
ability to call down the notification
shade with a swipe down from the
homescreen should be made standard on
every Android phone it's sort of a shame
that neither of these phones has
split-screen functionality especially
when the zenfone 2 is one of the only
phones around with 4 gigabytes of RAM
but then again I'm just happy to see
features like double tap to wake make
its way to both devices there's just one
thing that seems to have mostly skipped
the idol 3 the bloatware the zenfone is
packed full of excess apps a lot of them
from a soos and while it's nice that you
can uninstall most of them a cleaner
selection in the first place like on the
idol 3 would have been better so far
this comparison has been pretty well
balanced but that's about to change both
of us have 13 megapixel primary camera
x' but the zenfone absolutely spanks the
idol 3 in the photo department colors
are far more vivid on the zenfone and
images turn out much sharper though it's
worth noting that this is exaggerated a
bit bias oozes over sharpening still the
zenfone more accurately exposes shots
and you can even use its super
resolution mode
get a noticeably more detailed image
bring the phones into low-light and the
difference is further made clear the
zenfone 2 is capable of taking some
really great looking night shots and
it's night mode shooting make it even
better so long as you're okay with the
longer shutter speeds and the lower
output resolution the idol 3 on the
other hand struggles to focus on a
subject in poor lighting and suffers
from heavy digital noise if selfies are
more your style the differences between
the two cameras may not be quite as
noticeable both front-facing cameras are
actually pretty good but again the
zenfone photos are significantly sharper
and more detailed as mentioned earlier
each of these devices is blazing fast
and performance making full use of their
internals and pumping out flagship
performance they both run great for
games but the idol 3 superior speakers
and display definitely make it a more
enjoyable device for media consumption
and here's the best part both phones
offer similarly great battery life -
with over 4 hours of screen on time
though the zenfone is the only one of
the two with a rapid charging solution
bringing the phone from 0 to 60 in
roughly 40 minutes if you're still
undecided it's probably because both of
these phones are fantastic given their
low price tags in fact even disregarding
cost the zenfone 2 in the idol 3 are
fast and powerful and they remind us
that big brands aren't the only ones
capable of making a great handset in
short buy the zenfone 2 if you want to
take great pictures and change up the
back every once in a while for some
added Flair by the idol 3 if you want a
great screen and unbeatable speakers I'd
take the idol 3 myself given my
preference towards audio quality but
regardless of which you choose there's
no doubt that you're getting your
money's worth and then some
if you like these phones there's a whole
lot more coverage on them both starting
