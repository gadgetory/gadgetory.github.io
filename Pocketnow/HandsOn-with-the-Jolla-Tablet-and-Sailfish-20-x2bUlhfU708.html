around a product dominated by one
company's agenda that's a quote from
Yolo co-founder mark Dillon and it's
those kind of broad sides that have
drawn privacy lovers from all around the
world to the Yola brand today those
sailors get a close peek at the next
device to carry the Yola name I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow here in
Barcelona with a quick look at the new
Yola tablet while technically the star
of today's press conference was the Yola
tablet itself really the bigger focus
was put on sale fish the company's
open-source operating system many of its
core interface principles remain
unchanged from the Yola phone we
reviewed over a year ago
software buttons have largely been
eliminated in favor of swipe gestures
the homescreen is a blank canvas for
active app cards and there's a focus on
clean minimalistic design with the
upgrade to version 2.0 sailfish looks
and feels better than ever and it seems
especially at home blown up to the
nearly 8 inch screen size of the tablet
but the real news here is that sailfish
is now open for licensing to OEMs and
yola's business partners meaning it has
a chance of seeing wider adoption and
greater penetration and a wider customer
base is exactly what Yoli needs if it's
dream of becoming the private and secure
alternative to Android is to come true
speaking of Android let's get back to
the hardware the Ola tablet can run
Android apps natively within sailfish
2.0 as Dillon puts it it ships with 0
Android in the box but you can have
Android apps if you do want them further
Yola claims the performance and
responsiveness of these apps won't
suffer despite running on an on Google
device and it also promises a slicker
multitasking experience as a result of
sail fish's card based design part of
that workload will fall to the 64-bit
Intel Atom processor and it's two gigs
of RAM and users will be able to choose
between 32 gigs of on-board storage or
up to 128 gigs of microSD expansion for
their onboard media in the hand the
tablet feels sleek and lightweight it's
just a bit larger and heavier than the
iPad Mini 2 and its style is minimalist
without being dull the 7.85 inch IPS
display kicks out a pixel density of 330
PPI and the on-board radio provides
support for Wi-Fi a/b/g/n on both
primary bands no AC support as of yet
and no cellular either whether this
tablet holds up as a commercial product
remains to be seen
it won't ship until the second quarter
but the pricing of the world's first
crowdsource tablet is certainly
attractive early contributors to the
company's IndieGoGo campaign were able
to get in for less than 200 bucks and
the tablets final retail price is
expected to fall around the $249 mark
but even those prices won't convince
everyone to consider a tablet that falls
so far outside the mainstream even if it
was designed specifically to do so it's
easy to get behind yola's promises that
it will never sell a user data
especially in the modern era of rampant
data aggregation in the name of profit
but in the end before anything else the
Yola tablet will have to be a solid
tablet if its creator wants it to move
in significant numbers and we'll see
just how good a product it is when we
review it in the coming months be sure
to check out our 2013 video on the Yola
smartphone in the early days of Sailfish

fisher captain to phones on twitter with
anton Dino and Jaime Rivera on
production stay tuned for much more from
Barcelona as MWC 2015 rolls on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
