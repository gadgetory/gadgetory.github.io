weekly live from Barcelona it's a very
special episode of the pocket now weekly
the once-a-week podcast from
pocketnow.com where we put the mobile in
Mobile World Congress I don't know what
that means but on your host Michael
Fisher and I'm sitting in our field
offices a very cozy hotel room here in
Barcelona with managing editor Anton de
Naude you hey everybody hey Michael good
to be back together again nice to be
back together again in the same time
zone for the first time in a long time
and let us not forget we are joined long
distance by the tinny voice from the
other side of the room not because of
Brandon but because of the Internet
Brandon minimun good afternoon to you
what up son we're on the ground in
Barcelona that's what's going on and we
have a lot we have a lot to talk about
but we so much yeah but the thing is we
landed what we are three days away or
two days away from actually reporting on
anything so we're here to set up and
already tired already completely
exhausted and we look like utter crap I
think both of us say the least yeah we
have massive I mean yeah I think you
look better than idea but we have some
huge bags under RS which you've seen on
our Twitter feed a fuel red eyes are not
because of the flesh right now uh but we
my god has just been outrageous but we
need all the time to set up in advance
of the show because it is such a big
show and we also need to cover a lot
that's happened since the last podcast
that has nothing to do with him WC like
Brandon help out my memory here we're
talking blackberry z10 we're talking
teaching some kind of HTC to ask that
dropped i think as i recall we're
talking that we're talking you bunt we
just landed for the nexus 4 7 10 and
Galaxy Nexus nice oh that's right it's a
complete Nexus family you want a happy
family yes it
first we're talking about pre MVC and we
are talking about what to expect here in
Barcelona yes it absolutely and we know
about the echo in the room and we're
sorry makes us feel that there were more
exactly or more alive we are alive than
we've ever been before it's raw we just
before we jump into everything though we
we needed the reason we need a couple
days in advance of a show to set up if
you've never covered a tech show before
which a lot of you haven't and which
until this past year I hadn't is because
everything takes longer when you are
setting up for a show so Tony Brandon
you haven't heard this so Tony takes me
to across town across Barcelona to get
our SIM card there are sim cards for our
mobile devices you know because we reach
in an unfamiliar country and we need
mobile access lists local and he's like
how I've got this great carrier from
Romania yes uh and they've recently set
up shop in Barcelona yes that is also
true and we go across town to get our
SIM cards from this dealer that has got
on his on google maps and we walk around
the corner and there's this Romanian
store with like the Romanian fly only
Romanian products yeah yeah and Tony
take we walk in the store around the
corner i'm expecting to see like a wall
full of phones may be some memory cards
and i walk in and there's just like this
endless case of um like sausage sausage
in mombasa and steaks and like
chocolates and but everything
traditional yeah yeah and Tony's looking
at this I'm like I'm kind of like where
the hell are we and Tony's like cam and
this is these are good brands so but
somewhere behind the counter this kid
has a couple sim cards that he unpacks
and I think it took what about it only
took about three and a half hours or so
it again because he wasn't lazy yeah
right it wasn't because of the carrier
and this carrier has actually been
really good we've got some really good
rates with them but yeah we're not going
to name the carrier because so far we
think we are smart I mean people in
Barcelona de Barcelona population is
more with 1 million people when it's mwc
and everybody's jumping to vodafone and
orange and nobody knows about the small
carriers which which don't have caps and
internet don't have clogged pipes so
we're happy to be on a small carrier
with superfast speeds yeah boom it's in
it's awesome I mean in any connectivity
after after my what for our morning
without kind of giving would have been
great but this is really good and this
is also my first got that could 4G so oh
yeah I'm cheer well let's not though
it's not LTE but its 4G it sorry it's my
back so everyone tony has is using his
note 2 right now and his note 2 came
from ATT replete with that stupid
firmware that calls HSPA 4G ah so anyway
yeah he's like it just is this a
poaching what do you say you let me view
I'm saying it's not right are you doing
Tony's doing Brandon Tony's doing your
lives be just wait on the air searching
for the application and I'm installing
the speed test application at the second
level f of course Michael here who can
testify that it's over data and not
Wi-Fi yes it is indeed over sailboat
unquote for genes doling successfully
installed and speed test tells you the
network type to which I like a lot let's
see but uh well while that installs we
should say that Tony and I are so tired
and you're about to see so many videos
York here comes the speed test good that
we actually waited in line at a
McDonald's to 2p earlier that's a bad
ping oh yeah that's a bad connection
yeah you ever just fire up speed test
and all of a sudden you're getting pings
of like I think what's going on anyways
it's it's a good speed yeah anyways is a
good speed and we waited in line for
like 20 minutes for a bathroom today
that that had 33 toilets and we thought
it had one so we're very tired but the
point is we need to talk I think a
little bit about these giant giant
releases from HTC and blackberry and
brandon has had a chance to play with
the blackberry z10 finally because some
mail carrier lost the blackberry when i
sent it to him can't trust anyone can't
trust anyone there's branded you want to
start with the blackberry because i
would love to hear your thoughts on the
z10 after after i'd spend some time with
it you know after using you bun to
blackberry tens not so bad because okay
well the thing is that i will talk about
you but to later um yeah so i've been
using the ziti
and blackberry 10 for like for like two
days I'm trying to think of a metaphor
it's kind of like it's kind of like
taking a picture in the dark or it's
kind of like being in the desert or it's
kind of like trying to drive your car
with your hands handcuffed behind your
back right slowly driving with your chin
then or your teeth yeah yeah so first of
all I mean the app problem is a huge
problem and I'm trying to think and I
had to review your review Michael to
understand you know your your thoughts
about it i'm trying to think about i'm
trying to think about like why this is
good okay and I'm really and I need your
help because I'm not really coming up
with anything um the messaging
experience okay that's yeah i'm calling
it oh that was gonna be my first
counterpoint like the messaging
experience is very very good on the
blackberry i think do you disagree the
hub what do you what do you mean but
like like how is it better than your
note to the note 2 does aggregate all of
my inbound messages and like any android
phone it throws them all in the
notification shade which i can glance at
with it with a top scroll blackberry
bundles it all into a unified inbox
rather than a unified notification area
so the notification area you tap on a
notification it takes you to a specific
inbox with blackberry it's all already
there in the devices primer and this is
also email facebook private messages and
BBM everything everything that could
possibly generate a notification so for
me that's very clean i like that and it
harkens back to one of the things that
blackberry has always done well so
that's that's where did lies for me
didn't ya yeah and that's reasonably
cool there's a lot of like little
touches like for example if you're in
the blackberry hub and you pulled down
slightly you'll see your calendar for a
second mm-hmm you notice that yes and I
didn't I didn't think that did not
mention that in the review that's one of
the things that slips through the cracks
um okay interestingly it's one of the
things I didn't really like I found the
calendar experience to be somewhat
somewhat lacking but if you liked it I'm
glad I don't want to
crap all over something that you
actually liked about it I didn't I
didn't say I liked it I think there's a
lot of little touches like for example
of you if you can pose an email it'll
try to like suggest who you want to send
it to kind of like Gmail mm-hmm um so
that's kind of cool the hub the hub for
me is a little too much because and I
haven't had enough time to play with it
to know if you can change this but for
example I put him I did what you said
Michael I put in all my email accounts i
put my Twitter my facebook and now I've
got like this vomit just like everything
and and and and on Twitter you know I
mad replied several times per day and I
don't want to see all of them in my
inbox thingy like i wanna i want to see
them only the day so I'm just trying to
figure if there's a way to limit the
number of times that the Twitter shows
up in the hub for example well I'm like
a fifth wheel here because I'm between
you guys I'm the only one who hasn't
touched blackberry z10 orb language and
for that matter but from what I've seen
from the demos also the big
functionality is something that I would
definitely appreciate mmhmm yeah the
peak is another cool thing so if you're
in any app and I really appreciate this
apps are full screen but if you want to
see what the time is you dragged up
slightly from the bottom but not only do
you see the time you see network status
you see how many missed messages you
have well then there you yeah and what
type there and then there's that awkward
slide to the right which is not
sensitive enough like you gotta really
like pop your finger over to get the the
hub to open up yeah you got to really
mean it I mean I feel like that's one of
those things that you learn after after
a little bit but yeah initially its kind
of kind of springy thank you and then
like you know you can make folders like
you can an Android or iOS but the
folders are like these full screen like
panels you know what like the folders
and the app launcher yeah yeah i don't
think i've ever made of folders i don't
think i don't i was able to download
enough compelling apps to justify a
folder what i've done is i've added
internet shortcuts to my home screen oh
ok ok which is which is not immediately
obviously you can do that and you get
these nice little fav icon they look
like little app shortcuts and so I
dragged them into a folder and called it
web and which leads me the next thing I
don't like
these background the the icon
backgrounds like this gradient it's like
what is yeah so behind every every icon
there's like a there's like a gray kind
of translucent panel that makes the a
bike that serves to effectively make the
app icon enlargers that we were talking
about Brennan yeah yeah yeah I think
maybe that's an attempt to to bridge the
visual unity of like you know the the
home screen active frames with the app
titles I'm not sure I'm not crazy about
it i will give you this I don't think
and maybe I don't know if you agree to
me I don't think it's the prettiest OS
that has ever existed well it's
interesting well here in Barcelona we
had the first specific Spanish lunch
today at a McDonald's and we were
talking about and we were talking about
the blackberry and I thought that the
orb I believe that we need to cut some
slack to blackberry because it's a new
platform it's it's it's like Windows
Phone was back in the day and Michael
had a great point it's better than when
those one was in its first day so what
I'd like to propose is what if we play
devil's advocate Brenda you tell us the
three top things that you hate and I
will try to defend blackbery against
your hatred that's a good critic good
nice yeah okay sure number one there are
no apps that are good how long's up for
facebook and twitter how many
applications were there for windows
phone and they won more than there are
here what are you missing specifically
what am i I'm missing Spotify that was
away for windows phone 7 how are you son
of a bitch ah their netflix is there
that seriously I'm not just saying this
to to be right here but Microsoft put a
bigger and at the time it was easier for
developers because there wasn't three
platforms that they've already done
there were just two there's iOS there
was android and so adding a third wasn't
that big of a deal but now it's you know
developers are getting getting a exactly
what's the word oh we're getting
saturated they're getting kind of yeah
inundated and also developers have a
tough choice to make because right now
windows phone is still under five
percent depending on who you believe
it's two points something percent 3
point something percent and blackberry
still has two points so they're kind of
tie
so if I was a developer I would
carefully choose my team on which side I
was mm-hmm okay so let's continue this
game Tony yes um the next thing is that
like okay the hardware um the z10 is
obviously this purpose drip
purpose-built device it's like it's
extremely nondescript and if but it and
yet it feels good in the hand it's solid
it's steady but it's ugly as s in it
looks like a phone that a three-year-old
could have prototyped in his or her
garage um they could have gone they
could have put some chrome accents on
this so it looks good when it's sitting
out on the bar but for some reason they
didn't this phone is ugly as sin well
Tony well Tony go ahead and then I have
something no I was about to say that
this is is all subjective and and and it
comes down to personal preference but i
think that the blackberry z10 resembles
a lot with the iphone 5 and with the
newly released HTC One so the rounded
corners the square that the elongated
shape it I can't defend blackberry
against this you don't like it I like it
so this is a tie and I will say that if
they had thrown some chrome rails on
there it would have started looking an
awful lot like that awful storm that
everyone always wants to forget the
blackberry storm so I think that there
were wise to go minimalistic on it Brent
and I I do I see where you're coming
from it's not the prettiest device I've
ever seen but I think it has enough guns
that it's not the ugliest it's not the
ugliest either and it stands out from
what blackberry used to be doing so I
think that's a that's that's worth
noting and I think that's one of many
things that is like Tony said worth
giving blackberry kind of a break for
considering this is there this is their
first outing in years that is
significant we give you have a third
hatred point as I as I um I was I I
might have said the battery that's not
good but it's been actually pretty good
for me because I'm trying to avoid it
and not you actually know the bottom
line is for for our audience to
understand we are not haters and we're
not definitely fanboy so we're trying to
dissect
everything so that you guys know exactly
what you're getting for your money what
what Brandon is trying to find the flaws
and bring those out to you Michael is
trying to be on the middle road pointing
out both of them and I'm always trying
to see the good things the good parts
and this makes a good mixture in a team
so I think that blackberry is at a good
start it doesn't matter what blackberry
10 is now what I think matters what
library 10 will be six months from now
will they fix all the flaws will they
fix the bugs will they have more
applications right now everybody
understands that this is a new release a
reboot if you will it all depends on on
what path they are currently on and
whether they go left or right yeah
that's that's fair and I'm I'm kind of
being a jerk I mean they've done a
pretty good job considering that they're
starting from effectively zero and
redoing everything in it you know it's a
cohesive operating system you know when
you compare it head-to-head with Android
iOS and Windows Phone it's becomes very
undesirable at that point I have to ask
you to sing question I asked Michael if
you were to choose between windows phone
seven or 7.5 or 7.8 so note no windows 8
here though that those or blackberry 10
um why not eight though wisin because i
know you choose eight over again oh i
would definitely go with 7.87 point ok
let's drop 7.8 7.5 or or blackberry 10
and comparing these because these are
both the initial iterations of a
platform and its infancy 7.5 why now
this is a good good question why 7.5 and
why not blackberry z10 7 7.5 today or
like when it came out well regardless is
the same today because it has apps it's
got all the apps on one right the app
title is significant yeah I feel like
that's probably the heart of your issue
right Brandon I mean like it's it the
apps is the most the biggest burning
point of contention for you right it's
it's that but also it doesn't the
operating system doesn't really work the
way that I do like I kind of like some
glanceable information here and there
and
and z the ctm blackberry 10 is this home
screen interface where there's sort of
this live tile idea but it doesn't
really work out very well because these
the tiles keep moving around so you're
not getting used to 0 weather is an
ampere right and a new calendars in the
upper left it's just it's just and we
definitely yeah i agree i called that
out and my three things black break and
learn from windows phones piece on the
you're absolutely right the tiled moving
around kind of needs to stop or they
have to be at least rearranged well but
i think just to hop back to the apt
question for one second i'ma does the
last thing I'm going to say about it I
think the question becomes if you have
if you don't like blackberries app
selection now what you shouldn't it's
very sparse despite the 70,000 apps then
claim and the you know the question
becomes do you trust them to get apps
down the road like do you think that
this platform is going to grow and I
think that's the question that's that's
really hard is to answer at this point
when you look at blackberry where it is
and compare it to where say window is
for say mr. yeah yeah if they don't know
there's a big dip there's a big
difference because with with Windows
Phone you had multiple devices from
multiple companies on multiple carriers
and with the blackberry z10 you only
have one to two ordinance into devices
from one company it'll be on multiple
carriers so well know that yeah
developer okay well the the the
saturation of hardware didn't help
windows phone at all you had all these
come from devices coming from different
manufacturers you had a hold the market
was flooded windows phone devices and
still everyone kind of like looked at it
and was like okay and kept on writing
apps for iOS and Android and just to say
here I think blackberry does plan to
have something like six of these devices
out within a year or something like that
I don't know what they're what they're
doing but they have they're talking a
big game on the tube to wrap it up I
have two questions for you Brenda first
one is a few or a developer right now
what would you choose windows phone or
blackberry windows phone okay and the
second question tell me if blackberry
would follow your advice give me three
things blackberry needs to do to win you
over okay number one is probably app
selection app selection number two is
take better advantage of this place you
keep going every time you're in a nap
the next thing you're going to do is
swipe up and go to your home screen
usually they could make much better use
of that space that's number two mmm yeah
use the home screen more intelligently
yeah and number three number three would
i'd say i don't know pretty up the UI
and and and go forward instead of
backwards i mean gradients are not in
and and these textures are not in what
sin is digitally authentic flat UI and
i'd like to see ya and and a flat UI to
me means efficiency and if this device
is supposed to help you get some stuff
done it should take away some of the
clutter and go to a less cluttered
interface I i would agree and i would
actually take it a step further and say
and i'm sorry i can't source this
article right now but i was reading an
article from another site that made the
contention that blackberry did an
awesome job at standing out with its new
hardware but it needs a true visionary
on the software side the platform
blackberry 10 can't just survive on the
merits of oh it's new and it's unlike
everything anything we've seen from
blackberry it has to say something and
right now it says to me look I'm the
middle ground between Android and iOS on
one side and Windows Phone on the other
I'm half them to the right yeah and it
but I I also blend elements of all and
it kind of doesn't have a cohesive
message in its in its in its aesthetics
so yeah we always weasel we always talk
about that that it comes down to why
blackberry 10 you know you gotta someone
in the phone store and they're looking
at all these photos why would they get
the z10 when they can get the galaxy s3
or the you know the 8x or the iphone
font you know there's there's no answer
to that and it's and I think the answer
is I tried to answer it and at the end
of my review where I was like yeah if
you're coming from iOS or Android you're
not gonna want this device if you're
coming on the dumb phone are you coming
from if you're coming from an old
blackberry you are and by the way
anecdotally haven't II million
blackberry subscribers today right and
and this would just anecdotally speaking
this was proven on my facebook wall
where I was like here's my blackberry
review and I
think anybody would respond and then
like four of my facebook friend like
thanks I've had this old curve for
forever I'm like you people still reuse
blackberries I'm sorry so I
underestimated how many people I knew
that still carried the old blackberries
and that still feel a real passion for
this brand is that going to be enough to
carry them to keep them alive I really
don't know the best girls on dating so
the investors really don't think so so
so there's no conclusion to this debate
so we had bros we got Kong we had tried
to defend and the hate and the size but
it was good to hear brandon's it liked
us definitely constructed we've been
talking about it for what three weeks
without Brendan haven't had I hadn't
gotten on it yeah and I kind of knew you
were not gonna like it Brennan although
I will say this i will call you out on
this in a very positive way brandon sent
us a two-paragraph email earlier in the
day that was actually pretty long and
the last sentence of this email was dang
this blackberry keyboard is pretty
pretty damn good you seem to like the
keyboard all right yeah you know it's
probably above average but not you know
amazing believe me that coming from
Brandon isn't that good well let's uh
let's move let's move on talk about a
device that maybe we'll get everybody's
blood flown a little bit hotter we were
in New York City to see the unveiling of
HTC's newest product this long-awaited
thing device that one more time we're
sitting there waiting on an HTC event
saying God do you think this is the one
do you think the one that's gonna bring
them know they learn yeah an antenna and
Brandon and I were in line and
communicating with the guys hopefully
listeners you were hanging out with the
rest of the team as they watched the
event and and you guys all traded
opinions back and forth you guys seem to
be having fun in the Hangout me with it
yeah and well HTC unveiled the new one
would formerly known as the NM 7 uh we
didn't actually really talk about this
and I want to get to Brandon and second
cos he was sitting right next to me but
Tony what were here I didn't watch the
Hangout I haven't had time i flew to
Barcelona the next day what were your
first impressions when they unveiled is
the M set to quote you on an idea which
you had initially this entire idea is
yours if the blackberry z10 and the
iphone 5 would have a baby that baby's
name would be the HTC one with a
chamfered edges and the elongated design
and many people in the calm and said
that they'll k I mean every phone with
rounded edges looks like the iPhone I
know it's not true i mean the HTC One
really resembles the iphone 5 the the
first thing which shocked me was the
selection of eppley a of the buttons on
the front I mean it's only two buttons
but if you come to think of it it makes
sense I mean you no longer need a search
button because you have google now and
of course with multiple actions on one
button you can access multitasking and
also the normal behavior of the button
itself then on the bright side aside
from the fact that I definitely like yes
double like the design I think that the
camera is a huge huge ? until we managed
to get that camera compared to other
cameras in real life we can only
speculate well of course the HTC has
been fond of quoting some reviewers that
megapixels don't count he has believe me
they do count and they always count and
i bet you guys read Brandon's editorial
the megapixels count and i have a
different approach as you all might know
i'm rocking a 808 PureView and a 41
megapixel camera really rocks Michael
can the birthday yeah so I was I was
standing in this very small hotel room
but I was still about what nine feet
away from you and Tony took a shot of me
you know showing my my entire body
basically from annie's up and that was
the extent of the frame and he just
gives me the PureView he's like go ahead
and zoom in on that and I just you know
zoomed in and then I zoomed in some more
and I zoomed in some more until I was
looking at the pores in my cheek and
like where I had missed shaving my my
roguish man beard and I was like mine
god this thing is incredible so it is it
is that isn't incredible my bottom line
is I'm an HTC fan I always give credit
to the Taiwanese company but what I
think they're doing with megapixels
don't count is just a cheap marketing
pole either they didn't have the
technology or the they didn't weren't
willing to do a great camera but the way
I see it 4 megapixels is not
you know fair enough all right all right
all right so let me I want Brandon to
finish this line of argument because he
wrote an editorial on and I want to hear
his take but I want to jump in here
right in the middle and be a jerkwad
spoiler because I understand what HTC
was trying to say and what HTC was
trying to say was actually very
refreshing it was like we've had the
stupid pissing match in specs of
manufacturers saying okay five megapixel
okay now eight okay now 13 okay now 16
right and and like HTC was guilty of it
did on the latest round iteration of the
Titan to they had a 16 megapixel camera
on a lens size there was no bigger than
any other county it was dumb it was
stupid right and so they said let's
focus on the size of the pixels and not
the easy you know what I agree with you
I just have one single tiny little
problem HTC's marketing campaign or
marketing bush or their buzzwords
doesn't refer to other 58 or 13
megapixel cameras it refers to the 808
PureView okay and it fine just leave
that alone you're you're far behind it
yeah it well that's true but you know
they're using a similar approach with
much deflated numbers and you know
that's fine I just think that it's nice
for a company to come out and say
finally stop it this is stupid the
megapixel race does not ultimately
matter unless you can do it right yes no
I found it yeah there's no idea found
another way to do it right right and
we'll have to see if HTC ultimately ends
up doing it right but Brandon as you
mentioned as a whole editorial on this
and Brandon obviously you are in the
same boat as Tony why do megapixels
matter so hard I mean if you look at
like the Nexus 10 which has a 4
megapixel screen if you take a picture
at the HD so guys that's four what's
that or the ipad 3 and 4 or the ipad 3
and ipad 4 or any high resolution
display and then becoming more and more
common like yeah did you guys see the
new Chromebook pixel that was announced
like an hour ago no no no it was that
it's a fairly high end it's a google
apparently wolf Google's first your
laptop it's 1,200 bucks but it's got
higher resolution and even though
hundred so it's right over laptop it's
not just a netbook right no it's grunts
chromium OS Chrome OS what does
a hard drive or does it boot it from the
cloud it gives you a terabyte of google
drive space but it has 256 built-in we
didn't get that wasn't this wasn't here
right this isn't in Barcelona this is
like they announced this from ya from
California right yeah and the LTE models
fourteen or fifteen hundred bucks the
thing about it is that the screen is a
higher resolution than the retina
MacBook Pro so it's it's pretty cray
whoa how big is the screen 13 inches I
don't know whoa once I saw the price I
just stop looking yeah I believe how do
you heard it here first folks or last so
go ahead run so one of my favorite
things to do ever in this world is to
take pictures on my iPhone and they show
up on photostream on my iPad and I look
at the picture on the iPad and because
the end this is an 8 megapixel shot
right so it's pretty high resolution and
the problem with looking at the photo on
the ipad 3 or 4 tape with a megapixel
camera is that you can't zoom in that
much beyond that because you quickly get
to the maximum amount of detail yeah but
I have asked where's before you Brendan
you can use the iPad Mini at any time
you use a committee or an iPad 2 or an
iPad 1 and then you can zoom in a lot
more and it's a lot more satisfying um
but if you if you go to 4 megapixels
it's almost like it's not almost like it
is that you cannot zoom in anymore
because there's no more image data and
so I mean that maybe that's not that big
of a deal because you're just looking at
stuff but like if you're taking a group
picture and you're used to like zooming
in on people's faces and it stays clear
because there's data there yeah with a 4
megapixel camera there's there's no data
it's not enough losses ok so my question
is do i do enough people do this outside
of our circle do you besides tony and
brandon and michael who like doing
things like zooming in on their phones
because you know it's fun and to see how
good the images are is fun to be nerdy
do normal people do this are there
enough normal people that do this that
it's going to seriously affect them when
they buy the HTC One and they do are
they going to bring it back to the store
and say listen I can't zoom in on my
pictures enough we'll alert I don't
think so I don't they're not return it
all right back the horse up they're not
they're not they're not going to return
the phone because of that but they're
gonna think it's less satisfying and I
think about my wife and my parents who
use these phones and
much about them and when they take a
picture I almost all the time I see
their fingers into the pinch to zoom
they're zooming and they want to see
some stuff you know mm-hmm so I see you
think it's going to diminish the
experience overall I and I agree mm-hmm
look what could make it the difference
though is that if HTC does this right I
mean we've seen a couple of either
leaked or promotional pictures and
videos which were looking good so the
only way they can pull this up say okay
hey we have small images it's 4
megapixels but look at how crisp and
sharp and colorful they are so this
might be something HTC thought of yes so
let me ask can we ask another question
is that Tony when you use your PureView
808 in in pixel doubling mode and you're
generating 5 megapixel images you send
those to a high resolution screen like
the Nexus Tanner like the the retina
iPad like do you run into this problem
now can't zoom very much no no no
because it don't zoom so I don't I don't
serve it no resuming is a thoroughly
Western cut let me tell you that if you
are shooting with an 808 PureView and
you zoom in within the phone then you
can use the difference from 5 megapixels
to 41 megapixels to have data so it
zooms without losing the quality of the
image so you no longer have to zoom on
your tablet or phone or the Creator
because your user picture already zoomed
in you're doing it already like you're
building the right the picture right to
begin with hear what you're saying
composition right alright so so then so
crap that's a good example example but
on the iphone yeah i used to zoom but i
don't know of any people in my circle
who you used to zoom in on pictures no
all right it's so taking if we if we
have the zoom issue and we kind of all
know where we stand on that i think what
we need to see and we will as we get
review units and as they get out there
and we see some photo and we do some
photo comparisons is how well the HTC
one performs versus its predecessors and
i think it's going to blow them away
because the 1x if it's no one in the 1x
yes rightfully it's a very low bar to
set right and we actually went out of
our way Brannon and I on the show floor
as we were leaving we sought out one of
the HTC folks who is very kind to answer
our questions very quickly and as best
he could and he definitely confirmed for
us that the optics are not the same when
I like that guy exactly we were at the
droid DNA event and I asked the same
question of an HTC person I was like so
is it the same camera module is in the
1x and he was like yes but but the
software is going to do something
different and then we saw the results on
the DNA and they weren't terrible but
they really weren't a market improvement
over the one on eight I'm a completely
unrelated but still positive note I am
more excited about HDR video I mean
there was this emotional video that is
interested in shut with the HTC one of a
HDR video I know the Xperia Z also have
HDR video and with these days cpus we
can have real-time HDR video and that's
something which is super exciting for me
because videos when we review devices
and have camera samples we always look
at the sky and then look at the bushes
and they look at something else we want
to force the phone to change its
exposure and white balance and every
every setting with HDR it is done in
real time you no longer have to do that
the processor and the coding does it
automatically so that's probably one of
the most exciting things yeah in my book
I agree it's going to be incredible and
but you know we saw this last year with
the 1x which HTC rolled out and you know
we'd say what you will about the lens
but that software had some really
groundbreaking features that was the
first time we saw taking snapshots
during video and real-time yes full yeah
and real-time effects exactly right and
and the unified view finder concept
where you had the shutter release for
the camera and the video button right
alongside so HD did a lot on the
software front in my opinion a lot of
which could overcome its deficiencies on
the physical side but none of that
mattered when Samsung rolled out the
gate with the galaxy s3 with a better
yes it was a better camera but and yes
it had more features so it was better in
almost every sense but HTC's camera
wasn't all bad as my point and they've
brought a lot of these new features in
but I think
I'm just going to come out to gave the
galaxy s4 with a whole lot more he'll
like a 13 megapixel camera and with a
tagline like 13 megapixels much higher
than 4 megapixels just to just to be
jerks too that I mean yeah so in enon in
it haha I'm trying I'm trying to frame
this i I'm I'm I I'm inclined to read
the email that I sent around I sent this
email around to the pocket out guys at
after I had some time to digest the one
event because I I came away feeling kind
of weird as I was excited but there were
some butts mom and I'm excited because I
think this phone is what HTC needed to
do it's a really great piece of
machinery attached too many carriers
attached to a really cool marketing
message which is everything your phone
isn't yeah and that's a that's a good
rest of that if he's awesome until the
galaxy s4 comes out and then you know um
but but there's just this mmm something
is not right something's not right
should I read parts of the senile or do
you think that would i would like to try
yeah please do yeah okay okay and and
and this was kind of an emotional thing
because like I you know I really want
HTC to succeed a night as an enthusiast
of this space I think that some their
brother it's accordingly as editorial
opinion piece and not unbiased review
yeah yes yes this is an opinion piece
this does not represent the views of
 Elsa and I'm not very the whole
thing so I said the one is unimaginative
it exemplifies the exact opposite of how
HTC describes the phone which is as
innovative the phone is a cop-out let's
start with the design it's based on the
iphone 5 there's no innovation with the
design it's cool that they were able to
avoid using plastic or glass so they
could use all metal but whoever said
that an all-metal phone is a good thing
holding the droid DNA I am reminded how
important in hand feel is versus in hand
beauty the DNA is sturdy the one is cold
and not grippy okay
can we can we talk about the hardware
then yes sir yeah let's just believe up
in segments yeah so so I'm going to say
that I and this is why I absolutely love
being on the same team with you guys as
Tony said about 15 minutes ago because I
completely and fundamentally disagree
with almost every poem every point you
and I completely understand why you made
them and I respect your points and I
think you can back them up with solid
arguments but for me an all-metal phone
is something that we've been missing for
for such a long time except the iphone 5
well yes okay but that's not all metal
it's yeah it's like metal and glass or
like it's doing it again HTC is doing
this kind of gapless aluminum thing
which is cool and I miss things like
soft touch plastic and and and and
excuse me I don't I don't miss those in
the new design I'm kind of tired of them
and so to see them come out something as
audacious as that and then they've
incorporated front firing speakers into
the design which we've wanted so bad for
so long and not to throw you under the
bus Brandon you actually do mention the
front firing speakers as being
innovative in your email to like you
yeah so I don't want to suggest that you
don't like those but I think I'm way
they're incorporated is cool top and
bottom of the display I think the
chamfered edge it's a bit of a ripoff
but it looks beautiful so much someone
had to doing something right exactly but
if he wanted to do first HTC made a huge
huge step from last year's 1x signature
design to this year's one I mean just
look at what X what it was 1x or 1x plus
last year it was all polycarbonate and
the design language was as it was and
the one from this year is completely
different does it resemble the iphone 5
yes but it still does resemble the
blackberry z10 at the same level so it
is a new design for which I applaud but
then again good artists but artists
stealing borrowing you know the drill
all right all right so so go ahead go
ahead Rena you know get it continued i
think i think it's it's okay we can talk
more about the hardware when we get it
in our hands yeah yeah yeah that's uh
that's something that you kind of gotta
live with the phone but I mean when we
were there standing there holding the
phone
it I don't know the phone that was
touched by a lot of people of course
because a lot of people from the press
but damn whether it was black or white
or black or silver the phone had like
this it felt look greasy to me like it
was absorbing oil or some somehow
holding it in you know yeah i mean the
silver one didn't feel that way to me
the black one did and you know i think
there's a is just no getting around that
you know i mean compared to the
blackberry z10 frankly I thought the
screen was doing very well because it
depending on the glass use now this is
something nobody talks about enough but
the type of glass you use on the display
and the type of coding use on the
display really affects how good it feels
after prolonged use and the z10 feels
like an absolute sponge full of like
french fry oil after you use it for any
length of time whereas other modern
smartphones do not so I think the one
was holding up pretty well under that
barrage but I think we didn't we agree
on the video that the black one was not
holding up as well black snow go that's
so very issue yeah that's a little bit
psychological I mean if you take a look
at the silver and the black one side by
side of course the black one reflects
fingerprints much better than the white
one your mind is tricked into believing
that the black one is more greasy
because you see fingerprints and not the
white ones so it's probably in between
them I think you know I mean since they
both have the g string so I think
they're both really excellent the g
string the what the hell is that do you
guys agree that it looks like a g-string
can i get a it's it's yeah it's a thong
in my book yeah can I get a hell yeah
it's like I can almost picture a but
Emma's g-string going down the quick you
know the strings always better than mini
boxer shorts I think it's easy to color
that I think it's easy to call it that
if it's if it's something you don't like
about the design and i don't i'm not
going to go out there and say that i
love that decision is this in the vein
on the of the butt flap on the other
phone from CES
yeah the Sony Xperia Z 0 would you take
a butt flap over a thumb no I thing is I
don't think it's a great design choice
but i like that it calls out the camera
that is one thing it does yeah it draws
a line from the top of the phone down to
the camera and it says hey this big-ass
lens is here look at it and you know I
think that's cool that it draws the eye
to that um you know could they've done
it better maybe but I I don't have a
problem with the g string I prefer to GC
has a dirty old man I'll tell you what
we got who came up with a name um but um
yeah we go ahead go ahead that's good
let's talk about the software software
yeah cuz that's easy for before we go to
separate one more thing which I'm
excited about is the 64 gig version of
course it's gonna be only available in
some select markets but finally
somebody's bringing along 64 gig
versions even though you don't have
microSD expansion support but you have
64 gigs for those who have pictures
documents images music multimedia and so
on that's another thing people have
listeners are going to be howling their
heads off if we move on without
addressing this because it is the same
thing that HTC did before and this is
what power users hate they've
incorporated a non-removable battery
again and they haven't allowed for user
expansion and can you see that sentence
again but the first part yeah they
they've I know I can't cuz I'm about
power it's the unremovable battery and
yeah I think power users aren't gonna
like it how our users aren't going to
like it that's how I feel about the
software um I mean I mean that's how I
feel about the entire phone this is a
this is such a phone focused on getting
all those millions of people that bought
the galaxy s3 to look at this phone it's
a very consumer-focused non enthusiast
focused phone in my opinion um you know
they didn't do everything from the
design to the software then the software
I should start by saying that sense 5 is
finally been lightened yeah it's it's
flat it as one example I i went into the
settings and maybe i missed it but they
took out skins I mean sense has had the
skin functionalities
version 2 or 3 the so they've removed
options they've removed some a lot of
the clutter which makes it less
customizable and then they give you this
thing called the blinkfeed and it's like
here senator front and center you should
like this and um that's not marrying
Windows Phone metro yeah it's it's got
it looks you know it's got these tiles
and they have information on them and
they it changes its you know it's a
little bit windows phone ask and it's
infinitely scrollable all the way down
and it sounds good on paper it really
does because like what if I mean this is
like the premise behind windows phone
what if I didn't have to go in and out
of apps Twitter Facebook web Twitter
Facebook web what if I could just have
everything flow on my home screen but
the problem with blinkfeed it from what
I've seen is that it really lacks the
ability to configure it you can't add
your favorite website like you can't add
pocket now for example which is probably
your favorite hopefully if your website
or you you can't change how the tiles
look and I don't even think you can
remove it from your home screen so if
you think it's inefficient or you don't
want to see it I don't think you can
take it off it's an yeah what's that
it's an extra but it's a fundamental HTC
wants it to be a fundamental component
of your experience but but but why all
right I'll tell you I went inside I'll
go to decipher guy sure and you want to
decide because you're an enthusiast and
you're not a consumer and this phone is
not targeted at you and so that's why
that's why they want to do it and
furthermore I think I I agree with you I
think this might not catch on with
consumers may be for various reasons but
i think it is refreshing to see HTC do
the opposite what did they do with sense
when they 1x launch they said they took
me aside actually when i picked up my
review unit and we were taught i was
talking to some of the designers and
they were like look what we did we
didn't we didn't break any of the stuff
that that that what's it go we didn't
break any of the stuff that I ice cream
sandwich brought in we still let you
swipe away your notifications we just
lightened it so since four was basically
all about HTC saying okay we're taking a
step back and we're pulling stuff out
and really I was worried that that's all
the tents five was going to be it was
more of HTC taking stuff out and making
the skin less significant but what they
did instead was build an entirely new
feature of the skin which is of their
I'm scratchy right from scratch which
yeah it was influenced by Windows Phone
and you know maybe it has its roots and
thought there but at least they're
trying to add something to the
experience like Samsung has been doing
so aggressively with with TouchWiz and I
think that's the way to go i think i
think to differentiate you can't just be
like look how close I am to stock
Android like Motorola is doing and who
pays attention to Motorola that doesn't
excite me that much I'm not a guy who
mean I love motorola sorry you usually
cares that much about whether if it's
flat or if it's free d what I care about
most is that from what I've seen from
your videos guys sense 5 is very very
fast you know it maybe it's because they
flattened it maybe it's because of the
Snapdragon processor maybe because
optimizations but for me the most
important thing is how fast it is yeah
yeah that that matters on and it seemed
you know there were some times there
were some hesitations um it feels like
the DNA but maybe I'd say Michael maybe
like twenty percent faster uh what did
the one compared to the DNA is one
percent faster yeah I mean yeah I don't
even know if it's that it's pretty damn
fast how it will hold up in time yes and
that's why we do after the buzz because
like you know you install software you
install apps you for the thing bogs down
over the months and then you're like wow
this is nowhere near as fast as it once
was so did you guys see the interview
with Peter Chou HTC CEO on the verge I
did not know because they were in London
right yeah let me let me let me read you
something very interesting I was so
interested to see this this and and it's
it's tough to tell with interviews with
Peter Chou because you know you don't
know if it's a language barrier or you
know because he speaks natively I guess
Taiwanese cuz that's where is that the
right language Tywin I don't know Willie
to see the Taiwanese i'm not sure if
Peter Joe's right sure that the language
is that one each maybe Chinese some sort
of minor the price doesn't matter what's
the deal well so so so check this out
mm-hmm great question what about sense
have you
consider doing Nexus class devices
handsets that either run stock Android
or offer it as an option mm-hmm he said
as a company we really want to offer
something unique and differentiated an
HTC Sense helps us do that if you don't
have the kind of deep capability
provides you won't be able to do things
like blinkfeed and our custom camera
experience you won't be able to
differentiate you won't be able to
really drive the innovation and then
verge said so you need sense in order to
drive software innovation and he said
yes that is very likely what Nokia why
Nokia chills Windows Phone the the the
landscape allows them to differentiate
themselves from the other OEMs from the
sea of phones and manufacturers and
since I think is the differentiating
factor between Samsung phones LG phones
HTC phones motorola phone sony phones
and so on it's the bluffs it's the
add-ons it's the user experience yeah I
completely agree I I'm Brandon I know
you have to we're gonna lose you in a
couple seconds because you've got work
to do because it's the sun is still up
over there and meanwhile it's like way
dark over here in Barcelona but I do
want to ask you a question before you go
and I know do it Julia point to me
because I want to close on this question
with you ah yeah go ahead well I'm I am
very curious and Tony to ask you this
question too about the galaxy s4 is
coming and there's nothing anyone can do
to stop it I mean right so what what is
the thing that would make you buy the
HTC One over what you assumed to be the
galaxy s4 I mean the galaxy s4 lands
it's got you know whatever features were
kind of predicting what what do you
think the chances are for the for the
one now that we know all about it I know
we don't know anything really concrete
about the four yet but what does the one
have to do to win you over
get answered right you go first Tony so
we have reached the point in technology
and an android where raw horsepower does
not matter anymore we've got jelly bean
software optimization so phones are fast
as they come out of the gate from the
factory so it's no longer snapdragon
versus XO knows it's no longer dual core
versus quad core it's not about the RAM
what I think is that I am I will
probably get the 1x the one regardless
of what Samsung will bring with the
galaxy s4 because unless the galaxy s4
will have something groundbreaking I
don't know and insert anything here and
upon the blank line the one so far suits
my needs I mean my only question is
related to the camera if the camera
sucks or I'm not gonna like it then it's
going to be the galaxy s4 but it's no
longer a question of is the Exynos
processor faster than internet dragon do
does the s4 have more RAM it's a
question between the features which
taylor to you yeah yeah I i was gonna
soggy yeah I was gonna say something
like that I was gonna say at this point
in technology I'm looking to be
delighted I'm looking for surprises
something that makes me feel something
really mad unique yeah and you know I'm
not saying I don't like the one I really
like the one and I'm going to probably
use the one and it depends on what
Samsung does I might use it for a long
time but will I be delighted by the
hardware maybe probably probably not
because it's not something I mean it's
beautiful but it's been done before will
I be delighted by the camera if it takes
super incredibly amazing pictures maybe
but i'll still be kind of bummed about
the four megapixel thing will i be
delighted by boomsound which is the loud
front-facing speakers out you know I
think that's cool but my wife always
yells at me when I'm watching YouTube
videos to turn it the hell down so i'm
gonna cranked up so high cuz you got to
put your palm box exactly
but go ahead well I'd be delighted by
blinkfeed well it doesn't really work
the way that I want as far as I've seen
so probably not you know will be I'm
just trying to think of how I will get
that feeling of delight from the one and
and what can samsung do to bring the
delight well I don't know as they're
gonna have that octa-core processor
maybe you know like Tony said we're
getting to a point where you know jelly
beans fast enough and at quad core
processors plenty fat I mean what what
are you gonna do like run adobe premiere
on your phone um oh that's a really
tough question I think I think Samsung
will have a couple of key points which
they will try to tout against HTC or in
their favor first of all it's going to
be the camera we're going to hear the
same exact HTC slogan that that
megapixels don't matter from Samsung but
the other way around the complete
opposite and they're going to say
megapixels do count them they're going
to come up with 5 10 15 reasons why they
do and they're gonna tell their new 8 9
12 13 megapixel camera that's one thing
the other thing I it's gonna be all
about features whether it will have a
stylist s-pen or not it depends on
samsung but at the end of the day it
comes down to the user so my conclusion
is horsepower doesn't matter just check
out two things one build quality to user
experience in 2013 I think android
phones come down to this yeah I think
that's I think that's really good just
boiling it down to two user experience
and build quality because those are the
things that you you live with I mean
that's the thing you spend the most time
with and but i would i would add a third
to that which is that I do care about
performance and Michael and I argue
about this all the time I can tell the
difference between a browser opening in
point six five seconds and point five
five seconds I truly can I I don't know
why um and and but yeah and that's what
matters is not targeted targeted
targeted toward you but I I do want to
say that I'll just answer the question
real quick and in my own terms and I
think the reason this question
my mind was because we were talking
about build quality and if Samsung
doesn't bring some incredible build
quality with the galaxy s4 and the new
design and a new design I'm not going to
be impressed because I'm very tired of
holding the galaxy s3 and the note to
Penn domini right all the over the
entire galaxy line basically and saying
wow this feels like plastic in the early
early leaks I hope they're not right
they show like a variant of the galaxy
s3 just like different kind of button
kind of art that that would really be
upsetting really be bad yeah and I hope
that doesn't happen so it if that if
that drops so if that does happen if all
the renders are right for some reason
and the galaxy s4 comes out and it's
basically a tweaked galaxy s3 exactly
I'm gonna do the downward thumb point
and I'm gonna go with the HTC One if I'm
shopping for an android device because I
value a build I think build is so
important that it's actually part of the
user experience I wouldn't separate it
from I yes you know I think it's crucial
and you know people ask me is like to
copy the other phone I'll be like no I
don't want to associate with you you
know I don't mind that but yeah I know
it and I don't want to keep you hanging
on the morn you're sending one word so
in conclusion everything comes down to
camera performance if the ultrapixel
camera delivers it's gonna be the HTC
comes down to more than that bow you
think it doesn't come down a more
facility comes in you that's good but
yeah that's world different you know
whatever you we're all have our pants
but guys thank you have fun you i will
be talking to you very soon and what do
you say oh you yell what do you say we
have a little hangout tomorrow yeah yeah
oh yeah we're gonna be hanging out
tomorrow so i'll see you on the Hangout
alright that sounds like a plan man all
right adios Lou wait wait wait yes the
sash adios muchachos that's a wiggle
good day to you sir I've got the movie
end so we will miss Brandon for the rest
of the podcast which is not going to go
very long because this is a special one
and we have had a little intermission
because we had to get our version the
Nokia Lumia 920 after the buzz ready
which is now should be live by the time
the podcast goes up it will be live it
will definitely because it's gonna take
us forever to edit this beast of a
podcast now that our neighbor has
started showering through the
association paper-thin walls and it's an
interesting one yet it's usually watch
it yes agreed we haven't seen it yet so
we have no better surgeon but i dunno
yet can we say this these are ya oh yeah
spoiler alert couple of particles of
dust in places where does shouldn't be a
men to that so make sure to check it out
hmm it's gonna be interesting one so by
the way that that particular fault was
found after we had actually already
wrapped the debt after the buzz episode
so i was i deliver the footage too high
man who edits all of our high-end videos
and all of our premium videos he edits
and i was i was done i was like and then
like two days later i'm low 30 amen and
i'm looking at the Lumia 920 of my hand
on the on a train ride and I'm like oh
my god that's horrible how did I miss
that and then I tested it and it turned
out to affect an element of the phone's
performance and I was like oh we have to
reach so we went back and reshot some
elements i added some more vo and and
you'll find out what we're talking about
a fuel see dat be which will go live in
approximately 10 minutes that's episode
12 of after the buzz and last time it
didn't add that section in which case
we're taking it and since we're talking
about nokia since we're talking about
nokia this is the most exciting thing
that I'm ready for this week wherever
next week from open blam WC hopefully
with our fingers crossed sitting here do
you like Lee do you think it is that
we're gonna get to see this fabled Nokia
EOS very again since nokia is no longer
producing any symbian / bell phones it's
just normal that any evolution and
camera software will be on a windows
phone and the nokia imaging department
hinted at this and we were just talking
about this at our dinner lunch and we
were and i have I I said the following
thing I am very very fond of the 808
PureView and just before recording this
podcast we did a
couple of tests that test shots of the
Lumia 920 against the 808 PureView and
low-light performance low-light
conditions and I said the following
thing if nokia finds a way to combine
PureView one with preview to or give you
the deeper view with purview light in a
regardless how many megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization and the
great low-light performance that's going
to be a winner so in my book if the 808
PureView and the 920 would have a baby
that's gonna be my next phone can I
already can I just predict the headline
like I mean instead of the Lumia the
Nokia EOS is what the 920 should have
been like yeah that's what yeah i think
i think it's it's what if they drop
PureView science on us in the way that
they should have in its first round this
will be the phone that i actually want
and I don't need 41 megapixel camera I I
can live with 20 something I can live
with 17 something if the same principle
of down sampling or over sampling works
as long as it generates images that are
larger than 4 megapixel that is true
which will be interesting what I'm
interested in is is low light
performance and while you can have that
put the 808 PureView you cannot have it
without a tripod and that's been proven
the 920 generates great images without a
tripod with the 80 preview you need a
tripod for long exposure times and your
high is l we were kind of betting that
around earlier while i was working on
something i was trying to get skype
working so we could get branded in on
the podcast and Anton was taking a ton
of photos of me in various stages of
frustration and yeah you just couldn't
hold the camera it's still enough he can
do you didn't know the 808 can pull in
light I mean it can you can set it for a
virgin I think the longest longest
exposure at times our about two points
something almost close to three seconds
and there's there's no human on earth
who can get that phone with that weight
still for that long yeah I mean at that
point your heartbeat just starts you
haven't I mean it's minutiae whereas the
the Lumia you know doesn't have as long
it can't bring in as much light but it
really does a nice job of straddling
that with the sensor normally when we
use that expression we're talking about
a compromise that results in reduced
performance but in this case yeah the
808 delivered a very bright but very
blurry shot row is basically
unidentifiable whereas the PureView
where's the Lumia 920 did its job right
and was like hey here's this thing i do
really awesome so a combination of both
i think would be a not only a normal
evolution to the PureView brand but the
next normal step for nokia phones and
i'm looking forward to that and if that
doesn't happen at this mwc i'm gonna be
disappointed hmm let's um let's talk
about maybe something that's a little
less exciting and a little bit less of a
surprise it's basically been linked to
high heaven and then I guess confirmed
right that it was confirmed like
publicly right which one the funded the
tablet no not if enough that's a lot i'm
going to end on that the tablet the
eight-inch the samsung tablet yeah no no
a point oh yeah no that's that's a
certain we can take this for granted i
mean a samson executive not only hinted
that basically confirmed that the tablet
will be here I think that's what it's
like giving a cookie to somebody to calm
him down we were waiting for the galaxy
s4 and it's that we got the yellow sea
window but the real question thread yeah
the real question is now the galaxy the
galaxy note 8.0 be out there with the
specs probably which have been leaked
the question is does anybody really care
about the note 8.0 i will leave here I
will say that I do and it I'll tell you
I'll tell you why samsung has galaxy
product in the 7 inch range and in the
near 8 inch range right now but their
galaxy tab which is not a very
compelling brand to me the note brand is
more capable I think it's a I think it's
a higher-end brand and also the note 8
if if the photo we saw from the bus
right if the leaks we've seen
true let's say that they are said they
are the note 8 will be the first tablet
from samsung in that size range to
follow the design linnaeus so it's a gap
fill of the new line yeah right because
the tab the galaxy tab 7 and it was cute
the galaxy tab 2 7 point 0 or 7257 it
looks nothing like anything else in the
galaxy lineup really like I mean oh it
does it looks like all the other tabs
which is it's just boring and it's
uninspired might not be exciting but at
least it's consistent with what we've
got out what you're saying is we'll have
a family reunion will have the note 2
will have the note 10.1 and filling in
the gap will be to melt eight-point oh
do you think that there's enough niche
for that yes I do because of the strong
response to the Nexus 7 and the kindle
fire and the other stuff at the 7 inch
price point backed up by the increased
cachet of the galaxy note name which is
now a big deal you know out there or is
becoming one if it's not a big deal
which do you think will be the strongest
competitor for the note 8 window like
the strongest like Ed like
counterbalance to it yes or do you think
let me rephrase do you think the note
8.0 could be a real competitor not to
the nexus 7 which we have right now on
the market but for the rumored next
Nexus 7 coming at Google i/o and may
hopefully right no I think that that's
what i was going to answer with i think
that next Nexus 7 whatever that is
that's going to be I think they're gonna
bring the heat with that ok so tell me
two reasons why I should buy denote a
point though it is aside from the fact
that i need a a 7 or 8 inch something
right to get to my ear haha the note 8
has a compelling argument for its
purchase in that it is not the 10 dot
one which was a disappointing product i
think and even with the newest software
i think it tends to lag a little bit and
it's not it's not a very i don't think
it's a terribly good product on the
software side or on the hardware side
cuz it feels kind of chancy we don't
know what the note 8 feels like we don't
know how the software is going to
perform but if they've been I have the
time I fix victoire bet something I
think it will feel exactly the same as
the
point one ordinal to know what can't
because the 10 dot one is a is a
landscape tablet for three reasons the
10 one is a landscape tablet whereas the
no date is a portrait one the no date
has a refined design language they've
had the time to learn the lessons from
the note 10 dot helmet and and Samsung
can build an amazing tablet in the nexus
10 true but the materials are kind of
the same the design is the same i mean
people see the s3 CML to see don't know
10.1 it's all the same again in a
different suite packaged form it is but
i don't think i don't know i don't think
samsung's gonna leave it at that i think
they're gonna be like no here's
something different here's that you know
what for that i'm looking forward to
yeah me too and you know what if it
doesn't it doesn't turn out that way
we'll be back here at this next week
chocolate I would didn't turn out
absolutely but I I'm holding out hope
that the note 8 will be a better product
than the 10 dot one was hopefully it
won't be as big as the note 2 because
the note 2 is huge it's the biggest
thing in the note lineup and I think it
will stay that way but i think that i
think the no date is going to be
significant well the no.3 is is due for
an IFA 2013 mmm so they need a gap
filler some somewhere there and the the
note 8.0 could be just that salvaging
the sales and marketing push for for the
summer spring summer right and playing
along with samsung's recently announced
you know TV push and the s4 which will
come sometime and a near future
according to recent rumors one day
before the HTC One availability Lamar's
porridge for Jane tia yeah that's really
something dick move right and
coincidentally one day before I take a
long weekend to visit a college friend
so it is entirely possible that i'll be
covering a samsung galaxy s4 event and
then like getting on a plane but anyway
i was going to say something before that
there was far more pertinent but i don't
remember it so will i will just say that
the note 8 cannot be possibly be as
exciting as another rumor we had batted
around for a tablet here at mwc and that
is the a sous not padfone but phone
interestingly the fonepad was the first
code name which was rumored for a bad
phone so if here's this if the bat phone
is a smart phone knocking into a tablet
what's it phone bad is it a tablet
document it couldn't be about it could
be a phablet docking into a tablet it
could be and so it's just normal that a
sous is trying to somehow catch up with
Samsung with its no to LG with the
optimus g pro and we need a third player
in the phablet market so i wouldn't be
surprised if this phone pad will be a
phablet with an 8 tablet but i wouldn't
be surprised if this would run some sort
of Windows it wouldn't probably not
happen but who knows I was just gonna
ask that I what's it kind of what's it
gonna run I'm thinking it might need
windows 8 blue which is bridging the gap
between Windows Phone and Windows RT but
let's stay on the Android side I think
that this phone pad will be a phablet
within a tablet and that's just about it
I think it has to stay on the Android
said because we talked about this what
last week or something like that and
well I know I came into that that
segment of last two weeks ago his
podcast whenever it was Oh kind of full
of anticipation saying guys what do you
think about a pad phone with Windows
Phone and you and Brandon were both kind
of like it's not gonna happen it's not
going to happen because it's a stupid
idea nears winos like how what I'm more
excited about is that from the rumors
we're hearing that this phone pad will
probably also be built from aluminum and
this is interesting we have the iphone 5
we have the HTC One and people moving
towards aluminum when everybody bashed
apple from moving from glass to aluminum
now this is strange trend did everybody
do that most people i don't know i don't
think i didn't i think it's great not to
have your phone shattering yeah it's
okay don't get us wrong it's okay to go
to aluminum just learn from apple's
mistake i recently unboxed a black
iphone 5 and it had a small but still
visible
scuff wretch frickin believable I was
there I was just sitting right now
people if you are getting phones tablets
out made of aluminum make sure you get
them sturdy enough or good enough that
they are out of the box good and they
don't wear off chip scratch something
similar over time yeah and it's not
necessarily that it's aluminum being
used i don't know what the engineering
explanation is but it's something to do
with the method by which they use to get
that chamfered edge and then how they
handle the devices after that process is
complete but whatever it is I couldn't
believe it when you took that device out
of the box and it had a friggin shipment
this is not what we expect from Apple
frankly from an apple or from anybody
else it's still the 2013 I mean
absolutely you should have your you know
issued these issues under control and I
know there's an old story and we don't
find analyzation under words stuff like
that but yeah please give us phones
tablets which are good yeah I'm not
chipped out of the box but you know
we're gonna have the opportunity to see
a lot of phones let me ask you something
new in a lot of topic yeah tell me three
things which you are excited about done
in Tony's obsessed with the three is
looking like they could give me two
things excited about at this upcoming
MVC this is a pre MVC podcast will have
a post NBC podcast so we aren't gonna be
here due to record and far so yeah so
okay two things for what you were
extended I will tell you the first one
is that is it and this that's Libra
showery the neighbor sharing man people
like Sharon here I like it we like a
clean populace um the first one I've
already we've already talked about
that's the no yes I think that is the
thing that I am most excited for from
what did you say that Nokia for once in
the recent past has the opportunity to
steal the show I mean Google is not here
with Mandrake booth right Samsung's not
here I'm some sludge to see one is not
here right so it could be all about
nokia it could very well be um you know
I mean there's there's always there's a
lot of players and we don't mean to
sound like we're dismissing them i mean
we're gonna say a lot from everybody
but but Nokia is probably the biggest of
the bunch then it's their home turf
right because they always do
announcements here right this is where
they announced the PureView 808 last
year true um Erin still remember waking
up to that news like I turned over I
grabbed my phone like I always do and I
had just been brought on board or
packing out I got brought important than
two weeks later you went to mwc with
high man yeah and and I've ever all over
look at that headlines like Nokia know
where it was also pressing the
41-megapixel you crazy bastard what are
you doing I like like fell out of bed it
was great and then I was like I think I
was like I want to write about this and
tony is like you have to write about
this other tablet but anyway um no so I
think that that is absolutely what I'm
looking forward to the most this second
thing I'm looking forward to the most is
not a product or a singular announcement
but it's kind of a feeling of redemption
that I'm hoping for after CES which was
a very disappointing show on the
hardware front and we don't need to go
into all that again but you know I
really am hoping for an exciting show
but on the bigger picture don't you
think NBC is somehow slowly moving
towards the same thing I mean we saw of
course Apple never participated Samsung
has moved away now HTC has moved away
will future shows like mwc ctia IFA and
CES be all about zeti who have a assu
say sir or as my other players yeah not
necessarily smaller I don't want to
offend anybody but but about these OEMs
yeah I I do and I think the writing's on
the wall you know for that kind of thing
and that's not necessarily you know I
don't know I feel like it's somewhat
patronizing for a lot of people to say
well it's not necessarily a bad thing
because what do we what are we in this
business for what does anyone in the
business of tracking superstars in the
business for you you are interested in
seeing what the superstars have to
deliver and when the small guy can every
once in a while get up and say hey
listen either wear a big company who's
not a player in the space or we're a
tiny company and we've never done it
before but here's this awesome thing
they're chaniz that's awesome i love i
love that more than anything else but it
happens so infrequently and
because it happens so infrequently it's
exciting when it does happen so I love
seeing that but it's it's rare so yes I
think we're looking at a future of
companies doing their own shows for
reason on my and I've been covering mwc
for like three or four years in a row
and after we took me sightseeing today
and here I was like this is awesome near
the water or something he was like yeah
after the third or fourth time it starts
to suck and after writing recaps at nwc
I I always see the headlines android
ruled but this time according to rumors
angry will not be here as in Google will
not have an Android specific booth with
all the small sub booths so this could
be a chance for nokia and it could be a
chance for microsoft microsoft always
always has something to announce at mwc
it was windows phone 7 was first
announced here that mango preview was
announced here was it mellow now well
Microsoft can show off something from
Windows Phone 8 point something
Microsoft can build a buzz this is nakia
stir it's Europe and they together can
do something and they might be able to
steal the show I mean the sous might
bring a lot of Android tablets that's
okay nobody cares samsung might bring
the note 8.0 that's okay i don't care do
you care I care a little bit but a
little but okay on an average not really
not sell saxo this really could be about
Windows Phone it could be awesome it's
gonna be really cool for me I'd be happy
for from a from a sort of family I'm
wearing windows phone 8 d sure you
totally are yeah I think I'm wearing a
palm t-shirt and yeah so I guess we're
gonna have to wait and find out but we
are going to have we're gonna have this
discussion and many others again Taylor
less than a week and well tomorrow in
the Hangout that's right and which will
happen by exception not at two p.m.
Eastern but a3 p.m. eastern so only for
this time because between our eastern
times and CET there's a smaller distance
we're going to be
at VP Eastern and because of a awesome
hotel internet connection and our friend
at the sausage stew we have a cornucopia
of connectivity available to us right
now so we will be able to get that out
barring any major malfunction knock on
wood yep and also yes you are right we
are going to have a podcast post show
right before you leave and we're gonna
have a nice big wrap up and in between
we're gonna have a lot about 30 40
videos hopefully that's it doesn't this
time you know interestingly it doesn't
come down to us it comes down to the
OEMs yeah don't even how many things
they have to show up the more things
they have the more videos we do that is
very true I think it's about time for us
to to wrap it up when you say yeah
please do well let's do it everyone
please stay tuned for all of our
coverage all of our MVC coverage all of
our coverage from the rest of the globe
and the obligatory bloopers so whenever
I on camera there's the bloopers yeah so
stay tuned for didn't happen those are
absolutely going to happen we are
doubtless going to get lost in some kind
of Barcelona fruit market or something
and we also almost unboxed a single
packed orange today what we did you'll
see more of that we do it yeah I can't
wait for real lab tech but until then
