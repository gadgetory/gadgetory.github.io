for last year's special sauce but
Samsung's newest smartphone is much more
exciting
once you go hands-on so let's do that
I'm Michael Fisher at MWC 2016 in
Barcelona one on one with the Samsung
Galaxy s7 brought to you by D brand so
here it is and yeah it looks and feels
very much like last year's galaxy's same
glass and metal sandwich construction of
the s6 with a fingerprint scanner and
home-button beneath a 5.1 inch AMOLED
display and it's available in four
gorgeous colors once again the changes
start out subtle and get more
significant as you dig in the phone is
more ergonomic thanks to a curved
backplate imported from the note 5 the
camera module has gotten a bit of a
shave so it's not so pronounced and it's
a perch er has also seen a boost to F
1.7 it's also a new sensor entirely down
a little in resolution to 12 megapixels
but with larger pixels overall and much
faster autofocus more exciting
Samsung brought back some features many
criticized it for omitting last year the
s7 S storage can once again be expanded
by the addition of a micro SD card and
while it doesn't look it it is indeed
water-resistant - ip68 that means it can
fall into a fresh water puddle a meter
and a half deep and sit there for a
half-hour it'll be just fine
Samsung has also added new features to
its custom user interface built atop
Android marshmallow some we've seen
before like the always-on display
pioneered by Nokia and Motorola though
the s7 takes it a step further by
letting you set things like a calendar
and custom graphics others are brand new
to me like the game controls that make
it easier to capture in-game video and
set things like do not disturb mode so a
call doesn't bounce you out of a game
and the s7 is set up nicely for future
developments in mobile gaming with
support for the Vulcan graphics API and
a very powerful processor either the
Snapdragon 820 or Exynos 88-90 depending
on market backed up by four gigs of ram
and with an integrated heat pipe for
thermal
Galatian battery capacity has also been
boosted to 3000 milliamp hours while
both fast charging and wireless charging
options remain samsung says you can
binge a whole season of Game of Thrones
over Netflix on a single charge which
seems dubious but we'll have to wait to
find out in the full review if it lives
up to its potential the galaxy s7 family
is virtually guaranteed to be Samsung's
best smartphone line ever with the
possible exception of the note that's
not evident from a distance though and
Samsung will need every ounce of its
considerable marketing muscle to
convince people that this isn't just a
warmed-over helping of yesterday's
leftovers the galaxy s7 will ship March
11 with pre-orders opening March 23rd
pricing is still TBD but we're not
holding our breath for any bargains
