over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well it gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take another look at 2015's
super-sized iPhone to see if it's still
worth its luxury price tag
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is the iphone 6s plus after the
buzz as always coming back to iOS after
a long stint on the competition takes
some adaptation on the software side I
do find the iPhone slightly more
consistent that doesn't mean it's always
faster or that it's impossible to find
any lag but whereas say a galaxy s6
might keep you waiting a few seconds to
redraw its homescreen on occasion the
iPhone doesn't really ever do that it
used to be that kind of consistency came
at the expense of features but iOS 9 is
really feature dense even down to the
little stuff just a small example I love
that you can see the charge levels of
connected Bluetooth devices right in the
Notification Center it's a nice little
sort of geeky touch once you're used to
iOS 9s added complexity it's also pretty
easy to access its shortcuts and
utilities even one-handed and I found I
forgot about half of them since the last
time I used an iPhone things like the
proactive panel to the left of the home
screen and of course a 3d touch 3d touch
was the biggest headlining feature of
2015's iPhones and I still think it's
one of the coolest interface
enhancements to hit the scene in a long
time over the past week I've used it
often when browsing in Safari I'm in the
middle of a loss tree watch so peeking
came in handy when I just wanted to
remember who a specific character was
without jumping all the way to another
page the force touch to animate
wallpapers is also a big crowd-pleaser
but I only started using that once I
remembered that 3d touch was there and
despite a bunch of apps having added
support in the past few months it's
still not a very discoverable feature
and it's hindered by some
goofy implementations the multitasking
shortcut where you force drag a thumb
from the bezel is the opposite of
intuitive feels more like something
Huawei might have dreamed up also
despite its reputation the iPhone still
has some usability issues Siri still
doesn't understand context as well as
Google now to give just one example
asking her about Union Square while
standing in Somerville's Union Square in
Massachusetts still produces a search
result about New York City also remember
how Apple used to pester you all the
time about your stupid iCloud password
yeah it still does the company's App
Store policies also mean buying books in
the Kindle Store is needlessly
complicated on the iPhone and the phone
isn't immune to strange behavior one
night my 6s plus just wouldn't wake up
from standby no matter what I did I got
a black screen until I soft reset it
still there's a reason Apple's about to
sell its billionth iPhone and it doesn't
just come down to savvy marketing the
ecosystem edge is still huge if you own
a Mac book you can handle messages and
notifications from either your phone or
your computer and if your friends and
family have iDevices you'll love things
like FaceTime and iMessage the ecosystem
advantage also extends to hardware there
are many more accessories available for
the iPhone and if you go to a hotel
you're more likely to find an alarm
clock that can accommodate your iPhone
then say your Windows Phone the camera
may not be as technically capable as on
some other phones but it's still one of
the simplest and fastest to use and more
often than not it delivers photos to be
proud of and in the specific case of the
iPhone 6s plus battery life is just
terrific in the past week I never once
ended a day below 60 percent charge
despite never having used power saving
mode for most people this will be a
2-day smart phone which in 2016 is
pretty fantastic
so in 2016 it's still worth buying an
iPhone 6s plus and for Apple fans
looking to bridge the phone tablet
divide I still strongly recommend it but
when you take price into account the 6s
plus seems like it comes from some
alternate dimension
it starts at $749 and if you don't want
the 16 gig version which you don't
you're actually looking at a minimum of
$849 that's $300 more expensive than the
Nexus 6p over $400 more than the Moto X
both excellent Android phones even when
you take into account Apple's excellent
customer service that's a big pile of
dough for years people have been willing
to swallow this so-called Apple tax but
frankly I just don't think this device
is worth that kind of premium again it's
still a great smartphone but for those
open to other platforms it's never been
a better time to look elsewhere for more
on the iPhone 6s and 6s plus be sure to
