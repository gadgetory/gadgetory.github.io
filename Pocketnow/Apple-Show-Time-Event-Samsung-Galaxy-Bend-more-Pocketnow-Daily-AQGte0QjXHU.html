invitations for their Showtime event to
happen later this month we get some of
the specifications of the huawei P 30
and B 30 Pro thanks to new
certifications and when Samsung said
they were working on more foldables
they mented because we've got some more
patents I'm hanging out a meta and I've
spent all today thinking it was Thursday
and I was so happy until now this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with the death of products I
don't think anybody is going to miss I
mean if I asked you what Google alo is I
know half of you won't know what but as
of today the service is dead there's a
way for those three of you that we're
using and to export your chats into
something else
and don't forget Google+ is going to die
next month which I don't understand why
that one died later and not alo I mean
but whatever
yeah just keep in mind now let's talk
about Opel and the company's next
flagship product I mean for the longest
time their flagship that would come and
go was the fine line that's where we got
the latest specifications but now
according to the company's VP it's going
to be called Reno or that's probably the
codename and according to him it's a
whole new product that's nothing
compared to what we've seen in the past
so yeah we've got the best
specifications and that periscopic
camera that we saw them WC of q2 2019
stay tuned and what company that's not
gonna make us wait for a periscopic
camera until q2 is apparently Huawei
with their feet 30 and B 30 Pro we've
got certifications now it seems that
we've got different SKUs for each phone
six or eight gigs of RAM 128 gigs of
storage in the case of the p30 and then
in the case of the p30 pro you get the
same ram same starting storage and then
an option for 256 gigabytes obviously
we're expecting to see this in Paris
very soon so we'll see which one beats
or wins and that sort of a racer
periscopic cameras that well the
spotlight over the Samsung has the
company said they were pursuing
foldables but they took it really
seriously
we've got patents these are actually new
where we see that they plan to bring
even foldable technology into
wearables and this is not new we've seen
this from Nubia we also saw the dragon
hinge concept from TCL at MWC and that
enable the possibility of having like
snap-on's and probably you - you guys
are too young to remember what that is
from the 90s but yeah it seems that we
might have wearables that are foldable
displays whatever the case might be we
just want to know when and finally the
hottest news that I have to do with
Apple the company has just surprised
this with press invitations for an event
to happen on March 25th and all they say
is It's Showtime
now the question is exactly what this
Showtime is going to be because the last
time that they used this was wow it was
more than a decade ago to announce their
new Apple TV back when it was first
announced the first generation so we're
hearing that the company has made some
significant investments in their
services particularly for content that's
up shot to a billion dollars if not more
into streaming services and whatever
they've already bought like carpool
karaoke and all those other assets we
also hear rumors that we might be able
to see a new iPod sorry new iPad new air
pods
all this is in the table but let us know
in the comments down below I mean one
what do you think It's Showtime means
from Apple and number two what would you
like to see it this event because in my
case honestly I'd like to see some
functional air pods that will actually
fit my ear and don't fall off and that
I'd be willing to pay money for that's
just me leave us a comment down below we
love to know your opinion friends again

and Spanish for more videos like this
one it follow me on twitter hi managers
