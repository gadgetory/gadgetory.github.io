off every major Samsung smartphone
launch for the past three years but this
year the next big thing is actually
worth the hype I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the Samsung Galaxy s6 brought to you
by squarespace every so often a product
comes along that you pick up and don't
ever want to put down the galaxy s6 is
one of these and picking it up is
important because without the context of
touch it's easy to confuse the s6 for
one of its predecessors slightly rounded
rectangle with a big screen and a big
home button it's only by holding it that
you grasp its significance this is like
no Samsung that's come before it not the
industrial alpha nor the leatherette
note nor the plastic II at Eve this is
something entirely different the galaxy
s6 is a slim sandwich of glass and
aluminum less than 7 millimeters thick
and much more substantial in the hand
than its hundred and thirty-eight grams
would suggest there's not a trace of
compromise to be found in the fit and
finish everything from the corner seams
to the button travel and feedback is
top-notch the phone is available in
several colors we tested both white
pearl and black sapphire in our nine-day
review period with the latter picking up
fingerprints much more readily than the
former and despite the creative color
name it's not sapphire material its
Gorilla Glass 4 also regardless of color
it's a slippery phone prone to sliding
off crooked tabletops if you're a
butterfingers you may want to consider a
case spec for example sent us a bunch to
try out the case for a case is bolstered
by the protruding camera bump on the
back begging to be shattered with a too
hard drop on a to tough surface the
Galaxy s6 has such a beautiful design
though that it seems a shame to cover it
up especially since we've so rarely been
able to say that about Samsung phones in
the past
while upping its game in industrial
design the company hasn't forgotten to
play to its main strength display
manufacturing this year's quad HD Super
AMOLED panel is sharper than ever it's
black levels and contrast excellent its
saturation rich but adjustable based on
your preferences it can still overpower
to around 600 nits in bright sunlight or
cranked way down to almost nothing in a
dark room annoyingly this time around
the dim setting is sabotaged by the two
bright capacitive keys at the bottom for
some reason the timeout controls have
been removed meaning they always light
up with every screen interaction and
there's nothing you can do about it put
your thumb on the home button in the
middle and you'll see another of
Samsung's many improvements the new
fingerprint sensor is leaps and bounds
better than the cumbersome swipe jobs of
previous generations getting you past
the lock screen just as quickly as the
best of the competition the other side
of the lock screen is where Samsung has
fallen short for the past few years
spending more time on useless or
half-finished features while letting its
interface aesthetics stagnate and at
first glance with its goofy icons and
garish colors the new software doesn't
seem all that different
but shaking things up is just a long
press away like HTC Samsung has
introduced full theming capability to
its latest flagship allowing you to
change everything from icon packs to
system sounds to wallpapers to accent
colors with the swipe of a finger at the
moment the theme store is pretty barren
but already I found a couple that work
with my particular sense of style and I
really liked that the theme changes
extend to almost every corner of the OS
including places like the notification
shade and SMS chat windows whether you
run a custom theme or not there's a
market improvement in responsiveness and
a more intelligent layout overall
continuing a trend that began last year
Samsung has culled or buried many
extraneous features resulting in a
faster experience in day to day years
the last out of place elements from the
old nature UX have been removed
and you can now swipe on the stock
keyboard for precision cursor placement
multi-window
one of Samsung's biggest standouts is
still better here than on any competitor
phone supporting a long list of apps
capable of running side by side with its
direct access to the phone's onboard
blood-oxygen and heart rate sensor s
health is more capable than ever and
better laid out to even the Flipboard
powered newsreader is snap here than it
once was not all the changes here will
be welcomed the replacement of overflow
icons with the word more takes some
getting used to and that combined with
some of the industrial design and the
parallax effect and the wallpaper makes
the s6 seem like it's trying a little
too hard to be something else then
there's the matter of how well the
software performs in real life which
we'll get to in a second but I want to
wrap up the section with my favorite
software feature of the s6 the reason I
don't have a camera shortcut on my home
screen anymore
double click the home button and you'll
find yourself almost instantly in the
viewfinder that viewfinder is a welcome
improvement over earlier
Clojure builds automatic settings are
available so the phone can decide for
itself if it needs to turn on night mode
or activate HDR and you can also preview
HDR effects before taking a photo a
handful of shooting modes are available
out of the box with others available to
download and there's a pro setting for
manual adjustments to my favorite sort
of fun feature is probably virtual shot
which allows you to combine multiple
angles of an object into one faux 3d
photo the best feature of the galaxy s6
camera though is that it doesn't rely on
gimmicks to kick out beautiful photos
the 16 megapixel sensor delivers
outstanding pictures whether the
subjects are hundreds of feet distant or
mere millimeters away the HDR effect
brings highlights to the dark zones with
only a minimum of color washout
back in standard mode colors are
sometimes a little punched up a little
on the warm side but I find that the
saturation boost helps more often than
it hurts importantly it doesn't mean
blues and greens are lost on the
contrary the s6 has no trouble rendering
the cooler side of the spectrum and
where at sundown you better take care
with other phones this camera's f 1.9
aperture and optical stabilization
combined to pull out a lot of light
without the need for the harsh LED flash
color reproduction wanders further into
the yellow-green area of the spectrum
the darker the scene gets but this is
still one of the best low-light
performers we've seen on android combine
that with the front-facing camera and
its wide-angle lens and the still side
of the scene is pretty well covered the
galaxy s6 brings a lot of capability to
its camcorder mode too but as the man
said don't take my word for it
the worst part of the camera experience
over the review period wasn't the
cameras fault at all it happened when
the viewfinder crashed immediately when
I tried launching it and it wasn't an
isolated occurrence ab crashes have been
fairly common over the past week and
while a recent software update has
helped a bit it didn't completely
eliminate the problem and given how
poorly some Samsung software has aged
over the years it does give me pause now
this isn't necessarily a Samsung issue
like the slight delay and calling up the
multitasking screen and the occasional
unaccountable lag Android lollipop is
just funky sometimes no matter what
phone you're using but it is frustrating
when you're in the middle of something
and you're interrupted by a notification
that an app you didn't even want
installed and didn't even know was
running has crashed now some of the
blame does fall at t-mobile's feet for
this uninstalling or disabling the
carrier bloat that comes with the phone
does help to a degree still put all that
together and it's not a great experience
ditto for androids too aggressive memory
management you think a phone with three
gigs of RAM could manage to keep a radio
streaming app loaded in memory after
taking a quick video with the camera but
sadly that's not the case elsewhere
Samsung's in-house silicon seems to
stack up while the Exynos processor
warms up the hardware with a quickness
it does a fine job rendering even heavy
websites in either Chrome or the stock
internet browser and it runs games like
asphalt 8 about as well as the
Snapdragon 810 does you've just got to
be careful not to squeeze the s6 too
hard in those stressful moments lest
your palm activate the capacitive keys
and kick you out of the game and you'll
want to keep your fingers clear of the
bottom firing speakerphone port to when
it's wide open it's a formidable little
driver but it's easy to cover up by
accident
already what about the much belaboured
lack of a memory card slot and removable
battery I only really miss one of them
expandable storage has been increasingly
marginalized by other Android OEMs and
by Google itself and with the s6
available with up to 128 gigs of
admittedly pricey on-board storage I
don't think many people will miss
microSD on the other hand it would have
been really nice if Samsung had managed
to retain a swappable battery so we
could carry a spare around
despite usually lasting me through the
day our galaxy s6 never managed to hit 4
hours of screen on time between charges
our unofficial benchmark for
acceptability but the phone does include
support for both leading wireless
charging standards and it's also one of
the fastest charging smartphones we've
ever tested with an adaptive quick
charger right in the box that juices it
up from dead to a half charged in about
a half hour so whether you can live with
its endurance will depend on how often
you can top up there's also some
question about t-mobile unit's
performing differently from other
carrier variants see our full review at
pocket now for more on this finally the
galaxy s6 is also a phone of course and
aside from its seems occasionally
snagging the hair around my ears
something the iPhone 6 also does it's a
very good phone its antennas hanging
onto t-mobile signal both above and
below ground in Greater Boston and it's
earpiece adroitly walking the line
between loudness and clarity the galaxy
s6 itself walks another line well the
one between changing things up and
sticking with what works
Samsung has kept the physical aspect
familiar but upgraded it so it now looks
and feels like the premium hardware it
is it's kept the software accessible but
also made it customizable so users can
more easily make the phone their own and
it's thrown in the best camera and
arguably the best display ever to hit a
smartphone it's not without its
compromises and it won't be for everyone
but the Galaxy s6 is one of the best
Android phones you can buy in 2015 and
it's probably the best Samsung
smartphone in history to us that makes
it worth every penny this review was
