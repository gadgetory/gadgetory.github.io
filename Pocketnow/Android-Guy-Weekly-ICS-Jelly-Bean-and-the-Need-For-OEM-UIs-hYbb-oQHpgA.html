bean and omu eyes why do we have them
and why are they good for us that's what
we're gonna talk about in today's
episode of the Android guy weekly so in
UI or a user interface is basically the
design the environment in which you do
stuff on your phone or tablet now it
looks a little bit different from tablet
to tablet there are different themes and
there are different launchers and apps
and whatnot it's really kind of
confusing but just know that it all just
works so why do we have these different
things well let's do some history first
Ice Cream Sandwich came along to really
speed things up it was an overhaul of
the entire underpinnings of the device
now this was really really important and
it helped bring Android essentially from
honeycomb which was like we said earlier
a necessary evil up into a modern
smoother OS something that could be used
on higher-end hardware and really helped
propel Android past where it was and
into where it will be Ice Cream Sandwich
was the refinement of that was really a
good thing let's go all the way back to
cupcake I know I love these names just
as much as you do and there's kind of
some sarcasm there and kind of not
cupcake I think that was version 1.5 it
was the initial Android that came out on
the g1 long long long ago it didn't look
all that pretty it did what it needed to
do but it didn't look good while it was
doing it was kind of a drawback instead
what it had was something that no other
OS had it was open it had the power of
the open source development movement
behind it it was able to be customized
that's where things get different but
we'll come back to that let's talk about
Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly bean we
talked a little bit about why ice
sandwiches and what it does what it's
doing how it's really really a good
thing for us to have jellybeans is the
next version some people we don't even
know for sure that it's gonna be called
jellybeans that's just what everybody
kind of guesses because J comes after I
and Ice Cream Sandwich starts with I and
what other dessert would start with a J
if you know let us know in the comments
over at pocketnow.com but jellybeans we
also suspect is going to be android
version 5.0 some of us though aren't so
sure yours truly I think it may be
Android version 4.1 maybe 4.2 why is
that we've heard some rumors that
jellybean which is what we're gonna call
it for this video isn't really that much
of an improvement per se over Ice Cream
Sandwich
it's an incremental improvement rather
than a huge leap it's probably going to
look a little bit different but there's
probably gonna be a lot more stuff
happening behind the scenes some more
api's may be open to us there may be
some more support for newer processors
graphics processors and whatnot and
overall tweaks everything that they've
learned up to this point they're going
to include in jellybean
now again probably gonna look a little
bit different but not too much and that
gets us to really the meat of what we're
talking about why do we have all of
these different things to make Android
look different so why do we need all of
these different flavors if you will and
if you'll pardon the pun well a lot of
times you you need to advance because
you don't want to have the same
experience and a new back-end because
users don't know that they want to see
something new they want to experience
something new they don't have to but
they want to and that helps sell devices
which gets us over to OEM customization
people like Motorola and Samsung and
probably some others out there have
customized Android so you're not using
the stock Android experience you've got
a new launcher you've got new apps that
replace the core Android launcher and
core Android
apps now do you have to do that as an
OEM well no you don't have to
it just helps differentiate your product
from somebody else's so with that we're
gonna shift gears just a little bit
we're gonna talk about iOS and the
iPhone okay all of these devices
essentially have the same oh s there are
some differences depending on platform
and you may not have upgraded and might
be stuck on an older version but let's
just say you're running the same OS with
the same look and feel the same
interface everything is the same its
uniqueness through similarity we won't
get off on that tangent but it's the
same it's consistent and people argue
that that's a good thing
in addition and I'm not going to
disagree with that argument right now in
addition you have very very few
platforms that you're running on that
means the device itself the footprint
the height the width the depth it's all
essentially the same now of course as
you're iterating up through the various
different devices you know the iPhone 3
doesn't look the same as the iPhone 4
but the iPhone 4 is the iPhone 4 it's
the same across that makes things really
really really convenient for accessory
manufacturers because now they can
target the iPhone as a platform and only
have to make one set of accessories for
every generation of the phone and not
even that anymore
Android on the other hand it's different
it's not the same it's not uniform it's
not consistent that is what a lot of
people say is its biggest drawback well
I'm gonna argue the other side of that
and say that's its biggest strength you
see people are different I don't want
the same things you want and based on
some of the comments that we've received
in the past you don't want a lot of the
things that I want and that's okay you
see with Android not only can you pick
your carrier but you can pick your
device you can pick your specifications
as
essentially you can pick your version of
Android you can pick what type of
interface you want on it and after the
fact if you don't like no motoblur if
you don't like sense if you don't like
TouchWiz UI guess what you can throw a
third-party launcher onto your device
and essentially you've got a device that
looks exactly like you want it because
you are the person that makes that
decision but things are different
that means OMS can sell different
products it's not all the same thing
there are lots of competitors in the
market that's one of the reasons why
Google is pushing out so many updates to
the Android OS all these different
people are throwing in new stuff a new
processor dual core quad core dodeca
core you see manufacturers are coming
out with all kinds of different
variations why because people like you
and I want them some people might want a
720p HD screen some people may want a
screen that's more visible in bright
light then it looks good inside with no
light some people might want a keyboard
on the device some people might want
that keyboard to slide out some people
might not like the Sense UI some people
might not like motoblur you see because
of android and it's open nature people
OMS and carriers can make different
devices that fit different types of
people and then different types of
people come in and adopt Android why
because it's not all the same it does
what they want it to do it looks like
they want it to do so why do we have all
of these different options why is there
so much differentiation because we're
all different Android is really the only
operating system that allows for that
pure freedom and flexibility to adapt to
all of those differences between us out
there now Windows Mobile that's kind of
the halfway point
I said Windows Mobile but I really mean
Windows Phone it's a hard habit to break
guys it's halfway you see OMS can pick
it up and install it on their devices
and their devices can be differentiated
but they can't customize it as much as
Android so we might see Windows Phone
really take off and accelerate because
it's got kind of the halfway between
Android which is anything you want and
everything you want an iPhone which is
only what they say a Windows Phone is
somewhere in the middle I don't know if
they realize the strength that they have
in that position just yet we'll have to
wait and see in the meantime I'm gonna
stick with Android if you want to choose
a different OS that's fine because you
and I are different if you liked this
video go ahead and give it a big thumbs
up if you want to comment on it please
head over to the new version of
pocketnow.com put your comments over
there we're gonna try and drive
