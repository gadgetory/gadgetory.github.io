around we tell you why the Verizon iPad
is your best choice and the new iPad is
hot and I mean that literally all this
and more coming up right now
hello we're one I'm Hina with
pocketnow.com and welcome to the pocket
nail I review the show we go through all
this week school and the not so cool has
had the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's talk this week off with what's
cool
well apple's new ipad is hot and sadly
that goes both ways so stay tuned for
the not so cool section as we go through
why that's not necessarily good news but
so far Apple has sold three million
units in just a couple of days after
launch day just to give you an idea took
Apple eighty days to sell those same
three million units for the original
iPad and you and I remember how long it
took for us to get one of those devices
so so far so good for Apple and sales
but sadly again not everything's fun so
stay tuned for the rest and the round of
applications that supports the new iPads
Retina display keeps growing at launch
there were only twenty four titles
supporting the Retina display but as of
now there are already 58 a supporting it
and just hit the filter in the app store
application to get full details of all
the applications that have been enhanced
a good chunk of these are free so it's
really good to hit the filter and keep
updating your applications now an
interesting move from Apple and we
actually even filmed a video about this
Brandon than recently where he shows us
that iPhone applications that are
enhanced for the retina display have
better graphics that even iPad 2 or old
iPad applications that are available in
the App Store so just to give you an
idea the Facebook application for the
tablet and hands version sadly gives you
a lot of pixels with the exception that
if you run the Facebook application for
the iPhone you'll get better graphics
kind of an irony but hopefully that'll
be fixed soon out of this week's
coverage make sure you catch Brandon's
videos on the new iPad we've got four
videos so far first of all we have the
unboxing and hardware tour of the iPad
in comparison to the iPad 2 then we go
through what we love and we hate about
the new my iPad and just the first
weekend of experience
then we have how the iPad manages Retina
display applications from the iPhone
just that we talked about and finally we
have another video where we tell you
which iPad is best to choose and why the
Verizon version of the LTE iPad is
better than the AT&amp;amp;T model we also have
Michael Fisher's recent editorial of how
it feels to come from the first
generation iPad to the new iPad iPad 3
or whatever you want to call it all
really good coverage coming up and hey
what would your new iPad be without your
ability to jailbreak it and the dev team
has come on record to show us that
they've already figured out a way to
jailbreak it even though according to
them there's still a lot more work to do
so so far so good sadly we still don't
have any dates as to when we could
expect it either tethered or even
untethered but hopefully they will get
this figured out soon trust me
anything's better than having your iPad
locked anyways and before we get to the
not so cool section recent reports that
Apple already placing orders for an LTE
equipped iPhone which is kind of a
no-brainer but sadly that's not fun and
games because apparently Apple is
ordering the same 3.5 inch displayed for
this iPhone and the cake topping is
taken by none other than orders for
October 2012 release when we were
expecting it to be launched in June now
what's interesting here is the fact that
Apple had to figure out how to fit a 42
watt hour battery into the new iPad in
order to provide LTE support and also
power for the new Retina display so it's
kind of a no-brainer to consider that
Apple should consider the rumors of a
4.6 inch display only to make the iPhone
bigger in order to fit a bigger battery
and therefore have the same battery life
that we currently get in the iPhone 4
because the iPhone 4s was sadly not as
good so hopefully Apple will take these
hints and bring a larger design
hopefully Donny is listening to this and
well Johnny since I just gave you the
idea how about if I get the 1 million
pounds a year that you get just as a
compensation you know just so us first
to be even
all right so that√≠s for the cool that's
continue on with the not so cool just as
we get a new iPad we also get a new list
of complaints first of all we have
complaints about the device heating up
even though in our personal tests we
didn't find the device to heat up that
bad even with tough games and processing
power now it could be just something
specific to certain devices so art by C
you take it to a genius barn let them
tell you or probably could even get a
swab for that device now second of all
they're also complaining about Wi-Fi
gate issues apparently there's something
wrong with Wi-Fi and the device
connecting to Wi-Fi routers I've been
experiencing this problem with the iPad
2 on iOS 5.1 so apparently this has to
do with software but let's just hope
that they don't take weeks to figure
that one out
and third of all it seems that people
are complaining about the Smart Covers
it seems that the first generation smart
foot covers are not working with the new
iPad so our advice to you is sadly
you're gonna have to buy a new smart
cover the new generation color smart
covers you can see the difference here
are apparently working with a new iPad
better than the old ones so that the
smart cover was built from October on
with the refresh in colors apparently
these are the ones that are gonna be
working well with the new iPad sad news
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high memory
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
