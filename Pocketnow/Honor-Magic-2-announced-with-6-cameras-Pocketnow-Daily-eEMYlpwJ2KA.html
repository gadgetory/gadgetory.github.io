brings six cameras yes six cameras if
you have an Apple watch series four do
not update unless you can want to make
your watch unusable and Samson just
trademark a new infinity display name
that might come to the foldable galaxy
ex-im hi Natalie that I and I was
supposed to wear a costume today
and it turns out that because it's green
I didn't want to play the Invisible Man
happy Halloween guys this is pocket out
daily the official news today begin with
a product announcements as a Nubia has
just announced the new BX and I love the
comments today where everybody's like oh
my god you just launched the video that
says the most interesting phone of the
year and now we've got the new BX why is
it interesting there's no knotch and
it's got two screens to full-blown
colored AMOLED screens on each side good
specifications it's most probably not
gonna leave China but you can learn more
about it in the description now let's
talk about Apple as the company has just
launched iOS 12.1 which has a major
improvement when it comes to iPhones
first of all you get multiple FaceTime
for different people up to 32 people I
believe and then the other is that those
of you interested in getting dual-sim
capabilities this is a firmware update
enables it you know what the problem is
the carrier's like Verizon and t-mobile
are apparently never going to support it
and AT&amp;amp;T is waiting on I don't know what
so dual sim iPhones that won't work
that's what you get man and guess what
is another thing that's not gonna work
watch OS 5.1 on the Apple watch series
for is apparently rendering watches
useless and that's one of the main
reasons why I wait for software updates
particularly I'm not using the Apple
watch but with the Apple watch so yeah
make sure you do not update your watch
just yet Apple apparently pulled
everything and they're working on a fix
so for those of you that are having
issues visit your local Apple Apple
Store now let's talk about Samsung as a
we are literally just a couple of days
away from the company's developer
conference where we're expecting to see
the foldable Galaxy S line and yes there
is a new Infiniti display patent out
there and trademark the Infinity V and
well if the product is gonna fold like
this and that then it makes all the
sense in the world for it to be called
the infinity V weather we're gonna see
it or not at this event is hard to
predict but we'll keep you posted
and finally the hottest news today has
to do with the honor magic - well mainly
because it was teased that an event
months ago now we finally get to see it
we've got a sliding mechanism for six
cameras three at the front one being the
camera and the other being two def
sensors to a certain degree and then the
other three with different functionality
including a monochrome camera etc etc
that's all fine and dandy specifications
care 980 processor and just about all
the bells and whistles of a true
flagship you know what's not of a true
flagship the fact that the retail price
being seized is somewhere around five
hundred and fifty bucks that's insane
let us know in the comments what do you
think about the honor magic I mean yes
definitely honor to a certain degree as
part of Huawei but I love how they've
pulled in their own identity completely
ever since the honor eight I'm really
looking forward to this product but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
what I'm talking out on kind of
descriptive both of our channels English
and Spanish for more videos like this
one you can follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore leave it on Instagram at high
Meadow you gotta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
