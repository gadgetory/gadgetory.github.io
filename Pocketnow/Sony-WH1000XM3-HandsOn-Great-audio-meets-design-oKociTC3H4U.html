quite a handful to pronounce but
something you really won't care about
once you put them on and listen in
reporting from Aoife and berlin i'm high
metal even out with pocket now and let's
go hands-on
there was one thing that Sony knows is
audio but my experience with the mark
twos was that we had great audio on a
really bulky design the mark 3 SAR all
about refinements in both that
department and also audio quality the
feel of the mark 3 is is metallic though
there is some plastic here and there now
tone with some copper accents on the
branding Sony has worked on reducing the
overall footprint of the headphones
avoiding the gap piece made between the
headband and the ear muffs like
seriously you look a lot better using
them now to assist in prolong use
there's also some added cushioning at
the top of the band and your ears will
regularly fit inside the ear muffs you
pair them through NFC were supported and
controls are swipe gestures if you want
to skip tracks raise or lower volume if
you tap and hold you also activate
either the Google assistant or Siri
depending on what phone you're using
there's also a Sony connect application
for the headphones that take them
further when it comes to functionality
but the app wasn't ready at our hands on
time there are two buttons one for
switching them on and off or pairing the
other is for activating ambient sound in
case you want to hear the outside world
through the microphones and for active
noise cancellation and speaking of that
active noise cancellation is the
signature feature from Sony regularly
companies provide great noise
cancellation at the expense of great
audio but not here these headphones are
loud and they are rich I've actually
really enjoyed my experience so far and
using them for the past few days there's
also a 30 hours of battery life and the
unique trick that there is USBC
connection that supports fast charging
meaning you can get up to 5 hours of a
charge in just 15 minutes
overall the mark threes are in my
opinion a significant improvement to
their predecessors and my first
impression has them above the bose qc25
s which also retail at around the same
$350 that sony is asking for these Mark
threes still I do need to try them out
for more time so stay tuned for our full
review coming very soon
Sony also announced the new SRS xB 501 G
wireless speaker yes another mouthful
but it brings quite the party in a size
that's a lot smaller than it seems for
the demo also this is a product
I need to test further while that
happens our coverage of e field 2018
just begins we've got more videos coming
up very soon so make sure you follow us
on social media subscribe to our channel
as well for more videos like this one
you can follow me on Twitter hi managers
quarterly that are on instagram @ how
you met any better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm highly mentally that I think so
much for watching we'll see you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
