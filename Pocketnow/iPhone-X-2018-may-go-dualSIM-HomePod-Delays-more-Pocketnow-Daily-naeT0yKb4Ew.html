network capabilities for 2018 the
Samsung Galaxy X already has a landing
page as a foldable phone becomes a
reality and we continue to get an
enticing couple of deals for Black
Friday being announced I'm hey meadow
Iveta and this is about that time when
my credit card does not like me to be
around amazon.com this is PocketNow
daily the official lucid I begin with
deals but not from a store believe it or
not if you're in the market for Spotify
it is currently free for new subscribers
for three months and then obviously
you'll have to sign them but even those
of you that are current customers the
thing about it is you can't just opt in
for it but if you cancelled or suspended
your account for any reason before
October 21st you're actually eligible
for this deal you can learn more in the
description other interesting deals come
from Sprint there are a few that you can
watch in the description but most
important is the one that includes the
essential phone because you can get that
phone for $5 a month and if you do the
math you're pretty much just paying 145
dollars for it and for those of you that
the bait if the essential phone is worth
it or not
titanium ceramic and for those of you
that complain about the camera I'm sure
that it takes better photos than any
phone at 145 bucks so I would definitely
consider this deal now it's all about
the Samsung Galaxy X we are expecting a
foldable device to be announced at some
point in 2018 and for those of you that
are doubting that this would ever happen
there is already a landing support page
on Samsung com meaning yes we can expect
this product to be announced at some
point we're just not sure if it'll make
it outside of Korea or Japan or whatever
market its targeting because flip phones
haven't come to the States in a while
and for those of you that are expecting
to buy the home pod this holiday season
you can forget about it
Apple has just published a statement and
I love how they publish these states
with fur they're like we can't wait for
people they always use that phrase we
can't wait for people to get their hands
on the home pod but sadly they need a
little more time and that little more
time is going to be early 2018 the
problem is early 2018 can take months
you know the way
and hafs work so no hope odd and finally
the very interesting rumors that they
have to do with the whole debacle
between Apple and Qualcomm mainly
because apparently there are reports
that both companies are working together
on something for the 2018 iPhone of the
specific variant of whatever iPhone 10
or whatever number that's going to be
that's going to bring dual-sim
capabilities we know that Apple really
wants to make a statement in China it's
been losing market share forever and
China is one of those markets where dual
SIM phones are the way to go so it's
interesting that Apple wants to take
this approach and apparently Qualcomm is
going to be the partner to build these
photos but at least we see the question
today I mean forget about China do you
care about dual SIM phones because in my
case I find them convenient I just
rarely ever used to Sims
