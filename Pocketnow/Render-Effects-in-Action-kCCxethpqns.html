a while back I wrote an article about a
developer over at xda-developers comm
that had postulated an idea about
turning off one particular color set in
the LCD panel so we used our Android
phones well back then it was just a cool
idea and I gave you some screenshots
today I want to show you not only has
how that's been implemented but also a
widget that lets you do it really
quickly and I'll talk about some things
that are cool and some things that are
not so cool about this method and how to
go about doing it let's go take a look
okay so what I've done here is this is
my Nexus One it is running CyanogenMod
version 6.0 rc2 which is a Froyo build
but it's got these extra bits in it so
I've launched the the settings here let
me go back one step I've launched the
phone settings and then all the way down
to the bottom is this CyanogenMod
setting so I'm gonna go in there and
that's where you're not you'll notice in
the user interface section that we have
render effect now in render effect right
now we have none it's using the default
rendering mode let's change that to red
and immediately you can see that it's
changed the entire interface over to
this monochrome red and it's still very
usable you know I can come in here I can
still identify what all of my apps are
looking at my icons I can still read my
email it's still very very usable it's
just a monochrome read now this comes in
really really handy ok let me see if I
can adjust the camera here a little bit
to let you see a little bit closer I
don't know how that's going to come
across but looking at it on screen it
looks just like the normal screen just
red and it's kind of cool if you're at
all used to doing anything outside at
night or even inside at night you know
that after your eyes have been
accustomed to the dark if you turn on
your phone even for an instant that
white light just blinds you it gives you
what's called night
- so to preserve your night vision you
can use red now red is a lot kinder on
the eyes and you can turn on your phone
look at it do whatever you need to and
then turn it off and you still have good
night vision so that's really cool let's
go back into the settings here so we'll
go back home go back into settings back
down to CyanogenMod settings user
interface and render effect let's go to
terminal
now this one is just like the old
fashioned command prompt terminals
you'll still see those around in
terminal apps and whatnot where it's
green text on a black background not all
that useful just for around the town for
for doing anything it's not as useful
like the red is for preserving your your
night vision but let me show you a
couple others and then I'll tell you why
these are really kind of cool here's a
kind of a dark blue and it looks a lot
lighter on the camera screen than it
does down here this is almost a purple
it's going and look at another one we'll
look at amber Amber's kind of got a
yellow hue to it it's a lot more
mustardy on my phone than what I've seen
on the camera
salmon kind of a dark dull grayish pink
and then fuchsia now why might these be
important well right now it's just kind
of cool but if you are someone who has
color blindness where you cannot see a
particular color or colors like a vast
majority of a lot a majority but a very
good number of males a lot of them have
color blindness now I'm lucky I don't
have color blindness but here's one
aspect where I think this could really
come in play
let me go ahead and switch this back to
no render effect and then I want to go
back over here out of CyanogenMod
settings to just the regular settings so
here we are we're looking at this and we
have something down here called
accessibility now in accessibility we've
got sound
back talk back kickback and yada yada
yada so we've got a whole bunch of stuff
that we can turn on that will help us if
we have whatever disabilities to be able
to use these phones now one thing that
this doesn't do is anything regarding
colorblindness you just can have to live
with the phone now using some of these
render effects you might as a colorblind
male or the few colorblind females that
are out there you might be able to see
the phone better using one of these
render effects now another thing the
render effects do because you're using
less pixels you're actually not using
the green which are two sub pixels there
are two green sub pixels through every
pixel and one blue sub pixel to every
pixel you're only using the red sub
pixel you're saving all that power so
effectively you're turning off all of
your green in your blue and only using
the red which is the most color or most
power efficient color on the phone to
display what you want to look at so
you're saving an awful lot of energy by
not displaying the full color set so I
mean that's one use and whether or not
you know you can do that whether or not
you can live with having it all in red
for example is really up to you but it's
neat that you can do it but a colorblind
individual might get a better user
experience by going in and choosing one
of these render effects so I'd really
like to see Google incorporate this or
something like it into the accessibility
options that's built into the phone
specifically to help colorblind
individuals so I would like to know if
you're a colorblind which one of those
and I know this is just a phone shot
through a camera you're looking at on a
monitor so there's a lot of variables
involved but which one of these looked
best to you or did any of them look good
the the red the green the blue the amber
the salmon or the fuchsia in fact if
you've got CyanogenMod 6rc 2 on your
phone and can try this out I would like
to know which one works
best for you and then I'd also like to
know what type of colorblindness you
have so and I'm sorry I don't know an
awful lot about colorblindness to
identify them but if you are a red-green
colorblind person which one of these
works best for you or none of the above
if you've got a different type of
colorblindness let us know what that is
and let us know what render effect works
best for you or if none of them did and
if there are any engineers out there
from Google watching I'd also be
interested to hear from you to see if
this is something that you might be
interested in taking up the flagpole and
seeing if some of the executives at
Google would like to incorporate this
into the stock Android build so kind of
interesting kind of neat and something
that you just really need to see on your
phone to get an idea of I hope I've
shown you here kind of a rough idea
please if you have any comments go ahead
and leave those below if you liked the
video if you liked the concept of
different color schemes for
colorblindness using the LCD itself go
ahead and give this video a thumbs up
subscribe to our video channel in case
you have not done so already and yes I
know that means you yeah yeah you right
there click the subscribe button okay
good deal Thanks
all right now everybody else head on
over to pocketnow.com check out all of
the latest articles that we have running
so showing off the render of X
capabilities of the phone with some
possible uses practical uses for them
