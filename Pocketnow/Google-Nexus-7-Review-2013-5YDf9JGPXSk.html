Nexus 7 last week the question now is
can it fill the shoes of its predecessor
better yet is it worth the upgrade or
230 dollars I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is our four of you of the new
Nexus 7 the new Nexus 7 and old model
have just enough in common to tell the
two are related but there is no
mistaking how much more refined the new
Nexus 7 truly is a soos quite literally
improved all the sore points of the
original Nexus 7 with the new model it
made the tablet nearly 6 millimetres
narrower allowing the tablet to slip in
to coat and pant pockets more easily the
tablet is also 1.8 millimeters thinner
and 50 grams lighter for an overall 200
millimeters tall 114 millimeters wide
8.7 millimeters thick and 290 grams even
for a 7-inch tablet the Nexus 7 is small
and it fits quite easily in one hand the
contoured backside which is composed of
a high quality soft touch plastic lens
to the ability to Palm the device easily
it doesn't attract fingerprints and
allows you to get a nice firm grip on
the tablet under the hood is where this
tablet shines no the 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro chipset is
not the latest and greatest but it's
certainly no slouch either it comes with
2 gigabytes of RAM either 16 or 32
gigabytes of fixed storage a 5 megapixel
camera around back 1.2 megapixel front
camera a 3950 milliamp hour battery
Qi wireless charging NFC and Wi-Fi b/g/n
it's also blue through smart ready and a
t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon compatible LTE
model would launch soon the display is
possibly the best part of this tablet
the contrast isn't the best and the
colors lack that certain pop we love so
much but this is the first tablet to
feature a truly high-resolution display
the 7 inch IPS LCD panel features a
resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels for a
total pixel density of 323 pixels per
inch
it offers wide viewing angles it's
considerably bright and it's notably
more crisp and clear than any other like
size tablet as far as Hardware goes the
Nexus 7 is spectacular it feels great in
the hands and it certainly feels more
high-end than its price tag eludes the
software is exactly what you would
expect of a Nexus branded tab
it ships with the latest version of
Android version 4.3 and will always be
among the first devices to receive
over-the-air updates we've gone over
Android 4.3 a few times now so we won't
bore you with too many details this
version has all the things we've come to
expect of recent versions of Android
daydream mode lock screen widgets
multi-user support separated pulldown
menus for quick toggles and
notifications and a gesture based
keyboard one great new feature from
Android 4.3 however is multi-user
support with restricted profiles you can
create multiple user accounts and
restrict which applications those users
can access this is a fantastic feature
for families who may share a single
tablet as far as the absent goes we're
happy to see that the things are
improving for Android tablets
fortunately the effect of running a
phone application on a 7-inch tablet
isn't nearly as bad as it is on a
10-inch counterpart but we're happy to
see that of the 30 or so applications
we've installed on our Nexus 7 only two
are not optimized for use with tablets
that's a far cry from just one year ago
we've been putting the Nexus 7 through
the wringer for the last several days
and we've counted a total of one
performance hiccup which was during the
initial setup process the rest of our
time of the Nexus 7 has been buttery
smooth opening applications switching
apps returning home switching
orientation and scrolling is as polished
as we've ever experienced on an Android
tablet we had no trouble playing various
graphic intensive games either and this
tablet's performance in synthetic
benchmarks is nothing to scoff at with
last year's chipset under the hood we
never expected it to set any records but
its benchmark scores are quite
impressive the dual speakers face
outward making them perfect for cupping
your hands around but they aren't all
that great they're loud but very tinny
without a lot of depth
you'll probably fare better listening to
media and playing games with headphones
but if you're going to use the dual
speakers at least they're not terribly
easy to completely cover also the camera
isn't anything to get excited over but
what tablet camera is we're glad it's
there as it may be useful for capturing
documents but the overall image quality
is mediocre the 5 megapixel camera
offers wash to help grainy dull images
finally battery life the cell inside
isn't giant and sure battery life while
in use could be better
as usual doing graphic intensive stuff
will kill the battery quickly
but the standby time is phenomenal
sitting for over 24 hours on standby the
Nexus 7 managed to drop only 5% on extra
heavy days the battery should last you
into the late evening but on light days
of use you may only need to charge the
tablet every other day add all of this
up and we're quite pleased we'll venture
to say that Google and Asus have created
one of the very best Android tablets
ever best of all is cheaper than just
about anything else out there and it's
display is the highest resolution
display on a small tablet to date
frankly if you're in the market for a
new tablet the new Nexus 7 should be
near the top if not at the very top of
your list of tablets to check out we
give the Nexus 7 and 8 point 7 out of 10
