is now live a 130 dollar nexus 7 begins
to surgeon rumors and LG's advertising
makes you want to throw a rock at them
I'm hi Mary Vanna and according to the
Mayans this message will self-destruct
in six hours and this is poking out
daily that's right our final reveal the
Sam szigeti VES is now live and there is
a lot to say Sammy made one of the
boldest moves of the windows phone surf
by releasing more of a business-minded
phone in comparison to the other
competitors like Nokia for example
bringing the red and yellow colors etc
now that the Vice score was 8.5 out of
10 and there are a lot of compelling
reasons why so don't let me bore you
here hit the links in the description
and watch the videos and read the full
review now rumors of a $99 Nexus 7 have
been so common we're now bored it's
extremely difficult for any manufacturer
out there to be able to build a tablet
that's that cheap and with so much power
now that being the case there were
already some rumors of a pricing for a
cheaper Nexus 7 tablet or a nexus tablet
just in case and apparently will be
priced between 130 and 150 bucks what we
don't know is if this will be the same
Nexus 7 design tablet or if we'll be
getting the same design with lesser
specs or a different tablet whatsoever
time will tell we'll keep you posted now
Samsung has just confirmed there'll be
nice of their customer base sometime
probably next year apparently they'll be
offering the windows phone 7.8 upgrade
to all of their legacy devices and that
is all of their legacy devices including
the first generation focus that was one
of the first Windows Phone devices to be
launched when those phone 7 that is now
the only problem here is we still don't
know what date and sadly I don't even
think Microsoft does now Apple's
policies are sometimes good and
sometimes a pain in the we'll keep this
video in PG the thing is there's this
Kickstarter company called p 0 p that
built this portable charging station
with a big battery in order to charge
iOS devices now guess why they're
refunding the money the capitalists that
everybody they raised money from well
because they're lightning connector for
iOS devices is sadly proprietary and
Apple did not approve the product talk
about a
great way to just kill a company Apple
now p 0 p i wonder why you guys are
being stupid enough to give back the
money i mean android windows phone
blackberry just about every other device
on the market uses micro USB don't
return the money build something for
android do it now it's a good idea and
finally for the teeth cringing news of
the day LG has just aired a new ad
claiming all the benefits you'd get if
you order a new beautiful nexus 4 from
the Play Store and the reason why this
is so ironic is because the only reason
why you me and millions of other people
don't have a nexus 4 yet is because LG
isn't able to supply demands that leads
you to the question of the day are you
still waiting for a nexus 4 in my case
I've been waiting for so long in the
process the free order was so stupid I'm
sticking to my galaxy nexus but leave us
a comment down below what are you doing
and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet well make sure you
follow us on parking now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks
for watching see you tomorrow hopefully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
