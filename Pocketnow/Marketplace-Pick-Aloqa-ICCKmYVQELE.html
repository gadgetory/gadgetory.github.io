Pacquiao calm and today I wish you a
l'acqua which is location-based program
which will show you events restaurants
movies pretty much anything that's
around your area so if I look on here I
have many different categories and as
you can see there's a number next to
them this one says 1025 1410 so these
are all different categories and events
and items that are actually inside of
that category so if i go to yelp
restaurants it'll show you which
restaurants are around my area and
actually give me the yelp rating so if
you can see this restaurant at the top
it got three and a half stars the next
one got five so it goes on and on and
there's many different restaurants that
you can choose from so we'll go back if
i want to look at yelp bars and pubs i
can go here and i can see which bars and
pubs are around my area and which one's
got the highest ratings and go back can
also see what's playing tonight so i'm
going to watch a certain movie i can go
to this and let's say that i wanted to
watch avatar 3d i can see when the next
showing is and which is the closest
theater so it says that this is the
closest theater to my area and that it's
playing at seven and ten thirty so we'll
go back so if I'm out and about i need
some cash i can quickly and easily hit
the ATM button it shows there's ten ATMs
in my area and the closest one is 1.3
miles so go back again so if i wanted to
learn about my area all i have to do is
go to Wikipedia so let's say I wanted to
look at the ryan house I'll have to just
click on here and it will give me a
little image if someone's taken a photo
would actually upload it to Wikipedia
and give us a little blurb about what
that historical icon is so we'll go back
and back again and we can also add
different channels so if you wanted to
add a channel here launch internet
explorer or whatever your default
internet browser is so l'acqua has many
channels as you can see whatever you can
think of to do during the weekend or
whatever night you have off or whatever
you want to do is pretty much on here
let's say you wanted to find a redbox
and that's a place where you can get
DVDs all you have to just click on here
so it gives you a little description
about what redbox actually is easy DVD
rentals no late fees renton return it
over 19,000 locations so if it
so I can just add this okay so now that
I've added the red box I can click on
this little icon and it will actually
show me which locations the red boxes
are located at so i would see i have
fred meyers and a couple Walmart's so we
can go back so I can also edit my ilaqua
if I go down to menu and to edit ok so
here I am on my subscribe channel so
let's say I wanted to change the housing
because I didn't really want that one on
there I can just click on here now if i
want i can either go back or i can
delete the channel so i'm just going to
delete it because i don't think that i
would use this one very often and it's
going to ask me to confirm and I'm say
yes someone hit the little check mark
and it will say my channel housing was
removed so I'm going just go back and
now I'm back to my ilaqua homepage and
as you can see it deleted it and moved
over the add channel so this is a
l'acqua and the program is actually free
and very quite convenient and this is
another marketplace pick where he picks
them useful and interesting applications
from windows mobile marketplace thanks
