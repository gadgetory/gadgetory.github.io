video renders and everything you could
think about the LG G 7 is reportedly
still on scheduled but we're actually
not sure what that means and prepare as
it seems that there is a modern iPad in
the works
I'm Jaime Rivera and believe it or not
this would be the second video edited by
my son kudos to you they go thank you so
much this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
as much as the essential phone has not
been met with fanfare it still continues
to be a great device and the camera has
gotten a lot better over time it
currently is on Amazon for just 434
bucks so if I have to pick between any
other options available on Amazon for
that price range I'd probably go for the
essential phone you can learn more in
the description now let's talk about LG
in a very interesting turn of events I
mean we've been covering for the past
couple of weeks that there will be no g7
at MWC and yet the company has just
pretty much published a statement that
confirms that the company is still
working on the g7 that it is still on
schedule but at this time the only press
invite we don't have from the BC is LG
so exactly what does on schedule mean is
one of the biggest questions as the Gees
have historically been announced at MWC
we'll keep you posted now let's move the
spotlight over to iOS 11.3 there are a
couple of changes like new ant emojis
most interesting is the fact that
eventually at some beta because it's
currently on beta 1 we will be getting
the update that will bring the whole
power of management feature it's still
not there most interesting if you dig
within the firmware there is a modern
iPad being mentioned now for those of
you that didn't know the iPhone 10 was
being dubbed the modern iPhone at the
beginning on for more updates so could
this be another iPad that will now bring
face ID and I don't even know why I said
another but you get the point it seems
that we're getting an iPad with face ID
and no bezels that would be awesome
now let's talk about the vivo ex 20 plus
UD that phone that made headlines at at
CES because of the embedded fingerprint
scanner on the display with synaptics
for those of you that are wondering well
the phone will be available in China on
January 29th at a price tag of around
565 bucks which is great we usually
don't cover phones that are exclusive to
China but this one is important because
of the technology that it brings
hopefully it makes it to other
smartphones even if made by the same
parent company and finally the very hot
news today I have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy has 9 we've got like three posts
covering the fact that it's available
now in renders that there's video on
Weibo showing tests that there are case
render leaks and usually these case
makers don't get it wrong so this is
pretty much the final design most
interesting changes are the vertical
design of the fingerprint scanner at the
back not the front with the camera and
also the fact that if you notice the
bezels are slimmer at the top and bottom
all this is great fine and dandy it
leads me to the question today I mean
after all the rumors you've seen do you
like the Samsung Galaxy as 9 as shown on
rumors in my case I honestly love
everything I see that's just me
