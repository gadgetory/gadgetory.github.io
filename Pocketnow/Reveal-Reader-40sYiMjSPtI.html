pocketnow.com today i'd like to show you
an e-book reader called reveal reader
it's free and in the android marketplace
and should run on virtually any android
powered device let me go show you why i
like it ebook reader it's available free
in the android market and it should work
on most modern android devices the thing
that I like about this ebook reader is
it's not like a lot of the e-book
readers that we're seeing in the market
which is just an e-book that you
purchase in the marketplace this is a
free reader that you can download from
an online library or even add your own
ebooks using the ybk format now ybk is
an interesting format it's basically
HTML inside of a zip file so the books
themselves are very small now something
interesting about this this ebook reader
is written by a few guys that are
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of
latter-day saints they're going out and
doing this on their own you may know
these guys better as the Mormons but
don't let that turn you off this is
first and foremost a scriptures app and
as such you can have let me go back here
to my home screen you can have a whole
bunch of scriptures now this of course
is their standard works it has their
scriptures it but it does have the Old
Testament New Testament those are the
King James Version so kind of cool there
but the part that I like about this is
in addition to having all those
scriptures so if you're looking for a
scriptures app this is a really really
good one you can go to this online ebook
download and grab some other stuff some
fiction and nonfiction these are pretty
much public domain books and I'm
probably scrolling too fast for you to
see what they are but you've got stuff
like the last of the mohicans the
Odyssey the Iliad dr. Jekyll and mr.
Hyde treasure island all kinds of stuff
and you can download these this is a
constantly being
dated library you can download these
right here free of charge over the air
and it only takes a couple minutes so to
show you that let's grab 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea we're going to download it
and i'll show you the status bar there
so right there really quick let's go
back and look at that 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea I'll tap on that here you
go let's jump to chapter 10 the man of
the sea and now there's my text it's all
very easily scrolled if i want to go to
the next chapter i can 11 chapter 12
just by swiping side to side that's a
feature I haven't seen on very many
ebook readers and I really like it here
so if you're looking for a religious
ebook reader this is an awesome one very
very good if you're looking for just a
generic ebook reader for public domain
books or maybe you want to make your own
ebooks you can do that easily as well
with third-party tools for your desktop
that will let you compile your books
into the ybk format so it's worth giving
a look I like it it's something that
I've had on my android since the very
very beginning their first version in
fact and I'm really impressed with it so
if you like this video please give us a
thumb up if you have any suggestions or
recommendations for other ebook readers
go ahead and leave us some comments
below and if you would like to stay up
to date with other apps like this and
with other videos along the mobile
computing line of thought go ahead and
subscribe to our Channel so again for
pocket now calm I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
