pocket now calm and in this video i'm
going to show you one of the ways that
you can get the sense UI from the HTC
hero on to a windows mobile device now
the sense UI lets you have seven
customizable home screens and you may
have seen this in our videos on HTC hero
so we can have one screen for email one
screen for weather and a combination of
things you can add a variety of
different widgets and move them around
on the screen although some widgets
don't fit and you need a larger swath of
space for but it really lets you
customize the way that you kind of
interact with your device and what you
see when you turn on your device in
windows mobile here we have a touch pro
2 and we're actually running a skin on
top of spb mobile shell three that looks
very very similar to the the sense UI
theme so we have seven home screens you
can flick your finger to go to the left
and go to the right same kind of
background here and let me show you what
I've done so here I have a clock with an
indicator for email SMS a calendar plus
next appointment that's my main screen
so I can see where I need to be to the
right I can see the weather current
temperature or I can tap on that to get
the forecast this is all part of mobile
shell three except for some of this part
here i have a widget showing me my next
two appointments is that instead of just
one have a media player here some
shortcuts down here and if we go to the
other screen I've got three pictures of
people that I call on a regular basis so
kind of let's go through customizing one
of these screens so we go to the bottom
right corner click this button and click
add widget we get a ton of widget
choices so we can go to application or
contact or even a link to show the today
screen we can go to email we can do
various indicators such as the weather
we can put a big old clock let's get one
of these clocks clock 16 let's see what
it looks like we can reposition it on
the screen it kind of snaps to so that
you kind of Center it a little better
and let's go back and add some more
widgets we can add a next appointment
widget which shows up to you saw one
with two
show the one with 5 this is really
helpful so we have a next appointment
widget with up to five things but now we
probably want to take the clock off the
screen so we can go to edit layout and
sort of reposition this and remove it
and so now this whole entire screen is
taken up for my next appointments let's
go to the one for the left and customize
it just a little bit more lots of lots
of clocks we can go to different sorts
of weather notifications this is one of
the smallest weather notifications
although there are a variety of other
ones
that one's a little better much large
your weather notification again if you
tap on that you get the forecast so a
lot of ways to sort of customize all of
these home screens and it really brings
that usefulness of the sense UI to
Windows Mobile with the skin but the
integration doesn't stop there we can go
down to launcher and program a grid of
12 of our favorite program so if we go
to the up button and edit we can click a
plus button go to one of our programs
and add it to the list there in the grid
also if we click the plus button we get
to the extended program launcher which
you can use to launch programs and
change various system settings so we'll
post a link on pocketnow.com on how
exactly to get this going there will be
a link in the sidebar to get you right
to that post but that is sense UI or one
of the ways you can get sense UI from
the hero onto a windows mobile device
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
