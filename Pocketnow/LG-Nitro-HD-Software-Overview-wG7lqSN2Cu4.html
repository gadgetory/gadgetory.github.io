pocket now calm and you recently watched
us unbox the LG nitro HD on AT&amp;amp;T well in
this next video we're going to give you
a further in-depth look at these
software that comes pre-loaded on the LG
nitro HD and how it runs some of its
apps so without further ado let's dive
in and we're back now one of the first
things we want to take a look at is the
version of Android that this device is
running heading into our settings menu
you will see that it is running Android
2.3 point 5 obviously it's not ice cream
sandwich which is Android version four
point oh however LG has promised that
this device will be upgraded in the near
future LG only has a few Android devices
out there so it's very tough to judge
their track record we'll have to see how
soon that update actually arrives
returning back to the home screen one of
the first features we want to point out
here is a notification bar it's your
typical notification bar however LG with
their custom skin has added some quick
launch buttons here for silent mode for
example turn off volume going to vibrate
you can turn your Wi-Fi on and off your
Bluetooth your GPS or put your phone
into airplane mode very quickly the
choice is yours this does offer some
shortcuts and getting things done a
little faster as mentioned LG has put
their own skin over the android
operating system here which is typical
from the non-google experience devices
which is practically any device being
sold with a manufacturer's name in the
title for example the LG nitro HD
manufacturers name in the title
therefore you're going to have a skin
that's how it sits for now unfortunately
many of you commented on our unboxing
video that the skin closely resembles
touchwiz 3.0 and you're right it
definitely does resemble touchwiz 3.0 it
gives you almost an iOS if that's a word
and iose if that's a word type feel the
icons are very colorful cartoonish
almost especially when you go into the
grid option here and you can see they're
very colorful and
an almost very cartoonish now what
they've done is they've separated the
installed applications from this top
section here and your downloaded
applications down here it has a nice
feel it allows users to see which
applications they've installed in a much
clearer fashion wanting to know was this
stock was this not many times carriers
and manufacturers will install trials of
games such as Madden on the phone you'll
open up madden waiting to play the game
to be shocked surprised and let down to
see it's only a trial well that won't
happen here you can tell what you've
bought what you've downloaded yourself
staying with that let's take a look at
the bloatware the carrier bloatware
that's installed here by AT&amp;amp;T we're
going to have the ATT code scanner
family mapping AT&amp;amp;T Navigator which are
all typical on the ATT Android device
phones live TV which uses the u-verse
that AT&amp;amp;T offers my ATT which we give
you a shortcut right into your account
now those are the 18t notice there is
visual voicemail included on here
without an extra charge but on top of
that you're also going to have for
example get HD games featured apps which
will bring in two separate essentially a
separate market you're going to have mog
moosic which is a music service that you
pay a monthly fee I believe it's ten
dollars to actually download music so
the choice is yours you may like that we
have smart share Wi-Fi share and then of
course will yellow pages and zynga poker
HD the nice thing actually believe it or
not about the zynga poker HD is it does
true take advantage of your
high-definition screen some of the games
out there don't do so I won't get into
this but some of the games out there
don't take advantage of that
high-definition screen which almost
defeats the purpose of having it not
with zynga poker HD if you haven't yet
noticed the LG nitro is a little
different from other Android devices
because there's actually three
capacitive buttons here at the bottom
will look more into those in our
hardware review which would be our next
video but something to show you for now
is the left button here as it's lighting
up is actually a menu and then you can
see the magnifying glass it's actually a
search button as well so a one press
will bring up your settings menu whether
you be on the home screen or in a nap
however if you long
and it may not work it does work here
this will give you that search key so if
you're within an application let's say
you're in the market for example you can
hold down the menu to bring up the
search right from there so it's actually
kind of nice that it eliminates a key
giving this a dual purpose you have the
ability to add seven home screens with
LG skin which is nice if you're really
into customizing your device and putting
a lot of widgets and a lot of icons on
that screen and staying on that they've
actually incorporated essentially an
animation that goes on behind it's
actually a movement or a grid that lines
up why are trying to move icons to show
you where that icon will be so for
example if we grab places here and it
may be tough to see with the finger in
the way but there's actually a pin
they're showing you I should do it this
way there's actually a pin they're
showing you where that app where that
icon will line up so if your first time
Android users or even an experienced
Android user that will help especially
when you're trying to add widgets so
let's go ahead we'll grab this widget
here and we'll bring it over so again
you can see that template is there
showing you what's really going to take
up just kind of a nice side effect next
up let's take a look at the browser very
quickly this is actual one of the first
times we've tested it out let's go ahead
and bring up pocket now calm from
scratch as you can see it hasn't been
typed in yet so we're experiencing this
for the first time together here so
pocketnow.com it may go into the mobile
version at first we can make it load the
full version by scrolling down here to
the bottom clicking on desktop now this
is on home Wi-Fi but as you can see it
is loading fairly quickly let's go ahead
and try and zoom in some of the text
here the zooming isn't bad at all it's
definitely not the smoothest slightly
jerky slightly hesitant almost but it
does do a fairly good job now it has it
finished load and let's go ahead and
give it a few seconds for it to finish
loading before we really judge that and
it has finished loading the page what
you're seeing the occasional loading bar
is actually the ad switching so now
let's go ahead and zoom and it still
isn't the smoothest there's still a
slight hesitation if you enjoyed our
software review please give this video a
thumbs up as always thank you very much
for watching everyone
stay tuned for our continuing coverage
of the LG nitro HD in which we will do a
hardware overview a HD recording test
with the camera on the back and our
final review for more details on the
software this device please visit the
