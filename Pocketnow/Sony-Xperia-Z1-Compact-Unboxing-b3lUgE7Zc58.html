months back and we just got done taking
a look at the t-mobile USA variant the
z1 s now thanks to clove technology
we're taking a gander at a smaller
device but one very much in the same
vein let's unbox the z1 compact I
mentioned clove technology and the intro
folks and I'll do it again this device
comes to us from clove technology it is
a loaner if you have a desire to pick up
a z1 compact yourself head on over to
club's website linked in the description
below and pick one up we thank them for
the courtesy of this demo loaner so
here's the box of the z1 compact we saw
this device at CES 2014 where Sony was
kind of touting it as a no compromise
device meaning it's smaller yes but it
shouldn't have any fewer features than
the z1 well let's find out we'll take
the box top right off of there and
there's the device occupying a very
small portion of the acreage here we
take it out and my immediate impressions
are yes indeed it does have a small
footprint but it ain't all that slim
let's get back to that in a second let's
just see what's in the box looks like we
might have some sort of chamois here's
the say this is a device protector what
are we doing here let's what's actually
happening with this you scraper to
remove air bubble yes indeed this is a
packaged device protector a screen
protector that's pretty cool along with
a cleaning cloth so that you don't get
any dust bubbles underneath there what
else is included here this is a power
adapter this is a USB cable move those
aside to find Hayao headphones included
we don't know well I shouldn't say we I
don't know whether Sony headphones are
any good but anytime we see earbuds
included in a box yes they're free for a
reason they are seldom huge and awesome
at acoustic quality but it's a great
great value add that the carrier's often
take away so this is a good reason to
get devices unlocked if you can afford
it there's are some extra buds in the
clip a lapel clip it looks like in a
micro USB to USB adapter included as
well another nice touch
and then we have all our literature as
well which we will not go too far into
but all the stuff you expect to see sar
information for radiation concern to
start up guide warranty information
safety operations stuff so sliding the
phone from its protective pouch here we
can see that we have some protectors to
peel off that's going to be nice and
I'll tell you that though this thing
only weighs 137 grams because it does
have such a small footprint it feels
heavier than it is and when I say small
footprint some readers have asked us to
bring back our old quick size
comparisons in the unboxings so that's
exactly what we're going to do alongside
the Moto X the difference is well not
that much at all in fact they're very
very close to the same size the Moto X
being a smart phone on the smaller side
of the spectrum but next to a Lumia 1020
you can see the z1 compact is
substantially smaller next to the iPhone
5c it is actually a tad larger 5c all
the iPhones are pretty small as far as
devices go and next to the Nexus 5 once
again a little on the smaller side we're
looking at an angle there some maybe
that's a little deceptive bring this
back up and yeah you can really see that
the difference there the Nexus 5 can't
fit in the frame at this point whereas
the z1 compact is actually quite small
put in the palm of your hand and it's
it's quite a nice little fit and it's
comfy and even though our poor z1 s is
laid up for repair right now we can use
it for a size comparison and bam you can
see once again a significant size
difference they call this thing the
compact for a very good reason it is
thicker but it is also much smaller on
the face now it's time for the
traditional screen peel we'll go ahead
and pull the screen protector off very
nice and while we're down here we'll
mention that the display is a 4.3 inch
720p panel using different display
technology still branded as a triluminos
display but side visibility should be
better if I am remembering right from
CES and let's take the back protector
off here as well
and while we're around back here I'll
also tell you that the camera up here is
twenty point seven megapixels same
resolution same hardware in fact
according to Sony as found on the z1 s
which we just did a camera test with so
we're looking forward to testing this
one out as well that's controlled by a
hardware camera key down here volume key
pronounced power standby button on the
right hand side we'll flip it back
around to the front bring the zoom out
so we can see the thing and then we'll
power on for the first time
press and hold I can already tell you
that the responsiveness of this key the
mechanical travel the click is way
better than it was on the somewhat mushy
z1s there's our headphone jack up front
up top rather sorry about the
out-of-focus we got a pretty tight shot
here and there goes that display those
colors those colors are just gorgeous I
got to tell you and a word on durability
here this device is rated to ip55 and
ip57 dustproof to an extent we'll talk a
little bit more about that in a future
feature as long as these hatches on the
sides are closed this one is for the SIM
card this one here is for the micro SD
cards that I got my finger in the wrong
thing for the micro SD card slot and
then we have finally micro USB for
charging and data sync so you want to
make sure all those hatches are closed
if you do immerse this device time to
select our language and to get this
device set up folks so while we get to
know our new review phone we hope you've
enjoyed this quick look at the Sony
Xperia z1 compact and its box contents
