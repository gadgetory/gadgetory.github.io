pocketnow.com today we're going to take
a hardware tour of the zinc 2 first off
let's slide out the back cover and we're
going to insert the thirteen hundred and
fifty million lithium polymer battery
next we're going to insert the SIM card
i have my AT&amp;amp;T sim card here and we'll
slide that in it slides in fairly easily
but i found it the hard to take out
we'll put the cover back on and then
that slides on easily I was not happy to
find only one telescoping stylus it's
nice to have a spare however it does fit
snugly into the bottom right hand corner
of the unit as we go around the unit
starting with the right hand side we
have a camera button the power button
and the reset button moving on to the
top left hand corner we've got a lanyard
hook then we have the volume plus and
minus buttons then the start button and
the microSD slot I'm not a big fan of an
open a microSD slot because of dust
issues and the possibility of losing the
card I did try the microSD slot with an
eight gigabyte card and it worked with
no issues on the bottom of the unit we
have a mini USB connector and the
microphone
the tour takes us back to the stylist
now let's take a look at the front of
the unit at the top we have the speaker
and we have a flush screen design which
is very nice and is the in style these
days then we have the d-pad in the call
and end button and notice that there's
no right and left softkey buttons so it
will be very interesting to see how that
works on the back of the unit we've got
the 2 megapixel camera and an external
speaker next will power on the unit
first thing that comes up is the mwg
logo then we have the windows mobile 6.1
splash screen and then the today screen
comes up with my AT&amp;amp;T service you can
see the H on the top status bar which
signifies HS PDA service I was a little
dismayed that the auto configuration
utility did not include North American
carriers so i had to configure the data
connection manually which is really not
good also notice the d-pad lighting up
any time you press it a neat feature
well that does it for the external
hardware tour next up data speeds GPS
functionality and the camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
