pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the t-mobile
sidekick 4G specifically the hardware so
sit back relax and enjoy the show
compared to my daily driver the t-mobile
sidekick 4G is about the same size width
length and weight it's just a little bit
longer over here and due to the way that
the edges roll up on either side and
then zit selves for a slightly better
feel in the hand in so far as holding it
landscape versus portrait mode compared
side by side with the screens the
t-mobile sidekick 4G has a much more
warm screen compared to the samsung epic
4g which has a definitely cooler color
the it's hard difficult to see in this
particular view but the brightness even
a full brightness on the t-mobile
sidekick 4G is a little brighter at
least to my eyes compared to the epic 4g
screen sizes is obviously though the
winner here will be the epic 4g but you
know comparing a four-inch screen to a
three-and-a-half inch screen is a
no-brainer viewing angles on the
t-mobile sidekick 4G are actually quite
good try not to get to the glare here
before you but try to show you the that
we don't use lose any real color casting
and there's not really any fading and
it's visible from all angles without
losing visual aspects here we can see
the multicolor LED blinking to give us a
test message it happens about once every
minute I really like this functionality
let's talk briefly about the buttons
that we see here on the t-mobile
sidekick 4G the orientation is obviously
a little funny looking when you're
looking at it from a portrait view the
buttons themselves are nice and cookie
good tactile feel and the button the
area in which you click the button
ranges from all the way on one
edge almost to the middle on either
button and there's a small spot right
there that you can actually click either
one the speaker grill here the the
volume that comes out of it is great I
find that the clarity is good opposed to
the back speaker which I really dislike
the sound of even though it is plenty
loud I don't like the tone that comes
out of there and for those of you who
were took issue with the white comment I
apologize it is a chrome cover on the
cover itself inside it is black is where
the speakers are but inside this case
it's white where that covers up anyway
speakers on the the speaker phone is
that like I said plenty loud enough but
I just don't like the tone if you look
down here at the bottom once again
moving back to the buttons comment and
apologize for just kind of jumping
around but the once again the
orientation seems a little odd until you
look at it from the this angle and
considering the sidekick is a landscape
device and always has been and this
position actually makes sense where you
have easy access with your thumbs and
with these grips on the back to hold on
to to operate this device in a very
efficient manner something I'm getting a
little used to and even your power
button and your volume keys make better
sense down here on the bottom and the
headphone jack because holding it in
this position makes a lot more sense
than holding it in a candy bar style
position with your home screen all the
way at the top and your power button in
an awkward spot down here at the bottom
by default the screen is set to not
rotate unless you pop the screen open or
slide it close this can be adjusted in
the settings I like the fact that they
configured it
so it's simple to use but wonder if some
users are going to start the device up
and turn on the web browser and try to
flip the phone this way and find that it
doesn't actually change the orientation
at all
I really like the way they integrated
this d pad on the sidekick 4G easy
finger swipes back and forth to
highlight new areas to scroll up and
down through zones it works really slick
pretty accurate from what I've found and
you can simply press down firmly on the
button itself to launch whatever view
that you want to go into for example
apps here if i press this then i go into
the app drawer and then back to home as
a nice feel and the buttons on either
side are the same as the buttons on the
top the microUSB door and the microUSB
port located on the same side is the
dedicated camera key button I'm just a
little concerned about this piece of
plastic I've never had good luck with
devices that have a door that has to be
opened and closed multiple times and I
think that in the future we'll probably
see people complaining that this door
comes off it's pretty stiff when you
flip it open there's not much give here
and this could get clipped off pretty
easily it does snap back down in place
and stays in place appropriately and
doesn't actually open very easily as you
can see here speaking of charging the
battery and battery life I found that
the device performed admirably even with
plenty of phone calls today in my test I
was able to make the device last the
entire day with very little issue and
when I put it on the charger to charge
it charged actually very quickly
especially compared to my epic 4g and
perhaps it lasts longer than my epic 4g
because of the smaller screen size or
that they've got the processor clocked
in some fashion even though it is
supposed to be a 1 gigahertz processor
some underclocking or some other things
might be going on there want the wait
for folks at XDA to tell us what's
really happening behind the scenes in
the processor world but again I found
that the battery life was more than
sufficient to last me throughout the day
with plenty of phone calls
the headphone jack is nice and solid I
solid click as you plug things into it
these are my headphones no headphones
included with the device itself what I
did find though is when the headphone
jack is plugged in if you've got one
that's particularly large you may find
that when you're holding the device it's
difficult to get to the volume up button
because the cable will be in the way the
volume levels in the sidekick 4G through
the headphones we're more than
acceptable plenty loud for my ears found
the audio quality to be more than
satisfactory the microphone hold down at
the bottom and thus far I have had very
well endowed no complaints about the
volume levels when making phone calls on
the device I haven't had any issues with
call quality coming in and I haven't had
any issues really with making phone
calls out the only time I did have a
problem with this device thus far was
when my battery got low it made a
strange beeping noise and then turned
off pressing and holding the power
button did turn it back on I did end up
charging the device shortly after that
but I haven't had it happen again so
I'll keep you informed in the full
review if I see that issue come up
the keyboard on the t-mobile sidekick 4g
is nicely spaced as good solid presses
to the buttons they feel nice the only
part that says really thrown me off as
the throw between the keys is a little
wider than I'm used to on the sprint
epic 4g that i normally use so it's
taken me a can't I quite as fast as I I
can on my other phone but I'm finding
that the more I use this device the
faster I can type it does have a backlit
tray and you can see it light up there I
talked briefly about the house solid
this device feels it's very little give
or extra clicking sounds when you twist
the vice other than me mashing the
buttons on the other side as I'm doing
this the back of device is nicely
rounded making it easy to hold on to no
real rough edges just smooth plastic
these little ridges come in handy when
you're kicking out that screen for the
first time you don't feel like you're
going to lose your grip and throw the
device on the floor sadly the t-mobile
sidekick 4G does not have a flash this
will present issues any dark
environments outdoors it takes pretty
great pictures for the 3 megapixel
camera that it is but I've done some
initial test shots and i'll post those
in the full review as mentioned in the
first look unboxing this device is hspa+
compatible 4g compatible and as you can
see from these speed test results and
will post these in the full review as
well you the initial results here were
from the basement of my house in my
office and then when we're out and about
we are getting 6.4 and then inside a
restaurant down on a basement later this
evening
that wraps up our hardware coverage of
the t-mobile sidekick 4G if you have any
particular questions or comments leave
them in the comments field and we'll see
what we can do thanks for watching
