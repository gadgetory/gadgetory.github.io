combination of two devices with one
primary focus they want to rewrite the
rules of photography and notice I didn't
just say smartphone photography so true
I agree that's kind of a tall order but
wait till I tell you why this is not
just marketing jargon I'm high metal
eval with PocketNow reporting from Paris
and meet the Huawei P 30 and P 30 Pro
you know I remember walking out of the
presentation of the Huawei P 20 Pro last
year and being like wow this is gonna
change everything with that 40 megapixel
camera let's just say that I feel that's
about to repeat itself while we claims
their focus with the P series is setting
new standards in photography and they
mentioned three key pillars to achieve
it design performance and photography so
let's start in that order if you were to
compare the p30 Pro with the P 20 Pro
they might look the same but oh boy our
looks deceiving see the P 30 Pro feels
substantially larger now three
millimeters taller one millimeter
thicker and twelve grams heavier even if
a hair narrower the P 30 by contrast is
the same height and weight as the B 20
and with just the hair more width and
thickness they're calling their color
options transcendent iridescent and I
hope I pronounced that right with new
flagship colors like breathing crystal
and amber sunrise all accompanying Pro
white black and aurora on each variant
though availability depends on your
market
I am definitely drifting more to this
amber sunrise which is more like an
orange of you see it closely up front
the p30 Pro has a six point four inch
OLED display at Full HD plus resolution
at a nineteen point five by nine aspect
ratio on a curved screen and if you
notice there's no speaker grille Huawei
uses electromagnetic levitation to use
the screen as your earpiece and then the
p30 has a smaller 6.1 inch OLED that the
same resolution and aspect ratio though
it's not curved than it does include an
earpiece both displays are capable of
HDR and the DCI p3 color gamut and both
include an on display fingerprint
scanner as for performance both devices
share similar specifications the Kiran
980 powers the show with the pro
starting at more RAM and storage than
the standard a larger battery 40 Watts
super charging 15 want reversible
wireless charging a better IP rating and
even an IR blaster it makes sense I mean
this is the pro but then the B 30 is no
slouch including a headphone jack that
the pro wish it had and then there's
emui 9.1 on top of Android 9 pi visually
not much seems to have changed but
Huawei claims significant improvements
in AI turbo options for the GPU one hop
sharing if you have other Huawei devices
and even serving as a digital car key in
partnership with Adi for up to seven of
their car models though we don't have
dates for that and even if this is still
not our favorite user interface it has
proven to be one of the most powerful
fishing that we've tested in every other
Huawei device we've reviewed now
obviously we left the best for last
let's talk about photography first of
all it's time to stop ruling the non pro
variant as a watered down version of the
pro it does have lesser specifications
but similar capabilities to start both
devices bring the 40 megapixel super
spectrum lens and this is where the
photography reinvention begins see their
partnership with Leica has come up with
the idea that our yyb is better than RGB
which should technically be our ggb so
yeah instead of two greens sub pixels
for every red and blue Huawei is now
doing - yellow subpixels for every red
and blue according to the company this
allows up to 40% more light to be
absorbed the p30 goes up to 200 4800 ISO
and the p30 pro goes up to a crazy 400
9600 achieving what Huawei calls as de
visuals even at night photography both
phones also include an ultra wide camera
with different megapixel counts though
the same aperture and then the second
photography reinvention both bring a
periscopic zoom camera
though the p30 pro is capable of 5x
optical zoom while the P 30 can only do
3 X both camera systems bring better HDR
there is now OIS on even the primary
camera and the selfie camera on both
devices got boosted to 32 megapixels
would similar HDR capabilities where the
P 30 Pro really has an edge as in the
time-of-flight sensor included which
uses flood illumination to detect
subject surroundings and even death
layers Huawei also claims better
low-light video a dual video option
where you can record two clips at the
same time with different focal links
though judging by the settings on these
pre-production models it seems that
there still is no 4k 60 on the primary
shooter and no 4k on the selfie camera
but again those features could probably
be included in the future there's only
one way to find out at our briefing we
also got to see the new Huawei free Lace
wireless headphones we're talking about
a pair of headphones you won't fumble to
connect through bluetooth or charge just
connect the USBC slot hidden for pairing
and also charging with four hours of
playback available in just five minutes
of a charge there's memory cable
28-degree in here earbuds IP x5 watering
dust resistance a magnetic switch to
help you turn them on or off answer
calls mute them etc Huawei also claims
significant wind noise reduction
environmental noise cancelling through
an algorithm an impressive sound quality
which we will have to test it comes in
four colors with this amber sunrise
again being my favorite one more time so
yes this is Huawei in Paris or at least
what we were briefed on this is the p30
MP 30 pro you guys know that Huawei
leaves some surprises for lessor there
is a possibility that we will know more
at the event like for example the price
tag which we will report on the pocket
out daily let us know what you think
about these devices in the comments down
below
I'll tell you this much I'm extremely
impressed but obviously our review
period begins today
there is more to report on while that
happens make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter hi menders quarterly that are on
instagram at high memory data please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hearing that I think
some
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
