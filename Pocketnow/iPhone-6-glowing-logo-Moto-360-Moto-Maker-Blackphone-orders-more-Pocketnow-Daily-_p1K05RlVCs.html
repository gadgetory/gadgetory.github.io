significantly better than the markups
Microsoft's to work on its own
cross-platform SmartWatch and don't
worry android wear isn't going away from
stock Android L I'm hi Mary meta
surviving after a weekend that I really
can't remember but this is parking
outdated let's begin today with what's
official as one of the things that
shocked us the most at mwc 2014 was the
black phone mainly because the booth was
always full people really do care about
these privacy minded smartphones and for
those of you have been waiting almost
six months for the phone it is finally
shipping for those that pre-ordered and
if you still want a phone and can't
order it because it's currently out of
stock apparently it will be available on
sale again on July 14 so stay tuned for
that and tell us what you think about
the black phone now let's talk about the
iphone and specifically the iphone 6 as
we've seen a ton of markups up to the
point where we don't really cover them
anymore because it's boring to see the
same markup delivering colors but rumors
have it that Apple is going to make this
phone look a lot better than what we've
seen apparently those plastic carbs that
we currently see on markups are really
the place for apple tells the company's
took carve the phone and then afterwards
apparently that will be molded with
glass so in a way to look a lot like the
iphone 5 and 5s with glass and aluminum
only that aside from that apparently we
are getting a carp logo that glows just
like the macbook lineup hard to tell
exactly how that thing is going to glow
or what the plans are but interesting
and assignment that apparently Apple is
also planning to adopt curve displays on
this phone at least with a 5.5 inch
model stay tuned for that that's going
to be really odd to see from apple now a
company that has not surprised as yet as
Microsoft though apparently the company
is already working on their SmartWatch
just wait for it reverse happy that the
company is a thinking of new designs new
ideas and that doesn't necessarily have
to do with the modern UI apparently they
want to bring this play in the wrist
because apparently that is more
ergonomic to them ok the second thing is
that apparently they want to adopt a
long display for in fact they're just
like the gear fit because they feel that
is smarter yeah it does make sense for
you to have it in your wrist you know
the bottom stay tuned for that is
obviously the bad part about Microsoft
is that everything takes a lot of time
and speaking of smartwatches those of
you that are worried that you know
Android wear will eventually adopt skin
from Android a samsung and other
companies build their own smartwatches
David Burke just came on record from
google and confirm that no Android L is
going to be the way to go the UI is not
going to change and that is just the way
it's going to be and if you think about
it it makes sense as a but first of all
it's mostly Google now unless they can
innovate with a different sort of watch
face so really what OEMs are going to
change the design and the watch phase
and speaking of design the news that are
coming up next or even more interesting
and finally for the hot news of the day
and hopefully the hottest of the week
rumors have it that Motorola is not just
planning on giving us the Moto 360
reports are that the company plans to
give it some moto maker treatment if you
think about it we have seen the
SmartWatch with metallics bands
somewhere and then when I was showcased
at Google i/o it had leather bands and
it just seems like if there are a lot of
options there are two colors the
metallic color and the black color and
apparently you will be able to customize
how your SmartWatch looks which is great
even greater is if they made those bands
available to you but that leaves you see
the question of the day what would be
important for you to tailor to yourself
when it comes to a SmartWatch meaning
how would you make it your own how would
you want it to be different from
anything else honestly in my case the
bands are very important but I don't
really have time to change the band's
all the time so let's Motorola comes up
with a really smart way for us to be
able to change the band's and different
options that match well with one color
I'm good to go but leave us a comment
