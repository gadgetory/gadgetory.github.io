which the galaxy s4 mini is borrowing
from it's bigger brother so today we're
going to compare the Samsung Android
flagship with the Samsung Android Mini
flagship I'm Anton this is PocketNow and
you're watching samsung galaxy s4 mini
vs samsung galaxy s4 let's go check it
out
there's so much more to the Samsung
Galaxy s4 than what we'll show you in
this comparison video for an in-depth
look at all the aspects of the Samsung
flagship make sure to check out our full
text and video reviews while you read it
follow us on social media so you never
miss a beat we are past the point of
complaining about the same materials and
fairly similar Galaxy s3 and note 2 like
design we are accepting the Galaxy s4 as
it is one of the best Android phones on
the market at the moment and while we're
at it we need to mention that this
galaxy s4 right here is the GTI 9500 the
Exynos 5 version with a octa-core which
is really a dual quad-core processor the
Galaxy s4 mini is the mini Android
flagship from Samsung it's a huge leap
forward in every aspect from its
predecessor the Galaxy s3 mini and it
tries to offer a premium like experience
for those who either find the galaxy s4
it's bigger brother too expensive or too
big and this comparison we'll take a
look at hardware software and user
experience as well as the camera love it
or hate it we'll have to put up with
hyper glazed polycarbonate and the good
old and Buy Now overuse design some more
according to rumors Samsung might be
switching with you real soon and on the
same note we're crossing our fingers for
a new design initially we were quite sad
that we didn't get the darker flavor of
the galaxy s4 mini but as we come to
think of it it's better this way
because we can show you just how well
the white version conceals fingerprints
or how badly the black mist tracks and
displays them there's a huge difference
nonetheless there's nothing really
interesting to note on the materials and
design and these two phones are
identical except for the measurements
and while we talk about size the galaxy
s4 mini is indeed a mini phone compared
to the days 5 inches and above but at
4.3 inches it could have been and not so
long ago considered a large phone by
today's Android standards and recent
trends it is a mini alright but itself
has a larger screen than Apple's iPhone
5 for instance while maintaining about
the same physical dimensions button
placement is the same on both devices
and so is the camera speaker and the
majority of ports
this is indeed h2 galaxy s4 miniature
however when we talk specs the galaxy s4
simply destroys the s4 mini on paper
that's not to say that the s4 mini is a
slow phone not at all
more on that in our full upcoming review
we have either a quad-core Snapdragon
600 at 1.9 gigahertz an octa-core exynos
5 processor at 1.6 and 1.2 gigahertz for
the dual quad for construction or more
recently a Snapdragon 800 processor on
the LTE advanced version powering the GS
for the Galaxy s4 mini is more modest
with its dual core 1.73 Hertz GPU 2 gigs
of ram versus 1.5 gigs of ram on this s4
mini 16 32 and 64 gigabyte storage vs 8
gigabytes of storage on the s4 mini both
of course expandable via microSD and 13
megapixels on the GS 4 vs 8 megapixels
on the miniature sibling a 5 inch full
HD Super AMOLED screen takes up the
front of the GS 4 and a smaller relative
back side quite modest 4.3 inch Super
AMOLED screen with q HD resolution which
is 540 by 960 the rest of the usual
suspects are present on both phones
including the IR blaster and NFC what we
really wish was there on the GS 4 mini
and it's there alright on the G s4 is
the LED notification Samsung could have
should have equipped the galaxy s4 mini
with a notification light we would have
loved that Android 4.2.2 is powering
both of these phones and Samsung's own
TouchWiz user interface brings the
company's signature to the user
experience while the Galaxy s4 is packed
with features some of them you'll
probably never even use yes 4 mini is
missing air view as well as air gesture
the LED indicator option is also missing
from the settings as it is of course
missing from the phone itself the rest
is just about the same offering a
surprisingly fluid user experience on
the s4 mini and since the notification
light is missing from the mini all the
extra sensors that are employed by s
health on the GS 4 are missing too but
we don't really feel the need for them
there are also some slight tweaks to
accommodate the smaller form factor like
the 4 row keyboard on the mini versus
the 5 row input on the G s4 but there's
no deal-breaker here
comparing performance between two phones
that are this far apart and specs on
paper might seem odd but we're happy to
see this little fellow right here
keeping up
it doesn't lag at all when compared
side-by-side with its bigger brother on
steroids
hard as we tried we didn't manage to see
a real difference in performance between
these two phones when doing day-to-day
tasks like launching applications and
even browsing the web we expect this of
course from the Galaxy s4 but it comes
as a pleasant surprise from the s4 mini
of course we have a lot to thank to
Android jellybean for this drama
animated photo and eraser camera
shooting modes are not present on the s4
mini but a certain continuous shooting
mode has been added something which the
s4 achieves easily by a burst mode video
stabilization is also missing from the
s4 mini but aside from these the camera
interface and the entire picture
snapping experience is the same Samsung
even bundled the photo editing
application for easily fixing or
applying filters to your stills we're
talking 13 megapixels versus 8
megapixels here but the g s4 mini
doesn't disappoint surely it sometimes
delivers somewhat lower quality images
but the colors as well as the exposure
seem to be spot-on
the Galaxy s4 mini puts up a decent
fight in this category - and the sample
images can surely tell you more at the
end of the day there's a difference of
about 250 dollars between these two
phones if we're talking unlocked SIM and
carrier free of course we want to thank
our friends over at close that code at
UK for supplying us with this galaxy s4
mini review unit if you prefer a smaller
screen you'll love the galaxy s4 mini
don't be fooled by the lower specs
surely we would have loved to see a 720p
display and of course that led
notification but if you can live with
that or without those it is an
exceptional Android device of course our
conclusion on the s4 mini will arrive
soon with the occasion of our full
review so stay tuned for that that's
going to wrap up our comparison between
the samsung galaxy s4 mini and the
samsung galaxy s4
