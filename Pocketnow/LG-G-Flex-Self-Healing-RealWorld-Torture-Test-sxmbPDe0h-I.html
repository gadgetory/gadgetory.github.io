itself displays that can't shatter
tablets that you can use as trampolines
without breaking it sounds futuristic
and some of that is still a ways off but
reality is fast catching up to those
sci-fi notions and LG is at the head of
the mobile front of the self-healing
revolution with its new G flex
smartphone that can repair itself at
least that's the claim but can this
curvy phablet really make the everyday
signs of wear and tear just vanish all
on its own let's find out I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
initial durability report on the LG G
flex we'd like to mention up front that
this Qi flex review unit comes to us
from Negri electronics if you want one
of the world's only curved smartphones
do what we did head over to Negri
electronics comm and pick one up for
yourself the G flex is resilient
reputation is made up of two parts and
the first is its ability to self repair
scratches made on the glossy back cover
within minutes we'll have more
information on just how that coating
works in our full review coming soon it
makes sure to follow us at all the usual
online public houses so you don't miss
it when it lands we've been using the G
flex for seven days and already the back
plate exhibits some fine hairline
scratches nothing you'd be able to see
unless you were looking for it but that
doesn't actually comfort us too much
because you'd think that a phone billed
as self-healing would have no trouble
sealing up tiny scratches like these but
they've been here for a few days and
they don't look like they're going
anywhere anytime soon still we wanted to
test fresh damage so we loaded up an
array of objects the typical person
might carry in a pocket from car keys to
coin change to ear phones to breath
mints we threw in a USB Drive and a
hairpin and even a cigarette lighter for
you smokers out there we tossed all that
into a pocket followed by the G flex
back first of course and took a walk
around town
on our constitutional we tried to
maximize the phone's contact with the
sharp objects we switched pockets
periodically to capture motion at
different points on the body and we
changed up our gait from time to time we
went up the stairs and down the stairs a
lot we even did a couple Sprint's down
the sidewalk in the manner of a harried
commuter trying to catch a bus and then
just for good measure we dumped
everything into a zippered pocket and
gave it a good shake up because
apparently we are sadists what we found
in terms of damage wasn't actually much
at first
the diagonal pattern under the phone's
glossy coating does a good job at
covering up minor scratches until you
really pour some light on it we took the
unit outside briefly to get a good look
at the corner scratches then brought it
into a 75 degree Fahrenheit room to
allow it to heal when we returned to the
phone to the testing table the Sun had
moved but the scratches had not it could
be that the phone just needs more time
but given our experience with the
hairline mark from earlier
we're doubtful these scratches will ever
heal still those marks were pretty minor
so we put the device in a few more
harrowing but common situations for a
smartphone we put it down on a sugar
covered countertop at our local coffee
shop accidentally grinding a few
granules to dust on the phone as we
brushed it away we carelessly tossed it
into a car a few times subjecting it to
the rough and dirty fabric of the
footwell mat and yes we did that thing
all drivers have done to their phones at
least once the dreaded forgot it was in
my lap maneuver that really hurt after
all that another sunlight past shows us
a much more significant damage pattern
now no one should reasonably expect some
of these deeper gouges to come out
despite all the terminator jokes the G
flex is not a t-1000 and LG even says so
in its own promo video but we did hope
some of the finer scratches might vanish
as they did within minutes in LG's
bronze brush test yet even after another
half hour in the warm air
our test unit was still pretty well
scored we really wanted to see a scratch
heal itself though so sticking with an
item we might reasonably find in a
pocket
we took a common American penny 1973 if
you're wondering and rubbed a clean spot
on the flexes back for a few seconds at
light to medium pressure giving us a
nice and visible but still fairly
shallow damage pattern we also rubbed
the same penny slightly harder in an
adjacent zone so we could compare the
effects of different depths then we
photographed the flecks every 5 minutes
to see what happened now even after 40
minutes sitting in prime self-healing
temperature the scratches didn't really
go anywhere even after we tried rubbing
them with a sleeve to try to get them to
fade but when we sat down to edit this
video about an hour and a half later we
found that the scratches had in fact
faded to a dramatic extent we're not
sure if we have a rise in the rooms
temperature or just the passage of time
to thank but the G flex is indeed
capable of self repairing minor shallow
scratches unfortunately though as you
can see from the rest of the device it's
not likely to cover up the dings and
scrapes that most of us encounter when
carrying a naked smartphone the other
big part of this phone's durability push
is the flexibility that gives the device
its name it conforms nicely to the
posterior when placed in a back pocket
and so you can sit on it without too
much fear of trouble outside the
occasional butt dial more importantly
the Flex is resistant to bending the
other way because heaven knows we all
sit where we shouldn't sometimes and
that means sometimes we sit on our
phones now we didn't like doing this but
we did it anyway for science as you can
see the Flex is aptly named even after
multiple sittings by a pretty bulky dude
on unyielding wood on a cold winter day
the phone has no trouble taking the
stress in stride it flexes under weight
and springs right back once that weight
is removed
no part of the device shows any ill
effects aside from some expected
scratches on the front panel and two
small deformations on the display which
are only visible when the screen is off
we're not sure if these came from
something within the phone or instead
were a result of some nails on the porch
will ask LG about it when we get a
chance so where does this leave us well
in terms of the scratch test we
certainly weren't as lucky as LG was in
its own promo video that's because we
didn't test the device in lab conditions
with a bronze brush but then again most
consumers won't be doing that either
while it is really impressive to watch a
certain type of scratch disappear before
your eyes we were able to come up with
many types of scratches not all of them
deep that don't respond as well to LG's
magic paint job on the flip side though
the phone had no trouble standing up to
the bends for a curved smartphone to
take the full weight of an average human
male and then spring right back to shape
with no cracks or creaks is to say the
least very impressive and very
reassuring so while the G flex is
probably just as prone as most
smartphones to scratches and surface
damage the flexibility of its durable
curved design still puts it a step ahead
of the competition for all you folks out
there who don't necessarily look before
you sit don't forget folks we have a
full review of the LG G flex coming up
very shortly and if you want one of your
very own visit our friends at Negri
electronics Negri electronics dot-com
but before you go anywhere please toss
us a like if you enjoyed this video
leave a comment down below if you have
some feedback of your own some follow-up
questions we'll try and get to them if
we can and thank you very much for
watching we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
