the Galaxy Note 8 was announces that
you're really just Barney a galaxy s 8
plus with an S Pen and the thing is that
the more that I played with the Galaxy
Note 8 the more I realized that that
wasn't so accurate I'm high not even
with pocket now and this is a quick show
for comparison between the Galaxy Note 8
and the samsung galaxy s a plus brought
to you by D brand
side by side these two siblings are
definitely built from the same mold and
that's actually great we have the same
glass and aluminum finish on each that
makes these devices both gorgeous and
sadly also begging for some edges and
fingerprints that's even more evident in
this lighting the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
is larger than the s8 plus in almost
every dimension though it's three
millimeters taller one millimeter wider
and point five millimeters thicker even
if you can't really tell much of a
difference when you stack them together
the best way to distinguish the note is
thanks to the sharper corners and
because the curves are slightly more
pronounced on the s8 plus internally the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is also a more
powerful device thanks to the added 2
gigs of RAM but the s8 plus swings back
with 10 percent extra battery and this
is a rather interesting paradoxes the s8
plus it's actually 20 grams lighter than
the node 8 even with the extra battery
and then in almost every single spec
you're talking about almost the same
phone's here the two major differences
left are most of what makes the Galaxy
Note 8 a note the s-pen allows you to
interact in more ways with the Galaxy
Note 8 than you can with pretty much any
other smartphone the fine tip doesn't
just help you act on screen elements
with more precision but it also becomes
a surrogate Mouse when you need it
Samsung is also bundled software that's
specific to the note to help you take
advantage of this things like the
animated messaging and the ability to
jot notes even when the screen is off is
again things that are just unique to the
note surely you don't need any of this
and if you already have a Galaxy S 8
plus you'll probably be just fine but
these are features that are definitely
nice to have considering the meagre
price difference between both phones
the second major difference is the dual
cameras on the Galaxy Note 8 I may not
be a fan of telephoto lenses I rarely
ever use the 2 X optical zoom but again
these are things that are nice to have
every now and then I also pray Samsung
for their live photo feature which is
their new portrait mode the fact that
you can dial back how much blur you want
on a subject even after you
taking a photo or even switch back to
the wider photo is definitely genius
again these are features that are unique
only to the Galaxy Note I don't know of
any other smartphone that does this now
calling one phone better than the other
is definitely too early at the moment
but we'll report back with a full
comparison very soon once are reviewed
enough the Galaxy Note 8 arrives of the
pocket nail Labs while you're at it
remember that glass back will need some
protection the brand skins will
eliminate those fingerprints and add
some grip to your upcoming Galaxy Note 8
or any other galaxy for that matter
