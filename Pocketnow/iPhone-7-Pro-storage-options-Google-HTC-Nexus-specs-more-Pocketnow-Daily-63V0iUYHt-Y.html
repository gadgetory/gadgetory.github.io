getting aggressive about storage we have
more details on the second HTC google
nexus smartphone and some new deals make
even the galaxy s7 look good I'm hi meri
behna and yeah I know yesterday was
crazy up to the point where the video
was crazy late but I wasn't going to
leave you today without the news this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for the Galaxy s7 and wanting
to get the phone unlocked I highly
suggest you go to bestbuy mainly because
well you're getting an unlocked phone
which is cool but second because you're
getting a $75 best buy gift card with
that purchase meaning that it'll drop
the price tag like crazy even though you
could pretty much spend it on just one
galaxy accessory and throw all that
money away but hey more information on
the links and for those of you in the
market the switch carrier is an upgrade
or whatever sprint is offering a very
interesting deal where you're getting
two months of free amazon prime all you
have to do is pretty much just sign up
to the Amazon Prime services and get
billed on your sprint account and if
you're asking yourself why months and
not years of services with Amazon well
that's because this is a really an offer
that's only available on sprint right
now ten dollars and sixty-six cents a
month and again you get two months for
free makes a lot of sense you learn more
canim links I have some news that aren't
official but are rather official if you
could say it that way is the fact that
we cannot find the Android one website
anymore you hit Android one and all
you're getting is the Android regular
website where we now get Android 70
nougat so the real question is if google
continues to plan its way through the
emerging market sector with Android one
or could it be that Android knew that is
going to be so good that you're not
going to need an entry-level version of
Android for these markets we cannot wait
to tell you more as soon as we learn
more about it and since we're talking
google let's move the spotlight over to
the HTC marlin which is the code name
for one of the nexus devices we still
can't make out in the specifications
that you have in the lengths of what
sort of processor we have here all we
know it's it's quad-core but the specs
really point to a flagship device even
though apparently this wasn't
going to be it for gigs of ram 32 to up
to 128 gigs of storage in addition to a
huge 3450 milliamp hour battery it seems
that this competition is going to be
rather odd and we just hope that both
devices offer great specs and probably
just some meager differences and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with the iphone 7 and storage options
we've got some very trusted sources
talking about the fact that it seems to
64 gigabytes is going to take a hike
apparently Apple is going to adopt the
whole ipad pro scheme starting at 32
gigs going up to 128 gigs and then
offering the 256 gig option as well
meaning no 64 gigabytes here and this
can even pinpoint to more rumors of
these devices being iPhone pro or
whatever name moniker Apple breaks to
these but it does lead me to the
question of the day do you believe that
128 gigs should be overkill for this
smartphone option that option be
available and probably just at a smaller
price point in my case I will admit I
had the 128 gig iphone 6 I always had
like 32 gigs available it's just too
much but leave us a comment down below
