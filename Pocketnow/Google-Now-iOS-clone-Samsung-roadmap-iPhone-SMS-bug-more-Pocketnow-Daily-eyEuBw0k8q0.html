returns to reboot your device we hear
new plans for Samsung's batteries and
camera sensors and CEO me and Qualcomm
are rumored to bring us some very hot
mi5 I'm high net iveta and I'm dressed
in white for reasons you wouldn't even
imagine this is sparking out daily you
know even with all the bad publicity
that Microsoft got a couple of years ago
it seems that the company is on the
right track the games on mindshare and
such as the case with their deals in
getting their software running on
Android OEM hardware we saw with Samsung
in the galaxy s6 and now the company has
just inked a deal with other companies
specifically LG and sony as of today and
apparently there are more companies to
come so yes you will get Microsoft
software pre-installed which is great
these are good apps but you can always
remove them if you want probably the
biggest news for today when it comes to
the official stuff is the SMS bug that's
been flagging iOS devices specifically
iPhones you get a specific thread at an
SMS and that will either make your phone
reboot or it will make the SMS
application crash and even though there
is a way around this this is not new
this has happened to iphones for the
longest time and it's actually something
that can happen to any phone as current
gps tracking companies use SMS commands
to control remote gps units the phone is
pretty much the same thing they use sim
cards as well so let's see what apple
patches this I've got trusted sources
talking about Samsung it seems we get
details on what Samsung is doing for
batteries and camera sensors going
forward where comes the battery to seem
to the company is investing and making
them more dense as of 2017 so you should
be getting a better smartphone
experience and the links in the
description will show you exactly how
Samsung is going to pull this off in
addition to that it seems we are getting
new camera sensors apparently we're
getting a new rwb type sensor that will
allow you to get better low-light photos
in addition to many other things which
is saying a lot given the great quality
that we have right now in the galaxy s6
let's see what we get Xiaomi show me or
whichever way you pronounce it correctly
is a rumored to be working with Qualcomm
on giving us a much better mi
five then what we were expecting for the
mi5 rumors that ended up turning into
the mi 4s and even though we don't talk
about these companies much the reason
why this is so hot is because number one
we're giving the Snapdragon 820
processor and the reason why that is hot
is because this processor enables
welcomes new fingerprint technology that
doesn't require a button to work these
are really cool things coming apparently
to this device the only problem is we
will have to wait until november
according to the leaks and finally for
the very hot news of the day it seems
that Apple already got the memo Google
now is really cool and the apple needs a
counterpart for its claim that it's
going to be called iOS proactive and I
know there's a medication for that as
well but yeah it seems that it's going
to be the same idea instead of the
spotlight search from the top you'll be
getting is a you know predictions for
white information or package tracking or
whatever things Google now currently
already does and it leads me to the
question of the day how important is
google now to you do you use it
constantly because in my case it is
probably the things I use most on
Android and even iOS devices
particularly to follow bus alone that
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case friends you know the drill
