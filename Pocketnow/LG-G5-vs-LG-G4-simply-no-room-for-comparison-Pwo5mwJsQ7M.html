the purpose of making a statement but
what was of last year's g4 doesn't
necessarily follow the same path for the
first time ever I'm hi I'm gonna leave a
tie with pocket now here with a quick
show floor comparison of the LG g5 vs.
LG g4 brought to you by D brand
LG's approach to compete in a saturated
market by launching phones that are in
no way similar to competitors continues
today but by god is this g5 a very
different device than what we've seen
before
LG actually claims that the predecessor
of the g5 is more the v10 than the g4
and that's easily seen today the plastic
and curved g4 with replaceable leather
options says goodbye to a more elegant
and petite g5 that now sports a unique
aluminum chassis that doesn't require
the antenna lines that we have to see on
every other smartphone the g4 was and no
means ugly but the g5 is just gorgeous
in every way you look at it the g5 also
feels more premium in the hand even
though both devices feel just as light
this new g5 also does away with the
volume buttons at the back now placing
them on the left even though the power
button remains at the back end doubles
as the fingerprint scanner that the g4
just does not include that was the v10
some of our complaints with the g4 were
also addressed here this is a more
saturated and brighter display panel
than the g4 being able to push up to 900
nits when needed and improving the
experience in direct sunlight even
though it is IPS it also includes an
always-on mode that LG claims to be
superior to AMOLED as it avoids the
burnout issues that flag this technology
according to their engineers LG also
claims that this always-on mode will
only affect 0.5% of the battery life per
hour but should improve on what the g4
was able to do as you won't need to turn
on the display all the time just to read
your notifications there are some
drawbacks though as this is a smaller
5.3 inch display and that battery also
sports 200 milliamp hours less than the
g4 where we expect the g5 to compensate
for those changes in performance as it
sports a more powerful and efficient
Snapdragon 820 processor more gigs of
ram 32 gigs of expandable storage
through an extended SIM tray in addition
to Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 through the
USB type-c slot everything continues to
be removable as well and this is where
the g5 also stands out as the bottom
slot not only allows you to replace the
battery
but also supports peripherals that bring
hi-fi audio and extended camera grip and
more we discuss these LG g5 friends as
LG calls them in a separate video given
their importance in a nutshell LG calls
this a modular phone and we have to
agree as you can do more with the
battery slot than you could in the past
and believe it or not even though we
praised the g-force camera for excellent
photos even there the g5 is superior
both devices are set to support the same
primary camera which is great news but
the g5 has the added bonus of an
additional 8 megapixel wide-angle camera
that provides 135 degrees of field of
view something that even defeats the
human eyes 120 degrees of field of view
this is specially useful when you don't
want to stand away from a subject or
just can't and where you can choose to
keep separate photos or videos of the
same scene or stitch them together
simply put the g5 is no iterative update
to the g4 this is LG's new approach to
smartphones with innovation we have yet
to see in competitors and design that's
definitely worth considering I
personally love the g4 for what it was
but man the g5 is a far better phone in
almost every way though obviously our
review will prove more on that later
