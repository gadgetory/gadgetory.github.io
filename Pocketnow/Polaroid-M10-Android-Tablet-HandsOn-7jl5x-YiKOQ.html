pocketnow.com here at CES in Las Vegas
still and you ever wonder what would
happen if Polaroid decided to try their
hand at tablet makings will wonder no
longer we're here checking out the
Polaroid m10 a quad-core 10.1 inch
tablet here at the Polaroid booth which
at the moment doesn't have a lot of
traffic but let's have a look at it and
see hardware first you can see this kind
of brush metal look on the back
reminiscent of what Samsung is doing in
plastic but this actually feels a lot
like metal we can't really confirm that
at the moment but we'll check with
someone here at the booth this camera on
the back here is a 5 megapixel primary
shooter it's backed up by a 2 megapixel
shooter on the front battery behind
there is 7800 milliamp hours which beats
out the galaxy note 10.1 which looks
like is what Polaroid is trying to sell
against this kind of mid-range 10 inch
device it's a 1280 by was at 1800 excuse
me 1280 by 800 display vector looks not
too bad in in person is launcher
obviously we're running what are we
running here
Android 4.1.1 jelly bean so that's nice
responsiveness is obvious is almost
nothing going on as far as widgets on
this in this demo unit fluidity is about
what you'd expect from a tablet running
this spec book trying to look at the
processor the only thing they're quoting
is quad core we're not seeing speed and
device storage is 16 gigs on this model
so I think it's priced it's priced at
229 which once again they're positioning
against the galaxy note 10.1 at 449 not
too bad and also no of course of course
no stylus but very interesting to see a
sort of sort of a novelty to see the
polaroid brand spreading out and if you
can actually we can take a look down the
road here there is more than just the
m10 m7 m8 m 9 some dual cores some
otherwise a whole lot of polaroid
tablets we're gonna take a look at the
the camera we haven't been able to get
great performance out of the 5 megapixel
shooter here but well take some more
tickets to take a longer gander at this
if we have some time once again Michael
Fisher with pocket now at CES Las Vegas
stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
