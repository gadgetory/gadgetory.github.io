pocketnow.com Google is rolling out a
new version of the Android Market with
an updated interface and in this video
we're gonna take a look at all the
features that it brings let's get to it
so this is going to be rolled out over
the next few weeks on Android 1.6
devices and above but you can actually
get it right now if you really want it
it's really easy to install I'll put a
link up in the description so you can
get to it so this new interface features
a scrolling carousel at the top it's got
this kind of curved theme that you find
on the Nexus S if you go to the Nexus S
website it's all about this curvature of
the screen and they kind of bring that
forth here in the marketplace it even
has a really nice landscape view here
that looks pretty much like it does in
portrait but a little bit different so
we can swipe through featured
applications we can scroll through a
list of other featured applications we
can go right to apps here and then we're
taken into the categories it's a very
very fast interface we can go back go to
games and take a look at all the games a
big focus on Android 2.3 Gingerbread is
games there are many improvements for
developers to take advantage of to make
games faster there's gyroscope support
and a lot of really technical stuff and
so Google is trying to bring forth the
game selection of the Android Market by
giving it its own little link here on
the home screen and of course we can go
into my apps and take a look at your own
apps that you've downloaded let's take a
look at what a page actually looks like
so we'll go to Guitar Hero where
actually let's go to a free app let's go
to Yelp we're gonna jump back into
portrait for a minute
if you remember in the old version or
the current version of Google Market the
Android Market you get tabs along the
top which we actually liked a little bit
more to keep things organized but now
everything is laid out in one long
vertically scrolling screen so to
install it it's super easy to tap the
free button it's actually faster than it
was in the current version of the
Android Market to install an app you get
the description here you can tap on more
it expands you can tap less and just get
a little synopsis here are the
screenshots some statistics the reviews
here are the related apps we saw this
tab appear in the Android Market but now
it's within this screen we can tap more
to get even more related apps dveloper
info and so on let's take a look at what
it's like to install this app you tap
free and then the permissions show up
within the current page so you're
staying within the same screen all along
you click OK boom it's downloading a
really expedited process to be able to
download apps in the Android Market
there's also two new categories for live
wallpapers and for widgets because a lot
of developers are making lots of widgets
and lots of live wallpapers so you can
dial down right by that now the search
functionality is pretty much unchanged
so if we search for say widgets we will
get very fast results here in terms of
settings and options if we go into the
menu we can go to settings and turn on
notifications so that if you have an
update available for one of your apps
you also get a little window shade
notification at the top there and let's
go back and that's pretty much it an
updated UI that looks really good it's
faster definitely much faster than the
current version of the Android Market
and it makes games have the spotlight
more than ever so again I will put a
link in the description if you want to
download this it takes about two seconds
to install on your Android phone or you
can wait for the official update to
happen within the next few weeks if you
liked this video please give it a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
