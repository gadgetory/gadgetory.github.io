and it's time for another unboxing it's
actually device it's been in the
headlines as of late if you've been
following the Android news and that is
the Droid Pro so without delaying any
further let's go ahead and get started
and here we are we have the Droid Pro
box right in front of us which is from
Motorola and once again that's on
Verizon we're gonna go ahead and
actually unbox this guy but before we do
we're just going to flip it over and
actually gives you a nice mug shot of
the device itself it's going to tell you
on the side what comes in the box that's
going to be the device the Droid Pro
phone the standard lithium ion battery a
two gig micro SD card which is of course
pre-installed now the SIM card which is
for the world's phone capabilities a
wall charger a USB data charging cable
and then all the different adapters this
is a world foam and one of the things
that we know about this phone as of
right now is Motorola and Verizon are
really marketing this device toward the
business Crouch where the business users
who might be traveling you know
internationally globally as well as the
power users of androids hence the
physical keyboard so we're waiting for
let's go ahead get this guy open now our
on top we're going to have the phone
itself which we will put aside and we'll
get back to but here's just a quick view
of the device there we have the nice
Droid Pro raised lettering here you have
some jackpot we have a global support
guide as well as a global calling card a
little starter card more or less we're
going to have looks like an AC adapter
here which is a micro USB hopefully you
can see that now this of course uses the
standard prong system we use here in the
United States however it looks like you
can actually add these different
adapters for the corresponding countries
on top of that adapter there there's
actually a few different kinds here as
we said there's three different types we
should get used where you have to go and
the nice thing is they also do include
that extra US speech syncing or charging
cable as you can see right there which
is once again the microUSB to the usb so
really this is once again dedicated for
that power or that business user kits
going to give you the best of both
worlds of the battery
have the back which unfortunately
appears to be plastic which seems to go
against most of the Droid and alright
who actually already put the battery in
the battery cover on the device before
we boot it up we just want to show you
that battery cover it's actually a very
cool design of course it says with
Google another thing here is actually
going to be the physical keyboard it's
very similar to that of the Motorola Q
series devices and that is a parent of
course with this being a Motorola device
let's go ahead and turn this guy on for
the very first time and of course in
typical Droid fashion you hear the droid
sound bite as well as the logo and it
looks like we are now fully booting up
or getting close to that full boot up
process once this little goes away there
we go so we can touch the Android to
begin we're going to ahead and skip all
of this stuff for now just we can
actually see the device in action at
very first glance now once again nothing
has been set up on this device yet this
is fresh out of the box so let's see
just kind of this state of the actual
device once you do power it on for the
very first time and it looks like there
is a backup assistant which will use the
Verizon service to store your numbers
names and email addresses of your phone
book and once that process is complete
you are greeted with a set up accounts
menu here which you can actually set up
your Twitter your Facebook if you still
have a myspace account you can set it up
you name it though it's going to be here
including your email addresses as well
as LinkedIn so we're go ahead and
actually just skip through this for now
say that we're done adding the accounts
and we are now greeted by the home
screen which as you can see are off the
bat it's quite plain we're going to have
the actual app drawer here which will
bring up the applications it looks like
or all of them here looks if we can
swipe actually here we go so it's
starting to actually populate the
entries in now so it's not plain we hate
we do have the options here as you can
see of course going to have the
notification bar swiping over to
left we're going to have your your
calendar your message is some other
shortcuts that are set up here and
toward the right once again going to
have some more widgets and other
shortcuts already pre-populated for us
we'll actually dive more into depth on
this in our next video which will be the
software overview and we'll also go into
detail in the future on the hardware of
the Droid Pro with the hardware overview
so make sure you stay tuned for those
videos this has been the unboxing and a
quick look at the Droid Pro if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and stay tuned for more coverage thanks
