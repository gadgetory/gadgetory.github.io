SmartWatch replacement reactions to the
Huawei watch 2 were mixed if I'm putting
it mildly after a couple weeks we can
talk about how this chunky piece has
held up to my daily use
right off the bat not much has changed
from our first impressions in terms of
design this watch looks feels and wears
better than the press photos might have
showcased and it certainly does the
trick for durability I've raked it ugly
by accident a couple times during this
brief review period and it survived
scrapes which would have easily deface
the pebble this display is also very
good for an OLED one of the better phone
style screens we reviewed it still
doesn't quite achieve the view ability
of ePaper when viewed at steering wheel
angles but there haven't been any issues
reading this display in Los Angeles Sun
oh my gosh speaking over that big creepy
mind which is handy in a pinch but
really something that you're relying on
in public the most controversial aspect
of this gadget is that it's definitely
not a successor to the original Huawei
watch in terms of design the og Huawei
watch dresses up really nice watch twos
focus on fitness makes it a trickier
solution for those times you want to
wear a button-up shirt and this watch
band is one of my least favorite
included with any watch I've ever warned
it's not really a sport band instead has
a really cheap plastic quality and feels
terrible on my wrist I tried to write it
out for the review period but had to
replace it with a nicer sport band
Barton watch straps for the discerning
collector of noise much punch yeah
Android wear 2.0 is a nice improvement
over using older wear watches the
performance is snappy and the new UI is
well laid out for quick navigation
there's been a significant focus on
fitness tracking and all-day heart rate
monitoring has been my new favorite
feature it's so much better than just
step tracking you get a terrific
snapshot of what the activity of your
day really looks like Huawei second
button is customizable but I left it set
to start a workout quick toggling for a
bike ride this nicely streamlines the
process of monitoring a workout and act
which is fiddly on other watches this
software updates much more resembled
idea of wearing a phone on your wrist
Bluetooth Wi-Fi LTE NFC and on watch
access to native apps and the Google
Play Store the feature set is more
robust but that also means this
accessory is a tad more complicated to
customize chirp swapping a watch face is
easier but it requires a bit more
babysitting than other wearables we've
reviewed it's a little less a direct
companion to your phone and more its own
proper product battery life is a perfect
example of that baby sitting out of the
box all radios are on so popping in a
SIM card means Auto connecting to LTE
when the watch drops Bluetooth this
works great around town for short stints
keeping you connected to your accounts
but my first two days wearing the watch
battery life would plummet at odd times
during the day disabling Wi-Fi and LTE
achieved consistent all-day runtime but
even then maintaining heartrate checks
I've not been able to stretch this out
to two full days of use that and we
still have some of the same gripes with
wear like a lack of leash notifications
when your watch loses the Bluetooth
connection it would be nice to know if
I'd left my phone behind or if I was
using up LTE data we're still forces the
user to babysit actively monitoring
watch functions instead of fading into
the background of the users daily life
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us with the Huawei watch 2 I said
it before and I'll say it again I like
it a lot better than I thought I would
it doesn't match my personal style
though a new strap has helped a lot
still this should be considered by folks
looking for something sporty but who
also wants something simple
it won't however satisfy a
one-size-fits-all seeker since I like
watches in general I have options to
dress up and dress down with my
smartwatches spending this much on a
piece of tech we can appreciate the
people in our audience who would hope to
have both in one gadget as it stands now
this is the launch which is mostly
replace my pebble I miss the battery
life I miss the center build and ePaper
display but just about everything else I
like better on Android wear 2.0 it faces
formidable competition and it's
certainly not what we were expecting
from a sequel but it should find some
fans out there as always thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe for
more reviews like these plus we'll be
doing a round up on all the watches
we've reviewed recently so helped us out
with some cheering on you
