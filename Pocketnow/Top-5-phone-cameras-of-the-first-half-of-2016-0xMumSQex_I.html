first half of 2016 are out and reviewed
now when it comes to cameras have we
really seen progress over last year's
shooters or is 2016 shaping up to be a
year of photography gimmicks I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket now and here's
our top 5 smartphone cameras for the
first half of 2016 first a little
housekeeping we're talking about the
best of the best and we're focusing on
the camera package offered by the
manufacturer both hardware and software
that means we're looking at the photo
and video performance you get right out
of the box not what you might be able to
do with these cameras if you were to
install a third-party app and this list
might include some phones from 2015 if
those phones are still a top offering
from a manufacturer number 5 the Huawei
p9
this dual camera experiment influenced
by Leica has catapulted while waiting to
producing some of the best stills we've
ever seen from a smartphone camera color
saturation clarity dynamic range are all
top-notch on the shooter thanks in part
to a color sensor and a monochrome
sensor working in tandem to make your
shots as vibrant as possible in addition
to great photography Hardware Huawei
also has one of the best laid out apps
we've seen in recent memory very
consistent delineation between modes
settings and controls requires very
little memorization from the user to
know where you are in the app and how to
control settings on this camera while
this photography performance is
bleeding-edge video performance is
unfortunately last generation at best
there is no UHD video on tap this phone
topping out at 1080p at 60 frames per
second but that high-quality video mode
lacks any kind of image stabilization
software or Hardware still this is
phenomenal improvement from a company
who's really starting to take those
lifestyle features like cameras
seriously number for the iPhone 6s plus
Apple is very conservative with their
hardware upgrades but we finally have
iPhone shooters that can produce UHD
video when this higher resolution is
combined with Apple's track record for
having extremely consistent color
processing class-leading slow motion
video and the best HDR processing we've
seen from a mobile you know you're in
for a solid camera experience and
specifically the 6s plus over the
6s or the iPhone se because of that
hybrid hardware image stabilization
system the iPhone camera app is the most
familiar camera app on the market today
any consumer upgrading from an older
phone will instantly be familiar with
the settings controls and options that
an iPhone camera has to offer of course
that app is starting to show its age and
really could do with a refresh or a
little extra polish for all of the new
features that Apple is starting to put
into their smartphone cameras still it's
really compelling to see a phone from
any manufacturer offer up such
consistent performance number three the
HTC 10 welcome back HTC the 10 delivers
excellent top-tier sensor and lens
performance for a smartphone camera this
is a back-to-basics year for HTC no
funky gimmicks no dual sensors just
working on the core photo and video
experience and we think users of the HTC
10 will be in for a treat but this
camera is still very much a work in
progress and we would like to see a
little more polish on fun features like
HDR and panorama stitching plus there
are some video mode omissions like
control for exposure or the ability to
shoot 60 frames per second 1080p while
the HTC 10 only lands our number 3 spot
were happy to deliver our most improved
camera award over the phone that HTC put
out last year number 2 the LG v10 LG put
out a really interesting dual sensor
camera on the g5 one with a standard
field of view one with an ultra wide
field of view but when it comes to
delivering on the core photography and
video experience the LG v10 is a beast
while many of our flagship phones now
deliver expanded controls for
photography like controlling the ISO the
shutter speed or manual focus only the
LG v10 brings that aesthetic that
experience to video full granular
controls for everything that you might
want to adjust in terms of exposure the
ability to control the audio and the
source that you're recording from and
the ability to get into some fairly
professional options like changing up
the aspect ratio or the bitrate what
keeps the v10 out of the top spot is LG
supplying a slightly lower quality lens
than some of the other options we've
played with the lens on the v10 is a bit
more prone to fringing and aberration
than some of our other options and while
this has with the least powerful
internals of any phone on this top 5 the
v10 is still an absolute monster for
content creation and the number one
all round camera for the first half of
2016 the galaxy s7 edge now the
difference is between an s7 and s7 edge
are a little less severe than the
differences between an iPhone 6s and 6s
plus the camera Hardware on both
galaxies is identical but we are giving
the s7 edge than not simply for the
larger battery these new galaxy cameras
are insanely fast we've not seen any
smartphone cameras which can launch an
app as quickly can lock focus as
accurately or fire through a burst mode
as fast as a galaxy s7 edge Samsung
delivers on all of the core features a
great sensor a great lens and a nicely
laid out app but that app is the one
area where Samsung could stand to refine
this experience just a little bit
there's a little bit more hunting and
memorizing for mode settings and
controls but even with those minor
criticisms the s7 and s7 edge offer up
the most complete photography experience
on any phone currently available to be
sold at the time this video was created
and we're ranking over all camera
offerings this list becomes a lot more
fluid when you're looking at specific
features from each camera so we know you
have thoughts and we want to hear them
drop a comment below this video
hopefully we can get into some fun
debates as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more fun comparisons like
these make sure you hit that thumbs up
button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now i'm juan
carlos bag now you can chat me up on
twitter and instagram as some gadget guy
and i will catch you all on the next
video
