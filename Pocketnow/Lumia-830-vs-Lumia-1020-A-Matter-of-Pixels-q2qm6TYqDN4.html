2014 we were struck by its resemblance
to the earlier Lumia 1020 a device which
thanks to its huge camera stands alone
as the only super shooter in the Windows
Phone lineup microsoft out at the a30 is
a kind of affordable successor a
so-called mid-range flagship designed to
compete on cost but with the Lumia 1020
available for a full hundo cheaper is
newer really better in this case let's
find out I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is Lumia 830 versus
Lumia 1020 the 8in Lumia 830 puts the
model on the high side of Microsoft's
mid-range numbering scheme well below
the four-digit flagship class of the
1020 but like looks numbers can be
deceiving
the Lumia 830 is over a year younger
than the 1020 it replaces that 15-month
edge is apparent in industrial design
the 830 bares the aluminium edges and
changeable back plates of more modern
Nokia's and it's also thinner and
lighter than the 1020 with a larger
display much thinner bezels and a higher
screen to body ratio that goes a little
ways toward making up for the use of LCD
instead of AMOLED technology in the
newer phone with the accompanying loss
of contrast the milkier blacks and the
much less saturated colors overall to my
eye this is one of the most visible
compromises of the newer phone one that
gets more pronounced the further off
center you view the display all the
hardware slimming makes the 830 more
pleasant in terms of hand feel than the
1020 it doesn't seem quite as solid
thanks to the removable and somewhat
flexible back but you can change its
color on the fly which is nice and it's
easier to pocket hold and put on a table
without the massive camera crater on the
back
I also think the 830 is a better-looking
device but whether you agree will be up
to you of course
rounding out the spec sheet the newer
phone also bears a more modern quad-core
processor expandable storage that are
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi compatibility and a
larger removable battery that last bit
is a big deal for road warriors and the
integrated wireless charging capability
is a win for convenience as well
wireless charging is still kind of a
novelty but you'll probably appreciate
it more in the 830 so you can avoid
using it's bizarre top mounted USB port
with the 1020 can charge wirelessly to
but not without an add on battery life
is comparable between the two though to
be fair our 1020 is a very old unit and
our 830 is brand new check our full
reviews of each phone for more detailed
endurance impressions at pocket now
while both of these run Windows Phone
8.1 the 830 brings an edge with a newer
build of the Lumia extras package Lumia
denim instead of the older cyan the
Lumia 830 is also running the GDR one
update for Windows Phone while our AT&amp;amp;T
branded 1020 isn't the result is that
the 1020 still doesn't have the newest
improvements like Start screen folders
though you can join the preview for
developers program to get around this
it's nice to have the latest Windows
Phone improvements right out of the box
and given the more modern processor in
the Lumia 830 it's more future proof as
well in terms of support that newer
processor isn't enough to smooth out all
the jitters in the day-to-day
responsiveness it is a mid-range phone
after all and in side-by-side testing
the 830 is only marginally more speedy
than the 1020 in app launch times and
screen loads despite the jump from two
cores to four we're now talking about a
quantum leap in power here at least as
far as responsiveness goes the 1020 does
have a small edge in gaming at least
with some titles while low demand apps
like rise of glory run identically on
each of these phones graphically intense
games like asphalt 8 play more smoothly
on the older hardware of the 1020 with
fewer frame drops and skips in both
video and audio whether you prefer the
side firing speakerphone of the 1020 or
the rear mounted driver of the 830
probably everyone can agree that
front-facing speakers would have been a
better call and speaking of audio
there's not much here to distinguish
these from one another
in terms of phone calls just like the
1020 the 830 delivers adequate call
quality there's nothing really
remarkable in terms of noise
cancellation or clarity one of the
biggest differences in cameras here
comes right at the startup more often
than not the 830 beats the 1020 and
launch time despite the newer phone
having only half the RAM and when Lumia
camera 5 lands for the 8:30 performances
promised to get even faster while the
1020 is probably doomed to stay pokey
forever that's because the 1020 packs a
41 megapixel camera producing shots too
high in resolution for its old s4
processor to handle via background
oversampling so the 1020 will probably
be forever behind the 830 in terms of
camera features and speed now as a 1020
owner none of this makes me happy
so it's nice to be able to brag that the
41 megapixel sensor and my old warthog
produces much sharper shots much more
zoomable than the 8 megapixel or 10
megapixel output of the newer cheaper
phone also there's the small matter of
the xenon flash in the 1020 which is
much better for capturing objects in
motion and the 10 20s viewfinder tends
to respect focal settings more with a
shallower depth of field than the 830 in
these respects the 1020 is more pseudo
professional camera while the 830 is
more your typical point-and-shoot that
being said this isn't by any means a
total Smackdown the a 30 actually
improves on the 1020 in some respects
with a minimum focal range of 10
centimeters versus 15 you can get much
closer to a subject with the 830
also that greenish yellow tint of the
1020 partially corrected with software
updates is nowhere to be found on the
830 and that goes double indoors under
incandescent lighting given the almost
comical color reproduction problems of
the 1020 in some of these shots it's
easy to forget just how much more
capable its sensor is until you remember
that you can take the raw 38 megapixel d
NGS into your editing software of choice
and tweak them to your heart's content
again the 1020 a mess to be a semi-pro
tool whereas the 830 capable as it is
Falls much more into the mainstream and
the broad truths in the cameras
translate to the phones themselves at
450 bucks unlocked it's definitely weird
for Microsoft to position the 830 is an
affordable flagship and that's something
we touch on in the full review too
considering you can get the 1024 much
less isn't that the phone to pick here
the answer is yes but only if you're
strictly talking about the camera even
then you've got to want the pixels real
bad the 1020 is the only 41 megapixel
shooter on a major smartphone platform
and that super high-resolution paired
with digital zoom and a xenon flash mean
you can get shots with the 1020 you
still can't get anywhere else including
the 830 in almost every other way though
the 830 is the smarter buy here it's
newer hardware means it's software -
whilst a newer for longer and some of
that software will power camera features
even the 1020 won't get factoring the
bonuses of the removable battery
expandable storage changeable back
covers integrated wireless charging
yada-yada-yada you get the point well I
won't be ditching my 1020 for the 8:30
anytime soon someone stuck choosing
between them today will almost
definitely best be served by the newer
Albia technically lower end model keep
in mind folks this is not pocket now's
Lumia 830 review that video is linked
