kaam kaam and this is another episode of
the windows phone 7 app roundup in which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started
photoshop is a free application
available in the windows marketplace
that allows you to add graphics and text
to your existing photos so we can do is
I already selected photo love to do is
go down here and let's say they don't
want to choose on the words head it's
not to do is pick something let's try
these 3d glasses and they're a little
big right now so can make them smaller I
using pinch to zoom and I can also move
them and rotate them see here now looks
pretty good so now we can add some
subtext and what's to enter and go down
and say add text and we can move the
text and align it and then we're
finished with our photo one now we can
save police scanner 7 is a paid for
application which costs two dollars 98
cents on the windows marketplace so what
this application allows you to do is to
listen to various EMS feeds and police
scanner feeds from the internet and to
various countries so let's hear see here
we can choose any one of these countries
so we have all these countries to choose
from or we can also scan for our
favorites and we can listen to the top
10 so we can load the top 10 and here we
could listen to the Los Angeles Police
Department because they probably have
some pretty exciting stuff going on
Wikipedia is the official Wikipedia
application available the windows
marketplace that is free so what we can
do is we can search for something so I'm
going to search for Windows 17 so we'll
click here and here we have the windows
phone 7 Wikipedia page and the cool
thing about this version is it does have
full graphics we can also go down here
to the content and quick search if we
like so let's learn to church search for
contacts LEDs go from there and I'll
bring us directly to what we are looking
for full house poker is an xbox live
game that cost two dollars and
ninety-nine cents on the windows
marketplace so this is a pretty simple
texas hold'em game and there's three
different gaming styles so right here
i'm going to check because i have a pair
of Queens which is which is pretty good
so let's see what the other players have
and we can play against live people or
we can also play against the computer so
we'll just check again and now I think
I'll bet a little bit of money here
try about 30 bucks or so on that's close
enough and it looks as though I won
because everybody else 450 word search
is a free game avail on the windows
marketplace so it's pretty simple to set
up all we have to do is select our
difficulty select our category which try
dinner and all I do is click start and
now I can begin by selecting in one of
these words if I can find them let's see
here i found milk so in my okay and then
it will cross it out and game continues
on just like this and it's a pretty good
if you want to waste some time let's see
here we have pie and let's see what else
we can find if you can find anything in
