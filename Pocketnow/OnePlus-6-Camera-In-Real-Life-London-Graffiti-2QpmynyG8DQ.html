at least I got to write on the black
calves so one puzzles made it a big deal
for the last couple of years over how
much they have worked on improving the
cameras of their most latest smartphones
but sadly in the past they never really
got it right I think until now I'm
hiding everything that I would pocket
now and let's see what the oneplus 6 can
do from the beautiful city of London
bear in mind there is a separate video
with our final thoughts and the reveal
the 1 plus 6 this is just in our
experience here in London which was
quite early when we had the phone but
it's been great so far
some of the things that makes London
famous is their graffiti for actually
doing a graffiti tour with the rest of
the gang it's going great I mean I see a
lot of art here not just the standard
graffiti you'll see on the streets but
just wow some paintings on the walls
that are amazing
so it makes the oneplus 6 camera special
has everything to do with the company's
approach which is completely unique in
the past you would see cases like
telephoto lenses or monochrome sensors
this is a completely different approach
where we actually have two cameras a 16
megapixel F 1.7 1.2 2 microns at a new
Sony IMX sensor with really interesting
results and then the secondary lens that
we have here is a 20 megapixel F 1.7 as
well but interesting it's not there for
anything else but to help out with
portrait mode so again this is just very
interesting and also one of the things
that I commend oneplus mostly is for
their software no gimmicks straight to
the point
easy photography and amazing speeding
the launching the camera app definitely
things that I like and so why graffiti
definitely the oneplus 6 gets color
reproduction right let me show you
you know I've been very honest in the
past I've loved 1+4 many things except
their cameras but right now is a
different story I feel that the company
has truly figured a ton of things out
it's got its specially known proprietary
version of HDR I love the color
reproduction and I love that the photos
are very natural it's not horrible
punchy saturation that then becomes just
difficult to edit on Instagram for
example it's the complete contrary the
phone performs great and then probably
one of the most important changes for me
was really low light photography that
was probably the Achilles heel of
one-plus phones before I've had at least
three people come up to me and be like
wait a second that phone took that photo
last night we were at a oneplus dinner
we took a shot and if there was a galaxy
s 9 in part of the group and we also
tried the one plus six and the result of
the one plus six was significantly
better
I've told you moving subjects in the
Galaxy S nine has been a big issue and
we didn't have that problem with the one
plus six which for me surprising
definitely a lot of positive work here
one of the things this phone does really
well is video recording I'm insanely
impressed with the stabilization of the
video and you've also got all of the
latest standards because it's this
holcomb snapdragon 845 so we've got 4k
video at 60 frames per second
there's also a 480 frames per second
slow-mo video as well and I mean just
look at the samples the stabilization is
interesting in the phone does this very
interesting play where if you're at any
other standard that's not 4k at 60
you'll be using a is and then if you're
at 4k at 60 it uses oh is and then
there's electronic image stabilization
for the selfie video not a big fan of
the crop of the stabilization is just so
good it makes you forget about it
interesting so we have two lenses for
portrait mode the results are actually
very good surprisingly better than I
expected
mainly because oneplus is not trying to
play around with fake effects or
anything they're trying to do it as
natural as possible I don't really care
what technology is being used so long as
the results are there and I would
definitely recommend the usage of
portrait more on this phone now bear in
mind portrait mode on the selfie camera
is not enabled at the time of this video
now you know I'm not the biggest fan of
Celtic photos but I do like the 1600
pixel sensor it is very wide captures a
lot of detail and most of the time it'll
do a good job the palm is obviously if
you're in a well-lit situation sometimes
it'll over expose and probably not
provide the best results so yes these
are final impressions of the one plus
six and it's camera I again am very
impressed let us know in the comments
what you think again in our full review
we'll provide more details
why are you added make sure you follow
us on social media subscribe to our
channel for more videos like this one
and follow me on Twitter hi boundaries
quartering better on Instagram and hang
with me better please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I'm
hating everything I think so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
