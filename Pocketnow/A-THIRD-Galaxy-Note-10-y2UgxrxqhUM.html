Note 10 because yeah I said plus not
throw looks like Johnny Ives departure
from Apple has been something that's
been working for a bit and until in
Microsoft don't seem to be getting along
as AMD might be stepping up
I'm hi Mary that I and greetings from
Kyoto because you can't blame me for
being in Japan and not indulging myself
though that's the smallest closet known
to mankind
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals of here in
the market for a Samsung Galaxy Note 9
well you know that the note 10 is coming
up we've actually got some rumors that
we're gonna cover very soon at the end
of the show but the thing about it is
the note 9 is currently just $4.99 on
eBay you can find it for 550 at B&amp;amp;H and
you will be finding more and more deals
for the no tonight it's continues to be
one of my favorite phones expected after
the buzz video coming soon as a yeah I
think it's due now let's talk about
Apple and its strategy for the Mac Pro
and the China ban and I'll explain it a
bit why this matches because well we've
seen companies moving their production
away from China for obvious reasons
we've even seen Foxconn CEO for some
weird reasons asking Apple you know what
we should move production to Taiwan
think about it as Apple has just sort of
made it official that manufacturing for
the Mac Pro is not going to happen in
the United States which is sad
definitely this was great that Apple was
manufacturing the Mac Pro in the United
States but no now it's moving production
to quantity nough because apparently
certain materials for the components and
everything would be more I guess less
expensive to manufacture in China but
it's just rather interesting I mean
we're in the middle of a trade war and
we've got companies moving production
away and Apple is actually starting a
new line up in China so yeah and since
we're talking about China
let's move the spotlight over to the
feature of LCD displays and on display
fingerprint scanners and WC Shanghai is
currently happening and BOE has just
announced that they figured out a way to
get in display fingerprint scanners to
work on LCDs in the past this was
currently a limitation for hardware and
you notice that right now you only find
them on
oled displays so yeah LCDs and if you're
asking why why not just make the shift
to Oh LEDs the thing about it is LCDs
are still a huge chunk of the market one
point four five billion smartphones last
year alone eighty-five percent of them
had LCDs so definitely I'll say these
are not going away
not anytime soon and they're actually
getting better and better they're more
power efficient in certain cases so yeah
it seems that this is coming here now
let's talk about Microsoft and Intel and
AMD and let me explain to you why
because this is I know weird MD has
become famous for its GPUs not
necessarily for its processors and
that's been the thing for years decades
usually until has always been a step up
when it came to processors think about
it as that hasn't been the case for the
last couple of years we've seen Intel
struggling and being able to give us a
10 nanometer chip at a time when ARM
processors are already killing it so to
think about it is we hear that the next
generation of surface laptops and
tablets is going to come with AMD
Picasso processors not Intel and we also
hear that Microsoft is already working
hard with Qualcomm on taking the always
connected PC to another level with some
project Excalibur that it's designing
in-house but being built by Qualcomm so
Wow
yeah this is very interesting because it
does show that arm is you know getting
better than ever and also I'm glad to
see AMD back in the processor game in a
better way so let's just see when we get
these products and let's continue
talking about Jonathan Ive and the news
that we covered yesterday over the fact
that he is stepping down as Apple's
chief design officer and starting his
own company the thing about it is let's
remember that name chief design officer
because according to certain reports the
company has already scaled back and had
already begun scaling back
responsibilities from Johnny Ives
since 2015 when he was named chief
design officer and it was mainly because
he was burned out
he claimed that ever since the Apple
watch that took a huge toll on him that
he was tired and it came to the point
where the company had already begun
working on his successors which were
already named and they were already
scaling back responsibilities up to the
point
I've went to Apple campus probably twice
a week sometimes he went to London
constantly sometimes meetings with his
design team happened in hotels and so
yeah this was something that was coming
meaning I guess that this is Cooper
Tino's way of telling us that we
shouldn't worry about the future of
Apple products because it has been
something that already begun but people
are just gonna use the Mac Pro stand as
a way to criticize Apple and be worried
about this
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
covering reports that there are four
Galaxy Note variants that are coming
we've covered rumors of 5g now we see
that there is a plus variant and this is
rather interesting because we haven't
seen this before we've got two images
leaked of the screen turning on showing
the plus we see the back and the back
doesn't really look any different to any
other Galaxy Note 10 and as it turns out
we're actually assuming that because we
hear rumors that one is 5g and what is
not it could just be that this plus is
the standard variant and then the pro is
going to be the 5g variant whatever the
case may be let us know in the comments
what do you think do you think that it's
a good idea for us to have so many
variants of the galaxy know 10 or do you
think that this is a smart approach
because in my case I think it's smart I
think that a lot of companies
particularly Samsung experimented with
three variants of the galaxy s 10 so why
not three variants of the galaxy note
10-4 the fall that fights with apples
tennis Mac's or 11s Mac's I think it's a
good strategy but let us know what you
think in the comments down below
