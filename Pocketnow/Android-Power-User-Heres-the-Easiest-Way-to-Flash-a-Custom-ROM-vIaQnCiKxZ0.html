you've been following along with our
Android power user series you already
know about rooting you know about super
user you know about custom recovery
images today we're going to show you an
app that ties in with clockworkmod
recovery which we showed you in that
previous video and I'm going to show you
how easy it is to flash a custom ROM
like I mentioned in the intro this is my
Nexus 7 it has been routed and I do have
a custom recovery ROM running the ROM
that I have this clockworkmod recovery
and the same person that makes that
makes this app called rom manager rom
manager comes in two parts this which is
just basic and free it lets you do a
whole bunch of cool stuff and then a
premium key that unlocks some of the
extra advanced features that runs you
right around six bucks us so let's go
ahead and fire this up when you launch
rom manager you're going to see this
interface and one of the things that you
can do here is reboot into recovery and
do some other recovery based things now
this is very basic all it's doing is
it's taking all the commands that you'd
normally do in your recovery image and
it's wiring them up to all of these
different menu items so you just tap
them it'll reboot into recovery and take
care of it for you very quick very easy
very nice one additional feature and
this is available in the premium edition
is to check for ROM updates now it's
going to go out and check and it's not
gonna find anything because I just
installed this but I'm gonna show you
how to do it again so we're gonna go
ahead and download a rom in this case
I'm gonna download a CyanogenMod nightly
and I'm going to grab the october
fifteenth version we can look at any
comments and hit the download button i
also want to grab google apps or gaps
we'll say ok to that and now because I
already had it downloaded it's already
there so it's saying this is what we're
gonna do next
normally this is where it would take a
little bit of time to
load do I want to back up my existing
ROM wipe data and cache or wipe dalvik
cache since this is just an upgrade from
one version of the ROM to another
version of the ROM it just a nightly so
a very small incremental update I'm just
gonna wipe the dalvik cache so I've got
that checked and I'll say okay it warns
me that it's going to reboot and install
this will say ok to that it's been
granted Super User permissions I don't
know if you caught that and then it's
going to reboot into clockworkmod
recovery once it comes up into recovery
I don't have to do anything at all it's
already passed off all the parameters
that it needs to do and it goes ahead
and installs the update as soon as
that's done then it's going to install
the gapps package as well all right so
now we've finished installing we're
going on to the gaps for Android 4.1.1
even though this is Android 4.1.2 it's
copying those files over as soon as
that's complete we'll see another status
update so there's our status bar we'll
see an update down here and then it'll
continue on so we're done copying over
it's fixing the permissions and
unmounting the system it's now complete
and rebooting up into my newly flash
drum that's it
that's all it takes as simple as that
you can flash a new version of your
existing rom or if you wanted to use one
of those two options - to backup your
current rum and to wipe everything you
can flash an entirely new ROM if you
want to flash another ROM just select
another one from the list and tell it
you want to backup your current ROM and
wipe everything before you flash the ROM
quick easy fast and easy to revert back
to if you want if you want to download a
rom from somewhere else that's not in
that list that we showed you it's easy
you just hit the install from sdcard
link and you can install it just as
easily as we did this very nice ROM
manager is definitely the way to go
whenever you are going to be flashing
custom roms but just in case you don't
have ROM manager or if our manager isn't
working
or if you just want to do things a
little bit differently I'm gonna how
show you how to use fastboot to do
essentially the same thing in the
upcoming video so make sure you hit the
subscribe
button so you don't miss out on that and
if you haven't watched the previous
videos where we talked about routing and
super user and custom recovery images
I'll have a link to the entire Android
power user series at the end of this
video as well if you liked what you saw
make sure you give the video a big
thumbs up thanks for watching for pocket
now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
