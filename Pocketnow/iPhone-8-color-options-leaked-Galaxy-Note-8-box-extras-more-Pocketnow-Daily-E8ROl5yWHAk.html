three color options and production is
almost ready Samsung Galaxy Note 8
rumors point to additional storage
options and even packaging extras and we
get more credible photos of what the
Google pixel 2 will look like I'm Heine
Rivera and you know what the only irony
and Odyssey of 2017 is Nintendo Nintendo
switch without a Mario game this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with software updates it
might take a few weeks for the HTC u11
to get it but for those of you that
we're wondering exactly why the U 11 is
not capable of 60 frames per second and
video recording that's actually going to
come very soon you can learn more about
that and the other capabilities that are
coming in the links in the description
even though again it's apparently going
to take a bit for it to happen now let's
talk about the lgbtq as the company
continues to tease when we should expect
this device to be announced at Aoife I
personally can't wait but for those of
you that want more confirmation on what
this phone would look like well there is
the HIPAA court ad that's being
currently prepared as we know that LG
continues with its a marketing campaign
which I don't really like personally but
yeah if you want to see photos of the
phone in real life that's what it looks
like and I actually like it a lot now
let's talk about the Google pixel - as
we also get some leaked images of what
this phone is going to look like we know
that it's not going to follow on the
design of the Google pixel XL - and I
think that's not necessarily a bad thing
I'm not saying I don't want this 18 by 9
aspect ratio but I do notice they're you
know speakers making the cut and there
is no device with 18 by 9 today that is
capable of providing this functionality
so yeah the bezels might have
functionality being added now let's see
if that's going to be the case and as
many assume the price tag of the Galaxy
Note 8 might not necessarily be very
affordable I mean we've even seen the
Galaxy s8 active going live for $850
which is extremely steep but it seems
that Samsung might try to compensate for
this apparently we're getting a case
bundled in the box I'm not saying that
that actually compensates for the price
tag hopefully that case provides some
sort of functionality that will be
pregnant and
only available to the note but
regardless of that apparently there is
also going to be a 256 gig storage
variance that's only going to be
available in Korea so that's even going
to be even more offensive stay tuned we
are just compiling rumors as we get
closer to the announcement and finally
the very hot rumors that they have to do
with the iPhone 8 those of you wondering
color options we've got some leaked
photographs that show is that we have
some sort of a rose gold that looks like
pink to black and definitely some sort
of like a silver color option all of
these look actually very good with the
glass finish but we also have KGI
chiming in into a couple of things
number one but at Ranelagh production is
going to start as early as September
which is actually a full month before
the company predicted it to start the
other is that apparently the demand for
this phone is going to be so staggering
but even if Apple might be ready to have
some of these units as many as four
million on launch date it will not even
be close to enough to match the amount
of demand that people are going to have
to wait months to get their phones which
is usually what happens with iPhones but
anyways it leads me to the question
today let's forget about the whole
demand thing which is usually what
happens with Apple what about the color
options what do you think if you had to
choose which one would you pick in my
case the only reason I have ever picked
black iPhones is because the bezels were
large and I prefer black bezels but if
that silver color option includes black
bezels on the front I will totally go
for that leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
