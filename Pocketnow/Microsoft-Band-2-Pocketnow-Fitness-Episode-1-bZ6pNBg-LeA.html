every calorie every rep when you're
working hard it all counts and
everything has to be accurate I'm I'm
going to be better with pocket now and
this is PocketNow fitness you'd be
shocked at the amount of requests we get
every single day of people asking us to
recommend a good wearable for fitness
surely this is the era of smartwatches
and fitness trackers but not every one
of these products is designed to address
all the needs of somebody that wants to
take Fitness seriously so just like we
review smartwatches and smartphones
we've decided to create a separate
segment that only focuses on the fitness
capabilities of a specific wearable this
is episode 1 of PocketNow fitness and we
decided to start it off with the
Microsoft band
like its predecessor the
second-generation Microsoft band
continues to be a polarizing product it
looks far better than the previous model
but continues to stand in between being
a SmartWatch and being a fitness tracker
out of the box you get the band two
front and center and inside you're
greeted with a lot of literature and a
proprietary magnetic charging and sync
table it's curved design invites you to
use it on your dominant hand as you
would a fitness tracker but the problem
is that even its hefty size and weight
we doubt that you'll also want to use a
regular watch on your non-dominant wrist
because of the amount of bulk you'll be
carrying it is a heavy product and the
battery enclosure within the class
mechanism makes it even more
uncomfortable when trying to flex your
wrist to make matters worse none of the
components of the band are replaceable
and within just a few weeks of wear and
tear we really wonder if this van will
be able to withstand the full year of
use on the positive front the bevy of
sensors hidden within makes up for a lot
of its shortcomings this is one of the
few smart wearables out there with a
combo of a built-in GPS an active
optical heart rate sensor and even a UV
sensor for your skin in addition to the
usual accelerometer gyro ambient light
sensor and others it's also one of the
few wearables that supports almost all
the smartphone and computer platforms
out there and even better you don't
really need to carry your phone on a run
for the band to work as it'll simply
sync your data with your device or
computer once you're done all this combo
of specifications proved to be a mixed
bag when using the Microsoft band 2
while training the device doesn't really
have much memory so this means a few
limitations that are rather annoying
on one hand you're limited to only 13
live tiles of usage options which you
can switch around within the companion
application but which limit the things
you're able to track at the same time
that low memory also means you should
sync your band continuously and if you
decided to leave your phone at home you
won't be able to use the band too for
carrying music which is
rather sad point that aside the
Microsoft band 2 is extremely accurate
for most of the trainings that I used it
for on an average day I start with a
four to six mile run followed by an hour
of weight training and then 30 minutes
of spinning to discharge and my
experience was rather good running is
definitely one of the devices strong
points a band to does take a while to
catch on GPS signal but it's smart
enough to allow you to start running
while it finds the satellites once
you're on the road you'll notice that
it's very accurate at calculating your
mileage your average pace and the ammo
that display is just perfect when trying
to read your stats on the go the heart
rate sensor is also fairly accurate when
compared to the polar 870s strap and you
know what I'll admit that even with the
awkward design
I was never bothered by the feel of the
band - during my 6 mile run and I can't
really say the same about a chest strap
indoor cycling or spinning with this
device is also rather Pleasant just like
when running the heart rate sensor is
fairly accurate and monitors your whole
workout and I really didn't feel
bothered by the band - at any time and
again the display is also very pleasant
to use as the numbers are very easy to
read while you're training probably the
only activity where I truly didn't like
the Microsoft band - was with weight
training the class mechanism is simply
too uncomfortable when doing dips and
pretty much most of the reps you do
whenever you have to use your arms the
band - would definitely benefit from
moving the battery to the top of the
unit since flexing your wrist is a
downward movement that you have to do
all the time
this activity even affects the accuracy
of the heart rate sensor which was
around a hundred calories below the
polar h7t when weight training speaking
of the battery this is also something
you truly have to consider when buying
the Microsoft band - on an average day
when you don't train the bent could
pretty much last up to two days but
Microsoft only commits to 5 hours of
battery life when tracking yourself with
a GPS and that was
about right if you're like me and you're
runway trained and then spin on one day
the band is most likely gonna survive
but this is no triathletes wearable the
Microsoft band 2 also tracks other
fitness activities like golf and even
when you sleep and the Microsoft web
application is rather complete and
giving you a full training session when
working out the only question left is if
you're really willing to use the band
too when sleeping for example as again
it's not the most comfortable wearable
out there and the battery doesn't last
more than just a few days
overall using the Microsoft band 2 was
good but this product just isn't for me
your mileage may vary but my bad
experiences with weight training were
enough of a deal-breaker for my needs at
$250 and considering the things that it
can do right and the storage limitation
that it has I'd rather buy a garmin
vivoactive for a little less money on
Amazon and with a chest strap included
if you're invested in the Windows Phone
platform your choices are rather narrow
but if you're on any other platform you
might want to skip and wait for the
Microsoft band 3 or by any other
wearable out there the only problem is
that other competing wearables are
either not as smart or not as good as
the Microsoft band 2 when it comes to
fitness anyways that's it for episode 1
