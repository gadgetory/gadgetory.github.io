HTC website asustes is a new metallic
miracle coming to mwc and LG teases an
LG optimus f7 among others I'm hi meri
behna and I do wish that coffee was fed
intravenously this is walking out daily
now have a look at this interesting new
case even though HTC did not mention a
red variant of the HTC One Steven and I
were covering the news yesterday we
notice that there was a Red Baron being
mentioned in the website you can even
select it and notice how the HTC One
looked in red now interesting enough
it's no longer available on the website
and it just begs to wonder if this is a
mistake that just happened on the
website or there really will be a red
variant coming in the future so stay
tuned now speed of the HTC One the
benchmarks are in in this device smokes
everything out there absolutely
everything the Snapdragon 600 does
proved to be at least 25 percent faster
than just about everything in the market
so don't let me bore you what the
numbers hit the links and get the full
details on the numbers but so far just
remember numbers are one thing on paper
and then there's real wolf performance
so stay tuned for our review and we'll
tell you that's the real deal now get
this apparently that Snapdragon 600 is
so good the new reports have Sammy even
ditching the Exynos 5 octa for the next
galaxy s4 apparently that Snapdragon 600
could power the galaxy s4 at least in
some markets and apparently it has to do
with that adrenal gpo that's included in
the Snapdragon so stay tuned obviously
these are rumors and it's probably too
early to know just yet but so far the
seem like that processor is really all
that now let's move over to mwc LG has
just brought out their first teaser
we've also got some leaks but salient
don't match with the previous teasers
that we had apparently LG was planning a
new product brand to be launched at mwc
and all we have is an optimus f7 and f5
a lot of the teaser that mentions
freedom a lot but not really anything
concrete so stay tuned obviously Tony
and Michael will be at the event and
they'll bring you all the goods once
that they happen and finally for the
interesting news of the day as soon as
also provided their mwc 2013 teaser
which is actually a very
video kind of interesting and it
provides details on apparently a new
metallic miracle happening for mwc the
question is what do they mean I mean
they're transformer pad infinity
whatever numbers have been good products
but they sadly have not taken off in the
same case what goes for the issues
padfone hopefully they will be as
popular as the nexus 7 but obviously it
begs to wonder if the market will behave
as well as the products are so that
leads you to the question of the day
what do you think about Android tablets
are mean are you planning to get an
android tablet this year so far they
have been good products the Nexus 7 has
been a great tablet but sadly they
haven't taken off as well as the iPad so
it begs to wonder if good products don't
necessarily mean good sales so leave us
a comment down below what do you think
and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm and

you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
better thanks for watching see you
tomorrow then three months and 18 days
is the original launch of the Nokia
Lumia 920 at first we were all amazed by
the first smartphone with optical
civilization on the camera but then we
were all dismayed by that fake
advertisement that pretty much tarnished
the PureView brand so the question is
how does it do by stacked up after some
real-world use well michael fisher has
just prepared as after the bus so join
us on thursday februari 21st for the
Nokia Lumia 920 after the buzz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
