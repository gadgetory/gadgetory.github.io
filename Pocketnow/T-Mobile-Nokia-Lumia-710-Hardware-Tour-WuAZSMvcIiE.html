pocketnow.com next up we're gonna do a
little hardware tour of the Lumia 710
from Nokia
I'm t-mobile but we're also gonna do a
little comparison with the HTC rare for
Jesus that's a pretty comparable device
first off be sure to check out the link
in the description for more details on
all the specifications on the Nokia
Lumia 710 and we're gonna just gonna
take a little tour around the device
there's our screen up here we have a
sensor that is not a front-facing camera
there's your speaker and nokia logo and
down here we have the back Windows key
and search button it's all one piece of
plastic but it's we can press different
sides of it and this is a physical
button this is not your normal
capacitive buttons which are cheaper
make and smoother to the touch and
easier to touch easier to activate but
there's a good thing about this if
you're playing a game you don't
accidentally press your buttons over
here you really have to press them
because they are plastic buttons and
there's your timo logo and the
microphone
I'll just lit right there on the bottom
we don't have anything except for a
lanyard hole this is for people that
like to attach dangly things or you know
a little looped you know keep track of
it so we have that there over here we
have nothing but a little fingernail
slot that's to get the back battery off
battery cover rather at the top of our
micro USB port a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and the power button over here we
have the volume controls and the camera
button camera button is kind of flush
with the device
see it's hard to feel you gotta find it
before you press it but the volume
buttons have a little ledges there which
make them pretty easy to feel kind of
wish the camera button was easier to
feel for while you're holding in your
pocket so you can you know go straight
to the camera right hold him down like
that okay on the back we had our five
megapixel camera and an LED flash nokia
logo again and just this little tiny
slit is the speaker and this is not
really your speaker's just decoration
and there's your Nokia 710 label and if
you put your finger over the speaker it
definitely gets muffled really easily
now this back is a nice soft matte feel
to it and in the hand it actually feels
very ergonomic really feels nice you see
these little ledges there those those
fit really nicely with your fingers it's
where my thumb and fingers are it's a
really nice feel to it okay let's open
this up now to open it you gotta get
your finger in there and push it pretty
hard there we go so there's our battery
this is 1300 milliamp hours and is very
thin that's pretty nice
and there's your micro SIM card slot
it's kind of difficult to get it out but
can you get I'm just gonna leave it in
there okay and one of the cool things
about this device is these backs you can
replace them and get different colors
you know white yellow pink blue so if
you're one of those people that really
likes another color of your phone to be
something personal
you will eventually be able to buy
different back for this
alright you guys step back in place now
since this device is on t-mobile for
only 50 bucks but sometimes it can get
free we're also going to compare it to
another pretty budget-friendly device on
t-mobile the HTC Radar 4G so here's your
size comparison they're pretty close the
radar is a little bit thinner and of
course the radar is metal case non
removal battery and capacitive buttons
there and the radar also has a
front-facing camera so you can see what
differences there but let's also look at
some of the benchmarks for the screen
okay so what is the screen like on the
Lumia 710 this has actually has a
polarizing film as a layer under there
which is supposed to make the blacks
much blacker and also reduce glare a
little bit so here's a color ramp and
you can see the differences there this
one seems a little bit more washed out
and let's go back to a different style
let's look at the ingredients you can
see a different hue here this one seems
a little cooler maybe there's a little
bit of green in there and let's do these
colors so both of these we see a lot of
banding but we definitely have better
blacks over there
and let's look at the blacks and this
one actually we do see a little more
glare so the polarizing may be helping
that on the Nokia and lastly let's look
at color shifting from different angles
you can see the colors are actually
different already and the Nokia seems to
change as we tilt it probably has
something to do with the polarizing film
now you probably also want to know how
that compares to a really good screen
like the Samsung Focus s so again we're
seeing a little bit different shade of
color there and you can see how it
changes as we tilt
but the color ramps are pretty close
looking pretty good there and there's
your blacks okay now for speed this is a
one point form gigahertz processor and
actually in the speed test it does
pretty well gets the score in the 90s on
WP bench which is pretty nice so we're
not talking a a slow device even though
it's very inexpensive so that's our
quick look at the Nokia Lumia 710
hardware stay tuned for more on the
software side of things that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
