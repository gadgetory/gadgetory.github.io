calm next up we're going to do a little
hardware tour of the Lumia 710 from
Nokia I'm t-mobile but we're also going
to do a little comparison with the HTC
rare 4g since that's a pretty comparable
device first off be sure to check out
the link in the description for more
details on all the specifications on the
Nokia Lumia 710 and we're going to just
going to take a little tour around the
device there's our screen up here we
have a sensor that is not a front-facing
camera there's your speaker a Nokia logo
and down here we have the back windows
key and search button it's all one piece
of plastic but it's we can press
different sides of it and this is a
physical button this is not your normal
capacitive buttons which are cheaper
make and smoother to the touch and
easier to touch easier to activate but
there's a good thing about this if
you're playing a game you don't
accidentally press your buttons over
here you really have to press them
because they are plastic buttons and
there's your team logo and the
microphone I'll it right there on the
bottom we don't have anything except for
a lanyard hole this is for people that
like to attach dangly things or you know
a little loop to keep track of it so at
that they're over here we have nothing
but a little a fingernail slot that's to
get the back battery off battery cover
rather at the top of a our micro USB
port a 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
the power button over here we have the
volume controls and the camera button
camera button is kind of flush with the
device
you see it's hard to feel you gotta find
it before you press it but the volume
buttons have a little ledges there which
make them pretty easy to feel kind of
wish the camera button was easier to
feel for while you're holding in your
pocket so you can go straight to the
camera right hold them down at that okay
on the back we have our 5 megapixel
camera and an LED flash no kala again
and just this little tiny slit is the
speaker this is not really your
speaker's just decoration and there's
your Nokia 710 label and if you put your
finger over the speaker it definitely
gets muffled real easily now this back
is a nice soft matte feel to it and in
the hand it actually feels very
ergonomic really feels nice you see
these little ledges there those those
fit really nicely with your fingers so
where my thumb and fingers are it's a
really nice field of it ok let's open
this up now to open it you gotta get
your finger in there and push it pretty
hard there we go so there's our battery
this is 1300 milliamp hours and is very
thin that's pretty nice and there's your
micro sim card slot it's kind of
difficult to get it out but can you get
I'm just gonna leave it in there okay
and one of the cool things about this
device is these backs you can replace
them and get your colors you know white
yellow pink blue so if you're one of
those people that really likes another
color of your phone to be something
personal you will eventually be able to
buy different back
this all right you guys snap back in
place now since this device is on
t-mobile for only 50 bucks but sometimes
you can get free we're also going to
compare it to another pretty
budget-friendly device on t-mobile the
HTC radar 4g so here's your size
comparison they're pretty close the
radar is a little bit thinner and of
course the radar is a metal case
non-removable battery and capacitive
buttons there and the radar also has a
front facing camera so you can see the
difference is there but let's also look
at some of the benchmarks for the screen
okay so what is the screen leg on the
Lumia 710 this has actually has a
polarizing film as a layer under there
which is supposed to make the blacks
much blacker and also reduce glare a
little bit so here's a color ramp and
you can see the difference is there this
one seems a little bit more washed out
let's go back to a different style let's
look at the ingredients you can see a
different hue here this one seems a
little cooler maybe there's a little bit
of green in there and let's do these
colors so both of these we see a lot of
banding but we definitely have better
blacks over there
and let's look at the blacks and this
one actually we do see a little more
glare so the polarizing may be helping
that on the Nokia and lastly let's look
at color shifting from different angles
you can see the colors are actually
different already and the Nokia seems to
change as we tilt it probably has
something to do with depolarizing film
now you probably also want to know how
that compares to a really good screen
like the sampson focus s so again we're
seeing a little bit different shade of
color there and you can see how it
changes as we tilt
but the color ramps are pretty close
lookin pretty good there there's your
blacks ok now for speed this is a 1.4
gigahertz processor and actually in the
speed test it does pretty well gets the
score in the 90s on WP bench which is
pretty nice so we're not talking to a
slow device even though it's very
inexpensive so that's our quick look at
the nokia lumia 710 hardware stay tuned
for more on the software side of things
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
