pocketnow.com you know many agree that
the web OS operating system is a shining
star in the smartphone industry it's
just been sort of underutilized in
hardware that hasn't been so great which
is one of the reasons that people really
applauded HP's move to buy palm because
now HP with their vast resources can
really invest in webos and they're doing
just that we're going to have webOS
tablets new webos devices heck maybe
webOS printers so there's a very bright
future for webos and in this video we
did an opportunity to review the palm
pre 2 we just wanted to talk about it we
may or may not do a full review because
the phone has been out for a couple of
months but wanted to take a look at it
and give you a different perspective on
it to see how webos 2.0 the new software
and the new hardware comes together to
create a new smartphone experience let's
get to the unboxing
okay and this is the unlocked version
that will work on a TNT's 3g network so
I'm just going to rip this open here and
dive into here it's also no secret that
verizon is going to be getting this
device soon so here it is the palm pre
to packaging is very similar to the
earlier palm devices let's see what we
get here palm to smartphone battery yep
okay let's open this up really cool
packaging here for the palm pre you
don't actually have the little tilting
area here there you can set it on that
slant but pretty cool box nonetheless
very minimal design changes between the
palm pre 2 and the palm pre plus and the
palm pre we're going to compare it to
the palm pre plus in a minute so I can
already tell you off the bet you've got
a much flatter screen here hopefully the
build quality is superior to the palm
pre plus because it really wasn't that
great I've got some information here
packaging isn't as fun really basic
stuff here I mean I don't even see
headphones just uh just a pamphlet so
pretty basic that's alright saving on
packaging keep the world green alright
so let's take a look at the palm pre too
so it's got the same smallish screen
kind of low resolution so it's 480 down
by 3 20 across you know hewlett-packard
has come out to say that there are going
to be higher resolution web OS devices
with different form factors coming out
soon which we're really looking forward
to I'd be nice to have a slate like
webos device with an on-screen keyboard
so if you're we've got the slide-out
keyboard keyboard looks identical to the
let's see the palm pre plus the
mechanism feels a little bit more secure
let's get a closer look at these
keyboards got the new one on the right
and then we've got the legacy sort of
legacy palm pre plus on the left so they
look about the same keyboard feel is
about the same the hinge like I said
feels a little bit upgraded it's kind of
cool to have this flat screen they're
kind of unusual and of course this is
compatible with a touchstone inductive
charger flipping over the back here
pretty much I'd
go back here identical there I mean it
pretty much tells the story here these
are very similar devices let's pop off
the back battery cover and take a look
at what we have back there without
ripping okay so we've got the touchstone
mechanism there we've got a battery
which is of size interesting that it
came already installed ok so it's 1150
milliamp hours really hoping that this
has much better battery life the
original pre had horrible battery life
the pre plus a slightly better battery
life and now hopefully with the palm pre
2 we get battery life that can last
through the day with heavy usage now of
course this has a much faster processor
1 gigahertz kind of giving more power to
webos which really needs more power
because it's such a visually intense
operating system with awesome cards that
you flip through things like that there
is your slot for the sim card we're
gonna pop in a sim card I'm going to use
it for a few days and come back on
camera and talk about experience here
with the the new palm pre to select this
video please give it a thumbs up and if
you want to see even more about the palm
pre to let us know if you're still
interested in this device and we'll be
sure to cover it in its full glory
