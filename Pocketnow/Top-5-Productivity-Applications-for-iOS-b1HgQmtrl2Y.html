productivity applications for Android
but what about iOS on Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and these are the top five
productivity applications for iOS
yesterday I covered the top five
productivity applications for Android
and truthfully this topic is a bit more
interesting on that platform since the
possibilities are virtually endless and
a large portion of the great
productivity apps on iOS are ones we've
heard of a million times already however
I did some digging and found some both
unique and awesome productivity apps for
iOS first is LastPass I felt the need to
include LastPass and this top five as
well as the Android video because I
don't go a single day without using
LastPass dozens of times I can't live
without it on Android and likewise on
iOS LastPass is essentially evolved
where I keep every password for every
online service I use Twitter Facebook
Instagram a dozen Gmail accounts my bank
accounts and everything in between and I
don't even know the vast majority of my
passwords as I randomly generate them
when I create the accounts to use
LastPass simply log in find the account
you want tap it select copy password and
paste it into the application you need
to log into the LastPass application is
free to download but it requires a
premium account to use via mobile which
is only twelve dollars per year it's
also practically totally cross-platform
with availability on Chrome Safari
Internet Explorer opera Firefox Mac OS
Windows Linux iOS Android Windows Phone
and Blackberry the next application is
one I found in my search last night
it's called 3030 and it does something
I've been meaning to implement in my
professional life for months now split
my day into efficient time blocks to
increase stamina focus and productivity
countless studies have shown that
working with intent for a stretch of
time followed by a short break increases
awareness and productivity different
people operate on different internal
clocks and schedules and that's what
makes 3030 so great you can set a
schedule for your entire day in short
time blocks I've chosen 45 minute
increments of intense work followed by a
15-minute break where I've read watch
videos and chat I have the timer set to
repeat until I end the loop but you can
also create preset timers maybe one for
your workout one for studying and one
for work whatever helps you stay focused
the most I've been trying it out today
and so
I'm loving it best of all it's
completely free continuing in that same
vein I now need a calendar to help keep
me on task and remind myself of
everything I have to do before I hated
dealing with calendars the process of
creating an event was and still very
much as with normal calendars annoying
fantastical not only has a beautiful and
easy-to-follow UI it has natural
language input for calendar entry
instead of creating an entry for go to
the grocery store then manually setting
the time I simply right go to the
grocery store at 5:00 for an hour the
event is created with a proper time
block it seems like such a small feature
but after using it it's difficult to go
back to the old way of creating calendar
entries but not only that it means I can
dictate calendar entries within
fantastical with proper time blocks you
can dictate calendar entries to Siri or
Google now but the process is much more
convoluted and requires multiple steps
fantastical too is currently on sale for
a dollar ninety-nine in the App Store
but normally sells for $4.99 another
application for iOS is a service I use
for many different things if this then
that if this than that is an online task
automation service where you create
recipes which pair mostly unrelated
services first you pick the this part of
the recipe say you choose Twitter and
you choose a new favorite tweet by you
as the trigger for the that portion of
the equation you choose pocket will be
save for later action now when you
favorite a tweet it's automatically
saved in your pocket account this is
only one of the thousands of examples I
have a recipe set up to send me a text
message when someone uploads a photo to
an Instagram account I help manage and a
notification to be sent to me when a new
Craigslist ad is added with my search
criteria within the free app you can
browse other people's recipes for ideas
create your own recipes and see all the
successfully triggered actions in your
own stream it's a very helpful tool to
have in your belt if you're into an
online service lifting some of the load
off your shoulders finally good reader
good reader was actually one of the
first applications I ever bought on iOS
when I picked up the original iPad at
its core it's a PDF viewer except it's
on a whole lot of steroids and bring
some much-needed functionality to iOS
namely a quasi file system you can
download files by directly pasting the
download link in the download field or
you can browse the
with the internal browser you can zip in
extract files and much much more you can
annotate PDFs and you can sync with
remote servers or services like Dropbox
Box SkyDrive Google Drive etc just know
this isn't a document editor but you can
move files into GoodReader for storage
and then open them in an app like Google
Drive to edit if you're looking for a
decent local file management system for
your iPad good reader is a great start
and the $4.99 price tag is definitely
warranted folks that's gonna do it if
