hate relationship I know for some of you
it could be with a spouse or significant
other for others it's a job or a
co-worker or even a season of the year
for me it's with a phone a device that I
love so much that I have a really hard
time forgiving for some odd design
choices as they get in the way of making
it great I'm hiding out with pocket now
when it's time for a review of the
Google pixel 3 excel just to give you an
idea of how much of a pixel user I am my
first ever Android phone was a nexus 1
and then almost every nexus after that
which means that I naturally drifted to
the first pixel even if I found it
really ugly which means that the Google
pixel to excel follow later once the
screen issues were addressed so I'm not
new to the idea that Google doesn't
really focus on building pretty phones
they're a software company and building
a useful product that disappears into
the experiences more important
the problem is when that particular
premise isn't meant and design gets in
the way of execution but first let me be
fair and begin this video by telling you
what's great about this phone one of my
favorite things is simply this phone at
a glance you guys have no idea how much
I love this clearly white color option
permits back it looks elegant it looks
sleek it looks different I mean what
other manufacturers using this color
with so much intent and with the tiny
black details and the ports along with
the green power button just adding to
its visuals
I'm also a huge fan of this frosted
finish along with the smooth accent at
the top
surely the glass means added heft but
the finish makes it hard to notice
fingerprints or smudges I have a feeling
this will aged better than last year's
coat of paint over aluminum but keep the
borders protected as my unit already
showed me that it will chip and scrape
on a drop
another benefit of this glass is that
wireless charging is now in tow
you know I've never really cared much
about it but that was before I use this
phone with the pixel stand I've always
said that I'll start caring about
Wireless charges whenever it doesn't
limit my use of the phone and the pixels
stand actually augments it the phone
becomes a sort of a Google home and you
also have the advantage that this
charger is faster than average and so
many dollars it's not cheap I'm sure
your pixel will charge with other cheap
based pads but all this added
functionality only works with a pixel
stand and okay fine I admit I've never
spent this long talking about a wireless
charger but then there's the camera it's
simply a memorable for Google to stick
to its guns and only provide one primary
shooter and making multiple cameras on
competitors look really bad in the
process we have a 12 point two megapixel
shooter at F 1.8 aperture 1.4 microns
and a 28 millimeter equivalent at the
front the approach is different with two
8 megapixel shooters one of F 1.8
aperture and 28 millimeters and
equivalent and the other of F 2.2
aperture in a wider 19 millimeter
equivalent when it comes to photos a
pixel is a pixel it is just one of the
best cameras of the Year class-leading
dynamic range on backlit photos thanks
to its hdr+ made possible by
computational photography some photos
are simply surreal even too good to
expect from a regular camera which can
be good for those looking for great
Instagram pics and not so good for
purists and then there's portrait mode
which once again is class leading but
more on the side of too good too
aggressive if compared to a real camera
but then again let me just say this the
pixel doesn't have to abide to trying to
replace a camera I feel that the pixel
is unique this added versatility should
be just considered the pixel experience
I mean even selfie photos don't have the
benefit of a regular and wide angle lens
both capable of the same portrait mode
that's really hard to beat in skin tone
and detail you know what else works in
the selfie camera that doesn't work on
any other phone
sites I've been testing it for a couple
of weeks now and I'll call it really
good it's not at the level of huawei's
night mode because you need to hold the
phone really study if you want to avoid
grain still it's a welcomed addition to
half and it's awesome that you don't
have to really worry about either using
the primary shooter or the selfie one
video recording on pixels is also
fantastic great dynamic range detail and
this is also one of the best cameras
when it comes to stabilization
I just wish it supported 4k at 60 but
the hardware is capable so maybe we get
a software update later who knows and
then selfie video has not just the
advantage of great civilization but
every vlogger will tell you that a wide
lens is a must and here it is in its
full glory though sadly it's lacking on
the same stabilization of the primary
even if it's not really that bad and
really notice just how crucial software
is to all this awesome experience as I
mentioned earlier Google is primarily a
software company and it has spent the
last 3 generations showing us that the
phone is merely a terminal a window if
you may and quite the up to date window
as the fastest way to get the latest
version of Android first is with a pixel
it's also the only official way to enjoy
these augments and wallpapers with this
one telling me the sun's position in
real time
along with cloud information you've got
this awesome always-on this flag which
doesn't seem as a separate experience
from the rest of the UI switch the phone
on and the animation hints to a
connection with the lockscreen
in the way the clock animates into place
and by the way if you love this Google
sans font as much as I do
it's also something that only has a home
in the pixel at least without hacking
and then there's the pixel launcher
which is hands-down my favorite on
Android I love the interactive date that
eventually becomes a calendar
appointment I'm a huge fan of the
density of icons on the grid I also
liked the quick access to Google search
from the bottom along with the Google
feed from the left heck I even liked
that the phone knows and suggests which
of the people you contact most then
offers it in the app launcher and
finally there are the perks of owning a
pixel like free Google photo storage and
my favorite which is Project Phi
I can't stress enough how much of a
lifesaver the surface is for me and how
seamless it is on a pixel this is a
definite must-have for those of you that
travel a lot or simply if you only want
to pay as you go now standing in between
of the things I love and I don't like so
much about this phone is the spec sheet
you guys know that I've praised the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 all year for its
performance and power efficiency and
it's here and I also praise the
inclusion of ip68 water and dust
resistance where I'm mixed is in the
rest of the list like sticking to four
gigs of RAM and a starting non
expandable storage option of 64 gigs
like if this were 2016 and then the
regular size battery at 30 for 30
milliamp hours so fine now that I've
explained everything that I love about
this phone let me tell you why I have a
hard time being nice to it let's go back
to that initial premise of the phone
disappearing into the experience see for
that to be possible you need a great
display and this one is not have you
noticed that when you walk into a room
you can immediately tell if one of the
paintings is slanted we humans are
instinctive about noticing composition
problems we know when something doesn't
make sense so Q in this display we got a
total of eight corners here eight none
of which is even symmetrical so you've
got sharper corners at the bottom around
their corners at the top and then you've
got this huge not CH and then speakers
that aren't symmetrical a pair of
cameras that look like if ET is staring
at you and then there's a huge chin at
the bottom like seriously this is a
design aberration I honestly even stick
to black backgrounds all the time just
to avoid how cringe worthy it is and
then there's the problem that this
display is not too bright so even going
for darker backgrounds becomes annoying
and direct sunlight sure the color
tuning is great saturation is great
speakers for content consumption they're
also great because they're dual firing
but then it's just so weird for video to
not be centered when you watch it in
full screen we
is another thing that I don't understand
like if you've noticed all my previous
reviews you'll know that this is the
first time that I've ever complained
about a notch on a phone and that's
because there's just too much going on
on this display for this device to
disappear into the experience even
eighteen by nine video shows weird cuts
and curves that you can't hide and sure
I know you'll tell me now that you can
hide the notch and developer options but
then why included in the first place
this is just what does it make sense and
to continue with issues in the
experience let's talk about battery life
I'm not sure what's going on here but
the small original pixel was great the
pixel to excel was epic but then the
pixel 3 Excel is not this device crawls
by end of day with 20% of a charge if
I'm lucky
a recent update two days ago has
improved it slightly but the problem is
it's becoming consistent sometimes it's
great sometimes it's not at first I
thought that it was due to some
connectivity issues that I had but no
this is sadly not a battery champ so now
we've got a weird display match with
variant anxiety not a good way for
content to become king over the phone
last but not least there's the pixel
pill for navigation which is no longer
optional and don't get me wrong I do
love gesture navigation but I don't like
this one swipe up to reveal multitasking
then there's another weird one for the
after our swipe left and it only
switches between one application and not
the full list it sadly just feels
incomplete like if they were trying to
fit too many features into just two
buttons to conclude yes I know I listed
at least 6 pros and only 3 cons and I do
agree that some of these pros are
essential like the camera the pros in
total are cool and they should be good
enough for me to balance things out and
say that this phone is worth it right
well sadly for a guy like me they all
have to be because there are benefits to
using a pixel that I just can't live
without I just I really hate that I have
to put up with the weird user experience
to retain these benefits so yes I've
gone to developer settings and I hit the
knotch but that really just defeats the
purpose of choosing the pixel 3xl over
the pixel 3
sure battery life issues could probably
be fixed with a software update later
but that's really theoretical 2018 is
just really not the year for any company
to come up with weird designs and charge
$900 don't get me wrong I love what it
can do
I love the benefits you have an owning
one and if you're already invested like
I am then sure go for it
I know in my particular case I'll be
using this phone as my daily driver
regardless but for everybody else that
values attention to detail and design
for the price I feel this is not the
phone it's a great phone but it's sadly
not the greatest out there folks let us
know in the comments if you agree with
our impressions of the Google pixel 3
Excel and while you're at it make sure
