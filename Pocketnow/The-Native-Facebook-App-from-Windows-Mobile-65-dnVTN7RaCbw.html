pocket naw Kham we've talked about a lot
of different ways that you can get to
Facebook through windows mobile more
than any other platform there are so
many ways that you can have a facebook
like experience right on your mobile
device now this new facebook application
has been extracted from a windows mobile
6.5 rom from XDA developers which either
means one of two things it will be
included on in windows mobile 6.5 which
we didn't know or it will be available
as an application that you can download
from the market place once the
marketplace launches later this year so
anyway I'm going to take you through how
this looks on my HTC touch pro here and
i'll i'll cut back in after i log in ok
here we are logged in and i should
mention that this will work on any
windows mobile device we're getting
reports that it works on non-touchscreen
windows mobile devices as well haven't
tested it on that yet but uh well we'll
see how that goes so here's the the main
page that we see we're taken to our news
feed and we can scroll down the page and
we get a little bit of flicks crawling
although it really needs work this is a
early version of course we can click
status updates to see what people are
doing we can click over further to see
who has updated photos recently and
we're back to the newsfeed and of course
we can tap on any of these actions to
view profile the person or view the
album kind of context context sensitive
menus and then we can click up here to
the profile of well yourself really and
the first thing that will show up is the
posts that are on my wall and it takes a
little bit of time when you first start
it up because it has to catch all the
information ok so here we are on the
wall and if we go over to the next tab
info it will show you all of my
information that you would be used to
seeing on facebook such as you know name
email address phone number if you have
that information listed so I'm going to
go over to photos and show you what the
photo browsing experience is like and it
will update the the covers of the albums
in a second and here they come now and
we'll go into the first album here
photos
and it comes up pretty fast you can just
tap right to left although flick
scrolling also work so you can do it
that way or you can open up to landscape
to see a bigger picture and we can also
flick scroll here okay and then we can
go up to this button here which shows us
all of our friends so we can see a
through z the friends that we have
listed and you can scroll your finger
you get to see a little status message
underneath if they've updated their
status recently the next one is messages
so you can manage all of your messages
your inbox your outbox you can send new
messages to friends and the third tab is
something that I'm not going to pull up
for security reasons but it's really
awesome most people list their phone
number on facebook and if you're friends
with them then you can see the phone
number which is isn't too big of a
problem because if you're friends with
them then you don't mind if they call
what's great about this tab is that it
will list all your friends all their
phone numbers so that in a similar
display like this I can tap on Chelsea
and a new screen will come up that will
say call Chelsea SMS Chelsea or email
Chelsea it's a great way to contact
people that you keep in touch with on
Facebook so overall I really hope that
this native facebook application is
included in windows mobile 6.5 or
becomes available in the application
marketplace I think it's the first
really good job at integrating facebook
with Windows Mobile that said if you
don't want to install pre-release
software onto your device there are many
ways to get facebook on windows mobile
and i'll post a link on the video right
now to get that but if you do want to
try this out i'll post the link on
pocketnow.com on how to get this
pre-release version of native facebook
for windows mobile that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
