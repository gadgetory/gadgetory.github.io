Motorola X phone rumors continue and
Microsoft's new Android application
shows us desperate moves towards Windows
Phone I'm hematuria better and yeah we
lost the Champions League but there's
always la liga this is pocket out daily
for those of you curious of the lg
optimus g pro in the united states AT&amp;amp;T
is just spilled the beans they'll be
offering the photo pre-order on may
three two hundred dollar hats or
two-year contract you can pick up the
phone on May tenth if you're still
having a hard time trying to decide if
this bonus for you link to the
description for the full review and LG
has also launched an optimus G K which
is a smaller optimus g pro that we don't
know what to expect just yet stay tuned
for the rumors on that one now let's
move over to Sony even though we were
making fun of their code names the Sony
Honami or onamia or whatever they're
calling that thing apparently it's not
just gonna be a mid-tier phone this
phone is actually special apparently
there is a 1.6 inch diagonal Exmor RS
sensor on this phone coming to the
camera and notice I said sensor not
camera lens now what does this mean well
this sensor is pretty much bigger than
what's on the galaxy camera so can we
expect some cutting-edge technology for
this camera stay tuned we'll see and
let's move over to Motorola the x-phone
rumors continue and we're already bored
we're still waiting for this film to be
launched and apparently we've got a code
name xt 1055 no photos just yet
apparently we know that the ex phone is
probably not going to be a lineup
because there's only one code name but
the sad news is obviously that it's
delayed and with one code name can we
really expect a lineup of colorful
options for just one phone we'll see now
let's talk about the ridiculous and
desperate news of the day Microsoft has
just launched a new switch to Windows
Phone application for Android and the
idea is that it scans over your Android
application list and tells you oh wait
we've got 75 percent of your apps we've
got these which are full matches you
know speedtest.net and other
applications and then we've got these
alternates which we know are terrible on
Windows Phone for Instagram and other
things like that you know it's probably
one of the worst moves we've ever seen
any company not just microsoft any
company to show just how
that their sales are currently for their
Windows Phone platform but Microsoft you
really don't get it do you really don't
get why people are not buying your phone
just yet oh well and finally for the hot
news of the day we've got some leaked
photographs of the HTC and boren agency
is pulling off a smart move here I mean
this is a smaller HTC one in every way
and some of us believe that it would be
a mid-tier device and it kind of isn't
it kind of visit it's got a 4.3 inch
display with 720p resolution so pixel
density is actually good it's got the
same for megapixel sorry ultrapixel
camera of the HTC One and it's got 16
gigs of storage so there is a compromise
there but just think about it I mean
there is a market out there people that
really don't want a big phone they want
a smaller phone that looks high-end and
this could probably be the case of the
HTC m4 we just wonder what the name for
this one is going to be but that leads
me to the question of the day if you had
the option you know HTC m4 and HTC One
both phones are really identical but
obviously this one's got some better
specs than the other and this one's
obviously bigger than the other which
one would you pick in my particular case
I'm honestly a bigger fan of smaller
phones but then again I get more storage
on the HTC One and there's no expandable
options here so I'll definitely go for
the HTC One but just for the added
storage so leave us a comment down below
would you prefer either a bigger option
or a smaller option of the same phone
and of course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's a parole but she follow
us on foggy now calm subscribe to our
YouTube channel you could also follow me
on Twitter and I'm it underscores iveta
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am home I believe
Anna thank you very much for watching
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
