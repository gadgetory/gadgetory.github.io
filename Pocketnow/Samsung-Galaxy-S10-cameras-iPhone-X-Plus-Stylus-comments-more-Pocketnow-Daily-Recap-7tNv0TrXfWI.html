kiss idea I will be sure that nobody
ever reads your comment before that
already have an s10 a 1998 Chevy yes I
I always wanted one of those when I was
in my teens and yeah no comment
wait a second my dad has an s10 I forgot
that trusted sources say that Heine is
apparently added jokes and trusted
sources are right and that's right it is
that time of the week I am hi emitted
Iveta this is PocketNow and this is a
bargain out daily recap your comments
for last week
so on Monday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 there were leaks of the
probability of triple cameras I asked
you what you wanted to see and we had
806 comments what I would like to see
from the galaxy s 10 are fast software
updates and capslock as if I hope they
actually read this cuz yes definitely
that would be great a price less than a
thousand dollars would be a great place
to start
oh man I you know I wish that this trend
of phones getting more expensive would
be to a certain degree stopped by
consumers not buying them but the
problem is consumers do well the Samsung
S 9 has an amazing design the S 10 need
to completely change it no matter how
good the specs may be it will not appeal
to consumers of the design does not
change you know this is something funny
but I actually like Samsung's design
ever since the Galaxy s6
I don't really mind that it hasn't
really changed much because number one
there's not really much you can do with
a phone lately I mean and everything
else is gimmicky number two you guys
don't remember what Samsung came from so
I'm actually worried to see them
experiment on Tuesday the topic was the
iPhone 10 plus there are rumors that
it's going to support the Apple pencil
and I asked you what would you think
about that we had 425 comments wonder
how the Apple pencil will work don't
think it's worth it for you to carry it
around
Samsung does it best with the s-pen
inside the phone so here's the thing yes
Samsung does it best with the s-pen
inside the phone but the functionality
of the Apple pencil it kind of warrants
the size this is a truly artistic
product whereas the s-pen can but is not
as good I don't know if you get where
I'm going a stylus for what's so
gimmicky from a guy that actually use a
stylus for way before iPhones actually
killed them I actually like the
functionality that they add I like how
it adds possibilities to the Galaxy S
and sorry galaxy note 9 with the s-pen I
love using it on the iPad pro is
probably one of my favorite tools so
yeah why would I need a stylus when I
have ten of them in my hands Steve Jobs
was head of his time so here's the thing
you don't need a stylus that's the point
you actually only add it if you need it
whereas yes you buy the Apple pencil
it provides any functionality for you
and I love having the option even though
yes half the time I don't need it at all
so then on Wednesday the topic was once
again the Galaxy S 10 I asked you after
all the rumors of a self-healing display
and Phi G and this and that what did you
think about that we had 337 comments
it's not about who gets 5g first but how
it performs versus 4G on a daily basis I
do have to agree with this it's great to
buy a future-proof phone mainly for
consumers that buy products early and I
feel 5g that transitions gonna be a lot
easier than LT was because so we're
starting the grief I of G depends on LTE
and it's this really interesting play so
I do agree that it's not important who
does it first but the cool thing is that
whoever does it first will again give
you more bang for your buck the Galaxy S
nine already has the fastest LTE speeds
so without 5g without be a problem
and yes the self-healing display would
be a bomb and I'm sorry dude I I have a
hard time reading this but I I'm trying
to get your point and I assume that what
you're trying to say is that we should
stay the way we are which is not the way
technology behaves I'm not worried about
my device having 5g just yet it took
service providers for years to establish
a reliable 4G network and it's still not
great plus watch them start charging
premiums for service that you will only
get to maybe ten percent of the time the
first two years
dude that is a great comment that is a
good point the biggest problem is not a
technology it's what carriers in the
United States charge and how bad it is
deployed I hope this is this changes
again the cool thing about 5g is it's
not like LT it's actually a lot simpler
than what was required from LTE so I
actually have great expectations for it
then on Thursday the rumors are that
Apple might be finding solutions to
bring touch ID back and I asked you what
do you think about that we had 428
comments touch ID under the display is
the way to go because it's going to be
simple fast now bring back the headphone
jack oh man I I don't know if that's
gonna happen I do hope so for me it's
just so annoying there are times when I
I don't want to be using the charging
port because I need to charge my phone
and
oh god it's just the worst the iPhone
should have both face ID and touch ID
you know I do totally agree with this
one
I love face ID when it's winter when I
can take my gloves off at those cases
but I prefer a fingerprint scanner most
of the time for everything else so I
would love the blend of both indeed I
think the touch ID is more convenient
but not at the winter in New York
totally agrees see that's the biggest
problem about fingerprint scanners the
fact that you have to you know use your
hand and if you're wearing two layers of
gloves which we actually need to do so
here oh yeah it makes sense
and then on Friday the topic was the
oneplus 60 and this was hot because
first of all yes that one plus 60 must
be great but apparently it's coming to
t-mobile for a very aggressive price tag
and they're calling it the flagship
killer again 567 comments 1 plus 60
mobile I had to read that like three
times to get the comment but yeah yeah
oneplus is doing something right dude
tell you this much I love every time
that I have a meeting with oneplus
because they are really open to feedback
whenever like I was surprised when I met
the company CEO and the key immediately
came over and he was like dude thank you
for your videos thank you for your
feedback on the camera we're working
hard on it and you know just to know
that the company is so humble about
their products is great and now to see
them evolve and now to see the
possibility of a US carrier I'm actually
happy for this I do feel that oneplus
deserves more spotlight and that's
probably the best way to achieve that 1
+ 60 + t-mobile at 550 bucks goodbye
Samsung hello oneplus yes definitely
it's really hard to just buy a phone
outright in the United States credit is
extremely important in this country and
therefore I feel that having a carrier
to support you to help promote your
product is probably the best way to go I
feel that that's going to be a great mix
but then again we just hope that the
rumors are true
we'll see friends again thank you so
much for watching if you want your
comments to be featured number one keep
them short number two stick to the point
number three try to get some thumbs up
it helps us spot on a lot easier
