close to its future event google updates
a ton of its applications it even helps
you find your parked vehicle and hukill
is reportedly going free on phones but
there's a catch I'm hi Natalie that and
don't you find that out that certain
companies will only give you sales
whenever they're about to give you the
revamp this is parking out daily let's
begin today with the official news and
hopefully you'll watch this video before
the times up but Motorola has a one-day
sale for the Moto X you get the phone
right now for three hundred dollars and
up to three 2981 a 32 gig model and
we're talking about the moto maker
options you pay $25 extra for the wooden
options as well and that's really
interesting the company is now posting
this sale obviously because they have am
a 13th event so this could mean that we
are getting the Moto X plus once a tune
and if you thought the Moto X plus one
was a weird name trust me HCC is trying
to win this lead here the company is
apparently going to change the name for
the HTC One m8 mini the rumors that we
were talking about yesterday and it's
going to be called the HTC One mini 2 so
you have one in the name and then you
have to at the end which is just odd we
don't know any specification we do know
that the stall won't have a dual cameras
so it probably won't be that compelling
now let's talk about Google as the
company has made it official that they
will be offering free content as of the
next couple of months but I set free
content not everything in their line of
the company will be offering certain
things and they will be at based and
it's just odd as you currently pay for
their premium services and you still get
ads so it could be that this will be the
low tier services and we do know that
the company is trying to make a big
comeback with Netflix growing it with
amazon prime going as well so hopefully
it will be compelling we just don't know
if it will now let's talk about Google
as the company is making some dramatic
changes to their applications we see
some overhauls in their google play
store application we also see them
bringing other updates but one of the
most interesting ones is google now as
of now you can remember for example
nicknames you can tell the phone to call
mom and it will understand who mom is
and dad which is something we've been
able to do on syria for the longest time
but even more interesting is the fact
that the phone now remembers where you
parked your car that option is available
though its region based right now I
can't
could work on my phone so leave us a
comment down below and tell us what you
think about this is it accurate and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day let's talk about Sony as we have
talked about the fact that the company
is not planning to launch the Xperia z2
in the united states yet this was one of
the biggest flagships at mwc 2014 we
were in barcelona with tony and as it
turns out the company has disappointed
everybody but there is a photo from sony
posted with verizon branding of the z2
we know that the phone will be available
until future we don't know exactly when
probably july august in that timeframe
but that leads to the question of the
day what do you think about sony lately
with the fact that the company is not
doing a good job in catering to the US
market in our particular case honestly
any experience e2 is probably one of the
phones that I want the most but the fact
that it's not available makes it
complicated leave us a comment down
below I do think that Sony is losing out
a lot of customers friends II know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed she

there's quarterly data please give this
