motto of motorola's latest smartphone
designed for developing markets and
we're in New York City to bring you a
first hands on this is michael fisher
and adam lane with pocket now and this
is your first look at the motorola moto
e as you can see the family resemblance
here is strong the Moto e is physically
very similar to the Moto X and the Moto
G and while it's thicker than each it
also has a smaller footprint Specter as
you might expect from a low-end
smartphone with a dual-core Snapdragon
200 backed up by a gig of ram and just
four gigs of storage only two gigs of
which are available out of the box still
there are a few surprises here including
microSD expansion up to 32 gigs a 5
megapixel camera with 720p video capture
and a surprisingly loud front-facing
speaker all of it powered by a 1980
milliamp hour battery the IPS display up
front is qHD resolution and quite bright
and it's 4.3 inch size means the Moto e
feels substantially smaller than its
siblings when held but it also feels
robust well there's nothing like
mil-spec durability here the motorolas
water-resistant nano coating is present
and the 12 millimeter thickness combined
with the soft touch paint job and
Gorilla Glass 3 up front gives the e a
reassuringly rugged feel in the hand
plus of course there's the dimple around
back the Moto e is available for
pre-order today at motorola com for 129
dollars in white or black with a variety
of colorful back shells we'll have much
more on the Moto e in the coming weeks
at pocket now stay tuned here on YouTube
on social media and at pocketnow.com
until next time this has been Michael
Fisher with Adam Lane from New York City
