china because batteries are just fine
their iphone 7 rumors claim 5 color
options in water resistance and the sony
xperia is get more affordable but not
necessarily better i'm high metal iveta
reporting from berlin our air B&amp;amp;B lovely
noise outside and a fire extinguisher
for our notes evans this is walking out
daily
the official news today begin with deals
I cannot say that I would recommend the
sony xperia x as a good smartphone but
still i know that there is a fanbase out
there that would be happy to just have a
sony xperia the current xperia x is for
four hundred fifty dollars on various
retailers amazon best buy you name it if
you are in the market for one why not
but i would highly suggest you watch
wands purview about it i was hold the
spotlight over to alcatel the company
has silently announced some new products
all focused on the fitness market that
they're being called the move we've got
two smart watches that are focused on
fitness a bracelet in addition to a very
small gps tracker to say the company is
out to compete obviously the original
SmartWatch from alcatel wasn't really
something that we would go crazy for you
can learn more about these products in
the link in the description as for
official news Apple has just pulled what
many of us did not want the company has
just announced its new subscriptions
models for developers what this allows
developers is to save on the thirty
percent premium that they have to pay
for Apple over royalty fees and well
they go from 30 to 15 and then here the
only thing that benefits you is nothing
because the way they'll get that
discount is if they lock you into 12
months overpaying for whatever it is
that you would like to get from these
developers it makes all the sense in the
world free to subscribe to a specific
magazine and if these price tags are for
example I subscribe to runner's world I
paid twenty dollars a year that's very
affordable but most of these
subscriptions are going for like ten
dollars a month and imagine how many
subscriptions do you really need for
certain services let's just hope it
doesn't get ugly and speaking of Apple
we've got some very interesting rumors
regarding the iphone 7 we hear i bx
seven water resistance five color
options a 2.4 gigahertz 810 processor we
haven't heard of ram much yet but
apparently one of the major changes is
that apple has enhanced 3d touch on this
iphone to make life without the
headphone jack easier that's not
necessarily going to mean better quality
just easier we cannot wait to let you
know more on apple's event very soon and
finally the very interesting news
they have to do with the samsung galaxy
note 7 and the fact that apparently
batteries don't explode in China
according to the statement from Samsung
towards the Chinese market they have
begun sales starting today because the
company has various suppliers and the
Chinese market can be confident that the
phones will not blow up there and this
is rather interesting we wonder exactly
why Samsung than not pull this in the
United States figure out what batch has
had a problem instead of doing the
global recall it did although I know
people that do prefer Samsung's approach
to this which leads me to the question
of the day how do you feel about that
how do you feel about the fact that
Samsung can guarantee thanks for China
but not for the United States I feel
that it's rather not nice from Samsung a
lot of people really don't want to trade
in their notes Evans for an s7 edge they
might as well just have bought than s7
edge earlier leave us a comment down
