features for users I thought also got
released and it's nothing that we
expected but it's still cool and there
was one more thing but that wasn't an
iphone for us all this and more coming
up right now hello everybody I'm high
metal even and welcome to the pocket
nail I pervy the show we go through all
this week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
now apple's WWDC event kicked off with
Steve Jobs releasing iOS 5 among other
things though the event was mostly for
software the enhancements the Iowas five
were kind of substantial but not
everything was perfect we'll talk more
about that in not so cool section but
breezing through the really cool things
let's start with Notification Center
which is a swipe from the top to bring
you notifications and more like an
Android sort of design you can also get
them from the lock screen you also get
deep Twitter integration enhancements to
Safari like the reader view that you get
on max in Safari and reader lists more
like what you get an Instagram reminder
service that it's more like the test
service that you get on exchange but
that iOS hexa neglected for years you
also get rich text on email enhancements
to the camera where you can now take
pictures faster from the lock screen and
even use the volume up button as a
shutter which is kind of cool and best
of all you don't need a pc anymore or a
mac to use your device you can now
activate your device and it's totally pc
free ever since you buy it and that's
pretty much the same for the iPhone the
iPad and the ipod touch these are pretty
much a list that we just breeze through
of 200 plus enhancements that are coming
to iOS 5 and that we will expect in the
fall to be released for the iphone 3gs
the iphone for all the ipads and the
third generation and fourth generation
ipod touch kind of cool enhancements
again not everything is perfect and
we'll talk about more of that later well
I cloud was released and boy was
everybody wrong with their predictions
this is not a music streaming service
this is so much more than just that it's
pretty much mobile meat on steroids in
the past you had to pay 99 bucks to get
mail contacts
founders bookmarks sync between your
devices but that was pretty much it you
still needed your PC for pretty much
everything that had to sync with your
device now I cloud makes the PC become
something of the past you don't no
longer need your PC to do anything with
your iOS device as mentioned in the past
column first of all our cloud will allow
you to sync everything or pretty much
everything with your device including
applications music purchases videos
photos and everything happens instantly
to the cloud with no need to be syncing
anything with a cable now what makes
iCloud really cool is that you pretty
much get it for free now you get 5
gigabytes of storage for free but that
does not include the storage you need to
include your applications your pictures
or your videos it pretty much only
includes the fact that you can sync I
work documents to your iCloud service
with those five gigabytes which is more
than enough for just documents and also
applications if you ask us I cloud is
more than what we expected though you
know it's still not perfect then we will
talk about that in the not-so-cool
section also but wait there's more
alongside iCloud Apple is also releasing
a service called iTunes Match if you
remember on our test I reviews we used
to talk about the fact that Apple will
probably offer service well they'll
replace your current music either ripped
or pirated from your library and offer
better quality songs at a price well
iTunes Match is just that it'll cost you
twenty-five dollars a year and it'll
search within your music library for all
the music that you have that has that
they offer better quality in the iTunes
Store and as a difference from amazon
cloud player and google music you don't
have to upload all your music to the
cloud Apple will detect whichever songs
you have on your library and just
replace the songs which it has better
quality and it actually replaces the
song for a 256 kilobits per second AAC
file that's drm three so if you think
about it it's kind of cool because
you're not going to take weeks to upload
all your music to the cloud the cloud
will upload some of the music that it
doesn't detect within the iTunes library
but then the rest of it will only be
replaced with the current services
offered in itunes in their store it's a
really cool service and if you think
about it
only cost you like 50 cents an album and
apparently there's a limit of 20,000
songs I mean I have a current music
library of about 20 gigabytes and that's
4,000 songs so it's pretty much
unlimited I mean it's really cool well
that is our for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool you know we all
expected to get an iphone 4s or an
iPhone 5 on this event and yeah we all
smile chimed and got crazy when Steve
came up on stage and said wait small
thing and well sadly it wasn't an iphone
4s as Steve mentioned it was small we
didn't get a device we didn't get you
know any updates on when Apple will be
releasing a new device we are expecting
it to make the itunes music event so you
know it's not cool that the apples
losing their yearly cycles and even
their stock has been getting a strong
hit because they're forgetting about the
fact that well they've always been
accountable for timely releases and it
seems that they're going to wait for
Google's or release their gingerbread
and when those phone 7 to be released
and pretty much just put everything on
top even though well not all the
enhancing that we got with iowa's five
were really that groundbreaking let's
talk about that too okay so what was not
so cool about iOS 5 well first of all
think about it we've been dealing with
the iconic you I ever since 2007 where I
still remember in 2007 that I was using
an old HTC device that was rocking
windows mobile 5.0 things changed a lot
in Windows Mobile things changed a lot
in Android palm switched to webos and
then we still have the same user
interface that Apple released in the
same timeline I mean I do understand
that a lot of people are really enjoying
the iconic you I because it's simple but
then again a lot of us power users are
compelled to end up jailbreaking our
devices because we're tired of seeing
icons after icons after icons we weren't
expecting for iOS 5 to bring widgets or
at least some changes but sadly we're
disappointed about that and aside from
that you know
Apple there are certain things that you
release that are pretty much basic and
Brandon came up with an editorial that
was really great and it mentioned the
fact that there are certain things that
are not supposed to be even
groundbreaking like for example using
the volume up button as a shutter which
is pretty much something that you could
have brought you know a long time ago
it's not groundbreaking a lot of things
were copying from windows phone 7 and
for example the new notification system
was copied from Android we can also say
that a lot of Android and Windows Phone
7 was copied from iOS from the start and
that pretty much everybody just threw
away all their plans as Apple released
the iphone and yeah you know everybody
was a copycat of the iphone in their
time but we weren't expecting apple to
come up with the same card eventually I
mean Apple you're all about innovation
now one of the things that I'll mention
that I was probably expecting the most
was you know simple things to change
like for example if I want to make a
phone call on an iPhone hmm after first
of all going to the phone app then go
into my contacts if this contact is not
in my favorites swipe all the way to the
top of the search bar that's step 3 then
look for my contact as i type that
that's step 4 then touch the contact
then touch the phone number you have six
steps to make a phone call how about a
simple swipe from the bottom and you get
a t9 dialer these are the number and you
either get a number or name in the
entire lid I mean those are the things
that are really great about blackberry
that you just have to start typing and
you get the phone number and again Steve
and your first keynote with the release
of the iPhone you said that the killer
app for smartphones was making phone
calls but the palm is the iphone is
still lagging on the very simple things
and hopefully we're now going to have to
wait for iOS 6 next year anyways okay so
what was wrong about iCloud actually
nothing I crowd was really cool but hey
here's a ex mobileme user that recently
paid a renewal in May for 99 bucks and I
just got a little email that said hey
you know your subscription will now be
pulled all the way to July next year and
then you'll lose it and
there go my 99 bucks I mean how about if
I get a refund because I purchased it
about a month ago and you know I even
have a friend that purchased the two
days before the keynote and he's not
getting any money back I mean come on
guys is you know it's it's the nice
thing to do if you're making icloud free
at least current mobileme subscribers
that probably paid 60 days ago could at
least get a refund that's the you know
the nice thing to do that's it for today
show thank you very much for watching
I'm hi never be better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
