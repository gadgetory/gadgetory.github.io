Sam sings market share even in Korea
latest HTC One m9 elite show major
design changes in the camera setup and
Google cellular service seems to be the
next thing to come I'm hi meri behna and
if you're going to spend Friday the way
I am make sure you call a cab at the end
this is far canal daily the official
news today have to do with apple vs
samsung but not on the way you think
actually let's talk about market share
for the longest time Samsung has oh
that's South Korean market because it is
its home turf the most any competitor
had reach was twenty percent of the
market but new reports claim that Apple
reached thirty three percent of the
market share dropping Samsung's
dominance to forty six percent between
the months of October and November which
makes sense this was the time of the
iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus launch but it
just gives you an idea of how unpopular
samsung has become even if it's so
country another cool official news links
in the description you will see my full
lonely a camera for Lumia denim video
talking to you about how cool it is to
have a windows phone right now that runs
Lumia denim and as it turns out
Microsoft is just confirmed that Windows
10 smartphones will have two Lumia
camera app as a default meaning it
doesn't matter if you have an HTC or a
samsung Windows Phone you'll be getting
this with Windows 10 and what makes it
cool rich capture moments everything in
the video watch we've been doing a lot
of talk of the HTC One m9 mainly because
of the lease that we've seen recently
you said that the design doesn't look
any different that the one inmate but if
you look closely notice that there is no
dual camera in these recent leaks and it
seems that HTC is going away with that
instead going with this really big
camera lens and by camera lens I'm not
just talking about the glass that
surrounds it traveling closely into the
image the camera lens looks huge so
hopefully that 20-something megapixel
camera that's being rumored is going to
be hotter than the dual lens because the
ultrapixel camera was great as long as
you didn't want to zoom into the shots
another product we've been talking about
is the Samsung Orvis
which is the code name for the round
SmartWatch that same thing is working on
gear round or whatever you want to call
that thing and we've been talking about
a rotating ring at the top and we've
been wondering exactly what the point is
here with the patents turns out that
some internal sources claimed that the
this ring will actually serve for
navigation meaning that if you want to
answer a call you slide the ring to the
right or end the call you slide the ring
to the left and apparently it's going to
be a navigation button for about
everything you do hopefully this is
optional because it is a collect if you
want to zoom into something fine like
the whole rotating button that Apple is
bringing to the Apple watch but if it's
going to be the mandatory way to
navigate that thing is going to fall off
after like two or three months of use
but we will keep you posted on what we
see hopefully at mwc and finally for the
very interesting rumors of the day let's
talk about Google's plans to become an
mvno this has been something we've been
discussing for years the fact that
Google will probably want to become a
cellular company using another company
spectrum and apparently the rumors are
that there are significant talks between
Sprint and t-mobile up to the point that
there is apparently already a contract
this contract considers that number one
there is this a volume clause where if
Google proves to have a popular service
then there would be a renegotiation
there's another closet apparently shows
that this google mtnl would be sort of
like republic Wireless it tries to
default to Wi-Fi as much as it can and
then it falls back on some other
spectrum when needed and it just seems
that this is Google's idea of how to
revamp google voice which is pretty much
the only service that hasn't been
revamped from google yet it seems that
google voice would probably be assembler
company in the future and it leads me to
the question of the day would you want
google to be in the MVNO and what would
you want from this company I would love
it mainly because google fiber is just
so affordable in the companies that it
serves that yes if google fiber and
google voice would be a service
eventually it would make a lot of sense
google is making a lot of things
affordable it would just be awesome but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think frenzy us you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video is filled machine
I'm pocketnow.com inscription to general
as well you'll also follow me on Twitter
Highlanders quarter iveta please give
this video thumbs up it's like what you
saw I am hi meri behna thank you very
much for watching we'll see you next
