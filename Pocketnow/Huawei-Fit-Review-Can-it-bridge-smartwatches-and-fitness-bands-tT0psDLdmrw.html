two categories more watch like with a
focus on lifestyle features and more
fitness focused to track activity the
dream for a SmartWatch fans is to find
that perfect Venn diagram overlap of
features which will complement how we
use our phones Huawei delivered one of
the better examples of what an Android
wear watch should resemble now for a
solo effort we're taking a look at the
fall way fit with a one-inch memory LCD
monochrome display all operation is
touchscreen no additional buttons or
controls the charging happens through
pins that connect to a plastic cradle
which happily stays connected better
than the magnetic pins on the nicer
Huawei watch this sealed up design is
rated ip68 for water and dust resistance
but Huawei also claims to fit will
survive up to 5 atmospheres or around 50
meters underwater the interface draws
more than a passing resemblance to
Android wear navigation happens mostly
through vertical swipes tapping selects
an option and swiping from left to right
acts like a back button and on most
screens returns you to the main watch
base on the underside of the watch we
have heart rate tracking sensors and the
fit does feature always on background
heart monitoring the fit connects to a
flyweight app on your phone where you
can see your various stats like steps
workouts and your pulse it does draw
into question the usefulness of step
tracking however wearing it with my
misfit I saw the differences between 500
and 900 steps in a single day but not
consistently favoring one device
sometimes the misfit tracked higher
sometimes the hallway I only use step
tracking as a benchmark for general
trends now it's the heart rate data
which adds significant insight into the
quality of activity performed throughout
the day hallway claims up to six days of
battery life on a single charge what's
impressive is seeing this device run
longer than advertised
even with constant heart rate tracking I
routinely got closer to eight full days
before the watch would shut itself off I
also need to deliver a special shout-out
for the Bluetooth disconnect alert it's
a handy leash function should you be
separated from your phone and it's
absolutely mind-boggling this isn't
built natively into Android wear the
positives are pretty formidable great
water resistance excellent battery life
and easy to read screen and sunlight and
respectable fitness tracking
capabilities the issues unfortunately
are the unn
watch and lifestyle features recent
software updates have dramatically
improved notifications more of each
message can be read and the watch
handles things like my web connected
camera better when being used as a
motion detector unfortunately there's
still nothing you can do with these
notifications no replies no voice to
text the watch is still a gatekeeper
allowing you to keep your phone in your
pocket till you need to respond but any
interaction with a service requires you
to get that phone out the simplicity of
the setup also means we don't get some
of the fun watch like services we can
find on competitors like setting a timer
and alarm controlling media or using a
stopwatch you can't check your agenda
for the day except with the alerts your
calendar app will spit out the watch is
also easily interrupted as the user
swipes through options alerts will
always reset you back to home in the
middle of the night I got a batch of
notifications and in trying to find a
way to mute the fit just kept getting
returned to the home screen until I gave
up and removed it there isn't a way to
mute notifications from the watch that I
could find by the way but I wasn't able
to explore the menu options completely
before another alert set me back to the
start
lastly with any touchscreen it should be
reiterated that water will make device
operation a bit squirrely out in our
recent rainstorms gestures weren't
registered as accurately this also
becomes a baby magnet where my daughter
loves fiddling with the interactive
touchscreen she's not as able to flick
away important notifications but she did
manage to shut the watch off on her own
one night so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us with the huawei fit
the name is certainly asked I really
like having more background activity and
Fitness data recorded during the day
like several competing devices it's very
helpful to see those lifestyle trends
graphed out for you the fitness tracking
options are well implemented in cual way
has shown it can improve performance and
the software experience over successive
updates
still we don't have that great Venn
diagram Smart Watch overlap where it
would be helpful adding a few more of
those lifestyle features to the mix
especially with hardware which so well
emulates the pebble round I've found a
great replacement for my Microsoft band
but the search continues for that great
notification an applet delivery platform
