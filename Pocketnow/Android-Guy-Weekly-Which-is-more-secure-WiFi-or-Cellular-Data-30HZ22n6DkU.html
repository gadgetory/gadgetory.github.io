you our cellular data networks really
more secure than Wi-Fi networks why and
why not I'm gonna lay out the argument
for you and then we're gonna go to you
for the answer in this week's Android
guy weekly so what's security I mean
that's a good question right does that
mean less hackable does that mean less
able to be hacked does that mean less
recorded hacks I don't know maybe it's
just peace of mind so we're not really
going to define what security is or what
is or isn't more secure we're gonna look
at some possible security implications
on these various different platforms and
kind of weigh in on you know how much
should that really be considered when
we're determining whether we're going to
use a Wi-Fi network versus a cellular
network or not all right sound good
there we go and while you're watching
this if you have a comment comment right
away don't don't hold back just go down
and type up your comment so yes I agree
entirely with what Joe the Android guy
is saying he's a genius and you know for
everyone other than my mom who's
watching you know write something else
that's more realistic but anyway let's
get right into it the first thing that
we need to consider is technologies and
by technologies I mean you know the
types of networks that are out there
we've got Wi-Fi okay that's one kind
there's actually several different kinds
of Wi-Fi but they all share basically
the same set of standards so when I say
Wi-Fi I mean 802 11 a B G and N and 2.5
meters five megahertz we're just gonna
lump all that in together because I can
get a router today that does all of that
all in one and really a phone that does
pretty much all of that too except maybe
802 1180 which nobody really uses much
anymore unless they absolutely have to
that's a topic for another video
entirely on some other channel so that's
Wi-Fi we're just gonna lump all of Wi-Fi
together into a Wi-Fi hat on the other
side we've got cellular networks so the
other networks are
Wow there's a lot of them there's really
just three major types you know you've
got your gsm s you've got your CDMA s
and you've got your something else's
because something else is really we
can't define that well we're gonna just
kind of put those off for just a minute
we'll bring that back in in a little bit
so we've got CDMA and we've got GSM two
major differences and they are very
different in fact on your CDMA device
you Sprint and Verizon customers and
this is for us people in other countries
we don't have you know CDMA all that
much so this is just kind of wow that's
interesting just take that out of it
but for us here in the u.s. CDMA is
interesting in that you can have data
over the same bands that you have voice
but only one at a time if you're on your
phone talking on your phone you can't be
on the web and vice versa if you're on
the web you can't be on your phone it's
data or voice not data and voice and the
reason is it's all over the same network
it's all over the CDMA network of course
there are different technologies that
enable that in the background but that's
it
GSM on the other hand your t-mobile's
your AT&amp;amp;T s they're a little bit
different they have the ability to have
GSM voice but they also then have
another set of frequencies for data so
we're not really concerned with voice in
this just data but it's you know kind of
important to make the differentiation
between the two all right even still
there's a lot of stuff inside that we
have a video
we've got edge we've got GPRS we've got
HSPA we've got HSPA+ HSDPA HSUPA blah
blah blah blah lots and lots of
standards
now lots of standards means lots of
different ways to exploit something but
you can't use the same exploit on one
network as you can on another and a lot
of the exploits out there are just for
the voice side of the
his networks not the data side it's
relatively difficult to hack them
because there are so many different
standards out there back over to Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is pretty much standardized you
want to break into something pretty much
all you're doing is you're breaking into
a security overlay on top of Wi-Fi
whether that's WEP whether that's wpa
wpa2 whatever it may be you're just
breaking the security on top of or
integrated with the data network itself
because of that it's a lot more standard
in fact it's a lot more standard across
the whole world not just the US where
we've got all this regional specific
stuff so because Wi-Fi is more prevalent
and more standards-based if you will
it's likely more desirable at the right
term for it for someone to try and hack
and exploit then on the other side you
know the cellular stuff so using that as
our basis Wi-Fi is probably not as
secure as cellular data okay let's look
at another component my Wi-Fi signal at
my house only froze to my backyard my
neighbors are lucky if they even see it
that's partially because of construction
partially because of the antenna
configuration and location of the router
in my house but really my signals not
gonna go much further than you know
several houses down the street best-case
scenario cell phone on the other hand my
cell tower is a mile and a half away
that's an awful big radius of people
that are covered that could hack just
that one cell or try and hacked my
information going to that one cell now
of course
cells are interconnected so it's
possible that someone could try and hack
me or sniff my data or whatnot
from multiple cells away not that likely
but possible so you're talking much
greater cover
of people when you talk cellular which
means hey that's a bigger honeypot than
just one little Wi-Fi node so in that
case cellular becomes a much more
desirable target and that might mean
that cellular isn't quite as secure as
Wi-Fi
okay so we've kind of gone into
technologies a little bit and we've got
one case for cellular being more secure
in one case for Wi-Fi being more secure
but those are both kind of based on the
technology level and they both have you
know maybe they're not weighted equally
but for the sake of the argument let's
let's just say they are that's really
not what the problem lies you see there
are exploits on both sides so we know of
open exploits available on both cellular
and Wi-Fi it's just a matter if somebody
actually wanted to do it therefore let's
just wash that out okay let's talk now
about social engineering no not social
networking this isn't you know pocket
now the new Facebook this is you know
getting people to do stuff because
people are stupid and I don't want to
offend anyone out there people as a
group do stupid things a person a person
like you watching this video is smart
but people in general well we do a lot
of stupid things for example I've got my
phone right here I've got my Wi-Fi right
over there I'm connected to my network
everything's great
I'm trusted I trust my network
everything's good to go
I go to work and well it's my work the
Wi-Fi should be trusted it should be
just fine right except a lot of
corporations are really tight on what
you can and can't do with their Wi-Fi
you know they want to protect their
network and rightly so but you'll start
seeing rogue hotspots pop up here and
there that phone can even tether and
with the right app I could sniff all the
stuff coming through it and haha now
I've got your personal information now I
haven't done that and I don't advise
that you do that
I'm gonna tell you if there are any apps
out there that do that or what their
names may or may not be but people can
do that now take coffee shops for
example go to a coffee shop they always
have free Wi-Fi right but what's the
name of their Wi-Fi is it you know Joe's
coffee is it Joe's coffee shop if there
are two access points there which one
are you going to connect to or how about
this if there's Joe's coffee and Joe's
coffee - well gonna use maybe you think
hey they've got two different wireless
access points here for me to connect to
therefore you know either one of them I
can I can use their doing that to be
nice right well maybe again someone has
a laptop that's running it as a hotspot
and they're getting all that information
coming through so really it comes down
to trusted networks are you being smart
as an individual as a person and only
connecting to Wi-Fi umbrellas that you
trust that you know I mean absolutely no
and Trust is this something that's a
public access point that has no security
if so I wouldn't even do that I would
stay away from that if I were you and I
stay away from it because I am me
just don't do it because people can
sniff those packets you're not
encrypting anything you're sending it in
the clear it's just a matter of you know
putting your ear out there and listening
to what saying or as they say in Tron
you know knocking on the sky all you got
to do make sure you have some level of
encryption very important when you use
Wi-Fi okay that's my argument for why
cellular networks are probably more
secure than Wi-Fi networks are not
because of technological limitations not
because of exploits not because of
equipment that you may or may not have
that you need to use to hack either
network or either system but simply
because when I turn my phone on if my
Wi-Fi is off I know that whatever
network I'm connected to is the one that
t-mobile in my case says is OK
and they have done the research and they
put their reputation on the line to make
sure that that is secure Wi-Fi on the
other hand I don't know until I do my
own due diligence and find out for
myself if it is more secure or not so
because of that I would say as a general
rule cellular data networks definitely
more secure as a whole you can make
Wi-Fi more secure absolutely turn off
your cellular data and just do Wi-Fi but
there's so much more work involved there
there's so much more research involved
there and that's something that someone
like me you know an uber geek could do
but I'm too lazy to do it and if I'm too
lazy to do it
my mom's not gonna do it my wife's not
gonna do it my kids Wow they won't have
any clue and they'll just tell anybody
their social security number that asks
because but Dad the website asked for it
and it said I could get a free ringtone
don't do that so that's my thought on
which one is more secure cellular data
versus Wi-Fi but now it is your turn let
us know did I say anything
factually incorrect I tried not to
simplify anything too much in this video
like I have in the past so let me know
if I screwed up somehow in the comments
below and also more importantly what's
your take is cellular data more secure
than Wi-Fi why or why not
or is Wi-Fi more secure than cellular
data why or why not also extra credit
here if you want to list some tips and
tricks that you use to make sure that
your connections are secure and that
your data stays secret secure and
private let us know that to app
recommendations practices stuff that you
do we would love to hear that absolutely
definitely love to hear that so that's
the episode for this week if you thought
it was worthwhile or have someone that
you'd like to join in give the video a
big thumbs up share it with your friends
so that we can broaden our viewer base
and get all those other opinions in and
we can learn
or as a group about what's cool what's
hot what's not what's secure and really
where technology is taking us and where
we want to take technology for PocketNow
