pocket now calm and this is the hardware
tour of the HTC legend first let's talk
about specs the legend is running with a
six hundred megahertz processor there's
not quite as fast as you'll find on the
nexus one or the desire but it's it's
quite fast as you'll see in another
video in terms of performance it's
supported by 384 megabytes of RAM and
512 megabytes of ROM though it comes
with a 2 gigabyte microSD card of course
that's expandable up to 32 gigabytes
it's also running with a 3.2 inch
diagonal AMOLED touchscreen and mo let
display technology is fantastic we're
going to see more and more going into
the future it doesn't have a traditional
way of backlighting the screen which
means that blacks are super black and it
also helps a lot with power consumption
it also has a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack bluetooth 2.1 Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G and it
doesn't have the bands necessary to do
3g in the US only overseas so that's
UMTS ben's 920 100 megahertz so let's
take a look at the device a little bit
more closely let's zoom in to the top
here we've got a basically a flush touch
screen here that is very nice looking
the real story on the legend is that
it's made out of aluminum we're going to
talk about that in a second soap here we
have light sensor proximity sensor and
the speaker grill the screen is an anti
oil code in which does a really good job
at keeping fingerprints away down here
we have the typical android buttons and
they went with actual buttons here
instead of you know capacitive style
buttons so we've home menu back and
search now unlike the predecessor to
this the hero this device has an optical
trackpad so you can rub your finger
around it it's not a little bubble like
you got with the hero and you can also
press it inward to select certain items
on the screen you get the chin which is
nice because it really makes it feel
like a phone when you hold it up to your
face I really like the chin and then we
have a kind of a chrome looking volume
up and down rocker we've got micro USB
on the bottom with a volume control and
this is where the lanyard loops in got
this nice chiseled look on the side
with this edge that's about three
quarters of an inch laptop we have the
power standby button and of course the
the headphone jack here on the back on
the rear of the device we see a lot of
aluminum and we also see the 5 megapixel
camera at the top with the LED flash
which is nice and it's kind of a cool
design where the speaker grill is and
down here this is where you actually go
to take out the battery because the
legend is one piece of aluminum there's
no front and Novak it's just one piece
of aluminum so in order to get to all
the stuff like micro SD card the SIM
card and the battery you actually have
to take this off and it takes a little
bit of practice but then you kind of
slide this up words the battery falls
out I know very unusual and from here
you can take out the sim card you can
get out the the micro SD card and
everything like that very unusual we've
never seen anything quite like this but
they've done a really good job at
conserving space and keeping with this
one-piece aluminum design now John Wong
of HTC slammed this phone against a wall
we're not going to do that I can tell
you that the legend is absolutely
incredibly strong feeling and it's not
really apparent until you use it for a
few days when you take it out of your
pocket when you kind of squeeze it in
your hand and flex it and you realize
that this phone is extremely sturdy
thanks to this aluminum design very nice
looking very sweet device and it works
and it feels very much like a really
good phone device unlike say the HTC hd2
which of course is a phone but when you
hold it to your face you kind of get the
feeling like you're holding a old-school
pd 8 here to your head so we've got a
lot more coming up in the HTC legend
we're going to talk about the software
take a look at performance and how of
the HTC Sense interface has evolved
because there's a lot of new changes
with this new breed of devices from HTC
so tell us in the comments what do you
guys think about the HTC legend so far
let us know that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
