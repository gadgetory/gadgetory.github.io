Android with its fiche OS in the future
to bring its whole ecosystem
it looks like Huawei is also working on
a project to get rid of the notch and it
seems compelling and Samsung wants to
join Amazon Google and Apple and bring a
speaker to the market very very soon I'm
Jaime Rivera and we've been pondering a
crazy idea that we'd love your opinion
in the comments what would you think
about the parking out daily also going
live as a podcast leave us a comment
down below this is pocket out daily the
official news today start with Corning
Gorilla Glass of we haven't seen an
update to Gorilla Glass in years now
there is a new version six that is
apparently twice as hard as the previous
version and we know that it doesn't
necessarily mean that Corning Gorilla
Glass 5 was better than three there are
just some benefits but it seems that in
the case of 6 this is different it seems
that it would stood 15 Falls up to a
meter of height into direct concrete
which is interesting let's hope it comes
with devices like the Galaxy Note 9 and
the pixel 3 hopefully now let's talk
about Samsung the company wants to
celebrate 50 years of mankind going to
the moon in a big way and involves the
gear VR and Samsung's 8:37 store and
Chelsea and Manhattan for those of you
that are in New York this program is
gonna be life for a year where you can
go experience what it's like to walk on
the moon and they have a full way to
lift you up and everything and obviously
you experience it visually with the gear
VR seems very cool Adam Lane just went
to give it a try let me know in the
comments if you want me to go give it a
try as well and let's continue talking
about Samsung as we've got rumors that
the Bixby speaker is coming and it'll be
cheaper than the Google home max at $300
we hear that it might be launched within
the August timeframe so it makes sense
that it gets announced at the unpacked
event what makes it special is obviously
Bixby in addition to the fact that there
is this technology that Samsung demoed
at CES where it depends on where you're
standing from the speaker it'll speak in
that direction that's all cool and all
let's just see if it gets launched at
all and according to trusted sources it
seems that Huawei is working on its own
way to get rid of the knotch
it looks a lot like the essential way
of getting rid of the knotch which was
literally to just provide a hole for the
camera but instead of it being a sort of
a notch for the camera even if small
this is literally just a hole in the
display where the cameras gonna be and
then the speakers are gonna be in the
border again like we see in the
essential phone we see pens for this
information we hope that it does happen
we just wonder what's gonna happen to
the Android user interface with that
camera at the bottom I'm really curious
to see it
and finally the hottest news that they
have to do with Google's fuchsia OS and
before you scratch your heads over why
we left this as the hottest news well
we've been hearing that this project is
for the company's idea peripherals IOT
etc but according to the source which is
Google the engineers we have a hundred
engineers working in this project and
they are planning to replace Android in
the next five years meaning that there
will be a future where Fuji OS will take
over everything from IOT to smartphones
and tablets and Android will be no more
that's rather interesting there's a full
rated pocket now but let us know in the
comments in today's question and what do
you think do you think that Android
deserves to get the back seat over
fuchsia do you think Fuji OS is ass
great let us know in the comments I'm a
bit skeptical I mean I feel there's a
lot of versatility left at Android but
we'll see I could be wrong leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
