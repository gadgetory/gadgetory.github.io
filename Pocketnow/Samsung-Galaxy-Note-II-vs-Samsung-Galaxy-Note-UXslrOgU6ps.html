pocketnow.com here in the Boston offices
of pocket now we are slaving away on our
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 full review which
will be up very soon but we figured in
the interim that maybe you'd like to see
some more comparisons we've already
compared the note 2 to the galaxy s3 go
ahead and look that up if you haven't
seen that video yet we've done an
in-depth tour of the s-pen and now we're
going to have a quick look at the
samsung galaxy note 2 versus its
predecessor the samsung galaxy note
oh gee edition we're going to take a
very quick look at this as you can tell
work with on-camera audio so it's not
going to be an in-depth video we're
going to look at three areas hardware
software and the s-pen we didn't have a
lot of time we got to get back to work
in this review so let's get to it it's a
pocket now
so let's take a look at hardware first
this is the Galaxy Note on the left the
Galaxy Note 2 on the right obviously
these are different colored devices both
are offered in multiple colors and it is
difficult to photograph a dark and light
phone at the same time so please for
give me four that you can see right here
it's it's subtle but if you take a look
at it you can see what we're talking
about with this slimming effect Samsung
has definitely slimmed down the profile
on the note 2 here's when in fact the
dimensions are 80 millimeters wide
instead of 83 millimeters wide on the
original note there's also been some
minor slimming here 9 point 4
millimeters on the new device nine point
seven on the old one nothing you're
gonna really notice unless you're really
really looking for it and in fact the
weight has been increased 183 grams on
the Galaxy Note 2 versus 178 grams on
the original Galaxy Note but somehow
despite all that despite the slim
margins on the metrics and the fact that
this one is actually heavier the Galaxy
Note 2 definitely feels better in the
hand it's not just because there's a
glossy finish which is a little
friendlier to the skin then this weird
matte finish here on the original note
but the device is slimmer it's more palm
friendly it's more ergonomic very very
similar to the galaxy s3 which we
discussed in depth in our galaxy s3 vs
Galaxy Note 2 video so you can get our
focus back there
there we are working Before we jump into
the software we just have a look at the
displays here there's a little bit of a
scrolling action here which belies the
different technology behind these
screens they are both large panels this
one is five point three inches 5.5 on
the right on the new one they're both
Super AMOLED displays however and
they're both running the same resolution
almost the same resolution 800 by 1280
over here 720 by 1280 on the new device
no pentile sub pixel arrangement on the
new galaxy note 2 that will make many
people jump for joy we've written some
articles on that you can look it up if
you don't know what a pentile sub pixel
arrangement is anyway hopping around to
the back real quickly we have once again
both devices are rocking an 8 megapixel
primary shooter
the one on the galaxy note 2 has been
rumored to be and I believe confirmed to
be the same module as found in the
galaxy s3 so that's good news for anyone
as anyone will know who has used a
Galaxy s3 camera before it is an
excellent excellent shooter otherwise
Hardware differences are relatively
minor speaker phones are in the same
place samsung branding there's your
Flash volume rockers lock button in
roughly the same place actually Samsung
has moved the lock button down on the
galaxy note 2 so it's a bit more
accessible and note button excuse me
I keep doing that home button flanked by
capacitive menu and back keys on each
instance here so given the choice
between these two models it shouldn't
come as a surprise to anyone when I say
I prefer the note 2 despite the fact
that I don't really like the hyper glaze
coating it does feel better in the hand
and and it's certainly a much more
manageable device due to those new
friendlier dimensions I just want to
talk about specs briefly I know some of
you people watching the video are very
interested in specs obviously with the
generation apart the chipsets inside
here are going to be different the
original Galaxy Note 2 shipped with a
Samsung Exynos dual-core processor
running at one point four gigahertz the
note 2 shipping with the new X and O's
4412 quad running at 1.6 gigahertz that
is a quad-core processor obviously very
very very notable more notable possibly
is the fact that it also supports LTE
this will be the first phone one of the
first phones in the United States to
support both LTE and a quad-core
processor at the same time very
significant otherwise we have some RAM
differences here one gig shift in the
original Galaxy Note and most
configurations in the galaxy note 2 we
have double that two gigs of ram
available storage capacity 16 32 or 64
gigs of storage augmenta below microSD
compared to 16 or 32 gigs of storage on
the original galaxy note also micro sd
over here alright that's hardware now
how about the software so from a
software perspective the original note
shipped with Android OS 2.3.5
Gingerbread which was later made
upgradable to android 4.4 ICS which is
what
we're running here the Galaxy Note 2
being newer of course ships with Android
4.1.1 jelly bean and all the
accompanying notification enhancements
Google now and the project butter UI
enhancements among others and including
the pop-up browser which I didn't mean
to open just then but I'm glad it opened
because it allowed me to show off one of
my favorite features Samsung's new
TouchWiz build the TouchWiz builds are
the TouchWiz builds pardon me are also
completely different obviously you can
see in the original note this is very
much the galaxy s / Galaxy S 2 design
language and the software here with
these kind of big square colorful
TouchWiz widgets that we became familiar
with over a couple years of kind of
hating on skins the Galaxy Note 2
obviously bringing a much more modern
take to the situation a lot here just
ripped samsung just ripped directly off
from themselves in the the galaxy s3
which is not at all a bad thing you can
see some nice animations on folder
openings here obviously a much more
pronounced focus on user interface in
the TouchWiz nature UX whether you like
it or hate it maybe you don't like those
river water droplet sounds on every menu
action but you can of course change
those whatever the case it is a much
more evolved user interface than the old
version of TouchWiz and it is much much
more pleasant to use and you can see
that that change in responsiveness even
in just doing things like homescreen
scrolling here and maybe will see it in
the app launcher as well and let's not
forget the defining feature of phablets
the things that make Galaxy Notes Galaxy
Notes the s-pen the older s-pen on the
Galaxy Note 1 a much thinner affair than
the newer one which we'll take a look at
in a second and performance lagging a
little behind what one might expect from
a top-end unit especially one that's
being sold on its stylist like merits
you can see there it's trailing behind
if you get go and you can get a trailing
buy and buy a good inch or so obviously
good pressure responsiveness and you
know good performance overall
from this device but not exactly what
you'd expect from something that sells
itself based on being a stylus centric
device so Samsung implemented some
improvements in the Galaxy Note 2 the
new Wacom digitizer capable of over a
thousand levels of pressure sensitivity
here's the new s-pen thicker feels
better in the hand it was touted as
implementing some some friction
increasing elements to the stylus to
give it the feel of a ballpoint pen on
paper almost that is not the case it
still definitely feels like plastic on
glass which is exactly what you are
doing and while I can scribble nonsense
pretty well it is tough to write well I
discussed these difficulties in depth in
my s-pen guided tour video from earlier
this week so you should go check that
out if you have not seen it already
there are many many features samsung is
built into the software here changing
some of the implementations to include
support for back and menu that was there
in the note 1 but the gesture types are
different now there are also options
like quick launch where you draw a
straight line up there's a button on the
s-pen here which allows you to change
its mode of operation and you can select
certain symbols for a quick launch and
so forth that is fun those are exciting
features there is nothing that's going
to really really enhance usability all
too much I find that my favorite
implementation of the s-pen intends to
be in apps like the gallery where I can
hover over images and also in the video
player where I can scrub the video
manually before deciding where I want to
hop to in the video that is a very very
nice touch and I even find the S Pen
very useful in apps where a stylus is
not necessary and styluses are not
necessary in apps like Twitter here but
it is handy for precise precision input
particularly using some of the new
features Samsung was able to bring to
the note 2 like the pop-up browser here
very very handy as well as full screen
multitasking a very very innovative you
of the note twos larger display area so
if you are a Galaxy Note one owner
should you invest in a Samsung Galaxy
Note 2 as always that's going to depend
on you I certainly would I think it's a
much improved device I think the more
interesting question though is if you
are not currently a phablet owner and
you did not own the Samsung Galaxy Note
in its original iteration how will
likely are you to consider something
like this well considering the
improvements Samsung is made to the
Galaxy Note line with the Galaxy Note 2
I think the phablet category is only
going to get bigger in the future but of
course you'll have to wait for our full
review to hear more of our insights with
regard to the Galaxy Note 2
