player making headlines while Y has
spent the last three years surprising us
with their flagship offerings and we're
really close to seeing the company's
next pea offering but the attend was one
of my favorite phones of 2017 so it's
time to narrow down what we're about to
see next week I'm hey meta leave a tie
with pocket now and before we begin I'd
love to give a shout out to Squarespace
for sponsoring this video whether you're
looking for a Dell main website or
online store Squarespace is one of my
favorite options from beautiful designer
templates Squarespace is pretty much an
all-in-one platform that's praised for
its 24/7 customer service head on over
to Squarespace comm slash PocketNow and
get a 10% discount to get started let's
begin with our predictions of the huawei
P 20 and P 20 Pro
first of all probably one of the most
important changes is the naming scheme
we thought it was gonna be P 11 falling
on the numbers that we've seen but no
it's gonna be feed 20 according to
trusted sources and at this point let's
not even talk about the P 20 light
because it pretty much almost got
announced in Poland and Italy right now
the ones that are left earth the P 20
and the B 20 Pro being the P 20 Pro
probably the most important one because
we're not talking about a + variant
meaning a larger P 20 apparently this
phone is about a lot more which is
probably a great segue for the next
segment
design-wise it seems that the changes
are mainly focused on new material in
the past B 10 was aluminum and every
previous model before that now we're
getting more glass than aluminum in the
past it was backwards we noticed that
there are even some interesting color
options that will apparently change
depending on how you dilt the phone
we've got some really interesting colors
that I might be interested in in
addition to that yes we are getting a
notch on both of these phones and you
know what I'm not gonna say that I
wasn't expecting this as those of you
that remember the P 10 pretty much
looked like the iPhone so yeah now when
it comes to specification x' no
surprises here we're expecting the same
carryin 970 processor that we saw with
the may 10 Pro that processor is
extremely powerful and in addition to
that we've got six inga bytes of RAM on
both devices now the changes have to do
mainly with things like display size
where apparently the p20 is 5.8 inches
so the p20 Pro is not going to be that
much larger at 6 inches and then we hear
differences like for example the size of
the battery which will be 3400 milliamp
hours on one and four thousand milliamp
hours on the other one obviously the pro
making this more of a make 10 Pro
category the biggest question is what
will differentiate these phones and
obviously it's what the company has been
mainly teasing which has to be the
cameras the next segment so yeah for
those of you asking yourself what really
is going to make the pro a pro device
let's focus on a couple of things first
of all let's remember that Leica is
apparently going to bring something
special to this phone
and since Lika focuses on photography
what is it that photographers usually
look for I mean if you see ba7 from Sony
the a7 s and the a7 are the a7 is pretty
much the entry-level the a7 s is the
video one and then the a7 r is the one
that's focused on photography it's the
one that brings the most amount of
megapixels apparently that's what's
going to differentiate the Pro and the
case of the b20 it seems that we're
still getting the same color and
monochrome sensors but in the pro for
some reason I don't have these three
lenses that are apparently going to come
are going to bring one monochrome in the
other telephoto not exactly sure all we
hear right now is that apparently this
combo of cameras is gonna be capable of
40 megapixel photos and 5x hybrid zoom
and that's a major deal I mean the last
time we had a phone with this capability
it was the Lumia 1020 and it offered
lossless zoom and so many things but
again it's the focus on photography more
megapixels allowing photographers to
have more versatility we even hear that
the selfie shooter is going to bring 24
megapixels which is all great but yeah
apparently that is what's going to make
the p20 pro the pro but in today's
question let us know I mean what are you
expecting for this big 20 Pro or for the
P 20 for that matter what are you
expecting from them and what would you
like to see from this phones because in
my case I would have loved that if there
was no not sure but honestly I just
can't wait to see what that P 20 pro can
do it photography leave us a comment
down but let we'd love to know your
opinion friends our coverage of the
Huawei P 20 and P 20 Pro will begin very
