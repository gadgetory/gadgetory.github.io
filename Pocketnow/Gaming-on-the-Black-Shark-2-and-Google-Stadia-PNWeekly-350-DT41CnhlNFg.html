slash now hello
use your are you in the office use the
5g hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers recorded on March 21st
2019 I am of course your host Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
I'm here to bring you the first episode
of what is kind of a new era for the
pocket now weekly hour now former
producer extraordinaire Jules Wong has
moved on to new opportunity so now I'm
taking on the podcast not only the
hosting duties but also all of the
editing and producing and publishing as
well so I'm doing my best to bring you a
great show every single week and I
wanted to do something special for this
first one I just got back from China at
the launch of the Black Shark - which is
a beast of a phone and we do talk about
it at the beginning of this episode by
the way there's a bit of fuzz and the
audio to start off part of the reason
why and I'm pretty sure this is the
reason why it's because I had the Black
Shark - hovering over the recorder that
I use for the podcast which means that
there were some radio interference
there's a lot of stuff going on in that
phone so you're going to see why not
only in a video here on pocket knob
which is already available but also in
our first reactions where I have both
Jaime Rivera and our guest David Cogan
also known as the unlocker react to this
crazy gaming phone but on the topic of
gaming we also talked about the brand
new announcement of Google stadia and
how this game streaming service might
really change gaming for the better but
also a little bit confused as to who
exactly this service might be for and
how much it might actually be because
there's no pricing on it yet
all of this was recorded in San Diego
California where Jaime and David Cogan
were for a Qualcomm of
where they announced a brand new audio
processing chip and also did some
announcements around Wi-Fi six and other
announcements that would they discuss in
this podcast so yeah I wanted to make
sure that we were all in the same room
together it was kind of an opportunity
for us to hang out we don't get to see
each other too often and I figured this
will be a great time for us to get
together for this episode of the podcast
so let's go ahead and get into the
episode if you're watching the YouTube
edition of this you can get into the
comment sections down below let us know
what you think about all of the
announcements that we sort of touch upon
including that of the black shark - and
Google stadia and then of course you can
wait until our outro so you know where
to find all of us and also where you can
reach us on social media so let's go
ahead and get into the episode that
would be so the company is black shark
but they are funded in part by Xiaomi so
it's actually incorrect they were they
were they were making it very clear to
me during that whole trip that like we
get why people want to say Xiaomi black
shark but it's not so please make the
deal I sing in Oppo one plus 6 or Huawei
honor write something ok got it
so they really wanted to make that
absolutely clear want to make it its own
brand exactly and they're really they're
working really hard to become a gaming
brand because in the box or a bunch of
stickers and like they really want it to
be like like quantum core gaming
lifestyle away like Razer yeah and I
think they're doing a pretty good job so
far
cuz this this is this is such a fun
phone to use already is it real I mean
it looks cool yeah let me show you okay
so quick reactions to the black shrug is
how we're starting off I've not seen it
so yet you're in you're in what is
basically stock Android wait a second so
we already started yeah so we're okay so
we're in what is basically stock Android
oh yes even the longer yeah it's pixel
launcher which is awesome already weird
different I don't know if the Chinese
version is going to have me UI but
there's this looks like the alert slider
okay
oh the one bliss of one-plus yeah so
when you toggle that what it does is it
dark space shark space
sharknado space it dumps every app in
the background so that memory is only
used for games
got it so this pulls you into like a
yeah the game
- game launcher so how a game launcher
done right yes he'll every other app
because let's get ready to part and we
were talking to West landscape yes
Forest landscape boy it'll go to like
it'll do portraits
exactly let's do Super Mario run cuz we
were talking really test this thing well
thing is we were talking about this last
week that gaming has like the problem
with gaming right now on mobile is that
the software needs to catch up with the
hardware because the heart because the
thing is the hardware we have vapor
cooling we have super high specs and all
that the games don't use any of it
exactly right so you need it so what you
what you get what the Black Shark is
hardware that's actually trying to like
go all-in with that so you have this
shark space that that kills all of the
apps in the background he'll open this
later if you swipe down from the top you
get all of these options right here
including an overclock so you can you
can actually turn everything above razor
did that with their cortex after an Asus
doesn't Sue's does it as well true it's
a little bit easier it's actually like
cater though but there are other there
are other options available like gaming
HDR like button on this one yeah like
it's an easier way to just launched
launch it do you also remember just how
how not really upset but annoyed that
the controller was not available at
launch oh my god
but then again the problem was not the
annoyance of the controller with Razer
the late launch but the fact that once a
did launch it didn't really work well
well not the controller it's not a
controller problem it's an Android
problem it is so what have you got there
mister Nintendo switch alright so the
case for black shark has two ridges on
the sides where you actually slot in the
two portions of the controller and it
becomes kind of like an Android switches
between so this is what like that this
is the full configuration there is a
cooling case that's like that much
thicker but this is what the point of
software and hardware I don't need a
cooling case that's what I'm saying like
that's if you turn on the ludicrous mode
and you go like absolutely nuts on the
game and but the thing is it's not
necessary yeah now with games right now
but I think that's I think that's the
point is that they're encouraging app
developers to take advantage of the
hardware right so it's just like
encouraging everybody yeah now here's
the thing this is going this is gonna be
where
a chicken before the egg yes this is
where I musical thing comes in what's
that this controller does not register
the way that a Xbox controller or a
typical Android controller registers
these are all replacements all these
buttons and this touchpad right here and
on all replacements for on-screen
controls you have to map every little
thing got it so if the game has but you
only do it once yes okay I'm willing to
put up with that yeah do wait once per
game no just once because most games are
all gonna be in the same well once per
game
because for example pub she has so many
buttons on its interface right and then
you've got a drag
that's good but I like that I saw that
first in the issues yeah ROG phone mhm
that had but only to the triggers the
air triggers could do that yeah I don't
think the triggers concept though same
concept though the same concept more
buttons but the thing is it's a little
bit frustrating to be honest because if
your game doesn't already have a full
HUD oh I could just swipe to get them
two buttons exactly you're screwed
because literally you not set one of
these to swipe no well okay one thing
you can do is if you hold the right
button mmm it it renders a mouse on
screen and then you use this touchpad in
order to click on things which is okay
it's a compromise I feel like that feels
right but but like can you maybe set one
of these is a hotkey to do a swipe down
action or a swipe I'm obviously this is
wishful thinking I think there might be
one but it's more on the touchscreen
there's something called master touch
where you actually program macros to a
hard press on the screen okay that's
that's Wow but that's the into it it's
like they really they really work hard
on that yeah they put a lot of thought
into this and you know what like certain
games it's just not going to work like
for example portrait games of course
you're not gonna use the controller but
that's the thing they put a lot of work
into this to make sure the controller
makes sense in certain games and then if
you're going to use touch controls
anyway because some games require that
then they made sure the latency is low
you have master touch and all that there
was a guy
I'm a must have seen on my video but
there was a guy who came up on stage and
played like a guitar hero s game where
it was like on insane mode so everything
was coming down at like a millisecond
and he was just the whole time
perfect score to show off that the touch
latency is the
in the market a good wave it was amazing
and he came up and every I had a
front-row seat for no reason at all and
I just turned around and all of the
European media were staring at me like
[Laughter]
it was it was kind of an insane event I
have to say it was pretty it was in the
Great Wall
well not in it but we had a great wall
thing in the morning before the event
and that was so cool well I did I'm kind
of sad I didn't go it would have been
great to have you there thank you for
letting me go
I do have to show you one thing we're
quick tile before I again to a check in
with you guys
so I'll pull up the video later I don't
want to take up too much time with it
but so we climb the Great Wall in order
to get to the section where you start to
climb the Great Wall
we took a ski lift right hmm and then in
order to come down you could take the
ski lift down if you want there's no
walking down but you can also do
something that I think is it it really
doesn't fit with the historical
implications of the great wall you could
skateboard it was a toboggan yeah but
just to provide a little context the
problem is that the I don't know what
size Chinese people had when the Great
Wall was built because each step is the
size of one of my legs
it is so it's not that they're they're
just making it easy for regular humans
yeah to walk up and down cuz I don't
think like I was in top shape when I was
in the great wall and I was dead by like
by like I think that the bus driver
hated us so much on that trip that he's
like I'm gonna drop them off and the
most complicated place to climb and he
achieved well here's here's kind of what
it looks like this toboggan the weirdest
thing I ever that is fantastic because
you're still getting the visuals of the
Great Wall yeah and you don't have to
put up drop in the video why's your hand
in between is there like a break there's
a break and as you're coming down they
start screaming are you like test the
brake first test the brake
okay okay and they wouldn't let me I
snuck those clips in because they didn't
want you to record or take pictures of
the baby I guess for a safety thing
because if you're distracted you're not
breaking Casey Neistat teacher good
thing you have a picture of Michelle
Obama doing it there are like yeah and
they're like by the way just if you're
worried about safety Michelle Obama did
it we're like what is that yeah they put
the posters how she got those arms exact
is testing out that brake on the great
toboggan Dez
it was kind of weird because you know
putting putting aside you know like all
the slavery and death that happened so
we were all feeling once you got up damn
it
I should have gone yep damn it what can
I have you on for the next one that I
read and we're with them
so black shark I actually I actually
want that phone I've this is the first
time I see it first time I hold it I
told I tell you man I want to play games
with my phone I don't want to be
carrying around my switch there are
certain games throw on Android the
problem is I need a controller I just I
need a control I played my switch all
the way to China playing undertale by
the way no spoilers
and then on the way back I was on that I
definitely liked it definitely did help
a lot okay I will say though okay you
have to put in the work to map
everything but once you do games like
pub cheers but it's just once
I don't know cheat at once yeah I don't
mind doing that once it's like for me
anyways I would still remap a ton of
things on my keyboard whenever oh my god
my G pro my Logitech G pro keyboard just
arrived yes along with the G pro man
with Joyce and that charging trackpad
yeah man that's a good choice oh yeah
you pro you're not a mechanical keyboard
guy are you convenience excuse me I'm
not carrying that thing around
oh you saw mine oh no you didn't see my
dad did you no okay yeah alright MWC and
he just looks at me and goes that's a
loud
the other way about anybody with the new
MacBooks though like all of them so no
but the previous generation the 2017 the
new one is quieter it's much quieter
actually and it's actually very pleasant
to type on I like it
alright so the black shark and China of
course we're what I've been up to the
last few days
cool you two have been spending a lot of
time together recently so I drove all
the way down here not to get into the
details of my horrific four-hour drive
down from LA but we're here in San Diego
and I came down to see these guys so we
could have a we could have a fun little
podcast all person-to-person like this
yeah so what has been going on in San
Diego for you two for a Qualcomm event
they were showing off their new smart
speaker chipset it's like the first time
they've actually made a chipset
specifically for speakers yeah normally
they just like retrofit one of their
other series and throw it in there so
the fact that they did that it's like
they were telling us all about it how
it's gonna lower costs and like they
have really high fly audio that now will
be able to come to lower price points
and all this other stuff
the other thing that like I wish is like
that we could obviously see units but
this is of course Qualcomm telling us
about the technology before it's
actually available did they did they
have a reference unit that looked really
cool like a mason jar what yeah there
was a reference device that looked like
a mason jar it was supposed to be like a
Google home yeah but it's see-through
and so this is the QCs 400 series it's
actually not just one chip it's four
chips yeah it's pretty much one chip
with different components that will
either make it adequate for your echo
dot or your standard Google home or a
screen version or the high end you know
sound bars so no now yeah but in the
case of the sound bar dude like they
literally created this amplifier to go
with the chip that's literally a quarter
of the size of a standard smartphone and
so it's hilarious how there were like
you know audio files invited from you
know press audio files invited oh and
they were all just geeking out over lie
where is the where's the heat sink
where's this where's that there like I
don't know heat sink you don't need any
of them they're like you know that can't
be what Oh
and so imagine your typical soundbar now
not needing to be a soundbar it's
literally be something the size of this
okay okay that's one thing and then the
second thing is because you know
obviously they they've got experience
with Snapdragon and everything the whole
idea is if you want a portable echo dot
you can now have a portable echo dot
they showed different ways in which this
chip will only listen to key words and
actually only act require power drain
through key words huh in a specific way
that's a show doff how it works and so
my name is my password was that was that
the thing that they used to say my voice
is my password and so and so like it's
funny there were a lot of questions over
like why like you know the find the
reducing the size of a sound bar and
providing high quality audio is great I
mean there's there have been Qualcomm
chips on Sonos and other sound bars and
like forever but it was the cult concept
of what's the purpose of this chip and
so they were very clear into this is the
whole idea is to create a whole
different array of products that don't
exist today like portable Google home
minis and Amazon echoes and that okay
okay which I like so obviously you were
saying that audio files were there and
they were geeking out of course I think
it's obvious that this is the kind of
question that people like us would have
is this a chip that you could put into
like a smart phone like imagine like
boombox you don't know show they
literally what they did was pull out the
DSP from the snapdragon 855 or if not
that one they put two in there yeah it's
just it's its own custom thing meant for
speakers no that's for speaking as
opposed to them taking a Snapdragon and
putting it into a speaker they were like
well there's only certain things we
really need in a speaker and we need
more of these things and less of these
things let's all put that together and
make a different sure it's not you'd
never see this you know it just sounds
like a lot of business it just sounds
like certain parts of these would
actually enhance a smartphone experience
though like the amplifier will open the
empire's too big exactly good point
amplifier but it's too big for okay but
that's that's one thing then the
other thing is you know in addition to
the power saving you also have the
advantage that you can so right now if
you talk to an echo dot that you have
like if you have a smart room bar one of
these things you can only you can talk
to the echo have the echo call the cloud
connect to the Roomba and have it move
now what they're doing is also allowing
developers to create their own keywords
that work directly on the product and
don't require you to go through the echo
and so you will you can still use an
Amazon echo to call on the on the Roomba
but you will also have the option to be
like Roomba start cleaning without the
need of of the echo being involved and
so they're also it also allows you know
third-party products to not to be
smarter to a certain degree but to also
have the capabilities of continuing to
be connected to the Internet ok or
nicely not connected not needing to be
for example if you take that smart
speaker away from the house you can
actually still give it commands and I
still be able to do basic functionality
because it doesn't need to go to the
cloud for just the hot word yeah you
know and then they have multiple support
for a bunch of different Howard's as
well so you can have Alexa Google home
the brand like all of those can all be
embedded on the chip and yeah all the
time
KitchenAid that was one thing that we
saw the second thing is the one that
gave mr. Cogan the creeps
oh no it's so in the Wi-Fi presence oh
it's so creepy and yet so great okay I
think that the one I like the so I do
like you know the QC s400 everything
it's just I had no idea what Wi-Fi six
is capable of yeah and we were given a
full demo things that are gonna be like
whoa yeah so so to talk about the creepy
thing because we just need because it's
really but like it's not just Wi-Fi six
this is not something that necessarily
Wi-Fi six enables but but in the same
breath while they were talking about why
face six and telling us all these things
they were explaining a thing called
spectral something sense its spectral
sensing okay so instead of having to use
like for security purposes and having to
use a camera right but 19:19 secure
they were preaching all the cool things
about it and I was like that is all cool
but it's also terrifying so the cool
things about it that they were telling
us was like look we can actually use the
Wi-Fi spectrum to to determine when
things are open closed whether there's a
person in the room etc so forget a
camera or forget a sensor on your door
we can use your existing Wi-Fi network
and know that the door is open because
of the way the spectrum hits it right so
okay yeah cool creepy part is that they
were also explaining that each
individual person has their own RF
interference yes so if if you walk in
the room Josh yeah I can tell first off
that you're in the room because you're
interfering with the Wi-Fi signal but
then it can it can you can name that
Josh exactly it will always know when
you come in the room versus when Jaime
comes in the room versus when I do
Howie not been using this but have you
you know a strain there they were saying
like some companies already made
building this it's yeah it's not like a
new thing they're making it just hasn't
come to market oh okay they were naming
like a production companies have our
mobile because the sugilite you'll find
you'll find companies that because this
is a level of security it's also
terrifying because if you like it I'm a
I'm a futurist and a progressive when it
comes to things like I don't really care
that certain people are watching me like
I don't care but like Wi-Fi is
everywhere already right like you're
explaining they don't need to do much to
remember the scene in like Dark Knight
yes the scene in The Dark Knight and who
was the character that it was like I
can't work for you and Lucius Fox was
like I'm not dealing with you ever again
using cell phones and the signal they
emit and having a like sonar bouncing
off that is literally it the probably
that get smartest way to explain I get I
get why you're creeped out live I think
that's fantastic
well I honestly think it's super cool
and I love it and I'm gonna use it but a
part of me has to like I just I think
question of like like we're worried
about like facial recognition in like
China for example and how it's like
they're there I'll have a story is there
right like they were you know all of
those things and you're like oh well
like cameras are gonna be everywhere and
we're all gonna be watched okay we don't
even need the cameras to track you
across the world right now is already in
place yeah basically it's what they just
told me that's where my well I don't
think the reason why I'm totally into
that right now is because my family my
parents and I we've been having a
horrible time trying to like cancel our
home security system and to know that I
don't have to like necessarily pay for a
whole new like camera system just we got
Wi-Fi and there are other cool things
that Wi-Fi will be able to do like for
example so one of the things that Wi-Fi
six will enable or probably not probably
not Wi-Fi so once your TV is Wi-Fi six
capable yeah and you're smart speaker is
Wi-Fi six capable you won't need mesh
routers anymore your television can
become a mesh router your other speaker
in the room you're they were they will
be capable of not just receiving but
transmitting what's to shoot up the
price though no really it's literally
the same capability of the chip man the
Wi-Fi will be smart enough to pretty
much tell everybody in Latin America F
you because now you won't be able to
steal Wi-Fi will be unlike men you're
gonna really ruin my time in my
apartment I can't steal Wi-Fi yeah we're
gonna no no even a worse time on the
podcast my neighbor's no it's the other
way around I won't be able to tell my
neighbor hate my password is this
because you can literally geofence what
your apartment is and it will based on
all the products and it was bill signal
yeah outside of that fat like that yeah
I let us cool
and it's anybody the thing is that it's
uneven geofencing you don't even have to
tell it it just like it Wi-Fi six one of
the things you can do is it like it just
learns from what's around so like if it
knows like if you have it against this
wall right you're technically giving a
lot of Wi-Fi signal to your next-door
neighbor
exactly but none of the devices have the
password so none of them are connecting
over there so the beamforming stuff that
it does with my mo instead of pointing
that direction just points this way yeah
it just lessens the signal that way that
way and then you get more signal this
way yeah that's better I do like that a
lot yeah yeah that's pretty awesome
Oh quick story before we go into our
first break so when you enter you've
been to China obviously right but you
wait you want recently right I did okay
first time but I went I went to Shenzhen
which felt very which is fine in the in
the airport on the way in I mean you
know the uses there in mind you're in
Beijing the Beijing is a different story
it is but I think in Shenzhen they do
this too where are you going you go into
immigration control and you have to give
your fingerprints oh and then the face
yeah but like okay I don't remember the
last time I was in Beijing but I went
over to those machines remembering that
it was there and I was like I mean you
know certainly makes you feel a little
bit weird but okay so I went like that
and I saw other people there like
putting their fingers down and then it
comes out with like a a picture of their
fingers and it goes okay thank you for
that blah blah blah when I went like
this put my fingers down a little card
came out that just said okay which meant
they have my info ready they didn't need
it updated like they had it but again
none of this matters this new Wi-Fi
things gonna be just walk in the room
and they were like Josh
[Laughter]
oh my god okay no no no but I thought
that it was I I think that regardless of
the amount of you know the announcements
I really like being here just to be
explained what these things no I think
that's more of the value here like the
hard part for us to think about call
come events and I'm a high level dude
and then whenever they talk to the low
level stuff like what is happening I
feel so out class I'm like oh okay okay
you add will I miss Shareef there was a
guy that works with them he's the best
thing so and they've got new guys that
doing just the good just as good of a
job but he was so good at like
explaining it to you in like two minutes
put on the two-hour position put your
bib on it is important I like I like
coming these because they do like
there's not necessarily it's hard for us
to develop a story like there's not a
video I could do necessarily while I was
here because there's not there's not
really like some like a product there's
nothing there we're learning right well
you know what huh me because then when
the products come out I don't know
what's the song you know what just a
knowledge and I understand would
Qualcomm's position is behind it yeah
Qualcomm's favor I totally agree with
you but you could have totally done a
video just like whoa technically this is
it but the let's focus also on the fact
that you know there are ethics out there
like for example now laptops are coming
out with a cover for the camera yeah now
we've got smart speakers yeah now smart
speakers come with a cover for the
camera just don't bring a camera at all
so I I do feel that they're the
concerning the concern exists of course
the capability also has existed so yeah
how long have we been carrying cameras
on our laptops yeah think about it since
it's been more than fifty nine years
what do you put to your point you don't
need a camera
well you can just Wi-Fi I feel I feel
that we need more we need to see we
already know what it can do the question
is how it gets implemented absolutely
all right I don't even know if there's
like a mid ad for this one but we're
gonna go into a quick break if you're
overwhelmed by the sheer amount of
remote controls you have cluttering your
entertainment space then you should
check out the control center by kaavo
the control center simplifies your home
theater so you can control everything
that's connected to your TV with one
remote that includes voice control plug
in any media system into the control
center even your game console and it
will take care of the rest
one universal voice remote controls at
all just say what you want to watch and
you can enjoy every second of your
viewing time without having to lift a
finger or search for those other
in my family home I've been able to get
the living room down to one control
center as compared to the five remote
controls we used to use before that and
it is easier to teach our parents one
remote control rather than having to
teach them how to use multiple check it
out for yourself and get 40% off the
control center with the promo code
weekly that brings the price down so
59.95 from the original 99.95 service
plans are required but the first 45 days
are free control center is available at
CAA veoh.com and best buy control center
by kaavo one remote that does it all
okay so we have we have one huge
announcement from this past week which I
love that just a peek behind the curtain
I'm a reported this news but still
watched a few videos to make sure he
knew what he was talking so okay how how
much would you to say you are gamers
retro retro okay retro yeah if casual I
love my switch I like that I can play it
on a plane and like this is the reason
why I think well this is the reason why
I think that actually Google is its
Tatia stadia stadia stadium I tried I
remember trying to look up Wesley idea
and I'm like oh so like a stadium and if
you look at their advertisement it
focuses on showing how people would play
ever since the you know the gladiator
times and stuff like that and yeah it's
interesting afterwards date that was
that argument weird way of them
advertising okay that's the reason why I
think like especially for like you a
casual gamer who would not put down the
money for like a razor 17 in order to
have the best specs to play games you
know what I mean that's why because this
is cloud-based gaming obviously so you
can use any device Android and any
device with chrome you can use my switch
no no no no wait a second so currently I
think Hulu works on the switch like
switches allowing certain apps to work
on it like in the end what they want us
tree to be part of the platform yeah
they don't like they don't care that is
an idealistic world oh yes I mean but
you're right even regardless I have an
Android phone I have an iPhone I have a
computer I don't go so I could use
anything so here's so we don't know
exactly what the pricing is going to be
when it comes to stadia
or anything like that but I'm I want to
just put it out there I know it's got to
be a streaming service it's got to be
like subscriptions away the Netflix of
games there so which brings me to my
second question how many things are you
guys subscribe to I just got built for
runner's world I mean I didn't remember
that I subscribe to the magazine like
once a year for 20 bucks nice like what
New York Times runner's world youtube TV
which is 35 bucks a month Netflix which
is 11 something plus Spotify family
which is another 15 bucks personally I'm
watching anime I have Google Music as
well that's another 10 bucks so
literally I have what do you have Google
music ends because I for some reason
they act when so when YouTube premium
came around I was like alright I need to
report on it's all I'll accept the trial
and I have I always forget to cancel it
I spent three years forgetting to cancel
Hulu three years and I think how many
companies make money like that yeah you
try to cancel in they cage they come to
your house how many subscriptions do you
have I use a lot for work as well like I
have systems that help me like the
plugins from website a lot of those like
personal things a lot I mean a decent
amount yeah so what's to stop you from
from
adding this one I like the concept yeah
personally I don't know how well it's
gonna work that's the big question the
price is also a big question but like I
can't imagine it's gonna be that
expensive I was about to say I'm not
really concerned about the price
I just mean that my closer it matters
I'm not really concerned about the price
I don't think it's I don't think Google
can be they only have one game right is
doom so which which right there the
moment that I saw
doom I was like oh that's like one of
the main reasons the big selling point
for me to buy the switch wasn't all the
games but was the fact that doom was
gonna
port it to it and doom was my PC my
favorite PC game of all time right and
so I was like alright if I could get
doom on this thing so for me I'm already
sold right but so this brings up your
point which is the thing that drives
most people to any of these consoles or
these systems or these streaming
services the content so like if you
don't have the content nobody's gonna
come but the thing is as long as Google
is able to to make the deals no matter
what game it is they could probably get
it like as long as as long as it's
available for let's say PC maybe PC is
the only the only heart that's where it
would start yeah that's the only hurdle
here because you are you never giving
him anything
yeah and I'll never give them anything
Sony when I give them any reason so it's
PC and Xbox correct in that case because
that's an you have Microsoft coming out
with their own service but here's the
thing I mean Sony has had it for how
long yeah well the problem is can these
companies make the mistake of playing a
Microsoft or playing you know the
companies that became a playing an apple
with Apple music if you think about it
this is not new like streaming gaming
has existed for a while many companies
have tried and they failed the thing
about it is Google actually has the
money yeah they actually like of Amazon
said that they wanted to do something
like this I would trust that it would
work because they have servers they have
the capability in South Asia
I mean it's hilarious it's hilarious how
much if you try to watch a video or any
sort of video service separately and try
to compare that to YouTube yeah it's
like you YouTube has so much R&amp;amp;D into
how to make the video play immediately
that you don't find in other services
and so if Google has been able to
achieve that with a video which is
extremely complicated I don't doubt that
they will have the capability
I just with the game because well the
game is the same thing they're streaming
a video it's got nothing to do with
gaming the game is gonna run on the
server they're just streaming and output
to you yeah is essentially Oller even
the controller is not connected to your
device
yeah it's connected directly yeah so
it's literally like the Google Docs of
games that is real that is really really
clever I will it because you're
interacting directly so it's Netflix yes
but you don't interact with the movie
once it starts
whereas in Google Docs you're in
real-time interacting while the
spreadsheets in a server and that's the
other side there's so exactly there's so
many bits going in and out in terms of
gaming because even 4k 60 frames per
second video on Netflix or YouTube
yes different well yeah like when
there's a lot of crap happening on
screen there are artifacts yeah and like
you said well it doesn't reach oak I
don't I don't think there's stutters but
no the bitrate goes yeah but it doesn't
really immediately know but in and
here's the thing I mean if I long and
this is the reason why I feel that that
the idea is not so crazy try to launch
doom on your switch how long does it
take for the game to load try to launch
Super Mario honestly it's at least three
minutes for it to go through the whole
process so we're worried about latency
where you're gonna have a supercomputer
on the other end and it all depends on
your internet connection so if you're
telling me that the game is gonna launch
on that supercomputer in 30 seconds when
compared to three minutes I'll take it
hmm okay well but it's not that it's
because we know it's gonna be to launch
fine and it'll show up in the screen
work it's the it's the crosstalk back
and forth over the World Wide Web true
love of me pushing button a and
expecting a reaction immediately no and
then if you start if you have a certain
amount of milliseconds even it's gonna
be noticeable try to be like this true I
don't I mean right now when we were like
I told my son you know I'm getting these
these things for gaming but you know the
G pro and and everything he was like oh
you're gonna want this Mouse cuz it's
got it's got no lates like that
right like that I'm like all right dude
fine and that's the thing like the way
that I felt when I tried PlayStation now
mmm is that this is just not going to be
for hardcore gamers of certain genres
right you're not gonna do pop G here cuz
you need immediate reaction you're not
doing first you need fast all its
muscles like in the Internet sense yeah
and you also won't be able to do
fighting games you wanna you also won't
be doing you won't not be competitive it
is all be anything competitive it'll be
more casual stuff even play strategy
games even even doom is kind of pushing
it in terms of like cuz you need fast
which yeah that's the thing
but that is the title that they're
leading I know they have a lot of you've
got the B's to use doom as your launch
blast what
I'm like oh okay well there show me so I
want I want to channel a little bit of
because I when I kid when I was driving
down to San Diego my first one of the
first people was these two and then one
other person that I'm message to see who
was here and abang eath underneath from
what I work who as we were saying
earlier is already incredibly
opinionated about everything but he's
here Aaron says no to everything
everybody else is
he's probably loved this is this is
popular no stupid but he's also he is
back he is a self-proclaimed gamer
though so I wanted to hear what those
contrarian opinions are in the context
of a gamer and he actually was like he's
he's looking forward to it but at the
same time he also like you said hates it
he hates it because these would never
work the way that I feel is that good
the way that I feel as that GUI is over
promising so that when they
under-deliver yeah it's still okay
they're shooting for the stuff they're
shooting for the Sun but reaching the
stars because 4k 60 on the kinds of
internet the internet connection in this
very Airbnb you probably can't even
match that not even close I just I guess
I'm wondering what if they here's the
thing what if they do pull it off
because think about it how much like my
Falcon Northwest aqui oh my is a five
thousand dollar gaming rig I haven't
heard that brand name in a long time
dude like my my gaming rig is BS like
it's it's crazy it's gorgeous and it's
expensive
what is if they do pull it off what's
gonna happen to the hardware market cuz
this pretty much promises that you can
play whatever game you want on an iPad
on your current laptop you won't need
new hardware to play the best titles
like if you if you factor in how much
money you need to spend even to build
your own really powerful gaming computer
yep and this thing let's assume it's
priced at twenty bucks a month how much
time I mean fine it's like how many
years would you need and by the time
those years pass you and I already need
to upgrade your your graphics card or
this or that you don't have to worry
about the hardware anymore
but this is the way the world is going
in general exactly like is not even just
gaming in general everything is going to
eventually become a dumb terminal and
everything will be done in the cloud 5
G's gonna enable that as well so are ya
like so this is so so that's the reason
why I'm like what's gonna happen to the
companies that pull an apple you're
gonna have to figure that crap again
so the question is what happens if they
pull it off so do you think our so our
consoles in trouble speaking as a
PlayStation guy that's that that's
terrifying to me it would depend on
they're all coming out with their own
services as well for this like they're
not dumb they see that that's the future
they're all doing it it's a question of
who can get to it fastest and we do with
the bat and who's got the infrastructure
like right now I don't think Sony or
Microsoft have it well Microsoft because
they know they have a sure and they have
like but right now that three companies
that have that capability are literally
Google Microsoft and Amazon right these
are the three companies that are capable
of pulling this off yeah pardon and for
people to actually take the Xbox serious
now yeah fair so what where do you land
on sort of the there was that whole part
the integration with YouTube Mike did I
feel like this is why I keep coming back
to you like this is I don't I still
don't think this is for hardcore gamers
I don't this is for casual gamers
because they literally have built into
it Google assistant to so be to read
yeah to read where you are in the game
come on but it's probably what a Google
did anyway listen it's a good way to
convert people yeah it is it's a good
way to add value to their service yeah
that Xbox that Microsoft doesn't have
and if you think about it like even
needs to save all these doings doesn't
have a market when compared to twitch
who owns twitch Amazon right and so I
think that it's a genius move like
they're they're they're giving you an
ecosystem around gaming yeah whereas in
twitch all you do a stream like yeah it
doesn't connect your what connects and
sure but it's not one thing that talks
to the other directly and like if you
own all these things it's an even better
way to make youtube more important to
make the Google assistant more important
yeah
again I'm
bear in mind what I'm saying I am saying
that if they do pull this off
holy okay like if they pull it off if
they can actually it's you're not gonna
be 4k 60 it's not not unless you're
already a hardcore game at Lee's pub gee
like right hours a day no yeah no no I
get it but think about what YouTube was
five years ago you know think about what
Spotify we were having this conversation
in the car
how long did it take Spotify to
literally take over everything true how
long did it take all these seriously you
know what you know what one of the main
moves spot if I did and YouTube did to
be that free yeah they do free option
yeah free so I never think about it
what's the biggest problem with the
switch you can't do trials yeah you
either pay or you don't
you can return you can return in the
case of if you bought the the hardware
but if you if you did downloading you
can't and so if they come up with a
freemium server okay and this is my
other concern my biggest problem is when
you get titles like like doom and all
these hardcore gaming titles that's all
great the problem is when you get the
game lofts and you know the other
services
that'll literally pour in app purchases
on you like crazy for you to play
asphalt right that is like oh if Google
can control that part which Nintendo has
started controlling right now if they
can control that part I think it's gonna
work I think they're just gonna want to
cut of it and they're gonna allow it
okay so final question on here since
we're keeping this fairly snappy could
Apple do something like this of course
like do you really think that they would
have the licenses for actual like big
triple a title publishers not just that
how many of these gaming companies or
just Apple always been behind in the
gaming room yeah they always have nobody
makes for Mac yeah exactly
no but they've they also have the
infrastructure if you think about it
yeah and this could be a way for them to
make games work on that
[Laughter]
oh no wait a minute what do you want it
what do you mean this could be a way can
you use Chrome on your Mac this pretty
much will turn every Mac into a game
maybe at that point it helps them to but
I don't know I don't think they care
they don't they never really cared about
the gaming I don't think it's a priority
thing to think about it is Apple has
literally they're launching they have
been sitting on the laurels
yes but Apple has been sitting on the
laurels of the iPhone for the longest
time and now they've realized that can't
be 60% of their income they need to
diversify into different things which is
the reason we've got that streaming
service which is hilarious I report on
the daily today it's like oh yeah
so right now a Netflix CEO just came on
record to say that he won't be the
Netflix won't be on the Apple streaming
service that nobody has announced yet
right
nice nice yeah I mean I don't know they
could do it
I think but like I don't think they will
right I don't think the thing about it
is in the case of Google services it
doesn't fit their their ethos the reason
why I think that Google can do it is
because if you think about it when
Google Maps launched it took companies
like even the Hollis $300 Chromebook
running stadia
Wow and so think about this Google is
one of those companies that can launch
something like Google Maps and have cars
drive around and do Street View and not
make any money out of it only because
they want you to feel that YouTube as a
tool up to the point where the term
became a verb how did they beat Yahoo
and all these other search engines at
their time they literally did it by
dominating everything even at a loss
there's another company that's like that
that's called Amazon Amazon whole thing
exactly for Google it's not about the
short term you know games or whatever
they literally just want to dominate
okay they have so much cash so we need
somebody in that rooms like what do we
spend on data server out in the so my my
impression will be if they can pull it
off
oh wow this is gonna be really cool this
is gonna be really cool I try to think
about all of us parents that will need
to bar
any more gaming consoles going forward
you're gonna spend 60 I'm saying 60
bucks a month yeah it might cost one
alright there's gonna be cost of a game
okay I guess yeah I think that or maybe
a little less okay 95 which is the same
as Spotify Spotify as literally dollars
no no no show up Spotify launched that
cost the same as a CD yes one CD a month
right one city a month yeah and I think
even like Gamefly back in the day like
all those kinds of services that were
like online online that's what I'm
thinking of more than game flight but
same concept yeah they all do the same
thing no okay this is why I came down
see this is so much better thank you for
doing this fine all right
exactly apparently California's can't
drive in the rain anyway before I get
into that apparently it's okay
in any case that'll about do it on that
note thank you so much for listening to
