could FaceTime with all your friends
that have iPhones I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and these are some video
calling apps that you can use on your
Android smartphone video calling isn't
particularly new in fact it's been
around for decades and other video
calling applications exist at before
Apple broke into the space but FaceTime
is what truly put it on the map for
mobile devices the problem is Apple's
video calling service much like
iMessages is proprietary and only
available from other Apple devices ipods
iphones ipads and Macs this has created
a barrier between iOS and non ILS users
who want a video call each other but
it's more of a speed bump than anything
else now practically every smartphone
comes with the ability to video call to
some degree which has led to its push
into a mainstream form of communication
if you're on android there are several
third-party applications that allow you
to video chat with others quite easily
of those Skype is easily among the best
but we use that term quite loosely it's
the best due to how openly available the
service is it's available on most
operating systems desktop and mobile and
a lot of people are to use Skype like
most video chat applications you can
chat using text voice or video and if
you pay for a premium account you can do
video conferencing over all Skype is one
of the better offerings around
especially if your friends and family
use other mobile platforms tango is a
similar concept but unlike Skype tango
is packed with all sorts of goodies once
you log in and import some friends you
can jump straight into a text chat where
you can share all sorts of animated
emoticons most of which are unlocked
through in-app purchases you can also
play games with the people you're
chatting with but the video calling
features are pretty basic front and rear
facing camera toggle video on or off
audio mute switch and end call tango is
available across multiple platforms but
unlike Skype it's not available on Mac
or blackberry and despite having between
50 and 100 million installs on android
alone there seem to be far fewer of my
personal or work friends on and actively
using tango who is yet another
cross-platform video calling option and
at least based on my Facebook friends
there are even fewer people using ubu of
nearly a thousand of my Facebook friends
only five are using ubu but it's still
relatively popular with between 10 and
15
million installs from Google Play what
Ovoo brings to the table is
videoconferencing up to 12 people can
join the video chat for free
whereas Skype requires a premium account
outside that and syncing up with
Facebook friends lewis features are
pretty bare and it's also ad supported
lastly google has offered native video
calling for some time although it's been
largely overlooked and underused the old
Google Talk application offered video
and voice calling in-app and after
Google Plus launched you could join
ongoing hangouts from mobile at Google
i/o this year Google unveiled the
hangouts app which replaces Talk it will
come pre-installed on every Android
phone and it's available as a free
download for iOS devices and it works in
Chrome from almost any desktop OS you
can do one on one video calling or
full-fledged hangout with up to 10
people on call these of course are only
some of the most popular video calling
applications there are certainly no
shortage of options but picking an app
that is widely used and openly available
to as many users as possible is key when
choosing something like a video calling
