unveils a pair of solutions for wireless
entertainment the tone free yet first
resemble LG's previous efforts with a
pair of earbuds tucked away in a neck
band but removing those earbuds reveals
a truly wireless setup a trick we've
seen more frequently from several
manufacturers each earbud is completely
separate in that neck band will charge
your buds when they're stored an app on
the phone will help manage controls on
the earbuds and give users customization
options for alerts and notifications
it's a fun twist on a popular line of
wireless headphones you've probably seen
tone neck bands out in the wild and this
hardware helps solve the issue of where
to keep your case when you're wearing
the earbuds if the neck band doesn't
work with your fashion style LG will
also sell an optional charging cradle
you know what though we can go bigger
what about creating an entertainment
audio cloud floating around your head
the tone studio uses a combination of
four speakers and a haptic pad to create
an immersive audio environment and it
works surprisingly well yeah so these
are the the tone studio it's a series of
speakers and their vibration motors that
the haptic motors and I'm asking
questions and it's even difficult to
hear people replying it's almost like
they're creating like this little sound
bubble helmet around my head right now
so we've got speakers and haptic motors
yeah let's let's try something else
right at the base of the neck to this
delivery system does a phenomenal job of
drowning out surrounding noise the first
minute wearing them I wasn't completely
sure exactly how loud I was speaking but
have no illusions of this being a
discrete product anyone near you will be
able to hear exactly what you're
listening to for those situations you'll
want to pop out the cabled earbuds
following the b20 LG is riding high on
the audio fidelity kick including a 32
bit DAC to really drive your tunes and
the claim here is this hardware is
really low latency expect the tone free
to drop for around one hundred and fifty
dollars and the tone studio to hit
between two hundred and twenty and two
hundred and fifty dollars when these
headphones are released later this year
as always thanks so much for watching
we've got plenty more coming from the
CES show floor this year so make sure
you're subscribed to this channel to
catch all of our Las Vegas shenanigans
for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now
some gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram
and I will catch you all on the next
