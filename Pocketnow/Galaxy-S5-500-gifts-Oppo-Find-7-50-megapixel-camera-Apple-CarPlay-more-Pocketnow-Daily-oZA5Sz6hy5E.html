to take over your dashboard Oppo is
rumored to bring us a 50 megapixel
camera that's fine 7 and Samsung plans
to give you back five hundred dollars if
you buy their galaxy s5 I'm hai meri
beta and I apologize mr. teacher I
forgot my green screen at home this is
poking out daily Romania edition let's
go stay off with some official news as
this is kind of interesting Apple has
just announced carplay which is their
way of taking over your dashboard but
this is kind of different to what you
already saw from Android as in this
particular case you're not really
getting iOS on your dashboard what
you're getting is actually a way to
tether your iPhone and to control it
from your dashboard in a smarter way
that will allow you to interact with it
without having to actually use the phone
and put yourself in danger while driving
this is expected to be launched with iOS
7.1 at some point though we don't know
any specific dates will keep you posted
on this one and hopefully they do figure
it out better than Android now let's
talk about Nokia's famous tipster ethics
has just tweeted about a possible Nokia
martini and this is very interesting we
were expecting for more windows phone
hardware at mwc 2014 and we didn't get
any only Android hardware from Nokia and
now we're expecting for the company to
launch something with Windows Phone 8.1
very soon the martini is just a codename
we don't have any specifics but let's
hope that this vodka martini is shaped
not stirred and speaking of Windows
Phone let's talk about Android and this
is really interesting as we know that
windows show an eight point what is now
allowed to run on Android handsets but
it's kind of a pick one or the other you
have to delete Android to be able to run
Windows Phone but then we've got Oh Liam
from India called carbon which just
signed an agreement with Microsoft to
allow them to dual-boot windows phone on
Android handsets or vice versa we don't
really know the specifics but we know
that Windows Phone 8.1 Hans's from this
OEM will be launched in the next couple
of weeks and we are expecting for the
dual booting phones to reach retailers
by sometime this year this is going to
be really interesting let's see how that
goes
now moving over to android one of the
biggest disappointments of nwc 2014 is
that we were expecting 2k displays and
great camera improvements and we didn't
get any of that but the OEM that is
committed to bring us this innovation is
opal with their fine 7 we've heard the
teasers we know the company is going to
announce this phone on March 19th but
now we have this leak photograph and
according to the resolution which I'm
not going to detail here links to the
description for full details you will
see that this comes from a 50 megapixel
camera and even though the photo does
have a lot of problems obviously this is
a prototype phone so let's see if they
plan to bring us a Lumia type Android
handset which would make the spoon
actually very very compelling and
finally for the hot and very interesting
news of the day we've got Sampson now
announcing that they are going to be
bundling galaxy gifts with your purchase
of the galaxy s5 and the way this goes
is usually an unlock galaxy s cost you
six hundred fifty dollars but they're
giving you back five hundred dollars and
the way they're doing so as they're
giving you a full year of subscription
for Business Week six months for The
Wall Street Journal and even though
you're not getting Dropbox this time you
will be getting box.net 50 gigs for six
months aside from other goodies like
RunKeeper for a full year in premium
services linkedin evernote a lot of
services looks as though scripture for
full details but that leave this is a
question of the day would this make the
purchase of the galaxy s5 compelling to
you all these gifts because in my
particular case I will be honest with
you they're giving me back five hundred
dollars i'll probably not use every bit
of it but it's better than not getting
anything back from other OEMs like
apples so leave us a comment down below
