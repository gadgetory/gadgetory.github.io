is the device that wants to kick it off
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is the runcible an intelligent
object from mano when i first laid hands
on the runcible my first question was
what exactly are we dealing with here
mano mullet among other things an
electronic heirloom and when you think
about what the company is trying to do
civilize our relationship with
electronics that label makes sense also
it seems too large to be a wearable and
yet too small to be a smartphone but to
be clear this is a smartphone of a sort
it offers 3G 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity
it's got a camera and it supports voice
calls via bluetooth it runs on the
Firefox OS which mono Mo's because of
its customized ability the samples we
saw only ran demo loops but they helped
to visualize the possibilities antique
watch faces sure but also a fun new take
on navigation a rotary dial er for the
phone app and a camera that lets you
focus by twisting the device in midair
and it produces circular photos too if
you wanted to notifications will be
unconventional with the runcible it
won't constantly ping you with beeps
because it's meant to minimize alert
overload you'll be able to get calls and
messages from important people you
designate but less critical pings like
social alerts will get a broader
treatment like these blobs color coded
for Facebook Twitter and Instagram the
software also leverages the unique form
factor the digitizer extends all the way
across the bezel and even the housing
responds to touch so you can scroll and
swipe without your fingers blocking the
screen the runcible feels very
comfortable in the hand the polished
Riverstone analogy has been overused for
a while now but here it really applies
even without the wooden backs it's
obvious it was designed to evoke natural
objects you might find on a walk through
the woods and mono is planning a line of
accessories to protect and accentuate
the runcible from covers to chains all
using the single expansion port charging
is Wireless with available chargers in
cradle and cable formats using
magnetic attachments this is a very
early prototype runcible will be
available later this year for about the
same price as a high-end smartphone and
much about it remains to be seen for now
it serves as a reminder that between the
steadily stagnating handheld category
and the still uncertain world of
wearables there's still innovation at
this Expo of the future driven in part
by visions of the past for much more
from MWC subscribe to pocket now here on
YouTube and also be sure to visit us at

been michael fisher captain two phones
on twitter with Jaime Rivera on the
camera from Barcelona thanks for
watching stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
