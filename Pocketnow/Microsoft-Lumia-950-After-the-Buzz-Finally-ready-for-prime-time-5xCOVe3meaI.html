there's a flurry of commentary and after
a handful of videos we move on to the
next new thing
Halla phone ages is as important as that
initial review experience so let's do
something about this six months after
its release let's take a second look at
Microsoft's Lumia 950 on our full review
Microsoft's first branded flagship left
a lot to be desired expectations were
high following phones like the Lumia 930
and 1520 especially after such a long
hiatus in between phone releases the
result was a combination of a handful of
interesting features but uninspired
design and extremely raw software over
these last couple months using the 950
reinforces that this phone really isn't
a consumer facing device we've seen
significant improvements to Windows 10
on mobile but only after becoming a part
of the insider program to use early
release roms progress on official
releases has been agonizingly slow
especially for firmwares when carriers
are involved this newest software build
has been refreshingly snappy returning
us to some of the things we liked about
the best flavors of Windows Phone 8.1
though we still see a few
inconsistencies in the Windows Store the
occasional lag or catch as we're looking
for updates but at least it doesn't
force clothes on us like it used to
new innovating features like the iris
scanner are simply slower to use than
traditional fingerprint sensors and
require a more deliberate action in
bringing the phone up to your face
though was nice to use during a winter
trip to the East Coast while wearing
gloves continuum is an undeniably cool
feature turning your phone into a more
PC like setup when connected to a larger
display but we honestly haven't found
much opportunity to incorporate it into
our daily use or when traveling we still
need to pack up a proper laptop for
working on the go and the camera remains
one of this phones shining features the
Zeiss branded shooter has one of the
best sensor and lens Hardware
combinations we've ever used and
terrific microphones for recording video
but after a couple of updates this
camera app still produces overly
processed images with oddly warm white
balance and color tone disappointing as
it's not as easy to edit a raw file on
windows phones as it is on Android
and rounding out the rest of what this
phone offers we get mid-pack battery
life mid pack headphone performance dull
design and a five hundred and fifty
dollar unlocked price tag after that
initial review we had a hard time
recommending this as a general consumer
solution and while improved since then
we still have reservations about
offering this phone up as a mainstream
daily driver
Windows 10 offers one of the most
elegant interfaces available but viewed
as a total package the 950 still feels
like a test platform even more so in the
light the Lumia brand is likely an
evolutionary dead end
the next anticipated Microsoft branded
flagship probably to come from the
surface team what little DNA remained
from the former Nokia acquisition soon
to be bred out of this platform
it's a crazy fun phone to tinker with
and it shows off a lot of potential for
Microsoft's mobile future but we've been
seeing potential for years now we've yet
to see that potential fully realized as
