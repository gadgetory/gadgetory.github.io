seriously superior to touch ID the
Samsung Galaxy has a active goes
official even with the most silent
announcement ever and the oneplus 5 has
just adopted a couple of gorgeous color
options I'm Jaime Rivera and yes believe
it or not we are live every weekday at 9
p.m. Eastern
this is PocketNow daily the official
loose today begin with deals those of
you in the market for the Google pixel
it is currently available on sale which
is something that's really odd coming
from Google $125 off the regular pixel
up to $200 off the pixel excel and
believe it or not you are getting a free
daydream viewer as well I think that
these deals are actually very good
though consider there are new pixels
coming out very soon and philosophy that
didn't like the fact of the oneplus 5
only came in a few color options as of
tomorrow it will be available in soft
gold that's the six gig 64 gigabytes
storage option and then if you go for
the slate gray you have the option of 8
gigabytes of RAM 120 storage one plus I
I can't wait to get my unit thank you
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy s8
active for those of you that have been
following the rumors well we've been
covering it for weeks it now goes
official but in the most silent way
possible so as of tomorrow you're able
to preorder this device for crazy $850
you will not be getting the Infinity
curve display but it will have the 18
point 5 by 9 aspect ratio in addition to
pretty much all the specification of the
galaxy has 8 with the added bonus of
obviously a rugged phone that also
includes a large four thousand milliamp
hour battery you can learn more in the
description it's currently going to be
only an exclusive for AT&amp;amp;T but
apparently that's not going to last for
long which is actually good news stay
tuned and believe it or not even though
we haven't really talked about the
iPhone 7s or 7s plus like at all because
we've been covering the rumors of the
iPhone 8 as of today we've got some
leaked images of the possible iPhone 7s
plus with tally what looks to be a glass
back in addition to glossy sides the
dual cameras that we've seen then then
in the front the bezel look kind of
weird I'm not exactly sure if this is
really an iPhone this could just be some
that somebody came up with but
regardless if this is the true iPhone 7s
or 7s plus I would love to know what you
think about in the comments and finally
the very interesting rumor should they
have to do again with the iPhone 8
mainly because well we've got more
information from the whole firmware from
the home pod and first of all let's talk
about the Apple TV of the future
apparently it's going to come with 4k
and HDR video which is great but in the
case of the iPhone AIDS apparently that
whole Pro ID that face to unlock feature
is going to be so cool that the phone
will be able to be unlocked even while
resting on a table meaning you won't
really need to get close to the phone
put it to your face for it to unlock
which is far superior to anything that
we've seen from any other company when
it comes to the iris scanner all this
makes a lot of sense and it sounds cool
but it leads me to the question today
tell me something do you join me in
feeling that that's kind of creepy like
you know the phone's on a table I don't
necessarily want it to unlock but it
will if it just the text that I'm around
in my case again I do find it creepy I
also find it cool but leave us a comment
down below with a pen of your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video is filmed
otherwise I'm out on comment
subscribe to our channel as well for
more videos like this one
they also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore to be better on Instagram it
highly data please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
hanging there again I thanks so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow 9 p.m.
