their luster in the past year or so
which has left plenty of room for
convertibles to rush in and fill the gap
today in Barcelona Huawei announced its
own contender in the convertible space
the mate book I'm Michael Fisher with
pocket now here at MWC 2016 with a quick
hands-on brought to you by D brand
Huawei uses a lot of names to describe
the made book design sleek pure
streamlined curvature and so on but at
its core this is a tablet a big one
made from Double Diamond cut aluminum
offered in two colors and built around a
big screen it's 12 inches with an IPS
LCD panel at 2160 by 1440 and a max
brightness of about 400 nits always says
this is a 10 millimeter bezel making for
an 84% screen to body ratio compared to
the iPad pro and surface pro for around
77% each despite the size this is a
fairly lightweight tablet 640 grams and
it's just 6.9 millimeters thick
well that makes for a very portable
device it also only leaves room for a
thirty three point seven watt hour
battery a little smaller than both Apple
and Microsoft's competition still
hallway says its display and circuit
optimization means this thing should be
able to offer 10 hours of typical usage
and Huawei says an eighth layer heat
conductive structure means that despite
the lack of fans this should run about
three degrees cooler than benchmark the
made book runs on Windows 10 either home
or professional your choice running on
an Intel processor core m3 m5 or m7
backed up by either four or eight gigs
of RAM and SSD storage ranging from 128
to 512 gigs dual mics should make for a
solid Cortana audio pickup while dual
Dolby audio speakers and a special noise
cancellation headset mean the other side
of the sound profile is solid to a
OneTouch fingerprint sensor and
one-click access to your mobile phone
hotspot and wireless storage features
round out the nice touches that Huawei
has thrown in here and it wouldn't be a
convertible without the keyboard it's a
spill resistant detachable folio case
with a pin connector and 1.5 millimeters
of key travel with angle settings of
either 67 or 52 degrees
this is Huawei's big announcement for
MWC so there are two more things the
mate pen is an active stylus with an
elastomer tip and over 2000 levels of
pressure sensitivity and it also packs a
projector remote and a laser pointer
because of course it does and to
accommodate all the ports a 7 millimeter
tablet can't
there's the mate dock adapter with
leather folio to match the 4 available
keyboard colors the huawei mate book
will range from $6.99 to $15.99
depending on processor and memory
loadout and of course the accessories as
usual will run you extra no official
word on an exact release date but Huawei
tells us this device will be coming to
the US when that happens
fans of convertibles will want to be on
the lookout pocket now's MWC 2016
