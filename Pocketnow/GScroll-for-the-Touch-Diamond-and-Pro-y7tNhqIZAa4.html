pocketnow.com and this is part 2 showing
off the new software from a software
company called mobile SRC they're new in
the windows mobile world this new piece
of software called G scroll will work
with the HTC touch diamond the HTC touch
pro the fuse the touch pro and Verizon
Sprint and pretty much every other
variant of the touch of diamonds and
touch pro that exist and there are a lot
of them right now now what this
application does it's actually like a
utility really is it takes advantage of
the capacitive touch area down here
below the screen now by capacitive I
mean that you don't actually have to
push on the buttons with pressure to
make a key press be registered now out
of the box the HTC touch diamond touch
pro really doesn't take advantage of
this very much the only place that you
can use the capacitive touch panel is
when you're scrolling through a picture
you can run your finger around the ring
around the d-pad but this program that
i'm about to show you turns up the
functionality on this area hugely ok so
really we're talking about three pieces
of functionality then i'm going to go
over here to having to do with scrolling
and one having to do with program
launching so here we are in the in the
program's menu and of course i can
scroll around by clicking and dragging
my finger on the screen or now with g
scroll I can actually rub my finger
along the capacitive area and you can
see it move on the screen and I can do
that on either side I can do it up or
down and I can also do it side to side
so it kind of acts as a really quick way
to move around around on the icons kind
of like a d-pad the only con I hear see
here is that the sensitivity isn't that
great so if you scroll one time it goes
down one icon I would like to see future
versions of G scroll allow you to change
the sensitivity on that now this really
comes in handy when you're in a pocket
internet explorer for example so let's
go to pocket now mobile and I'll show
you what it's like using g scroll to
scroll around on a long webpage ok so
here we are and i want to scroll down
the page and just like the program's I
can you know do that with my finger but
instead i'm going to run my finger down
and you can see it scrolled down here
like so now now like I said it's pretty
useful though I wish the sensitivity was
adjustable the other thing you can do
with G scroll that has to do with
scrolling is actually use the XYZ axis
so you can tell the device this way this
way or this way to scroll around the way
you do this is you have to enable the
feature by double tapping your finger
gently on the in the center of the d-pad
ok so I've got the 3d esque scrolling
enabled and watch what happens i tilt
the device it Scrolls down a little bit
i tilted some more I i tolt it all the
way and it Scrolls down all the way I
tilted back and then it goes up is this
useful I'm not too sure the problem with
this is that if you want to scroll down
a lot you have to kind of tilt the
screen away from your face and that kind
of changes the viewing angle you may not
be able to see the screen where I see
this being useful is if you want to
scroll down just a little bit so you
would kind of just inch it up a little
bit inch it up a little bit and if
you're walking down the street and
you're trying to scroll down without you
know using two hands I think this may be
a good way to to do that though again I
wish there were some options on
sensitivity and to turn off this
function if it's annoying you like it is
me right now you tap on the center
button and it turns off now the other
piece of functionality that I want to
talk about is the the program launching
so now instead of just these four
buttons to work with we have four
programmable capacitive buttons so I've
set the home button to open up messaging
if I double tap it so watch this and
there's messaging I've set the call
start button to open up the calculator
and there comes the calculator very very
useful that functionality especially
because out of the box the touch diamond
touch pro really don't have that many
customizable hardware buttons so let me
show you what this all looks like in the
settings and how you actually configure
the different things so I'm going to go
into settings and system and G scroll so
here we have tap and tilt mode which is
the one where you double tap on the
center and you tilt the device around
like this and this to scroll around and
there are a lot of options here that
determine when the tappan tilt mode
actually works so sometimes it will work
when the scroll
bars are present or when there are no
scroll bars present so you really want
to read the manual and the same applies
down here for panel swipe mode you can
turn it off or you can have it work
conditionally so look at the manual for
that and then we have the quick launch
interface which is really easy to use so
if i want to make the back button be set
to a program i click set and i will get
a list of programs and I can move down
the program list and say I want Teeter
to start when I double tap the back
button so i click ok and if i double tap
the back button here comes to eater so
overall I think geez scroll is a pretty
good program on the right track that's
kind of half-baked there were times when
I had to consult the user manual just to
understand what the settings meant and
really in a good program there's there's
help built in there are ways to know
what it means when it says send scroll
only or send direction Keys only I
really don't understand what this means
simultaneously the sensitivity wasn't
that great in some programs and I always
have trouble enabling and disabling some
of these modes to get it to work right
fortunately the program is very cheap
that's four dollars and ninety-nine
cents you can get it at mobile SRC com I
really like it for the the functionality
of the program launching and also for
scrolling around with the the touchpad I
think that really makes it well worth
the 499 but again it does need some work
in the next version and i hope the
developer is working diligently on that
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
