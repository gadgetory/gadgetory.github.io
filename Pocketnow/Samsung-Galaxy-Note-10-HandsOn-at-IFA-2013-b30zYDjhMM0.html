and it's the last product we're looking
at tonight it's the samsung galaxy note
10.1 2014 edition is like in the car
business with in 2013 but we're looking
at the 2014 model let's see what it
brings to the table the first and most
important thing Samsung emphasized was
the screen we have obviously a 10.1 inch
screen but the resolution is the same as
on the Nexus 10 we got a 2560 by 1600
resolution and believe me the screen is
good now I cannot compare it with a
nexus 10 unfortunately I don't have it
with me but we'll have more coverage on
this when we get review units and we
have a comparison now in terms of
internal specifications it's pretty much
safe to say that the note 10.1 2014
edition has about the same specs as the
samsung galaxy note 3 also announced
today which means the same Exynos 5 octa
processor it's got the same 3 gigabytes
of RAM which is a first for a tablet on
the market
and also since we're at the back we're
looking at the same finishing touch and
I should probably rotated the normal way
it's the same letter with the same
stitching and the see it the same good
feel in the hand now since we wrapped up
here we have an arrow blaster right
there plus a volume rocker for volume up
volume down your normal power on / sleep
button on the left we have a speaker as
well as on the right on the opposite
side right there is where your S Pen
will play but we'll get back to the S
Pen just in a bit we have a microSD
expansion slot we have a micro sim card
slot and on the bottom we have the micro
USB syncing and charging slot first on
the front we have the regular by now
compulsory sense and home button flanked
by the menu and the back button which
are positive sense and branding action
going on at the top webcam and some
sensors and since we mentioned the s-pen
the functionality is the same like the
one on the note 3 for a detailed look we
encourage you to see the note 3 video
but just as a glance the dot the circle
and the box are also present here and
we'll try to see if we can capture the
dot is right there and when you see that
press the button you touch the screen
and there you go you can select your
action and in this case we're selecting
the action memo see Samsung Knox is a
first on a tablet it was launched with
the Samsung Galaxy s4 and it will be
included out of the box with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 a tongue twister
which is basically a sandbox a place
where you do stuff on your tablet which
remains within that space and it does
not affect your other part the public
part or the park which could be accessed
exiting Knox is one step away and you
are now hackable thank you very much for
watching it's been a long day and we
have plenty more to come and it's hot in
here I've been a tougher bucket now
Michael Fisher behind the camera thank
you very much for watching stay tuned to
much much much more Aoife videos from us
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
