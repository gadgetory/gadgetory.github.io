launch the LGB 30 and LG g71 to a CEO
shines that we should wait to hear on
the oneplus replied price tag and
Microsoft celebrates its boldest surface
Pro launch ever I'm high memory that I'm
reporting from beautiful what the meta
city this is firing out daily the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for one of
our favorite smartphones at the moment
the huawei mate nine continues to be at
that list incredible power incredible
features just about everything you would
really want in a smartphone and it's
currently for $380 on Best Buy but bear
in mind these are refurbished units
still for 380 bucks that's I mean you
still get the warranty and since we're
talking warranty LG has just done
something interesting
the company has silently announced that
well now your warranty for the g6 is
extended it descended for another year
now bear in mind this is the typical
warranty we're sure if you shatter your
display and absolutely everything else
those things are not covered but then
again if anything should go wrong with
your phone that's part of a
manufacturing problem or whatever you
can claim your warranty for two years
but you have to follow a procedure
that's in the link in the description
now it's time to spotlight over to
Microsoft if the company's surface
laptop and surface pro the new one are
pretty much official as of today the
company is celebrating the fact that
it's its boldest launch ever 25
countries at the same time and yeah both
of these products are extremely
compelling and everything except their
price tags but still for those of you
that are in the market for a pure
Microsoft experience that's the way to
go now let's talk about the one plus
five as there's been a ton of
speculation that this phone will
actually be more expensive and it's gun
more expensive over time from the $300
to the oneplus one to the current 439 of
the 1 plus 3 t people have speculated
that it might go over $500 because of
the new dual camera design but the
company CEO has insisted wait for the
event on June 20th I am waiting for the
event Carl and finally the very hot news
they have to do with other speculation
that have to do with the
deedy 30 &amp;amp; LGG 7 apparently LG wants to
get these phones out early as early as
August for the be 30 as early as January
for the g7 and it makes a lot of sense
as the Galaxy Note 8 is going to make a
big splash later the iPhone NEX will do
as well so Argus would be a good time
frame and then in the case of the g7
it's moving back to its earlier launch
frames of CES or during those dates
which makes a lot of sense I feel that
the beat 30 is a lot of a promise mainly
with everything we got with the V 20
that phone was freaking awesome but it
leads me to the question of the day are
you looking out for the LG v 30 is that
something that you're considering
because in my case oh my god if they
keep that design of the g6 with a V 30
yes definitely but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
