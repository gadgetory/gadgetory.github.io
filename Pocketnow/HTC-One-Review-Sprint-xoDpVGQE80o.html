unlimited data and voice odds are good
you've looked at spread but an unlimited
plan as only as good as the smartphone
that gives you access to it so is HTC's
newest flagship a good match for the now
Network let's find out I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
video review of the HTC One on Sprint
we've talked about the hardware on the
HTC One before in our review of the
European version and our comparison
videos follow us on social media and
subscribe here on youtube so you don't
miss those the one features stunning
build quality with an all-aluminum
construction broken up only by
strategically placed injected
polycarbonate that helps break up the
monotony of the back cover around front
the precision machined holes for the
boom sound speakers and the beveled edge
around the display contribute further to
the ones distinctive look that
distinctiveness translates to the feel
in hand as well a feel you can't really
get at the retail store when the phone
is tethered to a post the 9.3 millimeter
thick center section butts up nicely
against your palm while the four
millimeter thick edges fool your fingers
into thinking the one is thinner than it
actually is the weight is perfect at 143
grams neither too heavy nor too light
and the aluminum body is often cool to
the touch we're a little worried about
how well the metal will hold up to wear
and tear that chamfered edge dents
pretty easily but the deluxe look and
feel is well worth it if you're into
hardware aesthetics it's all held
together by the 1080p s LCD 3 display
which at 4.7 inches kicks out an
absurdly high 468 pixels per inch the
pixel density the excellent colors deep
blacks and outstanding sidon visibility
make this the best screen available on
Sprint right now the 5 inch Sam OLED
screen on the forthcoming Galaxy s4 will
give it a run for its money but to our
eye the differences are slight enough
that this shouldn't be your deciding
factor if you're considering both phones
the software running on that display is
Sense 5 the new HTC skin running atop
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean our demo unit
was a pre-production model with a very
few minor bugs
but HTC and Sprint informed us those
would be ironed out in the release
devices since five changes a lot about
the stock Android look and feel but
unlike previous versions of sense it
adds to the experience rather than
detracting from it colors are muted and
used judiciously classy grays and blacks
dominate the flat and low Chrome widgets
and the screen real estate is used
intelligently for the most part the care
that HTC took in designing its software
can easily be seen in apps like the
dialer or the messaging app the latter
of which is almost magazine like in its
clean easy-to-read layout you have to
get used to scrolling which is less
continuous and more page-by-page and
there are touches that you'll either
love or love to hate like blink feed the
social media and news scroller is a lot
like Flipboard and while it's a pretty
experience it's also slower to load and
tougher to read than just using the
stock Twitter or Facebook apps and its
aggressive permanent positioning on the
leftmost homescreen is a little
overbearing we understand why HTC did it
and blinkfeed
is a pretty cool feature but it's not
the grand slam the rest of the
experiences at least not yet
overall the HTC one's software build is
beautiful useful and responsive thanks
in no small part to the 2 gigs of RAM
and that speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
CPU every corner of the UI is fluid and
speedy it's not until you get over to
the network side that things start to
slow down a little bit we tested the HTC
One on Sprint's 3g and 4g LTE networks
in and around the Greater Boston area
over a period of seven days speeds over
3G CDMA were pretty dismal while speeds
over LTE were about average for Boston
area 4G connections while outdoor
coverage kept pace with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
indoor coverage didn't the Sprint's
version of the HTC One is only equipped
for LTE at 1900 megahertz which makes
sense because right now the only
spectrum block on which Sprint has
deployed LTE is 1900 that higher
frequency means indoor coverage suffers
and the one frequently Waffles back and
forth between 3G and 4G inside that
might have contributed to a bit of
battery
drain on our unit though the embedded
2300 milliamp hour lipo did generally
get us through more than a full day of
moderate use Sprint has announced plans
to deploy LTE on its 800 megahertz
Holdings next year but the one in its
current form won't be able to take
advantage of that so if you're buying
for the long term you'll have to be okay
with the one being a little harder of
hearing in the reception department then
smartphones of 2014 are likely to be
fortunately it's eight or 2.11 AC
compatibility means it's screams on
Wi-Fi networks using that technology
getting back to more conventional
testing there's some good news the one
is a very solid performer in the phone
call department callers said we sounded
very clear compared to other phones and
even in noisy environments we could
still hold a conversation with no
problem though callers did say they
could make out more background noise
when we rolled down the window in a
speeding car for example
similarly in loudspeaker mode callers
said they could tell we were on a
speakerphone but that the effect wasn't
bad on our end the earpiece delivered
rich nuanced and plenty loud sound and
that effect only grew more pronounced
when switching over to speakerphone mode
whether it's phone calls YouTube or
Netflix watching or streaming music on
Spotify the combination of Beats Audio
front firing speakers and the amplifier
driven boom sound technology gives the
HTC One almost unreal audio performance
if you're planning on using your
unlimited data plan to stream media the
HTC One offers the best audio experience
available from a sprint smartphone
there's candy for the eyes here too in
the ones ultra pixel camera we've talked
extensively about the ones oversized
pixels and how it's shooter compares to
other devices so we won't retread our
steps here in brief the HTC One delivers
photos that you'll be happy to share on
social media and via MMS and given the
right lighting it's actually capable of
some really beautiful photos at least in
terms of smartphone photography its
colors are a little warm and the four
megapixel resolution means you can't
zoom in on the photos too far after the
fact but it does incredibly well in
low-light scenarios keeping pace with
the king of dim room photography the
Lumia 920 that combined with good video
performance cool
innovations like Zoe and an immersive
gallery make the ones camera a solid
performer worthy of praise despite our
reservations about its lower resolution
sprints HTC One isn't perfect its lack
of a removable battery and no expandable
memory or a 64 gigabyte option means
some users might feel a little
constrained also Sprint's 4G build-out
is still in its early stages so many
users will be stuck on 3G as they wait
for big yellow to catch up but those
Network realities will affect any Sprint
customers and the one is certainly not
the first phone in history to lack
Hardware customization options the
bottom line is this if you're shopping
for an Android smartphone on Sprint
you're not going to find a device with
more beautiful hardware or software
design the forthcoming Galaxy s4 will
definitely give the one a run for its
money in terms of specs but it's not
bringing all that much new to the table
compared to the earlier Galaxy s3
you'll have to wait for our full review
on the Galaxy s4 for more but if you're
in the market right now for a premium
Android experience on one of the
nation's last remaining unlimited
carriers or you're an existing sprint
customer curious about what the luxury
Evo line has evolved into the HTC One is
a perfect fit we give it an eight point
eight out of ten for more on the spread

impressions and benchmark scores and a
whole lot more see our full review at
