in our last video we unboxed the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus in this video we're going
to show you the hardware just a quick
walk around of the device so you can see
what you can expect on the phone itself
let's go take a look alright so let's
take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
the GSM version first of all we've got
this protector that wraps all the way
actually there's two pieces one for the
back which will take that off have some
instructions and then one on the front
go ahead and take that off now the first
thing you'll notice is this is just a
very slightly curved screen you can
barely even see it the curve happens
about here and it slides through to the
bottom and then the back of the phone
looks relatively flat though there's a
little bit of curve to it up on the
front we've got a speaker right there we
also have our looks like some of our
sensors and our front-facing camera
nothing else at all on the front of the
phone just that very simple very elegant
looking over on the back on the top
there's nothing there
over on the side we have our power
button and our three gold dots for power
charging in supported accessories on the
bottom we've got our headphone jack one
microphone and our micro USB port over
on the other side we have our volume
rocker so just very simple very elegant
over on the back we have our nice
textured backplate you can hear that
texture there Google and Samsung
branding
speaker down here on the bottom and then
up at the top we've got our camera with
flash let's go ahead and take the back
off now this is kind of interesting it
has a uphe'll off effect this is plastic
by the way there's a little bit of
texture to this so it looks like we
might have some componentry inside but
that might just be heat spreaders or
whatnot set that aside and
we've got our place for our battery
there is no place for a microSD card yes
that's right a micro sd card let's go
ahead and put our battery in with the
contacts up the sim looks to be a full
size sim now this is a t-mobile SIM so
we'll just go ahead and slide that in
according to its picture now back people
have said is kind of tricky to get on
you put the the bottom in and then start
to work it to down and up and all the
way back up to the top and make sure it
all pops in place nice and tight looks
like that went back on pretty well so
there you go the device now with plenty
of fingerprints on the screen feels
really good in hand it's not too large
power button is right underneath my
index finger the volume up and down is
right here under my thumb so very nice
it feels good it's lightweight in hand
and very very thin compare that over
here to the g2 that I've been using you
can see the device is a bit longer it's
also a bit wider and of course we look
at thickness here you can see that the
the g2 is quite a bit thicker of course
the g2 has a slide-out keyboard where
the Galaxy Nexus does not so there you
go the Galaxy Nexus by Samsung all right
so that's the hardware that you're going
to get when you get your Samsung Galaxy
Nexus up next we're going to do a first
boot and show you what you can expect so
make sure you subscribe to the video
channel if you haven't done so already
so you don't miss out on that video
