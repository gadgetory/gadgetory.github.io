security concerns next bit and support
for the Robin Facebook is planning a
home video phone type of device and
Apple faces another class-action lawsuit
this one over FaceTime plus David retic
from Android police drops by to help us
unpack the camera comments from former
Google executive Vic Gundotra our
Android cameras really years behind the
iPhone we'll take a closer look at that
statement there's a lot to talk about so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode two six four of the PocketNow
weekly recorded August 3rd at 3 p.m.
Eastern this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and every sci-fi film had some kind of
home video phone we're finally realizing
that geeky dream I'm Juan Carlos back
now senior editor of pocketnow.com
blasting the signal from a beautiful day
in sunny Southern California joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong out on location what's going
on buddy boy are we excited I mean the
way into the mall I was supposed to be
at hotel but the way into this Durham I
was on the bus and but the mall is
actually the terminus of the bus route
and the PA is in this robotic voice says
we're finished thank you right now it's
like I was I was wearing my incom shirt
you need that that Tron voice end of
line you know I love it in just a bit
we're gonna be bringing David on I I
really want to dig in David's one of my
favorite I want to call him a tech
provocateur and some of his editorials
and his criticisms are just so
beautifully eviscerating for for a lot
of the tech audiences out there that I'm
really gonna enjoy discussing these
camera comments from mr. Gundotra
but before we get to the
point Jules would you be so kind as to
how to inform people is how they can get
in touch with us for the show
yeah sure indeed so you can do so by
getting on to your little Twitter app or
whatever you use with Twitter engage
another API thing and diva hashtag past
idea and weekly and typing the question
send it to their YouTube could be
another way that we could do it but the
chat has been very very very active and
can't really keep track of everything
they want so Twitter is the best way to
do things live if you can't make it live
if your aren't here right now then
podcast at pocketnow.com is the best way
to ask your questions and we can pile
them up and then it'll be a little note
back at the end of the show so podcast
at pocketnow.com hashtag key and weekly
all the better for you to tell us right
now beautiful and I'm we're already
getting some great questions in on that
PN weekly hash tag from Brandon from and
from Andrew Wallace fat produce is a
regular a Jif contributor the PocketNow
weekly so we've got some great questions
in there we will be jumping in as we get
closer to the end of the show just so
that we can chat all that fun stuff out
but um I think we need to chew through
the news we started a little bit later
and we definitely want to make sure that
David's a part of this conversation so
let's get through the top news topics of
the week I'm gonna take over this one
because Jules has like an army of small
children that are following him around
there's one of them this is the show
when tell part and now I'm going to be
silence Wow you tell me what's up with
this uh v30
yeah so kicking things off we've got the
LGV 30 we're gonna be producing actually
it's gonna go live later this afternoon
is sort of a a rumor roundup on the LGV
30 but one of the the big rumors coming
out is well we know we're saying goodbye
to the LGV 20s secondary ticker display
there is a little screen at the top of
your main screen you could dock it for
you could talk shortcuts there just have
a really fancy signature so everyone
knew is
phone and that's obviously gonna be
going away on a phone that's already
stretched and tall to make up for that
it seems like LG's gonna be delivering a
custom piece of software to have a
floating dock and this is definitely
something that LG has experimented with
in the past things like qslide apps so
it makes a lot of sense we're in terms
of rumors we're gonna put a pretty high
probability that LG's gonna have a
solution there I'll be curious to see if
it can really properly dock at the
bottom of the screen because having
really tall long skinny phones it's
sometimes a reach to get up to that
notification shade now moving on to
other fresh developments in hardware
news Facebook is rumored to be
developing a video chat device we've got
a post on this that actually performed
really well from Adrienne on
pocketnow.com and the sort of dummy
image that they've they've developed for
it it looks a lot like maybe something
that Amazon has already produced with
video capabilities just sort of a wedge
with a screen and a speaker on it but in
sort of doubling down on the current
entrenched user base with facebook
Messenger and facing more competition
from other outlets especially Amazon at
being a primary competitor there it
makes a lot of sense that Facebook would
be trying to develop something in that
arena and not going the phone route
because we all know how Facebook phones
turned out back in the day now shifting
gears over to Microsoft this was another
hot story because it's just such a
bizarre filing to read from Microsoft
that in in an absence of you know proper
first-party tablets you know not not
like the surface but you know some of
there's there other experimental like a
surface mini which never really saw the
light of day
we've got Microsoft potentially working
on a battery touch cover for the iPad
now Microsoft has an amazing track
record for sort of office accessories
keyboards and mice I'm using a Microsoft
Mouse and actually I'm using a Logitech
keyboard but I used to have one of those
really split awesome wide organ AMA
keyboards so this actually kind of makes
sense with that old-school Microsoft
hardware philosophy it's just I think
there is some disappointment from those
of us who have had our hearts broken by
Microsoft so many times that
they're willing to make accessories for
the iPad but we're not seeing any
development on you know windows for
phones or anything like that I mean we
actually don't want to break in with it
working oh my goodness so earlier on
today we found out in their Form 10-k
because they always file a new mission
statement or whatnot with all the assets
and whatever at the SEC and looking at
the mission and looking at their
overview of what their business is what
products they offer include all mentions
of mobility and phones so it's like what
what products did we offer well last
year they had the word phones in that
lineup and now it's just there's no
phones it's just other intelligent I
mean though phrase other intelligent
devices has been used in both 2016 and
2017 but it just seems like they're
relegating phones to the other to the
nether to the void so I mean yeah that
definitely has been sort of nutella's
initiative is turning Microsoft more
into a services company than a hardware
company and you just can't ignore the
success of Xbox and surface but any any
department that was sort of struggling
or not delivering or not blowing up
their part of the market it seems to
have gotten the ax and that again I mean
I'm sure we could still see some
movement on a potential windows mobile
device in the future but it's definitely
not a primary focus for this company
right now what is a primary focus for
Microsoft though and this is gonna be
some good news for surface fans out
there is they're gonna be introducing a
zero interest leasing program for
surface devices with 18 month upgrades
and this is something that I think makes
a lot of sense in the current market
we've sort of programmed consumers for
their phones to be working in sort of
one to three year time frames on how
they update devices and now surfaces are
starting to become that that's sort of
de facto mobility idea and this just
sort of gets consumers on board in a way
where you don't feel the pain of
dropping too large on your computer
every
time you need to upgrade it's a I think
awesome I mean you know even still pay
out the 24 months and then you own the
device too and there's also multiple
options for businesses is defense an
upscale downscale it's it's much more
convenient economical and ensures that
Microsoft has constant monthly flow well
and also it's treating hardware like
software like we expect significant
software updates every year and and now
I think that there's a there's an idea
of ecosystem where everything is getting
updated is this us yes actually yeah
absolutely
moving over to Motorola we've got some
news this is going to be disappointing
to some folks out there that the there
will be no shatter shield replacements
for the Moto z2 force this has been a
popular add-on for other companies like
a screen replacement for accidental
damage and the actually I'm just gonna
read from the full statement here our
apologies but we were mistaken about the
option to get a replacement liner so
there's there's a plastic liner on the
moto z2 which while he was pulling that
up so the door to turbo Qi was the first
one to have it the motors he force was
the next one and then he's the third
generation and we've been following on
because people didn't posting about just
all these scratches it scratches easily
and people are worried about okay what
can you do in order to fix the situation
and no Terrell initially told us that
okay so we're gonna have a consumer
version that's going to be improved and
we're also going to have the replacement
liners which is the top just the top
yeah you're gonna be fine that it cost
$29.99 and then they followed up with
another email and said oh sorry again we
screwed up we're not gonna do that
because no one was buying those
replacement - so I mean it just goes -
and they're actively pushing third party
screen protectors - which is kind of a
it's off well and that's an incomplete
solution especially when there are I
think some very some very fair concerns
over a phone
will not I mean it survives the big
singular event better you know dropping
your phone from a higher height having
it land on concrete something like that
your screens not going to shatter that
does a better job but when it doesn't
survive the daily sort of rough and
tumble abuse you know where you putting
your phone in a pocket with keys is no
longer a concern with Gorilla Glass but
it's a big concern if your phone and
phone screens made out of plastic this
is a disappointing step back when this
was a service that they offered for
previous moto shatter shield products so
I think again fairly this is something
that I hope Motorola will correct course
on if there is enough traction a part of
this is also just how many of these
phones are going to get sold and people
are making some pretty tough decisions
on what features they want and what
compromises they can live with now
another phone that's gonna be getting a
lot of press soon and we've only been
getting sort of unofficial renders and
some some really cute graphics depicting
what the general screen layouts gonna
look like there's a treasure trove of
Apple leaked iphone 8 info and this
includes things like the screen
resolution which is again this isn't
still properly confirmed nothing's
properly confirmed until Apple says it I
mean so basically it's sending out home
hard code to third-party developers for
them to work with a lot of it has
continued code for the devices that you
might interact with it definitely yeah
these are definitely a lot more on point
than just like you know regular rumors
that got filtered out through someone in
manufacturing but we will be seeing a a
higher resolution panel 24 36 by 11 25
so not quite quad HD but again Apple has
always had funky non-standard screen
resolutions so that's not too surprising
there we're gonna be getting tapped to
wake which is a feature that a lot of
Android phones have implemented to great
effect but no sign of touch ided which
might be a concern for some folks if
Apple really is gonna have to walk away
from touch ideas the security apparatus
for a lot of the services on the iPhone
instead going through
and just the from that there maybe
there's been code references to
something called pearl could be called
her ID and that may combine the face and
iris recognition the sensors that may go
into it could also be a authentication
for Apple pay because he also found that
corresponding to contactless payments so
someone else to watch out for definitely
and again that that's one of those
things that makes me nervous about Apple
implementing so many changes in in one
generation of iPhone but in other sort
of controversial Apple news Apple's
facing another class-action lawsuit this
time pointing to crippling of FaceTime
as owners of older iPhones made the
transition in software from iOS 6 there
was a mandatory iOS 7 update and that
did break some of the functionality of
FaceTime Apple has been trying to get a
judge to dismiss this class-action suit
and it seems like we've we've crossed
that threshold where this suit is going
to proceed it's not going to be thrown
out so now it's just going to be another
one of these sort of ongoing
conversations just what is a company's
responsibility to older products what is
a company's responsibility to their
consumers how should we be handling
things like updates we talked about the
sort of fracturing and fragmentation in
the Android land but there is also a
sense of feature fragmentation for iOS
you get sort of those core updates but
you might not always get the the best
individual feature updates from software
generation to generation and that is all
ultimately the course the gates from iOS
that you just can't get past 8 or 9 oh
absolutely well and I think it also I
mean this actually does in a really
roundabout way speak to Apple's success
as a software updating platform that
their consumers expect a certain level
of service and support well behind what
we've come to expect an Android land and
speaking of soft
oh yeah definitely and speaking of
software this is this is gonna be a
bummer for a lot of the enthusiasts in
our audience but official software
updates for the next bit Robin are done
the actual next bit tweet to clear up
some confusion although we're ending
customer support we will continue
software updates until February of 2018
as planned but this is this is talking
more about development so we're probably
looking at just whatever security
patches or bug fixes might be easy to
implement for the platform we're not
talking about any major or new
development moving forward for this and
I'll be really curious to see what
impact this has on this team which i
think is still operating as a cohesive
team under Razer and what that might
mean for future products there but it's
it's definitely gonna be disappointing
news if you were one of those folks who
went out there and we're ready to join
the experiment of trying something
different of using a Robin as your phone
there were some really great ideas there
the implementation still needed I think
a little work and they got stuck with a
bad chipset generation but there was a
lot of charm in what the Robin could do
so it's always sad when we see something
just come to a complete dead end and you
know what dead end for that was a better
segue than what I was gonna come up with
Jools it's like you do the news more
often than I do the the last bit of the
last headline that if this got a lot of
noise so what it was last year that we
we saw Amazon pull blue phones over
security potential security issues again
we see Amazon pulling some of their most
popular selling unlocked phones from
blue and again just some of these issues
that with the software that comes
pre-installed on the device potential
exploits potential holes Amazon is
trying to make sure that there is no
negative press surrounding this type of
direct-to-consumer sale they've really
been stepping up their game on marketing
and selling unlocked phones so anything
to do with privacy anything to do with
security they're gonna be reacting to
very aggressively we just had this post
updated so blue commented releasing a
statement
I believe yesterday afternoon retreading
its defense of the farm we're from
November the company is criticizing
media attention on Chinese servers and
insists that only basic information is
being collected excuse me the activity
has been more vigorously Johnson claims
that the activity has been more
vigorously concealed so this is this is
from crypto wire researcher Rian Johnson
is the one who was tracking what
information blue was was keeping tabs on
and then also sharing with these Chinese
servers there is another update blue has
commented on the Amazon sales stoppage
since November 2016 when the initial
privacy concern was reported blue
quickly remedied Amazon has been aware
of the aid ups at UPS and other
applications on our blue devices which
were deemed at the time by blue Amazon
and crypto wire suppose no further
security or privacy risk now almost a
year later the devices are still
behaving in the same way with standard
and basic data collection that pose no
security or privacy risk there has been
absolutely no new behavior or change in
any of our devices to trigger any
concern we expect Amazon to understand
this and quickly reinstate our devices
for sale and so I want to jump right in
on this one Jules the the the crypto
wire comments are a little above my
paygrade like I am NOT as well first on
some of these security concerns and
security threats um do we think Amazon
might be overreacting this is to protect
their own image as opposed and throwing
a manufacturer under the bus to make
sure they look like they're being the
responsible reseller I mean initially
back in November as part a said there
was some sort of violation or a breach
of agreement in terms of what features
they wanted food in that will the
firmware like reading data and all that
sort of get back to Chinese servers and
I didn't really you know it doesn't seem
like both of them are on the defense's
right now and they're both supporting
each other in this aim and they're
saying that nothing has rather approved
changes have already gone through
and wires seen them Google and seen them
or something you know and I mean trip
the wire has said since that they blew
does not speak on behalf of them so it's
just right it's all word he said she
said at this point first place you have
to address I think that's fair
so if there if someone is bringing up
concerns it absolutely is Amazon's not
only prerogative but I think it's their
responsibility to address those concerns
I also wonder if a part of this isn't
just exploit fatigue you know the number
of different threats that we're all
supposedly encountering on a daily basis
from Chinese hackers delivering Windows
malware to broad pawn to updates for
phones to it I Oh T devices that can be
zombified and used in DDoS attacks it's
it's a chain of trust that we have China
has a more lots use your all your data
you know part of its part of the
Communist you know frame of mind where
everything is easier you have I mean how
else are you gonna pay for all this
stuff Moberly you know
get through to mediate eat and all that
you know it takes a lot of data moving
back and forth the same time and they're
much more it's bleach out economy for
them whereas young you value more
privacy and it's that disconnect that we
haven't always been comfortable with
it's this relationship of hardware where
it's cheap and software that is also
cheap to maintain and Bend that is tying
us together still and we're just finding
ourselves at the crossroads of that well
and I think there's also become a
growing understanding that when you use
a free service you're the product but
Google Apple and you know entering into
that you know or you know a calendar
event and targeted advertising which
really was properly targeted like it
just clings on to your last
you know webpage search and basically
shows you wait for the next 90 million
day so I mean in exact science is don't
they yeah they do and what doesn't suck
though is catching all of the latest
news headlines on pocketnow.com make
sure you check out the site for all of
the the top mobility and tech stories of
the day in addition to Android police as
I see we are now joined by mr. David
Roddick I think he's he's muted and his
webcam is on he is here and an apologies
we started a little late so I know we we
wanted to bring you in at the half hour
and we're a couple minutes behind there
but thank you so much for joining us
this is a conversation I was really
excited to to be having with you this
week yeah thank you for having me on
glad to do it
absolutely okay so um first of all let's
just kind of sum up because this is one
of these sort of ios/android
grudge match kinds of conversations
where I feel there's a lot of emotion
behind statements when people have
picked a team and they're rooting for
their team and so IIIi am inclined to
disagree with mr. Gundotra but I also
really want to try and give him a fair
shake on what he means versus the exact
language of what he says so I'm gonna be
doing some interpreting I feel which may
or may not be fair but it was a when
when did he post this it was July 29th
in a facebook thread about photography
he's posting some adorable pictures of
his children people start asking about
cameras and he's making these
off-the-cuff remarks about how the DSLR
is dead the iPhone and image processing
this is the way of the future and if you
want to be in step with the future
apples ecosystem is going to be better
than Androids and if you don't mind
being a couple years behind that's why
you want to buy an Android camera over
an iPhone camera and just to start I was
really hoping that you could share like
what was your reaction when you saw a
former Google executive make this kind
of statement publicly on Facebook
well fix always been a pretty incendiary
guy that way I don't think
anybody would ever accuse the conductor
of not adequately voicing his opinions
even when he was at Google I mean you
know he was he was the face of Google+
he was the face big Google's big social
shift made it sound like that was the
direction the company was going in
period and that that was you know full
steam ahead
so he's always been very outspoken very
direct and I don't think it's at all out
of character for him to say something
like this and he was always a little
off-the-cuff too and I think in this
particular instance what I took away was
kind of just the generalizations that
were being made especially the whole two
to three years behind things that didn't
make any sense to me really on any level
I felt like he didn't really explain
that well if he had a cogent argument
for that point in particular I wasn't
seeing it I didn't understand what he
meant about the SLR I understand what he
means about how you know apples been
able to do the the wide lens and then
the long lens and integrate that in a
way to you know works really well and
you know produces good results and but
he seemed to be going off on a lot of
tangents and granted it wasn't like some
you know wasn't some official appearance
or statement or anything just talking
about what he thinks about smartphone
cameras and when you started talking
about how Google's gotten away from
computational photography I thought well
as Vic and really paying attention to
what's been going on with Google and
phones in the last year or so it doesn't
seem like it if that's the case you know
so I was I was but I felt like Vic maybe
a little bit out of touch maybe with
what's going on Android at this point
comparatively at least on the deeper
level and probably you know like a lot
of people is just enjoying the fact that
the iPhone offers that more integrated
experience and I think that a lot of
people eat up the brand message in the
marketing even people who are you know
high-level technology executives can can
really start to I think it sucked into
that not that's all marketing but I
think that really enters into some of
the kind of the feelings people
associate with Apple products about
integration completeness the value of
the the integrated ecosystem well and
especially from a company like Apple
where I think their only competitor in
terms of mind share would be Samsung the
only the only company that's really sort
of matching them reaching parity with
having a conversation with the consumer
that appeals to the emotional side of
purchasing one of these devices I mean
all of the various you know billboards
around Los Angeles you know shot on an
iPhone and you're like you made a photo
that you put on a billboard shot from a
phone and I think that's that's an easy
way to resonate with general consumers
and then also with people who are
probably more technologically inclined
to that message is gonna sink in really
effectively I I agree with that for sure
the billboards are no doubt Apple when
they came up with that idea it's a such
a simple idea to but it's so simple I
think now that nobody else can
appropriate it from them because they
look like copying oh you guys are just
copying apples you know I was talking
about this with somebody very recently
about how well why doesn't Google do
that with the pixel why don't they do
shot on pixel billboards and the reason
is probably because the marketing team
every time they somebody brings that up
like oh my god but it's so obvious
they're just copying Apple you know
nobody wants to be nobody wants their
marketing campaign to be oh we're
copying our biggest competitor that
doesn't feel great as a marketer but at
the same time it's a very effective
campaign and the images Apple puts up if
you're in the Bay Area for example they
change very frequently there's always
new pictures going up you know just to
keep catching people's eye and it works
and I think that's probably probably to
an extent to where the whole the DSLR is
dead argument comes from is you know the
idea oh well we can put an image from an
iPhone on a 50 foot billboard so you
know what uses a DSLR anymore obviously
and we can capture these beautiful
images on a smartphone so why do you
need the dedicated camera I didn't
they're putting arguments for the
dedicated camera still but the kind of
broader sentiment yeah that the
smartphones are replacing the DSLR and
dedicated cameras in a lot of respects I
mean I don't think you get any argument
from anybody about that it's been going
on for like seven it's been going on
since camera phones were a thing I mean
exactly so it's a it's it's a trend that
just keeps keeps emerging but and I
think it also creates those really fun
pockets you know the the smartphone is
the all-rounder immediate convenience
device doesn't mean that I ever want to
put away my mirrorless camera what
is gonna afford me more focus better
tools for content creation when I need
them in same thing with audio you know I
just did a review on a little audio
player like most phones are good enough
I'm listening to mp3s and podcasts like
that's fine and then I fire up some
flack files on a really nice pair of
headphones you're like man this isn't
this isn't good enough now but that's a
very you know focused like a very
singular use that I have to dedicate
time for specifically for that I wanted
to circle back and actually kind of
address a few of these because there's
like this four block paragraph from
Facebook and and he starts off and mr.
conductor starts off with this notion of
comparing open enclosed ecosystems as
how you can as how one can better
improve and evolve something like a
camera than the other and normally I
feel like that conversation is usually
weighted to the open ecosystem having
more competition which creates you know
better products faster as opposed to the
closed ecosystem where you only have
that singular perspective especially in
his point you know because he's
mentioned mentioning Samsung
specifically and this is a quote ever
wonder why a Samsung phone has a
confused and bewildering array of photo
options should I use the Samsung camera
or the Android camera Samsung gallery or
Google photos that to me starts to read
a little like sour grapes from someone
who didn't realize his social media
strategy with Google+ more than its I
think a fair accounting of what Samsung
looks like in in the market when we're
talking about photos and and social
media well it's not even correct because
the Android camera hasn't worked for
other phones for three years
no since around the time Vic left Google
it's it's again it's kind of one of
those things where yeah well maybe if
you say that way it kind of sounds like
oh it's confusing there's something
confusing about it there's one camera
app on a Samsung phone you open it the
camera opens Samsung's interface choices
are completely irrespective of anything
Google does with the Android I mean
Samsung have to do whatever they want
and the idea that Samsung is he also
goes on to talk about how well when when
manufacturers want to add these new
features and say to you know developers
obi-wan
feature well manufacturers have to wait
for Google to build an API and it's also
a lie it's not true Samsung can build
their own api's and they do there's a
Samsung
there's tons of Samsung API is out there
and now maybe for smaller manufacturers
it's a bigger bigger hurdle to get over
but it's never stopped Samsung well and
didn't wasn't that addressed
I feel like again I mean III mean to
parrot your point there that the VIX
seems that he's commenting on things as
he understood them past tense when he
was with Google but I really feel like
two years ago we got the camera to API
which even for smaller manufacturers
addressed a lot of these concerns moving
from phone to phone and having different
interfaces and having different Android
relying on that hardware in different
ways now I mean like one of the only
holy ounces like Sony doesn't support
raw capture through the camera to API
and I think that's it I think yeah yeah
the API is service to all of the
necessary controls that you would want
over a smart phone camera all the ones
that are meaningfully useful so yeah
again it's you're right it's not really
much of a point anymore it's Google has
done a lot to address these things over
time has taken time but I think they've
definitely made a lot of headway
especially in the imaging area if that's
the one area is gonna really point to
now here's one of the things that I want
to try I want to try and sort of hash
out from from Vic's perspective mr.
gündüz perspective and this is one of
the things that I've always had a
problem with in when we try and broach
these Android and iOS conversations and
people will make claims about how much
superior something like the iPhone
camera is and I want to counter with
something more along the lines of the
the main credit I will give an iPhone
camera is its familiarity and so like in
when I was shooting on DSLRs when I was
a hardcore Canon user I mean I'm a
reasonably good photographer but if you
were to just drop me in Nikon land I
would struggle to achieve the same kind
of output that I could organically get
to with my familiarity of a Canon camera
and I kind of feel like whenever people
are making these comparisons a lot of
them are confusing or conflating the
familiarity of using one type of of salu
as a poet and making that the quality
argument and do we think that maybe a
part of that might just be over the last
couple years he's now become wholly
familiar with iPhone cameras the iPhone
camera hasn't significantly changed ever
since the introduction of the idea that
maybe he is just more capable of
creating a good image on an iPhone not
because the camera is better but because
his familiarity with the tool is more
reinforced I think that maybe part of it
I think the other side of it for me is
on you know kind of just general
philosophy toward imaging I think among
Android manufacturers is a little
different than what Apple does I think
Google has done a good better job of
trying to you know reinforce the idea
that maybe maybe imaging should produce
more natural results even if HDR doesn't
always look very natural
you know let's try to at least make it
look like something that could look
natural whereas on the Samsung foam
processing can be very aggressive you
know I think that I think a lot of times
for people who are used to maybe using a
DSLR an Apple product may feel more
familiar and more in more the product
may feel more familiar and I think that
feels cleaner it feels like well if you
are going to edit it you know and you
want to do this thing so the things that
happen after the fact for people who are
really into photography maybe for
average people I don't think anybody
cares you know they're going to apply
their filters anyway regardless of what
phone they're capturing it's it and
that's whatever yeah I think there's
definitely an argument be made for the
the familiarity thing you know because
you know Samsung's camera interface is
if unless you can ignore all the visual
clutter which arguably is what I've
learned to do over the years I just
ignore all the buttons like the most of
them are totally useless they don't do
anything that's helpful you know and
there's all you just seen those where
the shutter button is and that you can
tap to focus you know that's as your big
tools so I think there's probably that
to an extent yeah the familiarity
argument is is a decent one and one that
I think Google is you know seems
cognizant of and their phones that
they're building in terms of just
keeping things very simple but if you're
going to again if Samsung
becomes the counterpoint then you know
it's it's it can be a different
discussion but I think that in the grand
scheme I don't know that most people
care very much I mean the end of the day
there's a shutter button you press the
shutter button it captures an image as a
viewfinder all camera phones are pretty
much the same that way you know they all
have that level of familiarity I mean
like I think the the tiny vocal minority
of people like me who do care about
those things are finding the solutions
that we need to feel like we're well
serviced in the market it it's rarely
like oh well I really wish I had this
feature and there's just no solution for
me to get that done it's I found it you
know like maybe it's a huawei camera
maybe it's an lg camera maybe it's a
third-party camera app but I I you know
I found it I cared enough to go out and
do that homework
I completely agree that I think most
people general consumers I think have an
expectation and this is also one of the
threes ins why I want to give Vic the
benefit of the doubt here is I think
your net your point on Google products
is kind of right spot-on perfect we're
the Nexus and pixel camera app has
definitely evolved over time but it's
managed to maintain a really consistent
experience for those times you might
want to fire up something like a
panorama or you might want to actively
toggle HDR as opposed to just letting
the camera make the decision for you
whereas I think if you were to go back
to like a galaxy s5 and track from the
s5 to the s8 you would be in a
completely different you know software
experience completely different
territory you know like if you updated
if you made that kind of update s6 to si
or s 5 to si you're learning a
completely new language just for
controlling some of those basics like
the first time I handed my s8 to my wife
she went to hit the shutter button and
it zoomed because she lingered just a
little bit and it flicked the shutter
button and that's now a new function and
that was like well I just missed this
shot of my toddler because I didn't know
that this was different that's that's a
fair point and changing things like that
I think is something that I think
manufacturers should be pretty pretty
careful
that some haven't been I remember when
Motorola changed something about zoom on
their cameras probably like jeez it must
been like three years ago it was very
unintuitive the way they did it and they
just like.he those sorts of things can't
even throw those of us who use lots of
phones off especially for a moment once
you figure it out but you can understand
how a regular consumer might immediately
get frustrated and get kind of upset if
those kinds of basic you know consistent
interactions aren't unfollowed across
different devices that said I think you
know moving from Samsung Samsung phone
yeah things change but I also feel like
it's always been kind of just kind of
had the interface that isn't very great
if that's a specific example um they
were gonna go with so right well I mean
and I think it should be I mean they're
the they're the top Android manufacturer
I feel like if we're gonna be making the
comparison it's probably the most likely
we're gonna be talking Apple V Samsung
but that's also I think why I think so
many other manufacturers have missed out
on opportunities to try and tell their
own story if you can't do shot on huawei
everyone's gonna go oh well you're just
copy the iPhone but that doesn't mean
that there's not some other conversation
where you can try and reach out directly
and tell that story to potential
consumers yeah and I think that is an
important thing to do i I think that God
I really wish Google would do it because
I think they have the product that has
the most compelling story to tell not
that I mean necessarily that the pixel
always captures the very best images but
they're trying hard with the whole you
get unlimited google photos backup you
know and it just works you know every
time you're connected the Wi-Fi all your
photos go up in space and you know if
you run out of space then your phones
like hey let me delete some photos you
don't need these or your Google photos
is like hey you've never looked at these
pictures do you still want them you know
and it'll be like you know all this kind
of little stuff you know where the
camera becomes something more than an
image capturing system it becomes a way
to manage you know your the memories
you've created with that system and
that's that's part of where I took
umbrage with what Vic Gundotra said
about computational photography where he
brought up that you know
Google had Vic Gundotra loved
auto-awesome apparently I hate
auto-awesome I think everything is
teriyaki yes and all this ever produces
is like this gaudy garbage that just
looks so corny I mean some people like
it so you know aesthetics and taste each
their own but I always felt it was just
stuff like I would never want to share
on social media it always just looks so
over rot and like like 80 Instagram
filters have been applied to my image
and turn them into a gif animation like
I don't want that it's not that's not
highly shareable that's just weird
looks like it sounds like Google like
deep learning algorithm or something
right so he was you know that's what's
the example I brought is like oh but
Google's gotten away from computational
photography and it's like well I mean if
you want to look at it through that one
very very very selective lens you've
chosen
maybe Google's you can't even say yes
you look through that selective lens and
it's still maybe yeah it's like no I
mean I open Google photos every time the
assistants like hey I made a stylized
photo for you it's not like super awful
like auto-awesome used to be but you
know it's like you know sometimes
they're really bad sometimes they're
like okay I don't think I've ever used
one but then it does other things like
you know hey this person's in your
pictures you know would you like to send
them your pictures that they're in
because maybe they want those like I
recognize this person maybe we could
identify who it is so in the future when
you take a picture with them like you
want to share that with them like in an
album you know like shared family album
or the shared albums two on Google
photos are great and I think you know I
mean that's not even speaking of like
you know Google's HDR algorithm which i
think is like almost magic on some level
it's incredible stuff that it can
accomplish when it works right and I
just think that he kind of he looks away
from the product that actually matters
to the photo you know the the
photography experience which is what
happens after you take the picture
that's what happened that's what's
important for most people and that's
where Google's focus is like I can go
into Google photos and be like mmm you
know I remember I took a picture of
somebody's dog and like I wanted to show
this picture with somebody and I can
just type in dog and Google's like I've
got all your pictures of dogs for like
the last seven years here here they
are and you probably type in like brown
dog or black dog you don't understand
what that means - it's pretty incredible
what it can do like if I'm looking for
you know a picture of like you know if I
went to a restaurant and I had a steak
if I type in steak it's gonna find a
steak like pretty incredible to say that
Google's moved away from computational
approach to photos I think is just not
right they're just not doing it in in
that way that apparently he found very
compelling right yeah and again it
really I think this is why this outburst
has resonated so much because I'm gonna
keep using a phrase like sour grapes
that Google didn't head down the path
that he thought was gonna be more
impressive or what he enjoyed about
photography and sharing and social media
and so it's obviously now what they're
doing now is the inferior solution I
think the only auto-awesome photo I've
ever shared was one of those weird
one-time Halloween images where it turns
you into like a zombie and that was
funny because it actually did a pretty
good job of that and literally
everything else has been a waste of my
time but then I look back on the
evolution of like cuz I was a big-time
Picasa user way back in the day so I had
all of my photos uploaded through this
Picasa account which was tied to my
gmail and how seamlessly that transition
happened through Google+ into Google
photos it's not like I've ever had to
manage ten years of photography it's it
was all handled in one direct evolution
through these different products and
like you were saying like if I want to
search for a steak that I had back in
2008 I can find it and I can find it
reasonably quickly I know what I'm
looking for and I have a pretty high
level of trust that Google's gonna gonna
aid me in that mission that that to me
has been a key part of this transition a
key part of this change where it matters
a little less to me whether or not the
HDR perfectly captures the shadow detail
in clouds in a bright beach pic but I
know when I search for a sunset two
years later that I'll probably be able
to find that photo yeah and that's that
to me is also such a huge source of you
if we want to talk about closed
ecosystem a little bit like that's a
great ecosystem locking feature to you
know note that well I don't want to take
my stuff off Google photos because then
it's gonna be really hard to find
anything because I've never done any
active organization of my photo library
whatsoever I've just let the system do
it it just knows if I want you know X or
Y you would and that's actually another
great thing about Google photos like I'm
a huge light your room user for all of
my stuff that I capture on my on my
professional camera for work especially
I've got a library of like twenty
thousand images there that I manage and
you know I've got some stuff stored it
sorted some not and live rooms of items
great for certain things and great for
processing photos and just kind of
general management that said for per I
would never put most of my personal
photography from my smart phones on
Lightroom I don't I wouldn't get much
out of it I get way more out of what
Google photos tells me especially in
terms of the search functions because
honestly the amount the signal-to-noise
ratio when I'm using my smart phone
camera sucks compared to when I'm using
my pro camera because I'm using my
personally my dedicated camera I'm
thinking a lot about the shot I'm taking
you know I'm not taking five different
shots of the same thing usually you know
maybe maybe like five different shots
from different angles and everything to
kind of you know if I'm trying to you
know do something that's like
aesthetically pleasing but yeah you know
if I'm on my smartphone it's possible
I'll take like twelve images and like
span of a minute and most of them are
probably useless garbage and so Google
photos is you know generally able to
more sort through that whereas a system
you have to actively manage like
Lightroom well that's a bear you have to
go through and do all that and figure
out what you do and don't want you know
so yeah I think I think Google is really
I think honestly this is the most
important part of smart personal
photography right now is managing and
just generally keeping track of what you
capture because we capture so much now I
think that's you know Google photos had
they said they were getting what a
billion images a month something like
that some insane number people take a
lot of pictures and so I think it's fair
to say that figuring out what people
want to do with them after their upload
it is probably a more important question
than like you said whether or not the
HDR gets your shadows right or maybe
there's
with a lens flare in one of your
pictures at night oh no you know that
that is less important now I will fight
you the pixel camera had terrible ring
flare I just look at one of those photos
I'm like everything was so perfect I had
someone I had someone fight me on that
it was like no I really like it cuz it's
like it's like this authentic feeling of
vintage photography where our glass
wasn't so pristine like that's fine for
you I guess I'm not gonna make that a
selling point per phone is that it
degrades your images in in a pleasant
way I don't need to be in JJ Abrams mode
oh man
one of the very first I mean they
actually have addressed this somewhat in
software but I was doing a night shot
and I was just catching these street
lights where the lens flares were
completely horizontal from edge to edge
of the video like that's ridiculous
that's yep that's impressive it's so
ridiculous I did want to circle back to
one other idea on the API get your
thoughts on this too and Jules actually
just reminded me of this in the chat
could maybe some of this discussion be
influenced by the sort of the historic
notion that iOS has been better for
third-party services like Instagram
where the image processing the API is
the Apple supplies developers and how
they're utilized well first of all
you're just supporting far fewer devices
so I think it's easier to optimize there
but there's just still been that
historical notion that if you share a
photo on an Android and you share a
photo from an iPhone that the image
processing is probably going to be
better on Instagram from the iPhone
yeah his Instagram switched over to the
camera to API yet I thought that I don't
know I don't believe they have okay I
wasn't aware of that or not I I know
that the poster child for this problem
is snapchat if we're going to pick one
where it's not just a problem it's like
and it's like infuriating that they
won't fix this you know where the image
quality is so heavily degraded because
you're using a viewfinder capture which
is just like it's it's like barbaric
this is how we did things like seven
years ago on Android nobody wants to go
back man you know
figure this out I mean I get there's a
lot of devices out there but maybe you
could make it work for like the 10 most
popular ones you know but anyway I agree
that's definitely something that's
always going to be a bit of an issue but
again with things like the camera 2 API
it's becoming less of one Google's
Google has been pretty good about
identifying this developer pain points
in terms of adopting for multiple
devices in some areas better than other
others I think that for example
rendering you know gaming for example
can be really tough one to build a you
know good set of profile metrics for a
device because a lot of time its chipset
and manufacturer tuning dependent but
there's something like photographs you
know well yeah we can build a camera API
that gives you like the basic stuff you
need for any you know modern camera it's
there it's usable so I think that yeah
you still have this problem but I think
it's much less of a problem than it used
to be I think again that's kind of a
theme in Vic's post as well yeah three
years ago you had you had a good point
sure and I think today there's still a
point there but I don't think it's
nearly as strong or at least not
something that would dissuade someone
from buying oh yeah it's the rest of
their lifestyle and exactly if you were
that devoted to Instagram you just do
you know what I think most people do
anyway now is you don't capture from
Instagram you just you know grab a photo
from the gallery after because you're
able to do that now and it doesn't show
up any differently and even from an
iPhone you know I don't know anyone I'm
sure there are lots of people who shoot
directly through the Instagram interface
I just hang in my circle of friends
you've gotten so used to whatever
shortcut so someone mentioned in RPN
weekly from the using the hash tag it
was rena-chan double-click on the home
or power button push virtual shutter
button photo taken there's nothing
confusing about that sort of addressing
some of the concerns there and same
thing from an iPhone you lift the phone
and swipe the screen and you're in the
camera there is no point in trying to
capture through finding an app in a
folder or yeah different homepage to try
and capture a moment the immediacy of
the smartphone is it's is it selling
advantage over a traditional camera
I find it dubious that this is really a
big motivator for who's using snapchat
over who's using Instagram yeah I agree
with that and for example you know just
like things like the the popularity of
like double tap power to launch camera I
mean it goes to show that yeah most
people just interested in the immediacy
and just you know getting the camera to
work as quickly as possible yeah
capturing through through apps I think
is more kind of a it's a it's kind of a
holdover I would say from you know III
guess it might come from PC computing
but it's it feels like something that's
just very archaic comparatively you know
I don't think people generally are using
their phones that way but I mean and I
think the one aspect is like cuz I don't
know that we found a good consumer
solution for editing so I think that's
why we've seen the popularity of
services like snapchat and Instagram
stories where you sort of hold on the
screen and it shoots little snippets of
video and those just get sort of stacked
and layered and and that's how you can
create a small little video piece and
when you do look at like even an iMovie
the people who are likely to sit down
and try and edit together a cohesive
video or narrative from a phone is
probably a lot lower and I just think
that's probably one of the last I think
holdouts for a custom camera interface
and it's something that is inherently
replicatable like Samsung could update
their camera app tomorrow and they
already include you know snapchat style
animated filtering stuff you know the
idea that you could just sort of tap
pause tap pause tap pause tap pause and
there's a two minute video doesn't seem
to me like it would be something outside
the reach of Samsung Developers know and
I think it I think that Samsung is
concerned with things like that is
probably you know for as much you know
flak they get for the kind of shotgun
approach to features Samsung is probably
trying to trying to show a little bit of
self convulse control in terms of just
adding things like we need this now
Apple did it we must we must add it
we're talking a very little bit of
company self control when it yeah so I
think it's yeah I think that you know
and I think Google is actually probably
the if we want to look at
the can we do it as the question and
Google were you know every time I talk
to people who work on the Android team
the process of adding anything to the OS
anything that is user facing is true
endless agony any time any button any
new toggle anything that's exposed to
the user that gives them a new option or
a new button anywhere it there it has to
go through this tremendous amount of
skepticism where nobody thinks that
anything should be added basically
because you're just going to complicate
things for the end-user
right so I think that philosophy is what
is what is driven Google and I think
that you know it probably drives certain
other manufacturers to Samsung obviously
to a lesser degree but but I think
that's you know I think that's I think
that's also something worth bringing up
in terms of just kind of general OS
philosophy and it's something that
interestingly from me for Apple I feel
like Apple has cared less about recently
been more willing to throw features at
the OS and see what gets taken up for
example 3d touch and they're removing
certain 3d touch functionality and iOS
11 right I think there was the yeah
they're kind of moving the goal posts on
that and I think in a way that again
it's Apple Apple built this reputation
for never beta testing their their
general consumers but 3d touches felt
like to me like this has been a moving
target what is it that we expect from
the additional functionality of this
gesture the gestures are always really
tricky I mean like I think BlackBerry OS
had a hard time entering the
conversation with so much gesture
dependent functionality and I don't
think Apple has a good answer for that
especially conveyance because there is
no conveyance on what is a gesture a 3d
force press and what's to sort of a
normal long press or what can you
activate through this process it's um
it's very you know it's silent to the
consumer so you're gonna use your iPhone
the same way you've used every other
iPhone and occasionally you might
accidentally peek or pop on something
and that really wasn't a core new way
for you to interact with your phone yeah
so I think that yeah some of the kind of
traditional conceptions around what
Apple does right and what you know
Samsung Android etc do wrong not always
you know holding up anymore and in kind
of the modern era necessarily yeah these
two are kind of meeting in the middle as
their own fiercest competitors like well
you've got that picture we can do that
we got a great little tweet here from
Brandon Hardy using the p-n weekly
hashtag it's not about the photos it's
the memories nice slogan from our that's
that's good Robi eleven for this shot on
pixel program so he just crafted a whole
brand campaign for Google using your
quote there and I just thought you'd get
a kick out of that that is that's really
good I like it
somebody should somebody should tell
Google well so I mean I guess like the
the the last thing that we need to
unpack is um what camera what what phone
camera do you like because now then we
can call you the bright kind of shell
for the company that you obviously
prefer and are getting paid for to use
yeah of course oh I love I just love the
pixels camera I mean I look at some of
the pictures that I've gotten on that
camera I'm just like yeah okay I every
time I want to throw my pixel I'm just
like okay but the camera is really good
and it's really fast and I just keep
coming back to those two things and for
the camera I think it comes down to you
know the processing to me is is somebody
who you know uses a dedicated camera
sometimes even for you know kind of
leisure activities like the processing
is not so aggressive the HDR is not
always realistic especially in low light
but I feel like the end product I get is
usually more usable and especially if
you're you know you want to frame things
you know the thing about using a single
lens smartphone cameras like well you've
got one vantage point and so if you want
to crop and work with your images a
little bit you know some cameras I won't
name names LG don't really give you much
room
in terms of you know like you know
taking photos apart and cutting them
down a little bit beyond making them
square so I I like that about the pixel
I've always been able to you know craft
my photos with the pixel a little bit
more and I just think that the the fast
capture experience is unbeatable nobody
is even close i I think that in terms of
by the time you double tap the power
button and you hit the capture button it
is easily the fastest smartphone imaging
experience out there and that that's
also huge to me
yeah it was really startling in one year
to go from double tapping the home
button on the s7 and be like wow this is
this is pretty snappy today at the end
of the year picking up a pixel and going
wow wow this is really scary it is you
can go straight from double tapping to
burst capture and it doesn't even skip a
beat
it's like witchcraft going on there so
yeah I love the pixels camera I love
that I get the original quality uploads
on google photos I think that's a for me
as somebody where the original quality
probably doesn't really matter but the
photo person and me is like I'd like
that please so it's it's an upsell for
me definitely yeah like I'm not I'm not
gonna be the guy who archives everything
and this is like been one of the the
weird transitionary phases like I still
use onedrive as a backup because we pay
for office we have to have Microsoft
Office we might as well use onedrive is
sort of a secondary cloud and the number
of times I've had to go back in to try
and get something out of onedrive have
been just incredibly painful the after
having used google photos and so while
I'm not gonna save every photo the
photos that I do save I want to have
some kind of archive you know like
archival quality not just I can kind of
share it and it still looks pretty good
like I might want to recruit or pull
someone's face out of it or you know
make it black and white and put it in a
picture frame and I can actually print
phone camera photos now and they look
really good to have that access to like
the pixel made a really compelling
argument for that sort of general
consumer philosophy yeah definitely I
think especially with the edits you know
everything happens in the cloud so
everything's reversible the originals
always there
no matter what you know and it's it's
it's generally very smart about trying
stuff like when you share images from
you know Google photos it strips out
location data because it knows you
probably don't want that in there but it
preserves in the original in case you
know like you want to search for your
photos by where they were taken you know
it's just kind of I think that they've
done such a good job with that and it
makes the imaging experience so much
more seamless I think that if Google
could tell kind of a product story about
a camera it would have to send her
around photos more than the camera
itself and yeah I think that's just such
a such a big part of why I like the
pixel in particular I think it's the
best camera for using Google photos and
Google photos is the best image
management image management it makes it
sound so cold and clinical the best
personal best personal like you know
media creation or you know media go back
go back to your slogan that's gonna be
part of the ad campaign it's its
memories yes managing it memories yes
yeah and now yeah I know what you're
talking about
exactly so yeah that's that's definitely
a big part of part of the reason I I
really like it so yeah right on I mean
you know III think people who have
watched this know that I'm kind of a
hallway and LG fanboy for photos and for
video but I have a lot of love for the I
guess I want to call it like the pixel
process or the pixel ecosystem or
whatever we want to say I can't get over
some of those lens flares but yeah that
they've created I mean and again why I'm
really anxious to see what we what we
get for the pixel to you know cuz I
don't think it takes much we're talking
some very minor adjustments for that to
go from being a very highly recommended
camera it's probably one of the best
consumer experiences on the market I
think so too
yeah there there are some changes they
need to make for sure
optical video stabilization would be a
good one I feel like they're they're
creepy Terminator II is is like yeah
impressive but like you know maybe if we
could do a little bit of hybrid approach
so it doesn't look quite like somebody's
like you know panning on like a machine
it has that kind of creepy feel to it
and the video quality at night on the
so it's very dodgy that's something I
also feel like they really missed the
mark on I think that may come down to
you know choice of sensor and processing
techniques but yeah well I actually I
think it's just a notion of fighting
physics at that point you know you've
got such a small sensor and you don't
have to use the full frame length you
know so you're shooting 30 frames per
second each frame is gonna be about a
thirtieth of a second that introduces a
lot of blur in low light and you can't
really crop stitch and reformulate
blurred video so you see that sort of
ghosting blur ghosting even like the
noise the noise that that phone can
produce it the high it low light is
pretty it's pretty ugly even it is even
pretty link rest yeah I definitely
definitely you know think that's one of
the shortcomings and yeah hopefully they
do that and I'm you know I'm guessing
based on kind of the the two leaks
renders we've seen now both when we
publish and the one that on leaks
published I'm guessing that the lenses
design that way for a very specific
reason you know maybe maybe giving
themselves some more leeway there for
for optics in terms of how the Sun and
various light sources are going to play
with the the camera lens now I've been a
big fan of a lot of these dual camera
experiments but I love the notion of
Google really trying to nail down and
focus on refining what was already a
very good experience I didn't have the
same sense from Samsung this year where
I felt like the essay was sort of a
lateral move from the i7 just having you
have fun features to see to see Google
like again like they're not gonna make
the move to more sensors or a larger
sensor or some other you know gimmick
until they've got the core perfect and
that's exactly what I want to see from a
manufacturer I was even why I was a
little disappointed in the iPhone dual
shooter because again they released
hardware that didn't have all of the
software for it at launch and then what
we've gotten is fun it's good but I
don't think it really addressed like
core photography use you use the zoom
sensor and your image degrades like it's
not as nice of an image as the main
sensor and those kinds of things like
Betts feel so
uncharacteristic of Apple to have that
kind of a disparity on one product you
know wasn't like a generational change
it's like on one product your photos
look different
moving from sensor dispenser yeah that
is that is definitely something that
I've heard about and yeah I think that's
maybe part of the hesitancy of some
manufacturers go camera obviously we're
gonna see Samsung do that with an o date
I'm curious to see what they manage with
that Samsung having you know significant
buying power and also their own image
sensor production capabilities so they
they are definitely the one to watch for
that I feel like you know what we seen
Motorola now do and what which was
copying with Huawei did with the
monochrome sensor acting is basically a
sharpening check in contrast check
against a color sensor I think that's
interesting I don't think that you need
a dual cameras story around that like
the idea that like oh well we've got one
camera that's black and white it's
different so like now you don't need
like that doesn't that doesn't you know
I don't get anything out of that second
camera like I get that it's there and
yeah maybe feel like you're super in the
black-and-white photography like yeah
okay cool but I think that the the
approach is definitely having either a
very wide angle and then a you know more
standard camera or having a standard
camera and something that shoots more
portrait at a longer longer zoom so
right I I think that Samsung I think
what we've seen is that Samsung is going
to go with the long long zoom on their
secondary camera I think it's pretty
likely that again they're facing Apple
that's probably the biggest competitor
in their sights and reaching parity
means having similar features but doing
it one better so instead of a 2x zoom
it's going to be a 3x zoom yeah I'm
curious to see what Apple does to refine
the two camera experiences here or if
they really do anything to refine it
that's gonna be a big question and I
think that if if we do see really
impressive results from Samsung and
Apple around the the secondary camera
systems especially in terms of
improvement in image quality and maybe
of optics that could leave kind of an
open question for Google oh why didn't
you push harder to do this but you know
we'll see a lot of big what-ifs still
yeah and this is
sort of the last little exciting period
of downtime we'll get before we're just
swamped with comparisons and stuff so
it's been fun speculation um David I
really want to thank you for jumping in
on this I Jules uh reached out to you I
like I could have kissed him on the face
because you were exactly the kind of
person that I wanted to have this
conversation with about Vicks comments
and specifically and then just sort of
the current state of Android photography
in general so again thank you for for
jumping on this podcast oh yeah thanks
for having me on had a great time
absolutely all right well um I think we
can put a pin in this show again I we
kept you a little longer to David so I'm
just gonna go through our little wrap-up
spiel here and and put a bow on it
ladies and gentlemen
folks another episode of the PocketNow
weekly has come and gone this show is
over but the conversation continues on
Twitter where David is oh no I lost my
note Rd Oh God
my Twitter handle is a dumpster fire it
is are tr0 people just look up twitter
david Redick just go on Twitter I search
for David running I'm the only results
it's okay
yeah my twitter handle is bad I should
feel bad about it sorry and I had it I
had it written in my other show notes
and then I didn't move that over Jules
is at point jules and I'm humbly at some
gadget guy pocket now he's around the
rep is around the web on Twitter
Instagram Facebook Google+ YouTube and
our home site pocketnow.com and now
