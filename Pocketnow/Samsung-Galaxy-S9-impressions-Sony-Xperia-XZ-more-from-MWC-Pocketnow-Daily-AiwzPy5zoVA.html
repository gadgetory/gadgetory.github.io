s 9 plus to show you that you don't need
$1000 for a premium phone LG did end up
launching something even if we're still
scratching our heads over it and Sony is
back and this time for good with its new
MWC offerings I'm high metal Yvette I
reported from Barcelona we love this
town we love the show and there is so
much to cover this is pocket out daily
we have had very little sleep we're
actually sitting on video still because
we've had been having to scramble
between places just to get all the
coverage done most important we were
already at the Sony booth we already
have our footage of the new Sony egg z2
and exited compact they are definitely
thicker than what we've seen from Sony
in the past but we love the fact that
the company is going back to stock bring
me a ton of Elemental features to the
phone we just can't wait to see if the
company will continue backing up the
phones as it's we'll keep you
posted on that now let's talk about
Huawei as the company has unveiled its
new media pad m5 both variants in
addition to its new mate book X Pro I'm
a big fan of the new mate book
definitely gorgeous design love that
display but a lot of people didn't
really like the new approach to the
selfie camera I am actually not
complaining and then in the case of the
media pad oh my god those speakers and
the fact that we get premium Android
tablets I love the fact that we still
have a market there I just hope that we
continue seeing more offerings you can
learn more about these offerings in the
link of the description with our videos
now let's talk about ZTE and we're not
gonna talk about an axon we're actually
going to talk about the company's new
blade b9 usually we don't talk about the
blade Series on the daily but oh my god
this phone looks identical to the honor
8 I love that design I love the back I
love the 18 by 9 aspect ratio and for
less than $300 that is a crazy deal for
a premium design we can't wait to tell
you more about it once on a review unit
comes in
definitely watch our hands on for now
now let's talk about LG yes we did get
an LG V 30s plus thank you we were
expecting some sort of a significant
spec bump but it seems that whatever we
saw with the LG
six plus is pretty much going to be the
standard going forward the company using
you know just minor speck bumps like two
extra gigs of ram double the storage and
that's pretty much it literally the
difference between the LGB 30 in this
LGB 30s is just a software update
because and absolutely everything else
the V 30 is capable of doing what the B
30s is you can watch our hands-on and
learn more about it and finally the very
hot news today and pretty much of the
weekend was the samsung galaxy s 9s 9
plus the unpacked event was crazy I love
the approach actually but it was full of
people we got you a hands-on video of
both flagships expect some comparison
videos coming very soon the footages
there obviously this is definitely the
phone of MWC 2018 we would love to know
in the comments what you think number
one of the s 9s 9 plus and obviously
everything else that you've seen so far
what do you think do you like the
offerings or not

do like that s 9 plus indeed friends
