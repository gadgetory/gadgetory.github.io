smartphone well if your Oppo you tell
the iphone 6 to do a better job and give
it a run for its money I'm high memory
that I with pocket now here at Singapore
for a quick hands-on of the Oppo r5
earlier this year I will launch the r3
and an attempt to bring you the thinnest
design possible on as many flagship
specifications as it could fast forward
to today and the Oppo r5 is truly able
to nail this idea this phone is not only
crazy then at four point 85 millimeters
which is already two millimeters thinner
than the iphone 6 but it also feels
substantially solid in the hand even
when it's hard to believe I don't think
you're gonna bend this phone easily it
feels substantial in the hand apple also
claims that this device was designed
with a new cool element phase shifting
material that adapts to heat in order to
cool down the phone and use which is
something will prove in our full review
later on this device comes in three
colors silver golden and gray and the
spec sheet includes a gorgeous 5.2 which
1080p m OLED display a 2.1 gigahertz
Snapdragon 615 octa core chip 2 gigs of
ram 16 gigs of storage and a 2,000
milliamp hour battery that's compatible
with apples rapid charging technology
just this with the case of the oppo n3
this device runs the new version 2.0 of
their color OS on top of android 444
you'll notice the app tray is gone and
this phone actually has other design
elements that are even more elegant that
what we saw in the m3 though remember
this is not finalized software there's a
13 megapixel sony exmor r BSI sensor in
addition to a 5 megapixel 80 degree wide
camera with f 2 point 0 aperture on both
cameras so yes you do have a good selfie
cam here and the primary camera can
record 4k video at 30 frames per second
and slow motion video up to 120 frames
per second if you're asking yourself
where is the headphone jack well
according to a poll it just didn't fit
but the phone will include an adapter
for this and there's always a good der
bluetooth headphones as an additional
option though you'd have to buy those
separately I've got to admit it this is
probably one of the thinnest and most
elegant phones that I've seen this year
and definitely something you need to
hold in your hand to understand we
should learn more about price points and
launch markets in November when this
phone is launched but so far there is a
lot a lot to be impressed about such a
thin phone again I'm hi Mary better with
pocket now make sure you follow us on
social media and subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you can follow
me on Twitter hina underscore rivera
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am hi Mary data
thank you very much for watching there
is more coming from our bow and
