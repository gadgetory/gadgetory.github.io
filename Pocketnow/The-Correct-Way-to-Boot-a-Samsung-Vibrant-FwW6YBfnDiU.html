the other day I recorded a video
demonstrating how you can get the
samsung vibrant to Haines or slow down
while it's running the me skinny process
in the background I got a lot of
feedback from the commenter saying that
this is not how you're supposed to boot
up the device and log into it so we're
going to try to do it the right way this
time
now here's where it gets tricky right
now you see at the bottom it says sweep
screen to unlock so if I were to do that
right now it would be very slow and
unresponsive we have to wait for it to
finish its background processes before
we can login so let's wait what'd you
guys think of the weather today it's
pretty nice out here anybody do anything
fun no so any minute we should see some
status notification so there we go media
scanner running so it's doing its and
that is done and now it's off ok so now
it should be all finished with that
startup process nope oh it's doing it
again ok come back on
so now we should be able to login and
everything would be safe okay there we
go right right to the home screen pretty
responsive now let's do some button
mashing search comes up right away good
home let's open a program loading back
swap swap application tray loads up so
that's much more responsive but problem
with this video is that that's not
showing any multitasking I had to wait
for those other applications to finish
processing before I could use the device
so the lesson to be learned here is that
you should let those processes finish
because they're going to take up a lot
of cpu usage before you interact with
the device so now that that's done
everything is very responsive and there
we go that's the correct way to boot the
samsung vibrant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
