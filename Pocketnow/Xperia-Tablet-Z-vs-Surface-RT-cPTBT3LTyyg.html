it's not the only high-end tablet out
there today we're putting two of the
iPads tablet competitors head-to-head
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Sony Xperia tablet Z versus
Microsoft Surface RT though
aesthetically similar at first glance
the tablet Z and the surface RT really
couldn't be more different one is a
lightweight and water-resistant but
otherwise conventional Android tablet
the other is a metal covered Windows
hybrid that tries to straddle the line
between tablet and notebook despite
these differences they're currently
priced identically so let's put them
side-by-side to see how they stack up in
hardware software and a few tests notes
on their faces the sixteen by nine
Surface RT and sixteen by 10 tablet Z
almost look like they might have come
from the same Factory
it's mainly the branding that sets them
apart until that is you get down to
table level and start talking thickness
at nine millimeters thick the Microsoft
tablet is over two millimeters beefier
than the Sony device and it's 680 gram
mass means it's much heavier than the
495 gram tablet z the surface RT also
tends more often to be cool to the touch
on account of its magnesium casing and
that combined with its added heft makes
the RT feel like it can take a pounding
but despite its petite frame the tablet
Z also feels quite durable it's soft
touch back feels great in the hand and
it's IP 55:57
and IP 5x ratings means the tablet Z
beats the surface in water and dust
resistance where the surface really
shines from a build perspective is its
ability to transform into something more
resembling a notebook computer than a
tablet it's reinforced kickstand is
sturdy and satisfying to deploy propping
the device up at an angle for desktop
use and the surface currently ships with
either a touch cover or a type cover to
serve as a keyboard when open and a
screen protector when closed and this
cover snaps on magnetically like the
power cable while the tablet Z supports
any number of keyboard peripherals and
third-party kick stands the surfaces
inclusion of both of these into the
purchase price thanks to a currently
running Microsoft promotion give
a much more complete feeling you feel
like you're getting more for your money
with Microsoft's product out of the box
that warm and fuzzy feeling takes a hit
though when powering up the displays for
the first time a Microsoft calls the
surface Artie's 10.6 inch 1366 by 768
panel a clear type HD display but it's
148 PPI pixel density doesn't lead to
the clearest text we've ever seen on a
tablet that's certainly true up against
the 1920 by 1200 display on the tablet Z
which is smaller at 10.1 inches but much
sharper at 224 PPI it's possible
Microsoft was planning for a display
you'd use while sitting further away and
in keeping with the surface Artie's dual
role as an ultrabook standin but no
matter how far away you'd get you'll
probably notice the density sacrifice of
the artis screen Sony's panel with its
added saturation thanks to the Mobile
BRAVIA Engine 2 is the clear winner here
other factors cancel each other out or
don't depending on your priorities the
tablet Z offers an IR transmitter for
remote-control duties but the surface RT
counters with a full-size USB port the
tablet sees 8 megapixel main and 2
megapixel front cameras beat out the
surfaces poultry duo of 1 megapixel
shooters but the surface RT comes in a
pricier 64 gig version while we're still
waiting on Sony to offer a tablet Z with
more than 32 gigs of onboard memory but
both tablets though feature a microSD
slot for more versatile expansion and of
course there's the matter of the power
plant behind all the software the tablet
Z runs on a quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
at 1.5 gigahertz whereas the surface RT
gets it zoom from an NVIDIA Tegra 3 at
one point 3 gigahertz each tablet
features 2 gigs of ram and each draws
power from a non removable lithium
polymer battery 6,000 milliamp hours in
the case of the slim Sony tablet and a
bit over 8500 milliamp hours inside the
heavier surface the difference on the
software side is night and day but
there's a lot of familiarity on both
sides the tablet Z's Android build is
heavily customized but underneath the
Sony tweaks it's still Android 4.1.2
similarly this
surface is running an OS instantly
familiar to anyone who's used a Windows
Phone and it weaves in a new gesture
driven interface that takes some getting
used to but becomes second nature after
a short time
underneath that futuristic UI is a
desktop familiar to most people who've
used a Microsoft computer anytime in the
last decade really with this legacy
comes challenges on both sides as we
mentioned in our tablet Z review Android
running at the 10 inch form factor has a
serious problem in terms of optimized
apps while some apps have been modified
for the larger canvas many more have not
and they remain stretched out versions
of smartphone titles running on a big
screen sometimes forcing a user into
portrait mode which is just absurd
that's a problem similar but not
identical to the challenges seen on
Windows RT on the surface which also
requires its own full screen apps to be
written for the larger display which
platform will serve you better in terms
of apps will depend on which titles you
regularly rely on we've found a few
tablet optimized titles on the surface
that haven't been optimised for
large-scale Android but there are
examples of the opposite as well the
surface offers the illusion of added
functionality with the faux Windows 8
desktop but as we've said before this
offers less utility than it initially
appears and given its limitations it
feels a lot more like a stopgap than a
legitimate operating environment if
you're using the surface pro with full
Windows 8 well that's another story it's
actually quite useful then but if you're
using the surface RT you'll probably
spend most of your time in the modern UI
Start screen a good thing as it's much
more touch friendly ultimately the
software question comes down to a
comparison of two very different and
rapidly changing ecosystems if you're
dependent on Google's portfolio of
services either of these will serve you
satisfactorily but if you want to be
able to run your G services outside of a
browser the tablet Z is the better
device if you're an Outlook user who
wants access to office and other
Microsoft centric titles obviously the
surface RT will serve you better tablet
cameras are arguably not meant to be
used as point-and-shoot cameras but
there are always some folks out there
who don't care what they look like and
you know what good for them
but with the surface you'll always know
when such a person has you in his or her
sights because of the LED camera on
indicator a nice touch or a big
disappointment depending on whether
you're a creep the tablet Z doesn't have
such an LED but it's 8 megapixel sensor
is far larger than the one on the
surface the Z also offers more shooting
modes and tweaks via Sony's excellent
viewfinder software which you'll need
the out of box settings don't result in
great photos in any sense of the word
but at least they're better than the
surfaces frankly awful offerings indoors
outdoors good light bad light it doesn't
seem to matter the Z delivers mediocre
pictures at best and the surface
generates photos straight out of 2004
again you're probably not shopping for a
tablet based on its optics but even the
more tablet focused features like the
front-facing camera or document scanning
features aren't bound to work as well on
the surface as they do on the tablet Z
considering the Microsoft engineers went
to the trouble of specially tilting the
surfaces camera module to account for
desktop use a very nice touch it's a
shame the camera itself is such a
disappointment compared to the Sony
product both tablets feature pretty
small speakers but Sony's long
experience in the audio field gives it
the edge here where it uses some
software tricks to deliver sound that's
richer and fuller than the surface RT is
muted output that said neither of these
is going to win any awards for quality
or amplitude well you might be able to
take the tablet Z in the shower you
won't be able to hear Spotify over the
noise the surface redeems itself
somewhat in terms of battery life the
2500 milliamp hour difference in battery
size is a useful metric here because
each tablet runs at 3.7 volts allowing
for a direct comparison there are other
factors like processor and software that
affect battery life of course and sony
has built some excellent power
management software like stamina mode
into the tablet Z but at the end of the
day in our testing the surface RT just
lasts longer in normal use and that
speaks nicely to the road warrior in us
these tablets tell totally different
stories and they're both priced as
premium products so it's important to
understand those stories the surface RT
feels like so much more it's a metal
transformer that full
out into a serviceable ultrabook
replacement and it looks and feels
incredibly good while doing it it also
lasts longer on battery on the downside
in trying to be more than just a tablet
it compromises in significant ways its
OS is more limited than it first appears
it's heavy and it packs a truly awful
set of cameras the tablet Z while
attractive is more confining it stays
much truer to its tablet roots it runs
just like any other full-sized Android
tablet on the software side and the
hardware while waterproof and beautiful
and portable and all those good things
is still just a tablet nothing more it
doesn't even come with headphones or a
doc in the box so if you want that added
raw functionality that the surface RT
provides and you're willing to put up
with the compromises required to get it
go with the Microsoft product if instead
you're looking for a more conventional
google centric tablet experience in a
gorgeous casing that's also water and
dust resistant the tablet Z will be the
better ride for you either way you go
you'll be spending as much as you would
to pick up a low-end iPad though so make
sure you know what you want before you
pull the trigger folks we have so much
