manufacturer took their flagship phone
hardware added an extra gigabyte of RAM
an IR blaster to use the phone as
universal remote improved the
fingerprint sensor and shaved around
$100 off the price might that be
something which would appeal to you as a
consumer if you caught our review of the
Huawei p9 moving to the honor eight
would resemble the scenario we just
described so let's dig into this new
mid-range er and see how it stacks up
against other options in this
increasingly competitive price tier
first getting the specs out of the way
the honor 8 has a 5.2 inch 1080p LCD
powered by a high silicon kuren 950
octa-core chipset and 4 gigabytes of RAM
the base model starts with 32 gigabytes
of storage with the ability to add more
via microSD and above the screen we have
a respectable 8 megapixel selfie camera
dual 12 megapixel camera sensors are
flush with the rear casing above a
terrific fingerprint sensor doubling as
a programmable shortcut button and the
bottom edge holds the speaker headphone
jack and USB C port now this is a
perfectly reasonable 1080p display we
would always prefer stepping up to quad
HD but this resolution will get the job
done for most folks respectable
brightness helps when using the phone
outside though it obviously falls short
of the high contrast mode on a Galaxy s7
though it is easier to read than an LG
g5 one nice perk over the sibling Huawei
p9 this screen gets just a little bit
dimmer which should make late night
reading in bed a little less ie piercing
another change over the metal clad
Huawei this honor features a redesigned
fingerprint scanner we've always enjoyed
the speed of these sensors and this
placement is absolutely perfect for
folks who have issues reaching
front-mounted fingerprint sensors but
this particular circle adds a
programmable button that the user can
assign various apps or functions single
click double click or long press are up
for grabs a handy ergonomic touch to
quickly get two commonly used services
and in a surprising turn from the Huawei
flagship the honor 8 also adds an IR
blaster to use this phone as a universal
remote most manufacturers this year have
abandoned this hardware feature so for
those of us who are fans it's exciting
to see a pop up on a mid-range
your phone this app has a great
collection of codes for most brands of
TV cable box and has presets for air
conditioners cameras and projectors if
your device is not on that list the IR
blaster can receive input from other
remotes to learn your hardware now
moving over to style this design is
instantly familiar as this layout is
nearly identical to the p9 the big
change here is moving from a metal back
with antenna bands in a glass cutout for
the cameras the entire rear is now one
nearly continuous piece of glass the
camera sensors and laser focus module
are not only flush they're under the
same sheet of glass as the whole rest of
the phone the fingerprint sensor and
dual flash are very subtle breaks in
that rear panel and as mentioned during
our lunch event video this isn't simply
a glass back 15 layers of glass and
reflectors slice up light in diagonal
playful lines
it's a beautiful look in the hand and
this blue model is one of the few phones
which has actually turned heads while
I've been using it in public it's
fantastically simple and sleek of course
this also makes the phone a crazy
fingerprint magnet like I think it might
be absorbing fingerprints while it just
sits here on the table honors supplied a
clear case but that also accrues smudges
and it's an easily scratched plastic on
the hole though we like the look of it
and this is a fun take on a glass back
device now we've covered this software
skin in numerous other Huawei and honour
reviews emui is the custom interface
which removed the app drawer and turns
the phone into something more closely
resembling an iPhone settings look
similar to iOS and the split
notification shade certainly recalls the
iPhone this isn't my favorite skin not
by a long shot
home screens look cluttered when there's
a mix of icons and widgets and swiping
through the notification shade well
sometimes laterally move to your quick
settings or swipe away a notification
Nova Launcher was a quick addition to
bring this phone more in line with what
I'm used to thankfully there's almost no
bloat here outside of honor included
services powering this software the
Kiran chipset is a snappy octa-core
processor when navigating the UI using
social media and messaging apps the
honor eight easily chewed through the
basics move
to gaming we also saw relatively fluid
frame rates on demanding games like
implosion Marvel future fight on high
settings didn't descend into the same
slideshow we've seen on welcome 820
power devices but we could discern
noticeable dips in the framerate
personally being somewhat unfamiliar
with the current chipset and having had
great anecdotal experiences with the p9
I ran some benchmarks just to see where
this processor lands against other
phones we've reviewed as a general trend
comparing against the Qualcomm 820
powered galaxy s7 every benchmark which
tested graphics or RAM performance
turned in favor of the galaxy but nearly
every CPU bound benchmark was won by the
honor a nice discovery to see synthetic
numbers which largely matched our daily
experience gamers might be a bit
disappointed here but on the whole this
phone handles its business very well
networking performance was also
top-notch around town on AT&amp;amp;T signal the
honor posted almost identical reception
numbers to the glass back to galaxy s7
by switching to Wi-Fi the honor fell a
little behind Samsung smaller flagship
call quality was respectable no one
complained about the audio being sent
out but I could do with just a bit more
volume from the earpiece the one area I
ran into a bit of frustration was using
Bluetooth I tend to hit Bluetooth really
hard driving around Los Angeles I often
have a phone connected to a SmartWatch
my car's in - stereo unit the car's
computer on a separate Bluetooth
connection and a pair of headphones to
switch over once I turn the car off the
honor eight was more prone than other
phones we've recently reviewed in
dropping connections frequently
throughout the day my pebble would alert
me to a disconnect it was a coin flip
whether the car computer connection
would initiate automatically and the
honor does not like to transfer audio if
I'm using headphones the car in - would
not switch over turning the car off
I'd have to manually swap back to the
headphones there didn't seem to be any
priority for Bluetooth management here
now moving to one of the highlights of
this phone the honor eight features a
terrific camera system these dual
sensors work in tandem to produce some
of the best still photos we've ever seen
from a phone it's nearly identical to
the p9 which we also enjoyed we have a
separate short review of this camera
which you can watch and we'd also
recommend checking out the Huawei p9
real camera review
on this channel if you really want to
dig deep into what this phone has to
offer for this section of the review
though we'd like to respond to some of
the concerns people have had as to
whether this dual system is really doing
anything we've seen some poorly
conducted tests often handheld or
focusing on video which conclude that
the second sensor doesn't contribute
anything to the photography process now
you can absolutely take a photo while
blocking the monochrome sensor but
putting the phone on a tripod to
eliminate issues with exposure or
differences in metering we do see subtle
but important differences in photo
output essentially the monochrome sensor
is being used to paint in light and
detail which might be missing from the
color sensor shot we might chastise
Huawei as it does not appear that the
system delivers a true blend of two
complete images but this still results
in some fantastic output while we might
have taken some liberties in advertising
but we're certainly not disappointed by
the actual practical results this dual
sensor setup is also instrumental for
the depth of field blur effect block one
camera sensor and there is no depth info
for the camera to use so there's that
too moving to audio speaker performance
is adequate if unremarkable against
similar bottom firing speaker phones
like the oneplus 3 the playback here is
a little on the dull side and it's not
quite as loud as what oneplus has
achieved the honor handily loses two
front firing solutions from ZTE and
Alcatel headphone playback is also
somewhat mid-pack it easily best phones
like the LG g5 but falls behind one plus
and ZTE again for Distortion frequency
response and dynamic range also while
the phone can playback high resolution
audio it seems to down sample playback
to 16-bit the headphone amp is also on
the lean side again edging out the LG g5
but losing ever so slightly to the
galaxy s7 the DTS mode on the honor will
play around with your EQ settings to
juice up your music but it doesn't do
anything to boost output and it's a
setting that purists will likely disable
lastly looking at battery life the honor
had no issues lasting a full day and
into the evening with mixed usage lots
of messaging social media a couple of
calls and streaming audio while driving
but this is not a screen on
most of my daily usage involves short
periods of screen activity but lots of
screen off usage this is demonstrated in
our media test streaming 30 minutes of
HD video over Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the honor
eight drained 8% of its battery this
display is not one of the more power
efficient screens we've come across the
phone achieves some decent real-world
runtime though by way of super
aggressive app management you will
regularly be alerted to power intensive
background apps and while helpful I mean
it does work in reducing battery drain
but the aggressive app management and
nannying notifications are more than a
bit annoying recharge times are
respectable 30 minutes on the included
charger resulted in a 37% top off not
mind-blowing but helpful during the day
if you need a little extra juice so
let's wrap this up
where does that leave us with the honor
8 this might just be my favorite
surprise of 2016 after using the
entry-level honor 5x I really wasn't
expecting honor to deliver a quality 9
at this mid-range er price that we see
some improvements to the p9 in terms of
RAM and features is just icing on the
cake the phone certainly has its share
of compromises but it definitely brings
a unique experience and a great camera
to the table the $400 smart phone tier
is fantastically competitive and this
phone is a charming entry which can
handle e compete against one pluses
axons Alcatel and iPhone SES we've got
some wonderful options to consider and
now it's just up to the consumer to
decide on what features they care about
most as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full Honor 8 coverage
and help us out with some sharing on
your favorite social networks for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next review
