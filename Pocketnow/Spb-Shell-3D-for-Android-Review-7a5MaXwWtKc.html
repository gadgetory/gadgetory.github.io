pocket now calm and we're excited to
bring you with a review of SBB mobile
shell 3d for Android let's get to it so
this was previously known as SBB mobile
shell 5.0 for Android it's been in beta
for about a year available only to
carriers and OEMs we did a preview of it
a few weeks ago but this is the final
version and they're calling it SPB
mobile shell 3d for Android and it is
awesome it's gonna be available soon by
the time this video is available we'll
have a better idea on pricing so we'll
put an annotation up on the video so you
know where to get it and for how much
what we're talking about here is a
complete interface replacement for
Android that rivals and competes with
ADW launcher and launcher Pro it's
comprehensive it covers a lot of parts
of the home screen experience and it's
really well done and well thought out
after a year of beta testing so let's
talk about what we have here on its most
basic level they are home screens eight
of them although you can change that
number that do certain functions and
then does a lot more than that so that's
kind of a minimal way of talking about
it starting off here this is the clock
pre-configured panel and from here we
can see the time we can see the next
lunar day we can tap to see the lunar
calendar we can also change the skin of
this particular pound so we've got a
wide variety of clocks this blue clock
is pretty cool and if we tap on it it
will download it and bring it to the
home screen and there you go a blue
clock sliding to the right this is a
miscellaneous panel we're not going to
talk about this right now it's kind of a
panel where you can put widgets and
programs shortcuts and really anything
you want to the right we have another
miscellaneous panel but there's
something cool here I want to show you
as you can see here I've got some
program shortcuts world time and this is
a picture widget if you tap on the item
on the left which has this 3d look we
get this really cool 3d album where you
can flick through your pictures in sort
of a beautiful almost touch flow 3d like
way and if you tap on the image you can
bring it up full screen there so kind of
a cool way to show off your pictures
swiping to the right this is enough
our built-in pre-configured panel it's
just the calendar panel and what you
have here are your next appointments you
can add a new appointment there you can
flick through your calendar to see the
different dates and tapping on the
calendar will bring up the Android
calendar swiping to the right this is
another pre-configured panel that we're
talking about this is the flicker panel
really cool way to actually change your
wallpaper so let's say you tap on one of
these this picture looks cool I want to
make that my wallpaper you tap on it and
boom within seconds you've got fresh
wallpaper pretty nice and we've got a
few settings we can change here we can
have the pictures update automatically
we can turn off the picture updates if
it is not over Wi-Fi swiping to the
right this is another miscellaneous
panel and from here we can actually tap
on this little picture here and get
another one of these crazy 3d views this
is of just your text messages this may
not have that much utility to be honest
it looks really cool but are you
actually ever going to go into this view
and flick through your text messages who
knows let's go to the right this is
another miscellaneous panel and there's
actually one missing that I want to show
you which I'll get to in a minute now to
manage all of your panels what you do is
you go into this view first and this is
that 3d view we started the video off
with and this is another example of
somewhere that the 3d effect is awesome
and it looks beautiful but it really has
no utility why would you ever want to
stay on your 3d carousel here and see
these animations unless you're showing
the effect to your friends so anyway we
can tilt around we can spin it at a
million miles an hour and get it to go
very very fast sort of pointless down
here we can manage our panels which is
very useful so here's the weather panel
that I left out that I want to show you
from here we can kind of move around we
can add new panels take certain ones
away and we can also set the color of
certain panels and select your default
so let's say I want the weather panel to
be the default I tap on it that click
set is home I can also change the
background color of the weather panel so
let's make it red you'll see that it
turns red so that when I go back to this
view you get that red color okay so
let's go to the weather panel this is
one of those pre-configured panels it's
the last one I wanted to show you it's
the weather panel
if you've got clouds or rain or
something you'll see a really cool
animation but when it's sunny you don't
see anything like that and we can go
through our forecast and move along like
so another piece of functionality here
if you take this little 3d button down
there and slide it to the right or left
it will automatically jump into this
crazy 3d spinny view such as something
to note also down here is a duck dock is
very important so that no matter what
homescreen you're on you always have the
programs that you use the most by
default
SPB mobile shell will populate the dock
with phone text messaging web which I
changed and the program duck the program
dock or the program tray it's very
simple just as a listing of programs to
change any of these it's very easy you
tap and hold you get a little chooser
here let's say I wanna have calendar B
in the dock and boom the icon is
replaced you've got calendar very easy
to do there now let's talk about some of
the kind of widget functionality there's
something called edit mode and if you
tap and hold on a particular widget
you'll get a green arrow on anything
that can be changed or configured so
here we've got a green arrow if I tap on
that it will change the look in the feel
of that particular widget let's try to
find some more green arrows here should
be able to find a couple like for
example here calendar so by tap on the
green arrow it will expand to show me
more information or it will collapse
just to be an icon on the screen and a
lot of other widgets will have this
functionality so if we tap and hold
here's the menu that we get and from
here we can add more widgets we can add
a program link just as simple as that or
we can add an SBB widget a lot of these
have different looks and feels to them
so if we go to favorites here's a good
example of a configurable changeable
widget we get a green arrow we can tap
to show my four favorite people or my 8
favourite people if there is enough room
on this homescreen I could actually see
12 so if I remove flashlight and do this
for 8 maybe not maybe there's only 8
inside of there another cool thing about
mobile shell and what they do and I
actually need to put a program or two on
the screen here
to show you that is that you get a
little tray in the bottom that you can
use to help organize your home screens
so have you ever had the situation where
you have a home screen full of icons and
the only way to switch the order of two
icons is to delete one move the other
one and then add the other one back well
with mobile shell you don't have that
problem because you have this little
waiting area this little dock on the
bottom that you can drag programs or
folders to and you can sort of keep them
for later us whenever you're done
organizing your home screens so let's
take a look at the other mobile shell
widgets that you can add they're kind of
basic to be honest we've got the weather
one which lets you switch between a wide
variety of weather styles so if we just
there's probably about five of them so
really lets you change that and here's
another cool feature you tap on this
little grid you get this 3d view once
again another example of where the 3d
effect is really awesome but the utility
is kind of low why would you want to
ever look at your weather like this I
mean it's backwards and obviously you're
supposed to look at it more like this
but the fact that it can rotate to a
point that you can't even read what is
going on in the particular widget it's
just kind of a little bit silly it's a
little bit fancy and it's it's very
clear that SPB was trying to wow people
with this and they did but they've kind
of forgotten the utility in some of
these areas so that's a pretty cool
widget let's delete that off the screen
and see what other widgets we can show
you that come from SBB birthdays is
pretty interesting
we've got messaging calendar all of
these system indicators really you even
get your own SBB battery widget with
percentages which is always good or you
can add your own Android widgets let's
say you've downloaded Android widgets
from the marketplace for example and
I've downloaded the battery you can use
your good old Android widgets you don't
need to use the ones that SPB have
specified for you so if you're somebody
that really likes eye candy you're going
to love SPB mobile shell if you're
somebody that likes things lean and
clean without all of the visual fanfare
and with lots of utility you might want
to stick with launcher pro or ADW
launcher it's really up to you
really quick let's see how much program
memory we're using right now on SBB
mobile shell 3d so we'll go into the
settings wherever that might be there it
is and we're going to go to applications
and here we are
SBB mobile shell using about ten
megabytes of of RAM that's actually not
that bad
launch a pro an ADW launcher come pretty
close to that so it's not it's not going
to SAP that much performance from your
device SPB has done a good job with
memory management so you can keep that
in mind
if you liked this video please give it a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
