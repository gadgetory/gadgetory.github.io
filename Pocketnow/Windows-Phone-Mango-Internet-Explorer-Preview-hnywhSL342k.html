and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview all right next up we're
going to look at ie9 on windows phone
mango so here we are the address bar is
now at the bottom there's your refresh
button and there's nothing else for
Chrome the back button still does the
back having the address bar at the
bottom makes it a lot easier to reach
when you're typing something especially
one-handed you don't have to reach all
the way up there to get it so that's we
kind of like that and it doubles as a
search so i can do searches this way and
actually goes to bing so that's a good
thing everything else is down in this
menu so in order to switch tabs you got
to go down there there's your tabs
recent favorites add to favorites sure
to page everything is here so there's
favorites you got to go down there but
this is totally new internet explorer 9
it's the real code from the desktop so
its GPU accelerated and all that and
here i am at the internet explorer test
drive site if you want to you can follow
along at home by going to IE dot
microsoft.com / test drive / mobile i
have a couple other devices here that we
can compare to
okay so let's zoom out a little bit so
here's some html5 demos and performance
demos let's try the fish ie tank
and up here you can see the frame rate
that went 27 frames per second over here
this is Android is doing about 26 this
is the infuse 4g this was a little
faster but this was still doing pretty
good and the iOS is not doing anything
this is iOS four it's the 4th generation
ipod touch when else have we got about
business charts let's see some graphic
demos html5 and css3 so there you go saw
that animation and android an iphone we
have it doesn't even work let's try
another one
hampster revolution will do these one at
a time this is a html5 game
so you can see how that one's rendering
on the iphone let's try this one
you actually have music over here I have
to scratch the buttons the right time
with a hamster dance revolution and of
that let's try it down android
sure in volumes up
and no sound and we got some weird
clicking the yellow thing going on but
it's working okay with the video
panorama
this one's kind of laggy but these are
moving pretty nicely now let's see if
the video will play
so there you go only ie9 is able to play
the video see that one animates that's
how it's supposed to animate
let's try that one
I 9 has a geolocation feature now
up guess which one didn't work
so you've got some pretty awesome html5
support in I nine but you've got there's
a bug one bug with the geolocation
feature however everything else is very
very good and remember this is a Samson
in few um this is a focus this is an
infused this is the newest infuse 4g
that just came out and this is on a
really old one gate hurts processor from
what a couple years ago so you see
pretty good performance for something so
old hardware wise that's it for IE be
sure to check out Pacquiao calm for more
of our windows phone mango preview
that's it for now
