liking something from day one there's
your favorite city to visit your
favorite car no matter how old it is
your favorite watch or SmartWatch for
that matter that effect can be the same
for smartphones but after pretty much
reviewing some of the best devices of
the year that love at first sight hadn't
really clicked for me or at least not
until today I'm hiding under that one
pocket now and I have to spend 24 hours
with the HTC u 11 so here's the thing I
wasn't really expecting much of a
surprise with the new HTC u 11 the you
ultra was seriously my least favorite
phone to hold during my review given the
unnecessary heft but the U 11 is
something else entirely the 3d form
glass creates this very interesting
aspect of the overall design instead of
having an enable a curved display the
glass is actually thicker on the edges
almost making the aluminum frame
inexistent the result of the phone that
feels like if it were fully made of
glass with no sharp edges to account for
anywhere honestly not sure what it is
but it's my favorite feel on a phone in
2017 now what hasn't really survived at
all well after just one day of use is
this clear case it scratched stuff all
over on the outside and on the inside it
is a lint magnet sure free stuff in a
box is always great but I've had to
migrate back to my usual sleep on Amazon
and yes a chamois is a must in this
reflective glass finish setting it up
for the first time we have the new HTC
logo animation while heading to this
being about you the Wi-Fi Google
assistant an account set up for restore
all resemble your standard Android phone
from the beginning it's not until after
that that we're greeted by the option to
set up your HTC account and then to set
up edgesense which begins by asking you
to set the sensitivity at which you'll
be squeezing the phone for it to react
next up we have the you sonic setup
which you'll need the headphones for and
you simply have to press a button that
it detects the noise and adapts to it
automatically and you have the usual
fingerprint setup and after that things
actually begin to get weird see for a
company that closed that it doesn't
bring any blow to their phones part of
the set up has applications that suggest
for you to install with some of these
being exactly that load amendment bloat
continues and features like blade feeds
which include sponsored content
something I honestly don't understand
that a phone at this price range
separate features like the HTC Sense
companion have to be set separately
since there's no secondary display like
on the you ultra you get these random
bubbles like chat heads on the display
with suggestions right now it's too
early to replicate it or for this
feature to be of any use and everything
else we have the standard HTC Sense on
top of Android 7.1.1 this continues to
be my favorite Android skin given its
minimalism with some new additions like
the pixels contextual menus when you
long press an icon making the cuts this
also continues to be my favorite version
of Android given its battery
optimizations so far the U 11 has lasted
me through my first day without a
problem the time will tell if that holds
up this particular review unit is a
snapdragon 835 variants with four gigs
of ram and 64 gigs of storage and
dual-sim capabilities and trade in the
space from that memory card performance
is obviously top-notch but I can't say
that I've been really impressed with
call quality as with previous HTC phones
boomsound high five speakers have been
plenty loud for content consumption as
for active noise cancellation overuse
sonic well these are no Sennheiser's but
audio over headphones can get so loud
but I seriously can't hear any noise
more from wants real audio review coming
very soon the camera has also been quite
impressive HTC has reduced the size of
the ultra pixels in favor of a wider
aperture in order to shave most of the
camera hump that we saw with the u ultra
my first batch of photos have been quite
impressive during the day and also
overnight once real camera view will
come very soon to shed more details on
what you get
here overall for my first day of using
this phone I'll tell you this much it
looks like a flagship it feels like a
flagship then yes it runs like a
flagship just like in the case of the
HTC 10 this is another device without
compromise from HTC we'll be reporting
back with our school review in the days
ahead in addition to our standard batch
