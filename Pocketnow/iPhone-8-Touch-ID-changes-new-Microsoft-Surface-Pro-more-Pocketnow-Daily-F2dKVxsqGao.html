Microsoft has just launched the new
surface pro new leak schematic show us
that the final design of the iPhone 8th
continues changing we get details on the
puzzle color options for the 1+5 i'm hi
mary vera yes i did go see the recent
guardians of the galaxy lately i did
shed a couple of Tears I know you did
too this is out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you are in the market for the Galaxy s8
on t-mobile that buy one get one free
deal that we saw on t-mobile for the g6
is available for the GF sate as well so
it's kind of different you actually end
up paying $100 for the other phone but
you came to loop that over 24 months and
there are a couple of other conditions
that I highly suggest you look in the
link in the description and a laptop day
starts with Huawei the company just had
its event in Berlin we get to see them
eight-foot x and mate book II are on
Jules Wang was able to be at the pre
briefed here in New York and so far
these computers are really good not just
for the design but specifications in the
whole round of what you're getting for
the money you can learn more about our
hands-on experience on the links below
as well and speaking of laptops
Microsoft took the stage is well in
Shanghai to show us its new surface pro
and the company is actually dropping the
number it's no longer surface pro 5 or
anything like that now this new surface
pro is actually a change in a ton of
things starting with the fact that you
can now get a fanless version with the
core and processor but you can also get
the latest seventh generation cores from
Intel that's all great but even more
interesting is the fact that the company
is kind of changing its appeal now it's
no longer a tablet that can be a laptop
now Microsoft is calling it a laptop up
to the point where the surface pen is
actually not bundled but it includes a
ton of changes that actually make it
worth 100 bucks which in the past was
only costing 50 and yet it's actually
not a cheap computer it's not but from
my experience with the surface pro 4 I
honestly cannot wait to test that new
surface pro I'm really in love with that
computer and we cannot wait to hear more
about when
or how soon we can get it now about the
1+5 we've seen leaks of the camera leaks
of the chassis we've seen leaks of the
specs but today we get to hear the color
options or possible ones seems we're
getting black red and some sort of tone
that looks to be between gold and silver
but even more interesting there is this
unicorn color option that seems to be
blue and that it changes color and well
there are so many things you could do
with anodized aluminum that we can't
wait to see what we get and finally the
very hot news they have to do with the
iPhone 8 and more changes in the design
in the past we have seen leaked
schematics that showed us the hole below
the Apple logo for the fingerprint
scanner then we saw some newer ones then
have one now they're back and these
leaked schematics look legit you have a
vertical cameras there and it's horrible
but the reason why this is the hottest
news is because yesterday the comments
got really heated
we saw some possible leak dummies that
eventually apparently got debunked of
the Galaxy Note 8 from Samsung the fact
that it didn't have a fingerprint
scanner hole at the back and that well
we were like okay either they figured
out everything to do with the display or
they're just ditching the fingerprint
scanner which I don't know with
everything that Samsung did with the
Galaxy s8 in the horrible placement it
just made sense for the company to want
to get rid of it so yeah it could just
be that synaptics has figured it out at
least for Samsung but then it hasn't for
apple with the leaked schematics or
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day I mean do you really feel that
companies are going to be able to bring
a fingerprint scanner in a display in
2017 the comments got heated yesterday I
wish they did but you know with all the
polarizing changes we saw with the s8
now that we've seen with the iPhone 8
then we probably will get with a no date
I don't think it's going to happen but
paid this is just me I hope they do
trust me leave us a comment down below
