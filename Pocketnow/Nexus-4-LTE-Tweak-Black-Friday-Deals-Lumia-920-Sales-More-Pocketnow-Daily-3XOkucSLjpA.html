tweak app store is going crazy with
black friday deals and the Lumia 920
sees incredible demand and Amazon I'm hi
Mary vana wishing you a happy
thanksgiving yesterday and this is
 out daily
now the hottest news that was happening
yesterday while you were all eating
turkey was the fact that we've got some
leaked images of the HTC DLX aka deluxe
the alexan I don't really care what the
phone is going to be called this is the
same variant of the j butterfly or droid
DNA device that you know currently on
verizon now the coolest news about this
phone is aside from the fact that we've
got some really good images of it is
also the fact that according to the
source will get more information on
december six oaks at your calendars now
speaking of turkey we know that most of
you are probably stuck right now in a
line for black friday deals and probably
watching this on your phone what if
warning a company that's not going to
give you any significant deals as apple
none of them are newsworthy up to the
point of mentioning but we do see that
AT&amp;amp;T is now offering the iphone 5
refurbished for really cheap on their
website now obviously this is a
refurbished device but apparently you
are getting a warranty i haven't been
able to confirm that so just make sure
you look out for that but it's being
sold really cheap and considering the
fact that it's really hard to get an
iphone 5 right now i guess this is the
second best thing to do now speaking of
deals we know that a lot of companies
carriers and OEMs are offering a lot of
deals on their gadgets but the ones that
are really going all out our software
companies our advice to you is visit
your respective app store because you'll
notice that gameloft EA and other
software titles are offering a lot of
games half price or even free at some
cases so make sure you follow that now
when it comes to deals the phone that
started being sold on day one as a deal
is the nokia lumia 920 and it's
currently sold out almost everywhere
amazon is claiming incredible demand for
the device and if you want to get it for
example with the non contract price of
150 bucks well now amazon is selling it
for five hundred and eighty bucks if you
can get it after two weeks with a
backwater some are even seeing dates of
january for 2013 and i'm really happy
for nokia because they're finally
getting a break but sadly i couldn't
secure the vice so i'm not happy for me
donations anyone and finally for the
interesting news of the day remember the
fact that your nexus 4 isn't capable of
LTE out of the box but it does include
an SOC that is capable of providing LT
being the snapdragon s4 pro well knew
how to's and even videos now show that
it is capable of providing LT after
some minor tweaks with the device links
in the description and well even though
we aren't capable of doing that with our
review unit just yet that leads me to
the question of the day just how
important is LTE to you up to the fact
of having to tweak the device we're not
really sure this is really going to work
for you in the United States or in other
countries it is working only on Canada
apparently but for us it is a deal
breaker so leave us a comment down below
and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on vaca now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
