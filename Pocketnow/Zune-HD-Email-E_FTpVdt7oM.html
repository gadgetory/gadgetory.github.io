com microsoft recently released a new
app for the zune HD called email that's
right first time for the zune HD to have
an email client so let's check out here
we are loading the email client and if I
do the back button here's my windows
live account this is going to download
all my emails unfortunately every time
you open it has to redownload all the
emails so we're going to take some time
they're doing a lot of downloading I can
switch to unread or urgent the screen is
a lot smaller than you would normally
have on a windows phone 7 device like
that so the buttons are a little bit
more difficult to press but it works
pretty well and let's look at the best
by email not HTML but you can read it
and down here we have a little buttons
for reply delete and moving back and
forth to the newer or older messages
pretty similar to windows phone 7 and
we've got a little back button up there
Sobek my accounts I said I set up an
exchange 2003 account but it doesn't
seem to work it just kind of sits on
this please wait window year so exchange
2003 doesn't work probably only sports
2007 and higher I had a settings I can
add an account however my own choices
are windows live exchange in gmail I
tried to set up with an IMAP email
account but it just was not working so
not sure how to get a pop3 or you know
any kind of other
account in here so that's kind of pain
but if you've got windows live exchange
2007 or gmail should be working pretty
good and you can see again it's download
in all my messages again a message like
this and
let's take a look at the windows phone 7
version so see a lot of similarities
here same all unread urgent and you see
pretty much the same buttons down here
so very similar to the windows phone 7
and that's it for the zune HD email app
