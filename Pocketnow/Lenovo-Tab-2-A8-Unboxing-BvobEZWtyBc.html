tablet from Lenovo but that's exactly
what we're getting with the Tab 2 a8 I'm
Hayashi huesemann pocket now and let's
take a closer look so taking a look at
the box itself it's a pretty simple
setup here we've got the Lenovo branding
up at the top as well as a photo of the
tablet itself and a call-out to the size
and the resolution at the bottom so
that's 8 inches at 1280 by 800 looking
at the sides it's pretty clean again
nothing on the left-hand side Lenovo on
the top and bottom barcodes on the back
and then on the right-hand side there's
actually a little indication that this
tablet won best budget Android tablet
for Android Pitts which is pretty cool
so we're going to go ahead and just open
up the box and get right into the tablet
and see what we've got inside let's
slide this open right here there we go
up front and center we've got the tablet
itself which is wrapped up in a bit of
plastic we're going to go ahead and move
that out of the way for just a second so
we can take a look at what else is in
the box and they don't really give you
any little lift tab or anything to make
it easier to pull out of the box you
kind of just got to go for it so we'll
set that aside and look at what else is
in here
up top we have some we've got the safety
warranty and Quick Start Guide and some
other literature we're going to set that
aside and then it's a pretty simple
inclusion in the box you just have the
micro USB cable and a standard wall wart
I think you can see that we'll take that
out of the packaging it's got a little
little circular indent in there which is
I guess kind of nice and a single USB
port right there
getting into the tablet itself we'll go
ahead and pull it out of its little
plastic packaging that it's slipped into
and here is the tab to a 8 you can see
it's got this sort of a blue soft touch
back into it with again a pretty clean
and simple design you get a load of a
branding up top and a Dolby call out at
the bottom as well as a camera in the
top left-hand corner over on the left
side the right side from our perspective
there's a micro USB slot
just kind of nice we'll go ahead and
close that flat back up and you can see
on the front again pretty simple with
the Lenovo branding there's actually
front firing speakers on this which is
really really nice to see at at a low
price point like this so we got two
front firing speakers front facing
camera and the eight inch display which
again has a resolution of 1280 by 800 on
the right-hand side bezel there is a
power button at the bottom and then a
volume rocker up-and-down we'll go ahead
and turn this thing on and while we're
looking at the rest of it up top there's
the headphone jack on the left hand side
and the microUSB port on the top right
with nothing on the back except 8 on the
bottom rather except a microphone pin
hole just starting it up you can see
Lenovo for those who do we're going to
go ahead and get this set up and take a
look at the start screen so it sets off
like any other Android tablet running on
lollipop we're gonna go ahead and just
get this set up we've got that little
sound of the Android keyboard before the
sound is disabled which we're going to
do very quickly getting into the
software itself hopefully in just a
second there we go
setup is complete let's get into the
software here you can see it's a
slightly customized version of Android
lollipop it actually looks pretty
similar it's still got the white
circular app drawer still behaves the
same way with the horizontally scrolling
paginate adapt drawer swipe down from
the top and we have the the system
toggles right here as well as a shortcut
to the settings so it looks like a very
slimmed down version of a skin on top of
the Android lollipop seems very very
close to stock is why is what I'm
getting at
icons are a little bit different the the
interface just looks a tiny bit
different but for the most part this is
a at least from first impression it's
looking and feeling a lot like Stocking
enjoyed so far which is nice to see so
we're gonna have more coverage on this
coming very soon thank you guys for
