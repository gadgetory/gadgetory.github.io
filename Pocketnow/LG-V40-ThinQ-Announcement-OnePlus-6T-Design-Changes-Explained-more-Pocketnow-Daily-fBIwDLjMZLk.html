yes we've got more lenses than a user
can handle the Microsoft Surface pro 6
and surface laptop two were just
announced then they definitely impressed
if you're wondering what the excuse is
for removing the headphone jack on the
one plus six it seems it just got
confirmed I'm Jaime Rivera and
definitely my god
why is everybody launching products like
right now why can't we spread it out
throughout the year this is fog it out
daily brought to you by swap the
official news today are kind of
inexistent we'll leave them for the end
because they're actually hot let's begin
with the case of Sony Evan blasts has
just leaked some images of changes in
the design of Sony phones and we've been
waiting for changes for a long time it's
not that the company has bad design to
the contrary they're nice it's just
they're kind of dated and yes we have
chilly have received the sony xperia x
III it's right there for review
I'm just so swamped with work right now
I'll get to it at some point now let's
talk about Huawei as well we're waiting
for the huawei mate 20 in May 20 Pro to
be announced very soon I'm definitely
looking forward to these phones in
particular but we've got rumors of a
watch of Huawei watch GT it seems and
well we have been waiting for a refresh
from Huawei for it but design and the
leaks looks really cool in the
specifications look decent we're just
not exactly sure if it's gonna be better
than the offerings that we have or not
and we're wondering why of the Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear 3100 I believe is not
going to be ready in time for this watch
let's see what we get now let's talk
about oneplus as we've got the oneplus
sixty coming up very soon the company's
CEO Peter Lau was recently in an
interview and he spilled the beans over
why we're now getting a headphone jack
according to him there had to be
placement for the on display fingerprint
scanner and apparently there's an
improved water resistance even though
there's still not a rating because it
would make the phone too expensive
whatever the case let us know in the
comments what you think about the lack
of it how about if we talk about
Microsoft we have a full video over our
experience at the Microsoft of it
yesterday I am a big fan of the surface
pro and we've got the new six model with
a new color option great internals
and then we've got the surface laptop
which is the version 2 great internals
as well new color options
I just I'm scratching my head over the
lack of USB see on these two computers
particularly when you've got the surface
go that's got USB see there are new
Microsoft Surface headphones that have
you as BC as well they look really cool
as well I highly recommend you watch the
video and finally the hottest news today
I have to do with the LGV 40 thank you I
hate the name I don't hate the phone the
experience using it has been fabulous
the event was great and definitely LG
has shown us that five cameras on a
phone is possible I love the whole
concept of the telephoto and the wide
and honestly there are some changes in
the design that are not evident but they
make the phone feel so great
let us know in the comments down below
what do you think about this phone would
you buy the g40 or not in my case I
would I find it expensive but I still
would leave us a comment down below and
folks we would like to thank swapper for
sponsoring this video and making our
content possible now we have new iPhones
out Apple has discontinued some of our
favorite models like the iPhone 10
iPhone 6s plus in the iPhone S II you
can still get those phones in a gently
used condition over at swap ax check out
