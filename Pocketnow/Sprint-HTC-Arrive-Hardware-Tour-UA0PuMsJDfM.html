calm and this is the hardware tour of
the HTC arrived running on sprint's
network and it's kind of nice that
sprint waited to release the very first
cdma Windows Phone 7 because this device
has the latest operating system of
Windows Phone 7 which allows for copy
and paste and all other sorts of
improvements so let's get started
okay so the first thing you'll probably
notice is that the front of the arrive
is pretty symmetrical I like the design
I like that the headset speaker is
underneath this metallic match along
with the notification LED on the bottom
though it doesn't make much sense
because the microphone is actually on
the bottom of the device we have our HTC
emblem right here our sprint emblem here
this is a three point six inch glass to
pass the multi-touch screen which is
running at wvga resolution on the bottom
we have our three capacitive buttons
that are required for windows phone 7 on
the top of the device we have our power
standby button our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on this side the device
we have our volume rocker along with our
micro USB port and I've already showed
you the microphone on the bottom so we
can go to this side our dedicated camera
button which does have a 5 megapixel
camera and can slow the back to see that
5 megapixel camera along with our
speaker right here and this does have
Dolby sound and incorporated we also
have our LED flash on the bottom we had
this little design feature which is kind
of odd i don't know why they chose to
put that right there and of course we
have our full qwerty keyboard which is a
five row keyboard and its really nice to
use a this is probably one of the best
keyboards I've ever used maybe in
comparison of the touch pro two and we
have our tilting screen which is spring
loaded so uh take that as you will to
get the battery off its kind of weird
the screen has to be open and it also
has to be tilted all the way open so we
just pop off this and this is mega made
of metal and on the back we have our
battery and this is a 1500 milliamp hour
battery we also do not have a slot for a
micro SD card but the device does have
16 gigabytes of internal memory so some
preliminary specs the arrive is running
at 1 gigahertz processing speed along
with 448 megabytes of RAM this device
also has assisted GPS an accelerometer
digital compass
22.1 we have Wi-Fi b/g/n n and the CDMA
radios are eight hundred and nineteen
hundred bands so this is in the hardware
tour of the HTC arriving on sprint's
network and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
leave some comments down below and stay
tuned for the software tour where we'll
show you how Microsoft has changed the
operating system from the older Windows
Phone 7 devices to this newer windows
phone 7 thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
