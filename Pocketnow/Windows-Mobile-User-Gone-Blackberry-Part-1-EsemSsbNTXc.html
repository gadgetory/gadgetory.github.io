i've just received a blackberry 8820
from t-mobile for review this is my
first actual use of blackberry that's
more than you know five minutes long so
it will be a learning experience for me
so this is fresh opened I've only used a
little bit with GPS today so these are
literally my first impressions on the
middle is a trackball and we I see the
t-mo my faves on the front here it's
pretty easy to understand says like to
add my faves so I can do that if I use
the trackball go down I get some icons
here that something like it kind of hard
to understand but if I wrote a little
right and left the label shows up so I
can read that it which is I'd rather be
able to see it right away but that's how
you access those and then over here on
the bottom left is a weird-looking
button with some black spots on it I
guess those are berries maybe if I press
that because whole list of more icons I
kind of thought this might have been
similar to the weird-looking icon on
symbian s60 devices that would toggle
between the home screen and the program
screen but it doesn't if i press it
again brings up a little menu over here
and i don't know i have to use the back
button here to get back to that home
screen
so that's kind of weird that this button
would have different functions like that
and problem with all these icons is none
of them say what they are if you look at
them you can kind of tell that's a
calendar this one looks like a black
thing this one there's a speaker there
okay well it turns out you have to use
this track ball to scroll through and
then read what it says at the bottom to
understand what that economies so this
isn't very easy I actually tried to
switch applications in the car while out
a stoplight on the way home and this
track ball you can't actually feel how
Matt how many items it scrolls across so
you really have to look at the screen in
order to make sure that you're selecting
the right icon now I went to maps and it
brings up a map of just full screen map
you can't see what to do here there's no
information about searching or
navigating or anything like that so I
have to press the blackberry button
again and the menu comes up
now I wanted to get some directions and
I choose where I am at the top here and
it says searching for satellites but if
you leave this here for like a couple
hours so it won't do anything
so you actually have to type in an
address and then you can type in your
destination and it makes this purple
line but if you go to gps navigation
mode surgeon sir satellites again it
will actually find satellites if I
wasn't indoors but the directions only
start from where you specified the
address and it doesn't recalculate when
I move somewhere nor does it give me any
voice prompts about which way to go so
it's really not that useful there's not
many other options here either
there's a lot of scrolling one thing I
did find was if i type a letter it'll
jump to that item in the menu but if
there's two H's you type it twice to
find the one you want you can't just
memorize a certain letter and no that'll
activate that also it's not even being
activated it just jumps to that item I
still have to press the middle of the
trackball to activate it so that's about
it for now I have not even plugged this
in to sync it or set up email or
anything like that until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
