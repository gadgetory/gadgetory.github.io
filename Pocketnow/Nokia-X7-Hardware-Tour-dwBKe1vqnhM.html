pocketnow.com the Nokia x7 is an
entertainment phone at least that's what
the finished manufacturer calls it or
likes to call it it's been released just
a couple of weeks ago together with
Symbian Anna it will be shipping out of
the box with the new Symbian platform
and today we're going to take a look at
the hardware specifications build
quality and we'll compare it to some
popular smartphones on the market
Makia is known for using top-notch built
quality materials and the finishing
touches with smartphones and the Nakia
x7 isn't much different from the Nokia
trend they have managed to build over
time a standard in terms of quality and
in terms of delivering top-tier hardware
let's see what the Nokia x7 which we got
here features first of all it's a pretty
lightweight smartphone it feels very
good in hand and the materials used are
very very good quality I didn't manage
to see any squeaking sounds at all
it feels rock solid it's got some
rounded edges around the corner and it
makes it feel even even more thinner in
the hand let's compare it to the iPhone
4 for instance as you can see it's a
little bit thicker at the middle but
because it's got those rounded edges it
feels to be a little bit thinner let's
see how it compares to the HTC Desire
they're roughly the same pretty much the
same in terms of height it's definitely
higher dollar and again let's see it's
almost compared to the iPhone 4 yes it's
definitely taller but the screen is also
bigger and let's take a classic let's
take the HTC hd2 they're quite about the
same it's almost
and thickness so hardware-wise
the nokia has a speaker grille at the
top and on the left and on the right
side you will find your sensors for
proximity and light there's not much
else on the top we got a four inch
AMOLED screen which if you can see turns
to blue which is classic for AMOLED
screens if you take a look at the screen
from a certain angle it's got four
inches in diagonal and it uses an HD
resolution which is pretty much common
for Nokia smartphones
it's got 360 pixels across and 640 down
on the bottom we got our menu button
which is good for bringing up your menu
while in the operating system or
double-clicking it will bring up the
multitasking features on the right side
we've got the volume rockers for volume
up and volume down which got pretty good
feedback to them and what's best we've
got a hardware camera button which can
be used to access directly the camera
application so wherever you are if you
hold the camera button it will go into
the camera mode and you can also snap a
picture or start recording a video with
this button at the bottom we got nothing
but a microphone hole at the back we'll
see the eight megapixel camera which is
not your 12 megapixel carl zeiss optics
camera on the na but it's a pretty solid
camera as you can see
the camera post it's got 8 megapixels in
sensor size and it's got a dual LED
flash which Nakia calls a
third-generation dual LED flash the
Nokia branding and the model number also
you can see here you've got a microphone
hole so if you're hoarding holding your
smartphone like this while you are
recording something it will also pick up
the sounds from the back as well as from
from the bottom and here comes the
tricky part because this smartphone
doesn't have a detachable backplate you
cannot replace the battery or access the
battery which is by the way of 1200
milliamp hours according to the nokia
specifications you will have to access
your microSD card as well as your SIM
card from these two slots which I
personally find a little bit awkward now
if you slide your finger all the way
down until this dot here then the top
will pop up you will have to grab that
top part and somehow force the trade to
come out with with the SIM card and you
can do exactly the same for accessing
the micro SD card which is by the way
included and it's an 8 gigabyte micro SD
card other specifications include a 350
megabyte internal storage which
according to some is a little bit too
less but the operating system handles
itself very well and of course you've
got the a gigabyte pre-installed micro
sd card which can be upgraded to 32
gigabytes if you have many pictures
videos or other content which you might
want to store in other terms at the at
the top you've got your micro USB
charging port and also syncing port
you've got your 3 port but 3.5 I'm sorry
I never get this right 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and your power button
which is a little bit angled but it's
it's great if you access it like this
it's got a nice sense to it so you can
puppet anytime let's take a look at the
first boot on the malkia x7 with Symbian
Anna and we're back and let's start the
device to see its first boot it will
take a couple of minutes so we will come
back and get back to the device once it
finished booting up so here we are back
let's try to boot this baby for the
first time and see how long it gets for
it to boot if it takes too long we'll
just cut out and get back to the device
once you finish loading so here we have
it
it's a white screen for now
let's see that typical Nokia and shaking
helping logo and we're back
still loading
and their tanake logo and not far from
now we'll see the Nokia logo being
followed by the Windows Phone logo since
Nakia and Microsoft announced their
partnership back in February but let's
get back to the x7 and Symbian Anna
let's select our language which is
English and it straight from the start
wants to connect us to OB Nokia we have
a Nakia account
and it's thinking it's trying to connect
but we have no data connections your
Wi-Fi router set up so we can expect the
AEF an error to be displayed here we go
we don't want to transfer anything at
the moment let's get to the operating
system let's skip this and let's get
this - and this is your typical Symbian
home screen it's got also sliding
screens like you'd be experiencing out
of android smartphone at the moment it's
got three and you can toggle between
them with this button here but we won't
take a closer look at the operating
system when we was you are full software
review so this was the Nokia x7 Hardware
tour and first move this was has been
denied front pocket never come thank you
very much for watching and it can take
this video please give it a thumbs up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
