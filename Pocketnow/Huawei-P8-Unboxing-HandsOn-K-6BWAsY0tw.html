mate seven that hallway knows a thing or
two about fancy packaging but this is
taking things to a whole new level I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our unboxing and first look at the
Huawei p8 smartphone we've already gone
hands-on with Huawei's new flagship
smartphone but we weren't allowed to
film or take pictures of the p8 and we
didn't see the retail packaging the
sleeve on the outside is made of a
rubbery textured material and the only
marking aside from the labels is the
phone's name note the dropped ascend
brand of years previous it's just the p8
pulling that sleeve aside we get a kind
of shower door like preview of the phone
itself and the interesting way it's
packaged while most phones sit under the
box cover face up Huawei has slotted it
in sideways making for a new and fun and
somewhat delicate extraction that the
company equates to taking a book from
the shelf as you can see we've got the
mystic champagne model here one of the
two colours available in the standard 16
gig configuration we'll put it aside
just long enough to check out the
accessories that come with it tightly
slotted sub boxes that contain or will
contain product literature as well as a
power adapter cable and bundled ear but
it's all beautifully done there's a lot
of stuff packed in here with precision
not just tossed in to rattle around like
Cracker Jacks and if you're the buyer
who's spent over five hundred dollars on
this phone folks this is the first
impression you get of this device that's
why the unboxing experience is so
crucial if we scored retail packaging
I'd give this one almost a perfect 10
let's move over to the phone who's
protective back-cover tells us where to
find the sim and micro SD card slots
side keys and the optically stabilized
13 megapixel camera and NFC tap point
now that we know all that let's peel it
off quiet please
under the protector and the casing
material is a lot of solid hardware
akhirin 930 chipset three gigs of ram
and a 5.2 inch full HD display all of it
encased in a 6.4 millimeter thick
chassis making it the thinnest phone we
have in the Boston review lab at the
moment maybe that's why the battery is
just average in size at 26 80 milliamp
hours how does it feel in the hand what
right from the shipping container it's
hundred and forty four grams steel
casing is cool to the touch and it feels
very high-quality but those double
chamfers on the edges do dig into the
palm a bit also it's pretty plain
looking as I mentioned in my initial
hands-on at pocket now Kundel eye casts
Oni Xperia with a metal back whether you
like this super simplicity will of
course depend on you powering it up it's
no surprise to see that Huawei has
sauced up Android 5.0 with version 3.1
of its home ground emui
it's more than just an interface paint
job it includes a new always listening
voice assistant and broad improvements
to everything from phone calls to
antenna software to the camera
viewfinder whose interface is a little
familiar by the by this is just
scratching the surface though there are
an awful lot of added features that are
going to take a full review treatment to
suss out fortunately that's just what
we're here for we'll be testing the
Huawei p8 alongside the new talk band b2
at the ephah global press conference in
Malta this week so expect some photos on
our social feeds and be sure to let us
know what you want to know about the
Huawei p8 leave a comment down below
until next time this has been michael
fisher with pocket now pouring a little
out for the ascend brand-name we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
