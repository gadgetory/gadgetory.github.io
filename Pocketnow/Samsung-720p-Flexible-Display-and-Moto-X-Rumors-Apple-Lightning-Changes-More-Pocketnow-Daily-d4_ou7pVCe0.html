for CES 2013 a Motorola X phone is
rumored for the same event and Apple
changes their mind about the lightning
connector I'm hi Mary better and if
you're able to watch this video it's
because probably the Mayan apocalypse
hasn't reached your time zone and this
is pocket now daily while Samsung and
the story of flexible displays is
nothing new we already saw an event in
the past in 2011 with a WVGA flexible
display being shown off and it was cool
but so far was rather gimmicky because I
still don't understand the point of a
flexible display if the phone is not
going to be flexible but like why
Samsung is planning to apparently envy
love flexible 720p display at CES 2013
let's just see if we get a flexible
phone as well now the next company to
make rumor mill is HTC and this time
because the report has them building not
one but two windows RT tablets and this
falls in line with Nokia's rumors of
them building a windows RT tablet though
the reporter wasn't nice enough to
provide dates on either of these
companies it could the mwc 2013 we're
just not sure if these tablets are gonna
be any better than the microsoft surface
which was a good product but not really
great just confusing now sony is a
confirmed player for CES 2013 their
president has planned on January seventh
and we're gonna be there covering it
live rumors haven't they're building a
yuga 1080p device and they're going to
be calling this the xperia z and if they
ran out of the alphabet that means that
this device must be a monster it must be
a great phone hopefully they're fast
devices haven't been that great and they
were already by the tea though we're
still not sure if this device will be
launched at CES 2013 it could be or it
could just be mwc we'll keep you posted
but the event is happening now after
Motorola spend 2012 being the complete
underdog of the mobile market even after
Google bought the company new rumors
have the company building an X phone and
an X tablet and apparently visits
Google's new plan for 2013 apparently
this device is supposed to be a
monstrous phone and a monstrous tablet
we're not sure if that's going to happen
at CES or mwc most likely CS will be the
case we're just wondering what they mean
by monstrous great tablets hopefully it
means great
and when it comes to specs and not
necessarily you know just an ugly device
we'll see and finally for the whatever
news of the day Apple apparently has
changed their mind about the Lightning
connector policies if you remember
yesterday we reported about a company
called p 0 p that was closing down their
iOS charger projects just because Apple
didn't want to approve them of using the
Lightning connector which makes no sense
in the world since everything is made
for ipod lately and it only makes sense
that the new verge would be the
lightning connector now this leads me to
the question of the day I mean do you
like the fact that Apple has to be
approving every company that has to use
their connectors or why shouldn't they
just use micro USB in my particular case
I don't care if they use proprietary or
not I just care that we have a lot of
accessories to be benefited on so leave
us a comment down below and if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi metairie venom thanks for watching
see you Monday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
