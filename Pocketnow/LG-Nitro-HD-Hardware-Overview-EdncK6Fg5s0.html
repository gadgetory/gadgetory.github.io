calm and it's time to take a look at the
hardware performance and specs of the LG
nitro HD and we are back now before we
start looking into the physical hardware
of this device the LG nitro HD let's go
ahead and talk about some of these specs
that are actually running behind the
scenes I just over all the measurements
itself it's a 4.5 inch high-definition
screen is an LCD screen which the jury
is still out will actually give you a
comparison the next few minutes of this
LCD versus an AMOLED screen the
resolution on this 4.5 inch screen is
720 x 1280 so it is officially an HD
screen it has a pixel density of 329 ppi
pixels per inch on the processing side
of things this device is powered by a
dual-core 1500 megahertz or 1.5
gigahertz processor one gigabyte of RAM
on the storage side of things it has 4
gigabytes of built-in memory for your
applications pictures media you name it
it does have a micro SD card slot which
is capable of using up to 32 gigabytes
and on the radio side of things this is
an eighteen t phone as you can see right
here it's branded right by AT&amp;amp;T it's not
unlocked at least right off the bat so
it's going to be compatible your typical
AT&amp;amp;T bands of 850 900 1800 1900 and 20
megahertz respectively vary their LTE
will run a different spectrum it's
actually going to use some 700 which i
believe is class 17 as well as 1700 in
the 21 megahertz spectrum for the LTE 4G
side of things staying with the radio
theme this guy is capable of using Wi-Fi
b/g/n and has bluetooth 3.0 it's not the
newest four point oh but it is somewhat
up there so let's go ahead and dive in
now to the device itself the first thing
we want to show off here and we've noted
in the past video so there are three
capacitive buttons instead of having for
LG is opted to have three of caution of
your home button your back button and
the button on the left side actually
doubles as a search and a menu button so
by long pressing you'll actually able to
search and by just tapping one time
you'll be able to bring up the menu
moving to the bottom of the device
you'll have the ability to take off the
bat
coverage will do in a second on the left
side you're going to have the volume
rocker up and down switch the top the
device will have the headphone jack of
course 3.5 millimeter you're off in your
lock or power in your lock button and
then you'll have your micro USB charging
port it has a door over that port which
is all personal opinion you may not like
having these extra ports hanging when
you're charging it but it does also
provide protection so you may not get
anything stuck in there moving over to
the right side of the device it's smooth
there are no camera buttons nothing
along those lines and as you can see
here the device is is relatively thin it
has a very very sturdy build to it the
back has a industrial look it's plastic
but it almost looks like a steel or a
galvanized theme it's going to have the
8 megapixel rear camera with an LED
flash capable of recording up a 1080p
and the front camera will be 1.3
megapixel for the video our next two
videos will actually be testing the
video recording of these two cameras
let's go ahead and get the back cover
open as you'll see on the battery it is
an 1800 30 million power battery will
have your SIM card slot and your microSD
card slot which it comes with a 16
gigabyte so I'm going to keep in mind
though it is upgradeable to 32 gigabytes
AT&amp;amp;T has begun rolling out their network
in places like Boston Massachusetts it's
not everywhere yet but it is a slow
build out and they will get there
eventually if we go ahead and bring up
the speed test application we actually
went to Boston right in the center of
boston actually in cambridge and ran a
few speed tests let's go the results
real quick over here now as you can see
the first few tests that we ran i'll
zoom in a little bit the first few tests
that we ran were on 3g so we're looking
at roughly 2.2 up not even half down as
you can see we're pretty low we're below
to except for the first text test two
megabytes per second up and in many
cases very poor ping times and upload
speeds but the most recent two were done
in a 4g area as you can see we have
almost
1d it's actually 19 megabits per second
down and almost 10 up the big thing to
keep in mind here are the ping times
also increased drastically so in our
numerous testing both with the speed
test application and just typical web
browsing 80 s 4g LTE does pass our tests
if you're in an LTE area we actually
went ahead and ran the same test on a
verizon wireless 4g LTE device in the
same exact spot with the droid razr and
we actually got lower speeds now that
may have been because of the time of day
these down here are on Wi-Fi these
appear on the 4g LTE better ping time
but slower speeds that may have been
because of the time of day early in the
morning maybe there are more verizon
customers in the area it's one of those
things will have to further test to see
who is the clear-cut winner running a
limp act protest you'll see the Nitro
come in at just over 53 m flops per
second running a multi thread test will
give it 78 almost almost ATM flops per
second running a full benchmark in
Quadrant
with the nitro HD coming in just over
2,300 2,300 22 to be exact we decided to
pit it up side by side with the motorola
droid razr which as you can see fared a
little better with a score of 26 6 6
since you've already ran the test of
these two side-by-side let's go ahead
and look at the screens will actually go
to pocket now calm now the nitro HD does
have a higher resolution and a higher
pixel density as a result however it is
an LCD screen whereas the droid razr is
an AMOLED screen it may be hard to tell
on the camera but while the nitro HD
does appear brighter the colors look
almost washed out whereas with the droid
razr they seem much more accurate much
deeper the Blues for example look much
deeper one of the latest buzz words is
in fact the pixel density and putting
them side-by-side you can actually tell
and see that the nitro HD does have a
much better pixel density the camera may
not pick it up but if we actually zoom
in here on these same text area on our
main page you can actually see the
individual pixels and some jag eNOS in
the font on the droid razr whereas in
the nitro everything looks very smooth
and that has been our harder overview of
the LG nitro HD if you enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
have any questions or if you'd like to
see further details on this device
