called modular LG g5 might be the cool
kid but the galaxy s7 and the
super-sized curve sibling the s7 edge
will probably outsell LG's latest and
greatest sure some of you will say that
this is just a 2.0 iteration like the
iPhone success versus the iPhone 6 but
those changes are nothing to ignore
I meant Andina is still recovering from
a Barcelona bug this is PocketNow and
you're watching our samsung galaxy s7
edge unboxing and first impressions we
pretty much knew from the beginning what
to expect before the official
announcement but we are still excited
because this phone is the 2016 Samsung
flagship it's been improve over last
year's model in almost every aspect well
let's get the unboxing part out of the
way really quickly box fast charger
cable headphones literature and the USB
OTG adapter done oh and the most
important part the phone and what a
beauty it is whether you're a Samsung
fan or not you have to admit it this
thing is gorgeous and the improved
design with the new subtle curve on the
back makes it feel even better in the
hand there's no easy way of describing
this sensation it's like the Galaxy Note
5 and the s6 edge+ had a baby a
beautiful smarter baby we don't want to
waste your time with specs you can find
them below we'll just mention that this
particular unit is the octa-core exynos
8090 version and not the quad-core
Snapdragon 820 variety you'll see in the
States and other regions the first thing
you'll notice is that the phone is big
well not as big as the iPhone 6s plus or
the note 5 and that's a good thing it's
also less bulky less intrusive the
upgraded materials makes you want to
grab it from the table just to touch it
just to feel it one more time and that's
how good the s7 edge
eels in the hand the phone feels like it
was designed to perfectly fit the palm
of your hand and that is something we
don't say often about phones which makes
you think twice about taking it for a
swim despite the fact that it can now
take it it's right there on the box i
p60 waiting for water and dust
resistance know what it flaps no ports
covered no bulk just plain and simple
water resistance and you can also expand
the onboard 32 or 64 gigs of storage
with the return of the micro SD card
slot the phone feels really snappy
Samsung's UI is less intrusive than
you'd expect
and everything you throw at it seems to
be easily handled putting a smile on
your face will have to go through the
entire testing process to see how well
the processor behaves what the benefits
of four gigs of ram are battery life and
the new camera with less but larger and
more intelligent pixels for now our
first impressions are mainly governed by
the excitement still we think that
Samsung's got it right this time around
but we'll see if this conclusion holds
true after a weekend with the phone all
the way through the review until then
