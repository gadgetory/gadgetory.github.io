it for months and now we finally have
with a new color to boot for pocket now
I'm high on touhous man and this is the
crazy bezel asami me mix when I first
saw the mixin person I couldn't believe
it
this phone features a six point four
inch display housed in a ceramic body
that's not much bigger than an iPhone 7
plus that phone has a 5.5 inch display
by the way meaning you get almost a full
inch of added space Xiaomei was able to
pull this off by slimming down the
bezels to give the mix a 91.3% screen to
body ratio though that does of course
come with some compromises the
front-facing camera is positioned at the
bottom of the phone which is gonna make
taking selfies a little awkward but
thankfully you can flip the knee mix
upside down for a more traditional angle
and the software will follow suit
there's also the matter of trying to
make such an enormous phone reasonable
to use one-handed and again xiaomi has a
solution in place but to be honest it's
not too different from holding most
other phablets the new white finish is
beautiful but I actually prefer the
black version we've seen before with
real gold trim lining the camera and a
fingerprint scanner no matter which
color you pick up it's really just
stunning in person and you know no
matter which color analog fans will be
happy to know that there's still a
headphone jack I would love to use the
me mix as my personal device and the
current SKU will work to some degree on
American GSM carriers but Xiaomi has
confirmed that for now this is just
gonna be available in China CES is
coming to an end but we've got a few
more for you in the pipelines so be sure
to subscribe and follow us on social
networks to catch all our latest updates
for pocket now this has been higher
huesemann and as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
