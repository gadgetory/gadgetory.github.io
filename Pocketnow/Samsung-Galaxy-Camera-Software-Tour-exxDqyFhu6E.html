experiment in the mobile space we spent
some time with one at Aoife at its
announcement we had some hands-on time
in New York City and now we've got one
in the Boston testing chamber and we
thought you'd like to see a brief
glimpse of the custom Android software
build powering this device I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
your guided tour of Android on the
Samsung Galaxy camera we've seen plenty
of coverage on the Galaxy camera already
discussing everything from its 16
megapixel sensor with 21 X optical zoom
to its onboard Wi-Fi and 3G and 4G
radios but for this quick look we want
to take a gander at the Galaxy cameras
software our device a samsung EK GC 100
running the latest updates arrived with
android version 4.1.10 s version most
Android devices are running today
including the carrier branded galaxy s3
and galaxy note 2 we have here in the
office everything from the TouchWiz UI
to the project butter improvements to
jellybean feels very very familiar here
there's a notification shade with the
familiar shortcut toggles up top an app
launcher and the usual suite of stock
apps and widgets with the ability to buy
more through the Google Play Store of
course you can even run Android in
portrait mode if you're so inclined in
those respects the Galaxy camera is very
much like many other Android smartphones
especially the Galaxy s3 with which it
appears to share a display but the
Galaxy cameras specialized software does
differ predictably from its smartphone
siblings in a few key areas the most
obvious distinction up front is the
permanent camera shortcut in the lower
left hand corner of the screen here
which conveniently sticks around on all
home screens it only disappears if you
hop into the application launcher or
drop down the notification shade or of
course if you are inside an app but on
all the home screens it is persistent
you can also jump into the camera app
from
anywhere in the UI by pressing the
shutter release key which is nice
there's also been a change to the
Android home key row the software now
including home back and menu instead of
home back and multitasking which makes
up for the lack of Samsung's traditional
hardware menu button multitasking can
still be achieved by pressing and
holding the home button the behavior of
the power standby key located up top
adjacent to the shutter release is the
same as on other devices but it doesn't
appear to be at first locking the camera
is done normally and unlocking it will
restore the device to its previous state
that's normal and it's handy but locking
the camera with the lens deployed will
stow the lens and then unlocking it
while the camera was the last app opened
will re extend it that's not the case if
the last app open was say Facebook or
just the home screen it takes a second
to get used to but it's logical and very
very convenient once you do speaking of
the camera the biggest difference is of
course that camera app when we're
talking about differences in this
Android version Samsung has ditched its
standard layout for an entirely new and
much more graphically intense UI a tile
or ribbon layout with smart shooting
options is available over here to the
right with preset modes for everything
from burst shot to long exposures to
macro to backlight and many more
additionally expert mode allows manual
tweaking of ISO f-stop shutter speed and
exposure in a pretty if convoluted
simulation of physical lens controls
also half pressing to focus prompts a
pop-up in the viewfinder with ISO f-stop
exposure info and more finally the smart
shooting modes can also be accessed more
quickly via a home screen widget
allowing users to jump right into the
camera with a specific shooting mode
already selected the camera defaults to
five megapixel shots but you can take it
all the way up to 16 if you want as long
as you're willing to do some hunting the
camera settings are hidden behind a very
inconspicuous arrow icon next to the
home shortcut here in the upper left
which took us longer to find than we'd
like to a
met the settings menu also lets you
control the video cameras resolution and
framerate from lower res video at 120
fps for slow-mo all the way up to 1080p
to cut that video to your liking there's
a new video editing app that offers a
pretty robust selection of transitions
and effects as well as a fairly
straightforward interface for editing
stills the bundled photo wizard app
provides the usual array of options for
tweaking contrast saturation and so on
as well as a bundle of filters if
neither of those suit your liking the
whole Google Play Store is of course
there for you in all the galaxy cameras
Android build is a specialized platform
that runs the camera hardware very
nicely but offers the full suite of
Android functionality except voice calls
alongside it whether that makes it worth
buying for you will depend on your
individual needs but for shutter bugs
looking for a connectivity and
customizability via apps it doesn't get
much better than the Galaxy camera
everyone thanks for watching we hope you
enjoyed the guided tour of the software
and the Samsung Galaxy camera stay tuned
for more coverage on this device this
isn't the end of the road we have
another video coming tomorrow and a very
special one coming next week so stay
tuned for that
