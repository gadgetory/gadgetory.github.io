mention beats music and even iOS 9
Microsoft has some good and bad news to
share with all of us and believe it or
not LG has just landed its own VR
headset but the LG way I'm Jaime Rivera
and word of warning new studio audio
checks lightning check some things may
not look well but we're still trying
this is PocketNow daily brought to you
by lynda.com the official moves adapt do
with Microsoft the lease could be good
and bad first of all the good side the
company has already shared in press
invitations print event to happen on
March 1st and I'm WC and Buster Laura
and we will be there covering everything
live we're not expecting any hot Lumias
here but we could be wrong but sadly the
bad news if we could say it that way is
that apparently trusted sources claim
that the company is preparing for
Windows 10 RT M released to
manufacturing to be ready by June so
that means that we'll have the official
version of Windows 10 much later than
that
meaning that yeah that is exactly the
same month when WWDC 2015 happens for
Apple will even know exactly how Apple
is going to prepare for its next version
of OS 10 you know and just giving
Microsoft whatever purpose it had for
Windows 10 down the drain but anyways
we'll see about that
now let's move the spotlight over to
Apple we are still waiting for the
company's build for the Apple watch
which was supposed to be iOS 8.2 and now
we have iOS 8.3 beta reaching developers
with a new emoji features new 2-step
verification for the Google services
which is ok but even more interesting we
even hear that there is an iOS 8.4 in
the works and apparently this iOS 8.4
will have a lot to do with Apple's new
music service new music service they're
not talking about Beats integration or
it could be that this is going to fall
under a new name or whatever the case
may be we'll keep you posted on that
since we have even more news for iOS and
that's right the next news have to do
with Apple's iOS 9 reports claim the
company's already working on it but that
this new version of iOS will be less
about features more about stability sort
of like what Snow Leopard was for OS 10
of you remember they had moved into a
new architecture
this was the operating system to polish
everything apparently that's going to be
the case given all the changes with iOS
7 iOS 8 and all the bugs that we've had
to put up with it's such an oddity given
that iOS has always been famous for
stability and now we're gonna have to
receive a software update just to bring
us what it's supposed to be famous for
let's see what we've got the good iOS 9
as there was lots of company and if
there are still people out there crazy
for a 1+1 and you haven't received an
invite from your fans on Twitter like I
have thank you very much guys I've given
up on the 1+1 by the way but anyways if
you are still interested you can get it
invite free wait for it as of Tuesday's
that means that from here going forward
you can order it for 24 hours without an
invite every single Tuesday this is
probably the most ridiculous way to sell
a phone ever
but if you're still interested again
there is a way to do it without the
invite great news for something and
partly for the very interesting news of
the day LG has just launched its own VR
headset it's being dubbed the VR or g3
meaning it works for the g3 and what
makes this product cool even though it's
kind of ugly and it looks archaic is
that it's completely free apparently
it'll be available on certain markets
whenever you buy a g3 which is great the
problem is this is not really a gear VR
it is in a way but it's not yes it
follows the whole Google cardboard
design meaning it's pretty much
something made basic you know not as
sophisticated as the gear VR but then
again for the price tag it doesn't
really matter you know cuz not very many
people are going crazy for the gear VR
anyways this is really an interesting
approach from LG again it's a free
accessory we don't know if it will be
compatible with current g3 but it does
lead me to the question of the day what
do you think about these virtual reality
headsets do you like them and would you
like to buy them or have you tried one
and what do you think leave us a comment
down below because in my case I would
love it for gaming but I'm still
skeptical leave us a comment down below
what do you think and folks have you
ever wanted to learn how to play a music
instrument build your own website or hey
