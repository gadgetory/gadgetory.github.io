pakka calm and salmon shoes for
creatures which is the second chapter to
be games for and if you ever played the
game on a windows mobile device it's
actually pretty fun and hopefully this
one is even more interesting so let's
get started okay so here we are on spore
creatures and it's a pretty simple game
you have to evolve your creature here
which is one of your spores and if you
play the game on the pc or on another
windows platform it's kind of similar to
that except this time you're on land and
not just in the water so we can move our
little creature around and to evolve him
we'll need to go into the nest so let's
go to the nest and you can select one of
these here we either have a color change
so we can change this color let's see if
you want to make it blue or red we can
do that we can go back and if we want to
give him some more defense let's see we
have this available can change his body
shape okay I like that one right there
so I'm going to select that one and we
can change if he has some horns or not
or whatnot or whatever so as you can see
you get the picture of how the game is
played so we can just go back to with
the nest and apparently the dice gives
it random which saves a little bit of
time and we can go back to the nest say
creature yes he can crawl over these
spikes so let's see here we got up cave
so inside the cave we have a few more
challenging events so as you see we need
to eat our food so we need to catch the
food and eat the food so that we can
advance ourselves okay let's come on
okay okay so we're just going to pause
here and go to the map and now we can
see where our level is and it shows that
we are six percent completed on this
game or in it okay so this is another
marketplace pick and the game's called
spore creatures and it is six dollars
and ninety-nine cents
windows mobile marketplace the gameplay
is pretty intuitive and it works rather
well thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
