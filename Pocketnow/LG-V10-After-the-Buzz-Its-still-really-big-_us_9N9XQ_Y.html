released we all get excited about it
then after a couple videos we move on to
the next new thing
how have phone ages is as important as
that initial out-of-the-box experience
so let's do something about this let's
take a second look at LG's beast of a
phablet did it live up to the hype I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
this is our LG v10 after the buzz LG
made some interesting moves in 2015
after facing performance issues on the G
flex 2 LG utilized a less powerful but
more consistent processor for the g4 and
this beast of a phablet having used the
v10 since its launch in October this
monster is proven to be a satisfying mix
of experiments with a few compromises
this is a big phone no way around it
for a 5.7 inch display even including
the top ticker screen this is a hefty
piece of tech but this extra material
has withstood some pretty brutal use LG
rates the v10 is milspec 810g drop in
shock resistant and this phone has
survived multiple unintentional drops
onto these stainless steel rails there's
almost no evidence of any impacts though
I am on my second glass screen protector
and this one is already cracked - the
combination of steel sides and grippy
back still feels terrific in the hand
but the Duras skin used on this back
cover started wearing away fairly early
into the life of this phone happily for
being such a large gadget the rear
mounted fingerprint scanner is helpful
for unlocking without dancing the phone
around in your hand and like Samsung we
have a proper screen shrink one-handed
mode some very nice ergonomic
considerations where the v10 continues
to impress is with multimedia and
content creation this phone really isn't
a gaming powerhouse but thanks to a
high-quality DAC and a powerful
headphone amp this LG consistently
scores top marks for headphone audio
performing admirably against Sony HTC
and apple and this audio hardware
significantly outperforms the current
Galaxy s7 s and the built-in headphone
jack on the LG g5 we also get the most
feature complete stock camera experience
built into any phone we've ever reviewed
the 16 megapixel shooter still
handily competes against newer phones
for still photography but we've yet to
see any other manufacturer approach the
absolutely fantastic options for video
complete and total control over every
setting one might need to adjust from
white balance shutter speed and manual
focus to audio source gain and
microphone direction to resolution
aspect ratio and bitrate there are
third-party apps which can deliver most
of this functionality but this is
seamlessly built into the v10 and you
really miss these settings when you
don't have them on another device pieces
of this phone feel a bit ahead of their
time though the several flagships in
2016 now come with always-on displays
for notifications but this really wasn't
ready for the v10 using an LCD so we get
this second ticker display at the top to
replicate that functionality it's less
elegant but arguably a bit more
functional for including shortcuts to
things like the flashlights wireless
settings and media controls you
absolutely don't need it but when you
get used to it it's nice to have and
while the fingerprint sensor is in a
great spot to reach we've seen better
implementation using always-on sensors
instead of this power button
configuration LG's launcher is not a
community favorite but this skin avoids
some of the more egregious sins and a
few offending issues can be fixed by
changing out a few widgets or
downloading a different theme now
battery life is the one significant
demerit we can point to especially
against newer phones the v10 does not
sip juice even after the update -
marshmallow if you get this thing
cranking you will watch that battery
icon drop for all this extra size and
larger screen the battery is the same
capacity as the g4 which came before it
on days where we use this camera a lot
it quickly becomes habit to top off at
least once in the early afternoon it's
difficult to say how this phone might
aged over the next year as developers
get a taste for faster welcomes and
manufacturers seem less concerned about
using high silicon or mediatek
processors we of course hope to see a
follow up v 11 or V 20 but would we
recommend buying a v10
a this phablet was in each performer at
launch targeting content creators but
after almost eight months there are
still a few tricks this phone can
perform which newer phones can't there's
a confidence in using this build without
a case and while it's still on the
pricier side of the market few phones
will match features like 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage or still include an IR
blaster and a user replaceable battery
this is far from one-size-fits-all
territory but the v10 remains a fan
favorite and it's still a capable option
for folks shopping something big as
always thanks so much for watching be

more videos and reviews like these and
hit that thumbs up button for a little
extra positive reinforcement for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos now you can chat
me up on Twitter and Instagram as some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next review
