build materials HTC unveils a new one a
nine and no this is no iPhone wanna be
in Google stands clear about how
marshmallows doze mode will work with
other OEMs I'm high never iveta working
on Tuesdays and making the best out of
him since 1998 I think this is parking
out daily the official news today but
you with HTC as a the arrow codename was
actually the one a nine we've actually
had the units for the last weekend and
so far so great yes it looks a lot like
the iphone let's just get that off our
system but HTC claims that this is
actually their design that Apple ended
up copying and I actually believe that
in addition to that Snapdragon 617
processor three gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage this is actually a very
interesting powerhouse that we are
currently testing it will report back
other official news are rather
interesting as google has just set its
foot down when it comes to the
modifications that it will allow with
marshmallow thank you google
particularly with its DOS mode it seems
that the company will not be allowing
OEMs to tinker with it and prove it
reduce it or do anything that is a
marshmallow feature that cannot be
tinkered with which is great news
according to google those OEMs that want
to do so will be removed from the google
play services and benefits in yada yada
yada of cool news let's move the
spotlight over 21 plus as we get some
more leaks of the oneplus x many or
whatever you want to call this thing for
those of you wondering exactly what
color options were getting this is
actually good news as we are getting two
color options it seems the black one
that we've seen in all the leaks and a
new white model that actually looks
rather cool obviously the specifications
of the you know 1 plus X are not
necessarily the best but then again this
is no chump of a phone and we really
can't wait to see what we get by the end
of this month and we get some very
interesting rumors when it comes to the
galaxy s7 number one comes the materials
apparently the company is going to be
adopting a new magnesium alloy for the
build which we've seen in other OEM
smartphones particularly in opal
example but even more interesting is
that apparently we are getting a new
sound chip audio ship that should
improve the quality of what we hear
we're just not sure if that means that
we're getting stereo speakers or
something like that but any improvements
when it comes to the galaxy speakers are
going to be well well received and
finally for the interesting if not
rather disappointing news of the day we
get some stronger claims that YouTube is
going to charge for a subscription
service and the way this will work is
that obviously there are breeding
YouTube channels out there and the idea
would be that if you want to watch them
you would have to pay ten dollars as if
you're not already paying a lot for
Spotify in addition to Netflix and
whatever other subscription services you
already have playstation or whatever
this is a lot of money ten dollars is a
lot of money to watch hey premium
content and the problem particularly
with YouTube is that it's not
necessarily like if these channels will
provide you with something that other
channels can provide you as well so it
leads me to the question of the day
would you be willing to pay ten dollars
to you know watch premium subscription
services from YouTube because in my case
yeah fine you're not going to get any
ads as a benefit but I would rather
watch the ads then have to pay for
something answer not necessarily bad
sometimes they have promotions and deals
that are actually useful to you leave us
a comment down below you prefer again
ads or premium services friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video

talking out comment subscribe to a
channel as well you can also follow me
