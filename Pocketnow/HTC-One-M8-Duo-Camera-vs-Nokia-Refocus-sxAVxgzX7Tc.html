special depth sensor mounted above the
camera on its new one m8 the company
highlighting some of the artsy effects
possible thanks to this unique setup but
critics say similar effects can be
achieved with far less specialized
Hardware today we'll take a quick look
at how the One m8 camera stacks up
against one of those competitors I'm
Michael Fisher you're watching pocket
now and this is HTC duo camera versus
Nokia refocus for the sample photos used
in this comparison we used a Nokia Lumia
925
alongside our HTC One m8 test unit our
full review of the One m8 includes many
more camera samples and it's available
at the first link in the description
below each of these devices allows for
variable focus the ability to refocus
photos after they're taken but they use
fundamentally different approaches to
achieve that whereas the One m8 employs
a dedicated secondary sensor to
calculate the relative distance of
subjects within an image the Lumia 925
cheats in a manner of speaking as do all
Nokia phones with the refocus app by
quickly snapping multiple photos at
different focal points that means the
HTC device is always capturing depth
information when shooting you can go
back and refocus or you focus as HTC
calls it almost any photo you've ever
taken with this device as long as you
took it in standard mode without the
flash by contrast if you want to refocus
a photo on the Nokia you need to decide
that before you take the shot because
you need to use the refocus app to
capture it in the first place
the second major difference is in the
type of photos you're capturing while
Nokia refocus works best when you're
extremely close to your subject
HTC's camera can't work if it's too
close so these features aren't
necessarily as analogous as a first
glance might suggest nevertheless they
are similar enough to compare in general
terms so here's how they stack up if
you're looking for features above all
else the duo camera on the m8 is the way
to go not only can you enhance your
subject with the faux bouquet effect
you can add layers of all kinds to add
fun to the photo there are animated
elements and even a very Spacey 3d type
effect that's a fun party trick if
nothing else plus you don't have to hold
as still when you're shooting as the
camera isn't taking multiple exposures
and in fact that second sensor helps the
camera focus faster but the experience
is far from perfect you have to get used
to the sensors position so you don't
accidentally obscure it with a finger
and it doesn't work with any fancy
filters like HDR also the software isn't
great at determining where to draw the
line on the focus regions almost every
photo with the you focus effect has a
visible delineation even the ones HTC
showed off at the m8 launch event this
is one of the problems we hope gets
fixed with software updates but for now
it's certainly not as consistent as we'd
like it to be over in Nokia world it's
the opposite situation there are very
few features to speak of outside the
core refocusing element there is a fun
color pop option though and of course
you can always edit photos in a separate
app once you export them that said the
refocusing component works very well as
long as you're not shooting a moving
object it's not as extreme and effect as
on the m8 but it also results in a much
smoother focus plane with none of the
weird distortion of the HTC device and
there's even the option here for an all
in focus mode creating the effect of a
very large depth of field
finally Nokia offers a collaborative
upload function that lets you post the
images online so people you share the
photos with can tweak focus as well we
want to reiterate that despite their
surface similarity these competing
features are really made for different
purposes that said we think the elegant
simplicity of Nokia's more elementary
approach is overall better the lack of
any special Hardware hasn't hurt the
Windows Phone offering in fact its
results are often superior meanwhile the
One m8 has a big additional camera
sensor and not much in the way of
quality to show for it at least not yet
if you don't care about
decision and you just want a big feature
load or you're playing the long game and
betting third-party developers will come
up with some fun ways to take advantage
of the duo camera the m8 may suit you
just fine but on the whole we think
nokia has done more with less in this
instance once again folks are full HTC
