FedEx stopped by with another package I
was eagerly anticipating I'm high net me
that I would pocket now and let's unbox
the nine point seven inch iPad pro yes I
was up at 3:00 a.m. pre-ordering the new
iPad pro and no I didn't just do it for
this review I've spent about two years
waiting for this tablet and it's finally
time to open it up
Apple is famous for using the minimum
amount of packaging when shipping I've
heads and as we cut through the box this
was no exception sliding it out we were
greeted by the same I pad packaging from
yesteryear and judging from the slim
iPad profile in the front Apple
continues to make this a topic of
thinness the box is then protected by a
film of plastic that we cut through and
as we live the iPad sits front and
center like with the unboxing of the
larger 12 point 9 inch model Apple is
now using a matte plastic that cover its
gadgets sitting below is a limited
amount of literature along with some
stickers from Apple Apple's wall adapter
and a lightning cable the wall adapter
is actually only 10 watts something I
hadn't seen on iPad since the boosted
12th Watts with the third iPad and the
lightning cable is far shorter than what
came in the box of the larger sibling
before we continue this plastic is in
the way
wow that was stickier than what I
thought
our 9.7 inch review unit is a Space Gray
variant of 128 gigabytes of storage I
tend to drift to this color mainly
because I find the black bezels to be
more immersive for consuming content and
also because space gray just looks
badass in most lighting scenarios I also
went for more storage because I've
learned the hard way that even 32 gigs
is not enough storage for a product
designed for content consumption holding
this nine point seven inch iPad pro is
just surreal after spending the last few
months with the larger iPad pro this new
model just feels like holding a piece of
paper it's incredibly light to hold in
the cool feel to the touch just answer
the premium finish sure you're pretty
much holding an iPad air 2 in all
dimensions and from a distance it's
really hard to tell the difference
visually it really comes down to the new
speakers mounted at the top that are
actually not designed to match the
bottom speaker symmetrically like we see
with the larger tablet and then there's
that lovely camera hump that requires an
extra hole in the box just to make it
fit yeah I know that looks horrible and
everything else this might look like
another iPad but the story really lies
in what this tablet can do and that's
what we'll spend the next few weeks
testing out starting with our first
impressions video that is coming very
