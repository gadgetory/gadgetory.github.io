behind the camera we are here with the
Sony Xperia m2 and we're comparing it
for the Sony Xperia z2 the two new
phones from Sony today so let's go take
a look so as you can see these two
phones are very very similar in terms of
built they look almost the same the
Xperia z2 on the left and the m2 on the
right we still have the same sandwich
glass construction but while the Xperia
z2 is submersible and dustproof the
Xperia m2 does not inherit that now
while talking about the specifications
we have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 on the
Xperia z2 and we have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 on the Xperia m2 we have
of course 2.3 gigahertz versus 1.2
gigahertz we have three gigs of RAM on
the Xperia z2 versus only one gigabyte
of RAM on the Xperia m2 and 16 gigabytes
of internal storage expandable vs. 8
gigabytes expandable as well flipping
them to the side we have the 20 point
seven megapixel camera and we have the
blue version of the phone here if that
doesn't really matter
well we have the 8 megapixel shooter on
the m2 of course with the LED flash and
the NFC in terms of software as they are
both running the same version of Android
and of course Sony's own proprietary
user interface on top of it which with
which you are used to probably by now in
terms of battery life you probably get
more out of the z2 because it has a
three thousand two hundred million power
battery compared to the two thousand
three hundred million power battery on
the m2 of course there's a much smaller
4.7 inch screen on the Sony Xperia m2
compared to a 5.2 inch screen this is a
full HD screen this is a qHD resolution
so it is definitely the lower end
between the two but it's shirt inherits
the good looks and good feel in the hand
of the Xperia z2 that's a pretty pretty
quick look we're going to thank the sony
guys for letting us to c24 this
comparison this has been Anton
behind the camera thank you very much
for watching stay tuned for more videos
from pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
