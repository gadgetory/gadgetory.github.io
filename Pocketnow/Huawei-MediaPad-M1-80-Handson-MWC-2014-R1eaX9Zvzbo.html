bigger HTC one but it seems that Huawei
does want it to be I am hi mera neta
this is pocket now we're still at mwc
we're still at huawei Tony behind the
camera let's have a look at the huawei
mediapad m18 point know before I lose my
breath so yes look at this this is an 8
inch tablet that looks almost like an
HTC One but is not this mediapad m18
point no brings android 4.2 with
Huawei's emotion UI which is the typical
you can't really go into an apps tray
but you can load as many of these
sections as you want it's got this new
proprietary silicon that they're calling
Karen 9 10 which is a 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor 1 gig of ram 8 gigs
of storage or 16 gig option and I'm
trying to see if this one is expandable
through microSD it should be I just I
can't find the jack anywhere we'll see
that but anyways it's got the typical a
lot of LTE bands pretty much almost
everyone it's got a 1080p full HD
display it's actually 19 2 1980 by 1200
and it's also got this metallic design
which is seven point seven point nine
millimeters thick it only weighs through
39 grams and again the cool thing about
this mediapad is the fact that you've
got front firing speakers according to
our way it's got this new chambering
technology within the speakers that will
give you a high quality audio whenever
you're listening to your videos or stuff
now sadly the chichi doesn't give us
information on what type of camera this
is we do assume that it does bring the
same 5 megapixel camera details that we
have and again we've got this plastic
lining here metallic back this is
plastic at the edges this haven't feels
really light and it feels really good in
the hand and it's a tall design which
makes it you know good for your back
pocket as well the UI looks well looks
pretty snappy probably the only problem
again this is Android 4.2 point2 but hey
I'm every ivetta Tony behind the camera
mwc 2014 the Huawei booth with a lot of
sweat hopefully some water at the
thank you very much for watching we will
be back soon with more video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
