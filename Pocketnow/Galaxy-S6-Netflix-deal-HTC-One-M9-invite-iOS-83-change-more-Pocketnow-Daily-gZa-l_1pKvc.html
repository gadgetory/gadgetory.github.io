you want to buy the galaxy s6 or galaxy
s6 edge the HTC One m9 plus makes a
public appearance and this time by HTC
and I was 8.3 finally gives serie a
little more life after being forgotten
I'm high metal iveta enjoying the
purpose of Wednesday's ever since I can
remember back in childhood this is
parking out daily brought to you by
Linda calm the official news today after
the with HTC and fine guilty as charged
I didn't believe in the leaked of
renders of the HTC One and nine plus it
turns out that I was wrong the company
has an out presentations for an event to
happen on april eight saying that there
has to be more than one and yeah all the
leaks and everything that is in this
present white matches everything we've
seen on the one m9 plus the interesting
part is that this is only happening in
China we wonder why now sorry about
Apple in iOS 8.3 Apple didn't just
surprised us all making betas public for
the masses which is great you no longer
have to pay hundred dollars a out of the
blue just to become a developer even if
you're not one just to try it out but
the company is also making some major
changes to Siri really some very needed
ones in the past for example you did
have the hey Siri option to call on Sri
whenever you were charging your phone or
tablet but the problem was if you wanted
to make a phone call you could ask you
to make a phone call but it would
default it to the earpiece and
completely defeat the purpose for it
this is being fixed in addition to new
messaging updates and a lot of other
things that are in the lakes description
even though we don't know exactly for
when this is going to be final now throw
out the google Pony Express and I know
that is probably the most hilarious
codename we've ever heard and we assume
that is not going to be the final name
for this new service that the company is
working with creditors and the financial
companies in a way for you to be able to
manage your bills and handle your
payment due dates and everything from
your gmail it seems that this is pretty
much going to work like Google now for
example if you receive an email with a
your boarding pass information you will
then get a google now card with
everything that you have to do in a
reminder
apparently this is going to work for
financial institutions as well there is
a still a lot to be done here but good
to see that Google wants to make gmail
even more useful now flexible displays
are your thing Samsung's display unit
notice not the smartphone unit the
display part of the company has just
come on record to state that the
smartphone flexible displays will be
ready by next year which is great the
technology is going to be there and
we're talking about foldable displays
meeting the displays there you can fold
it while using it which is a an
interesting idea we're not sure if this
is going to be a gimmick or not mainly
because we wonder exactly how they plan
to fold the battery and the rest of the
chassis we'll see what we get at mwc
next year that's going to be interesting
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day guys if you're
interested in the galaxy s6 your galaxy
s6 edge t-mobile is probably the best
company to buy it right now there is
this whole deal where if you reorder the
phone on t-mobile and right now that's
actually the only carrier you're getting
a full year of netflix for free and yeah
you can stream everything on your phone
and on your TV at the same time there is
this whole deal happening which is
really cool I mean think about it we're
talking about almost a hundred dollar
value here which pretty much drops the
price of the galaxy s6 and gives you
that extra which is cool not sure if
Samsung is planning to do this with
other companies as a sensing is the
company that's giving you the code
actually it's not really t-mobile it
leads me to the question of the day with
a deal like this one make you want to
buy the galaxy s6 because in my case
I'll tell you this much the phone is not
bad at all I mean I would buy the phone
without it but leave us a comment down
below because yeah Netflix deal would
make me want to buy to same reason why i
bought the chromecast at some point
years ago and folks if you've ever
