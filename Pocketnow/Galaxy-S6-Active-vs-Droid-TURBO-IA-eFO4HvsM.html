Galaxy Android active versus turbo I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and if you
need a phone that'll take some abuse
without sacrificing performance odds are
you've wait at least one of these which
one is better for you let's find out
well first off the network is going to
make a lot of the difference here the
galaxy s6 active is exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T
the Droid turbo is exclusive to Verizon
Wireless and for the most part neither
will work on the other so if you're
already beholden to or have a strong
preference for a one carrier over the
other congratulations your choice is
made but if you're a free agent and
either operator will do the phone makes
all the difference it should be noted
that these are separated by about a half
a cycle the turbo launched in November
while the Essex active just hit the
scene in June but each represents the
zenith of durable phones in its
respective lineup so let's see how they
stack up let's talk durability first
both of these look pretty mean purple
accents notwithstanding but on the page
the Galaxy s6 active wins the spec
battle to be sure the Motorola phone can
take a beating with the ballistic nylon
cover Gorilla Glass 3 display protection
and water-repellent nano coating
protecting its internals but the Samsung
edges it out with mil standard 810g
resistant to shock vibration and
temperature extremes along with Gorilla
Glass 4 and an ip68 rating for total
immersion in fresh water Verizon
meanwhile only guarantees the turbo will
stand up to everyday spills unexpected
downpours and the like the Samsung phone
also brings more in the way of physical
controls
it features hard buttons instead of
Motorola's capacitive tap targets and
it's got a dedicated activity key as
well that leads to a special active zone
and you can reassign it to something
more useful too if you want all those
keys by the way also offer much more
satisfying click and travel than their
mushy Motorola equivalents
that's not to say the droid turbo
straight-up loses on the hardware side
if first of all while it's thicker than
the active it's smaller in every other
dimension giving it a svelte err feel in
the hand to go with it's less
ostentatious design while it can't get
as bright or dim as the Super AMOLED
panel on the Samsung Motorola's AMOLED
screen is slightly larger and warmer and
then behind it sits up to 64 gigs of
internal storage while the active makes
do with 32 also motorola knows its
speakers not just how to build them but
where to put them the turbo speaker
phone sits up front where it belongs
while Samsung's
is tucked away around back moving into
software the turbo still got some
impressive aspects a Motorola's custom
interface is about as thin as it gets
just a few custom features atop and
almost perfectly pure build of Android
that makes it lean and pretty slick and
it also probably makes the turbo easier
to update notice this device is already
running android 5.1 while the active is
still on 5.0 - plus the features
Motorola's added our if not always
perfect at least very useful moto
display shows waiting notifications when
you pass a hand over the screen or pull
the phone from a pocket turning the
flashlight on is just a chop-chop
gesture away also the turbo can dictate
incoming text messages to you when
you're driving silence your alerts when
you're in a meeting or asleep and let
you give it voice commands without even
touching it what is the current distance
to Norfolk Virginia
and drive from your location to Norfolk
in 458 point four miles greeting the
galaxy Samsung will let you do some of
that but not as well and plus you have
to deal with s voice and her interesting
delivery ting galaxy
greetings galaxy
greetings galaxy what is the current
distance to Norfolk Virginia three
hundred forty six point three miles
you've got a much different experience
on the Samsung as a whole this is the
TouchWiz user interface and while it's
been slimmed down a lot since last year
it's still unmistakeably Samsung with
its bright solid colors and elementary
icons thankfully it's much more
responsive than in years past
and it also packs its own share of
useful add-ons like the S health fitness
tracking application that ties into the
heart rate sensor on the back there's
also an IR port on the active with the
pre-installed peel Smart Remote app if
you want to control your TV with your
smartphone you can run multiple apps
side by side on the screen if you really
need to multitask and if you don't like
the cartoony look of the UI you can
reskin it with a few button presses
thanks to the Samsung theme store both
of these phones offer quick launch
shortcuts to the camera on the moto it's
a quick twist of the wrist and on the
galaxy it's a DoubleTap of the HOME key
while Motorola's camera is higher in
resolution impacts double the flash it's
also got a smaller aperture and less
effective stabilization than Samsung's
offering what does that mean out in the
real world in daylight not much the
active tends to produce brighter shots
on the whole while the turbo usually
kicks out warmer photos but they're
pretty damn similar HDR is much more
subtle on the Samsung phone while
Motorola has
proved in this regard it's still a
little overdone also Motorola's camera
is much easier to trip up and wash out
because of its too sensitive exposure
controls at nighttime
Motorola's output tends to be warmer
still which sometimes makes photos look
even better here you can see the galaxy
s6 actives larger aperture and OIS at
work
letting in more light than the turbo
does with less noise to boot that said I
kind of prefer the turbos increased
contrast which makes for a moody or
photo also like all Samsung's the active
has a tendency to err on the vibrant
side while the turbo produces more
realistic colors more of the time where
the turbo really loses out is in its
ability to cope to adapt to maintain
focus and take a shot quickly Samsung
excels at this usually managing to catch
a usable photo even in very quickly
changing conditions while the turbo
usually needs a few beats to catch up
that probably won't matter most of the
time but a faster camera could mean the
difference between getting the shot and
missing it
and besides faster the active is also
crisper it just brings that little bit
of added detail color and contrast that
makes for a more dramatic more memorable
photo if you like a more subdued picture
you'll probably prefer the Motorola and
that's fine it actually holds up better
to the active than I expected it to but
when you factor in Samsung's available
manual controls its optical image
stabilization and the ability to take
photos underwater well I think it's
pretty clear which is the more capable
camera here as we said in our droid
turbo after the buzz video last week
this phone packs a hell of a battery but
it doesn't live up to its potential
despite its larger power pack the turbo
is routinely beaten by the active
weather it's normal day to day use or
heavy gaming and we're talking a big
difference over an hour and screen on
time
whether that's thanks to Motorola's
special features Verizon's bloatware or
the differences in processor and network
technology here it's really
disappointing and a big blow to the
turbo in this comparison also while
they're both packing quick recharge
capability and qi wireless charging the
active also brings integrated PMA
support so you can wirelessly top-up in
more places the turbo manages a few late
punches here it comes with Verizon's
screen assurance so if you crack your
display in the first two years of
ownership the carrier will replace your
phone at no charge as we mentioned
before it comes in an available 64 gig
trim though you may have to get it used
and at the 32 gig level it's much
cheaper
a hundred bucks less expensive on a
contract and nearly $200 less at full
retail but really you should be paying
less for the turbo because it's the less
capable phone on the whole from its
durability rating to its technical
capabilities that's partially because
it's older over half a year older which
is a long time in mobile but while I
prefer the turbos convenient software
features and it's feel in hand that's
just not enough with the galaxy s6
active Samsung has built a rugged
powerhouse that's really tough to beat
if you're shopping for a durable phone
and even with its new paint job the
Droid turbo doesn't quite measure up and
maybe the tables will turn when Motorola
releases its new Droid offerings later
