fisher with pocket now at the sony event
checking out sony's first android wear
device the SmartWatch 3 let's take a
quick look Sony struck out in a new
direction with the SmartWatch 3 Hardware
ditching the right angles for a rounded
design and wrapping the whole thing in
soft silicone or something that feels a
lot like it and that watch band is
replaceable with any of a number of
different colors the spec list is about
the same as you'll find on most Android
wear watches these days with a quad-core
processor 512 megs of ram and a 420
milliamp hour battery but there are some
standouts here as well the charging port
is no strings attached to microUSB which
we highly prefer over proprietary ports
also the IP 68 waterproofing means it
can endure a bit more punishment than
some other watches and the 4 gigs of
on-board storage give it some
independence if you want to take it out
without your phone finally the display
is a 320 by 320 panel that's just
transflective enough to see in bright
sunlight
it's a bold departure from the sony
standard and we're not sure what to
think about the SmartWatch 3 yet because
we've only had it for a few minutes but
it's definitely interesting to see Sony
ditching its proprietary wearable
platform in favor of Android wear until
next time this has been michael fisher
with PocketNow stay tuned for more on
this and other sony products from eva as
our coverage continues and thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
