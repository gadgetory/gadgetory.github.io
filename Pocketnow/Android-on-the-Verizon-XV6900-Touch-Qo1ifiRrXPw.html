pocketnow.com and in this video i'm
going to show you android on the HTC
vogue also known as the verizon touch or
the sprint touch and it actually works
pretty well so i'm going to take you
through the whole process the guys over
at XDA developers have figured out how
to do this so i bet all the files loaded
onto my storage card and the cool thing
is that you don't have to remove windows
mobile to get android to work you just
run everything from your storage card so
i'm going to go into file explorer and
then i'm going to run this exe and click
the Run button and in about after I
click the Run button in about 15 to 20
seconds will be an Android so i'll be
back when it's finished loading and here
it comes we get the splash screen with
the pulsating a little robotic guy all
right here we are and it says screen
unlocked press menu to unlock but of
course the HTC touch or vogue doesn't
have a menu button so it's actually the
down volume button that they've assigned
and well here it is android and it works
pretty darn well you have the three home
screens you can search google the phone
even works although this one isn't
activated so i haven't been able to
actually make a call but i've read the
thread XD developer said the phone is
indeed working internet is indeed
working so you get everything just like
you would get on a g1 you can go into
the dialer things are kind of scrunched
up because this version of android is
meant to run on a different size screen
but i mean you can pretty much see
everything call log contacts favorites
and then we can go back to the back to
the home screen by doing this we also
have the window shade the the games work
the camera didn't work for me let's see
what else we can go to let's go to music
music application works although of
course there are there is no music on
the device snakes on phone which is a
simple game press up to play and the the
d-pad does work alright see what else we
have notepad and there's no keyboard
because this isn't a g1 of course so
it's really impossible to type on the
pet and a lot of places while using this
I've experienced freezes so I had to
reset the device go back into my storage
card launched Android again so it's
conceivable that you could use this as
your full-time operating system but
you're probably going to be soft
resetting a lot and the guys that XD
developers are working to make this
actually work all of the way not just
half the way now we can go into email it
says welcome to your email click Next so
really it's pretty much everything that
you would have on a g1 and we can move
things around it's fun mostly a novelty
but a pretty cool to see Android running
on a windows mobile device so I will
pose download links on pocketnow.com on
how to get this all you need is a
storage card and a little bit of
patience and you can have Android
working on your HTC vogue be sure to
follow us on twitter at twitter.com

exclusive content there that's it for
