might bring an extra 3d sensor at the
back 2018 iPad pros might also be the
first devices to include a seven
nanometer mobile processor and while
some companies get Android Oreo today
others are still fumbling I'm Jaime
Rivera and yes I'm back in the studio in
New York I just wished that when I got
off the plane I would have brought a
thicker jacket it's cold
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the Samsung Galaxy s8
active I think Sprint is the carrier you
should choose because as of enough to
November 17 there's a deal where if you
switch to sprint you will be getting
half off the phone and again this is
pretty much all the bells and whistles
of the Samsung Galaxy s8 though with the
advantage of a rugged chassis you can
learn more about it in our unboxing
video and link in the description and
speaking of Samsung on the Galaxy S a
those of you that were happy that there
was already a beta test for Android Oreo
you're actually going to have to wait as
the company is putting the beta on a
halt over significant amounts of bugs
that it's been dealing with obviously
it's rather cumbersome to see how
Samsung fumbles so much would software
updates and we usually have to wait
until the latest galaxy to get the
software and then the older galaxies
just don't get anything I hate that
mindset of the way they operate with
software but then again it just seems
like if nothing's going to change
anytime soon
now a company that is not fumbling with
software updates is definitely HTC the
company is keeping up with its promise
those of you interested in Android Oreo
the Taiwanese variant is getting the
update today and my unit is actually a
Taiwanese variant so I can't wait to get
my update on my unit but for the rest of
the SKUs we're not exactly sure when
you're beginning it but we will be
keeping you posted as soon as we learn
more how about if we move the spotlight
over to Apple we've got some very
interesting information on the next
generation iPad pros believe it or not
we hear that the 8 11 X processor will
be a 7 nanometer process chip that will
power the next generation I've had pros
obviously this brings a lot of power
efficiency this also brings a faster
process but
interesting you've seen how Samsung and
Huawei have been able to use the 10
nanometer process and pretty much turn
your smartphone into a computer so I
can't wait to see exactly what these
iPads will be able to do and finally the
very hot rumors that they have to do
with the iPhone 10 2018 we've been
covering many of the rumors of what to
expect because we know that Apple is
already working on it one of the most
interesting ones is that apparently the
3d sensor that is at the front of a
table face ID is going to also make it
to the back now it's not because we want
face idea at the back it's because Apple
wants to bring even better augmented
reality apparently that is the plan the
company wants to really bit hard on a
art kit but it leads me to the question
today I mean how much do you really use
a art kit do you really care about it
because in my case I use it a lot
believe it or not to measure things or
whenever I want to buy furniture but hey
