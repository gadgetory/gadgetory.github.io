headset launched today the motorola x
phone is rumored for a very usual delay
and blackberry calls themselves a victim
of false accusations I'm hi Mary vera
and after installing facebook home i
uninstalled it this is out daily
let's start today talking about pantech
a company we hadn't heard about in a
long time when I came to smartphones
ever since their last year lineup was
kind of a cheap but anyways they're now
working on a rumored Vega iron no bezel
smartphone to be released on April
eighteenth and well apparently this is
gonna be a beautiful phone but let's
just hope these companies remember what
no bezel means it means no bezel now
let's talk about the famous Motorola X
phone so famous it seems like if this
were part of the x-men because they're
only available in comic books and movies
and not real the reason why is because
we were expecting this phone to happen
early this year and apparently well it's
still in prototype stage and it's being
rumored now to be available and Argus
are probably late this year in the fall
and since Motorola hasn't really been
that big lately when it comes to phones
what did you expect and even though we
don't cover watches it parking now the
pebble smartwatch has turned the
favorite accessory of the pocket now
team everybody's crazy over it I don't
have one yet but the company has just
launched their sdk allowing third-party
developers to create new uses for the
pebble smartwatch and even though
they'll probably not be able to pull a
Dick Tracy on this first generation
accessory hopefully they will bring
something new to the table so just stay
tuned it'll probably be even more
compelling for the 150 bucks now let's
talk about blackberry as analysts are
bashing the company as apparently
customers have been returning the z10
and numbers that are not usual numbers
that are so big that it makes to wonder
if there are any Z tends in the market
right now or if people are actually just
testing it for a week and returning it
because they don't like it at all to
that blackberry responded with a
statement calling these false
accusations but I just wish the company
would have also included numbers of
sales of bones that have not been
returned and you know to put their money
where their mouth is and finally for the
both good and bad news of the day
Facebook has just
punch their new Facebook home along with
their updated messenger application
including the chat heads and the HTC
first has also been launched on AT&amp;amp;T so
far word on the street and from the
editors at pocket now is that Facebook
comb sucks sadly but the chat heads have
been a very compelling service it's
actually very cool and extremely
reliable but well that leads you to the
question of the day if you've tried
Facebook comb do you like it have you
decided to keep Facebook comb with the
chat heads are just the chat heads up in
my particular case I installed facebook
home I tried it for 30 minutes and it
sucks you know every time that I see my
local newspaper bringing me all these
great news in my lockscreen I'm
compelled to just not want Facebook home
because it doesn't distinguish between
the things you like and the people you
know since it was supposed to be about
people and not the pages that want to
advertise stuff but anyways leave us a
comment down below have you like
Facebook home I honestly did not like it
but I do love the chat heads that's
actually very cool as always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
