company well I mean Huawei is actually
going to be a major talking point for
heavy discuss but outside of laptops
this was a humongous week for
convertibles or sort of tablet PCs
whatever it is that we're going to call
this new product segment and because you
know we focus mostly on smartphones
tablets and wearables in the coverage
that I produce and that highly produces
and the joules helps us put together we
had to bring on someone more educated
and more experienced in the world of
convertible computing gear and that's
one mr. Adam Lane editor at pocket now
Hey well thanks for joining is it's like
we we haven't actually properly gotten
to work together since the the challenge
video that we did we're having a Windows
Phone camera up against a flaw way you
don't count be a Galaxy S II well no see
that's that was what was kind of a
bummer is that like we we had the
shooting schedule so I mean we were in
the same building but I didn't get to
really work with you I'm putting
together any videos I was like on the
opposite side of the hall trying to
shoot like a two minute comparison video
um so no I'm really stoked to have you
back on because you're sort of the
you're my counterpart in the world of
photography the editor that's actually
been doing more of our sort of
photography conversation camera
conversation stuff like that and then I
got to see you playing with some killer
killer slate PC gear at that Samsung
event with the so first of all before we
even jump in I need you to settle a
debate for me right now
Wacom or Wacom welcome Wacom okay that's
what I've been saying I have a friend
who swears that it's Wacom that Wacom
tablets and I've been telling him for
the better part of a couple years that
he is
and so now I am happy to have the expert
weigh in on that sequel on YouTube used
to try to correct me too I'm like no
you're wrong no it's a comedy night of
two words why is it Chinese word I
forgot what it means I think it means
harmony okay and calm is short for
computer okay so the the harmonious
nosov using your computer to introduce
illustrations and graphics and that's
where we get Wacom I believe that's the
story right on no nns also it's just
kind of fun like you know it's one of
those things someone tries to correct
you and you're like well I would agree
with you if you were right and
unfortunately or not yes all the all the
employees know how to pronounce it
correctly so exactly as well it was a
number times it was when I was a
voice-over producer used to get into
these debates with people is it
Hyundai's at high end I how am I
supposed to say this guy name and like
that was just for an audition so first I
want to jump right in we've got I've got
my list here right in front of me we've
got the Samsung Galaxy book we do have
the other huawei the mate book II which
stands in sort of stark difference to
the more laptop designed wall ways that
we were talking about earlier in the
podcast the new surface pro is out and
there's even another crowdfunded
convertible that's going up on indiegogo
I'd like to kick this right off with the
the Samsung because I did actually get
to spend a little bit of time with that
Samsung Galaxy book during in Barcelona
for for M Debra no see and you got to
spend a lot more time you actually dig
into what this thing can do and I really
wanted to get your your impressions of
it obviously you know I want people to
go and catch the review because I think
you put together a phenomenal review but
in a nutshell for the podcast listeners
in the podcast viewers
Samsung has a rich history of building
Windows PCs and and nice laptops and now
they think they're bringing some more of
their tablet expertise to the table here
yes they've had some good Windows 7
tablets a long time ago - there was the
slate 7
but this new galaxy book the screen is
just really gorgeous so super amoled I
mean I don't think there's anything else
with this large of a Super AMOLED screen
on it and it's also the first time they
got the s-pen from the note on to a
large Windows 10 PC and it's pretty nice
it's not as nice as the much more
expensive Wacom but it still look good
it's like a cheaper version of Wacom
technology so their licensing licensing
welcome screen tech and the pen heck
which is the same as the s-pen but well
and because they welcome like set the
standard for that common touch computing
so if any company really wanted to get a
jump start it would make sense to
license that digitizer right right and
that's what Microsoft did at the
beginning to the original surface pro
and the surface pro 2 both had Wacom
technology in there gotcha gotcha gotcha
so you know and and I guess I should let
let our viewers know by trade you are a
photographer and I've seen you really
dig into this kind of gear so I mean
this is like for something to to perform
well for your job I mean it really has
to live up to sort of a designer graphic
design mentality as spen because I know
s-pen is built around that idea of
mobility productivity right like I
pulled this pin out of my phone and I
can jot down some quick notes or I can
select a view of the screen so that I
can quickly crop or make a an animated
gif or something like that now when we
expand the screen size does that help
flesh out the rest of the s-pen usage
bringing it more in line with what like
a proper graphics tablet would deliver
for a creative professional yes it it's
nicely supported in Photoshop and
painter and all the pressure-sensitive
high-end graphics programs so it works
really well with that it they did also
do that same kind of screenshot spen
what they call it again well I mean he
does Mars just parcel smart select yes
yes my selected screen right they
brought that to Windows 10 as well for
the galaxy book so the same kind of
thing they have in the note but I don't
think it's that useful on Windows 10
well I was just going to ask so I mean
like I think consumers so you know I'm
sort of wrapping up our main review
coverage and comparisons for the Galaxy
s8 and the s8 plus and the more I use
those phones the more I can I can kind
of say you know like there's a bunch of
stuff on these phones that I know a lot
of people might say is bloat or is
unnecessary or is a duplicate kind of
service or just kind of clogs things up
but when I talk to people who use
Samsung phones it's rare that they use
every feature but there's always one
feature that they love about their
Samsung that they can't get on anything
else
so you it's your opinion like some of
those features don't necessarily
translate to a more robust computing
environment does Windows 10 get in the
way or does this just feel like Samsung
hasn't found a way to properly integrate
this into a more tablet laptop style
user interface I think a lot of things
that they added we're already there in
Windows 10 like the ink workspace is
already there and that already goes to
the screen writing the screen capture it
doesn't do the animated chip thing but
how often do you need to do that I don't
know I mean like if you surf around on
Reddit there's like a whole talk of
other people though and maybe apparently
live off of their reddit internet points
by making tasty means of fun and Jess
that's true and the Sampson Notes app
doesn't seem to sync rise with anything
so just use OneNote instead you know one
no gotcha much more powerful so they're
there but they're not really necessary
the other thing they added was the same
from the flow app which is a pretty nice
idea that links it with the galaxy s I
think six and higher mm-hmm so you can
get messages on the tablet on Windows 10
and you can use the fingerprint scanner
to log in you know that way mm-hmm
I don't know how useful that is you know
you need this specific Sanson phone
right were you using a because I know
you word you're one of the last holdouts
that was keen Windows Phone yeah I
didn't have a galaxy of that note to try
to really work with but I've seen a use
at the similar so this wasn't enough to
convince you to like go full bore into
the Samsung ecosystem then now so I just
yeah just a couple other quick questions
before we move off from the galaxy book
it's it's been something that that I
found a little frustrating like I almost
picked up a surface book when I was
shopping for a new laptop and one of the
things that I really wanted was
Thunderbolt or at least USB C ports on
my laptop so I ended up not going with
that do you think that the hardware
layout for galaxy book really does
fulfill that mixed-mode usage because
it's not like it's got the same sort of
like hinge and we're going to be talking
about the surface pro 4 which i think is
sort of setting the standard for the
sort of hybrid idea of a device this is
this is a little bit more in Samsung and
Apple's tablet II territory with
magnetic keyboard covers and the one
additional USB C port there's always the
fear is this going to be a jack of all
trades master of none is this going to
be really flexible enough to pull off
multi modes of different kinds of
computer tablet usage does Windows 10 is
Windows 10 able to hang with that
experience that it doesn't feel
aggi in some areas are sort of
overpowered in others
what were your experience is kind of
like trying to adopt this hardware into
a daily usage strategy I've been using
it for about a week the keyboard the way
the stand is it's not really good for
sending on your lap and that was true
with the original surface pro yeah most
of them afterwards but that's true with
the no iPad pro in any kind of tablet
keyboard stand as well so it's not so
good for that but if you're going to set
it on the desk it's totally fine and
this new keyboard is much better than
the previous one nice and the kickstand
is much better than previous one it
doesn't fall over as easily
oh yeah galaxy tabpro s um as far as the
other questions you can switch it to
desktop mode really easily I kind of
like it in tablet mode for all the
easier touch features but switching into
desktop mode it's just like a laptop you
know sitting on your desk it's can do
everything it comes with Windows 10 home
so they don't have virtual machine but
you can always upgrade it's it's been
pretty good now when we're looking at
something so I I was very critical of
the the surface laptop I don't know if
you were following that kind of those
those Hardware announcements as closely
um I feel like if I were going to be
spending a not insignificant sum of
money more premium devices this is kind
of the direction I'd rather I'd rather
head in I don't know how apt I am to
really use a lot of tablet mode that's
not really a lot of my usage but I like
having the flexibility to move back and
forth even on on my laptop I've got a
razor
a razor blade and even for that not
being a convertible or a multimode kind
of computer I still really like the
ability to reach up and touch the screen
for some things come back down use a
traditional laptop keyboard and trackpad
for other things and that it's got some
particular hardware onboard
do you feel like Samsung's strategy here
is moving them in the right direction
against this kind of competition or
should we still be making more noise
about more traditional laptop style
solutions I think they're going in the
right direction hat they also do the
laptops so they got mm-hmm they got
their faces covered
but yeah the book is it's really nice
and portable it's a little bit thicker
and heavier than the count status that
they released last year but it's a lot
more powerful - it's a much better
design so yeah and so and so you were
ready to just drop your Wacom and be
like the Samsung is totally there now
I'm going to do good now I know this
yeah I chose people like when you when
you screenshotted that Wacom tablet has
those 3d scanning cameras on the base
and I still been showing people like
we're in the middle of this this show
floor and he's got it right there and
it's excellent we're in the middle of
the show floor and he just kind of waves
this tablet around me and all of a
sudden there's this blobby model of me
sitting trying to drink you know
chugging a cup of coffee at this a
countertop table and it was just
incredible like I don't think I'd ever
seen anything really work real-world
like that before and it's just not
something I've ever had the chance to
play with so we did spend a little time
talking about the the Huawei make book X
and the make book D these are more
MacBook competitors but I definitely
wanted to get your your take on the mate
book Yi which was also another
announcement that they had for their
modular system their modular computer
again another this is a core m3 up to a
core i5 I believe with a 12 inch screen
and some specs that look like they're
trying to position this
against products like what we were just
talking about like the galaxy book
service proclaims exactly and will ever
ever since what was the surface pro 3
that I think what Dell had a solution
out or HP had a solution out lenovo has
always been in the mix with yoga and
twist style computers and solutions like
I've got the the Lenovo yoga book right
here
which doesn't even have a keyboard it's
just got that really crazy touch sensor
coating on the bottom and I don't like
typing on it but I like doing a lot of
other things on it so this has been kind
of a fun thing to play with here but I'm
still looking for that killer
combination of portability and being
able to get work done what were your
thoughts on on mate book ii huawei isn't
necessarily the the biggest name player
when it comes to computers they're just
starting to arrive into smartphones in
North America well I think last year was
blurred first here's the old one yeah it
was their first computer the original
mate book and I was really impressed it
was a I thought it was really well done
I mean what were some ones digit because
like I said I I I know Huawei really
well from phones over the last two years
but I've never had the opportunity to
handle a mate book or play with anything
else what what were some of the
differences on that made book mate book
versus say a competing product like like
a surface for example from last year I
think that it's a lot like what Samson
is doing with the galaxy book so we got
the leather foldable cover and you gotta
flip it down over there to make the
stand so it's okay well like that and
then the keyboard is obviously there and
it's got the trackpad so ends attachable
of course nice so this is very thin its
mm iPad pro shaped you know like all of
them I guess no camera on the back which
is great really you're not you're not a
fan of cameras on tablets there
well I knew you had you had good taste
that's why I wanted you on this podcast
and the pen on this one was really
unique it's got a laser pointer in it
well you know a careful with laser
pointers man you don't want to like fry
your webcam there and it's got little
buttons that can be right click and
there's a customizable and it even has
bluetooth control for remote control of
PowerPoint presentations from the pan oh
that's cool
which is yeah that was pretty innovative
and it so nicely so it seems to me like
Huawei is trying to deliver a slightly
more corporate focused aesthetic than
what Samsung is trying to do I don't
know I mean the Samsung ones are all
just straight black
and while ways doing this brown kind of
various colors what other colors that
have for the e they have like fly rear
four colors let me see if I can pull it
up while we're chatting here but but in
delivering something that you know seem
to be a little bit more leather I think
they're going for some more slightly
more Apple styled color schemes than
what Samsung is trying to do especially
what with Samsung I think playing this
round very simple I don't think I have
any
it looks like it's gray and gold the
folio trims are brown blue brown and
pink pink isn't very that's not a very
very business you can make oh well I
don't know maybe maybe there's a
magazine editor out there that just
absolutely has to have pink a pink
laptop guy laptop case uh but in looking
at where um where Huawei was with that
what's is that a docker yeah yeah they
got a port expander oh that's kind of
cool
VGA so they're new one is designed a
little differently because the old one
had ports right here
so you couldn't really plug something in
that at that point in time so they
revamped the design of their new one
that's interesting that they like I'm
wondering how many people are really
still using VGA I know presentation gear
I thought about that too but if you're
in a business or a school they probably
have projectors in all the rooms and
those projectors are probably old yeah a
bit of me like even for the last time I
taught at an acting workshop about a
year ago and it was in this dis old old
like theater and everything there had at
least HDMI he even even in this old like
busted black box theater I was like yeah
you need to plug into a projector I've
got HDMI and I've got like Apple
DisplayPort yeah I got okay awesome yeah
I think we'll be fine all right great
good deal so what what do you think
about some of the some of the updates
the refresh on the mate Book II again I
mean I this doesn't look like always
trying to make the play like back when
Windows 8 was really getting translated
into low-cost atom chipset you know mini
tablets you could pick up my wife used a
Toshiba that was like $100 and she loved
that thing on the 8 inch ones yeah
exactly the one of the big arguments I
think was you know if you were one of
these other players you weren't Apple
you weren't Samsung you weren't
Microsoft you were going to make the
play on price ultra low power hardware
and kind of cheap maybe even starting to
push into the more disposable and of the
tech of the tech ecosystem but they're
saying that this this next Huawei is
going to be priced at 999 euro to start
so it really doesn't seem like Huawei
feels that they need to make the
argument that that they're cheap you
know that that's not the the impression
you should get from a Chinese
manufacturer anymore that they can
compete with bigger players yeah they're
going for the good quality tablet that
can replace your laptop
kind of thing just like yeah that's true
well and in in that even there they're
pricing because both the surface pro and
the mate book ii start with core m3s
but this is this is already it's looking
like it's going to be priced at least a
couple hundred dollars higher than what
or a couple hundred euro higher than
what Microsoft is going to deliver the
certain the entry-level surface pro 4
huh but the mate book comes with the
keyboard and a pen right oh that's true
that's really got a factor in the price
so if we calculate it that way it might
be a lot closer and then they're really
right on board but I was impressed it's
like they're talking MIMO antennas
they're talking
what is this Windows 10 Signature
Edition I'm not entirely sure well that
that's just that just means there's no
bloatware oh so there that that's also
the counter-argument to a lenovo where
it's like i've never I mean think pads
are usually okay but like what was the Y
700 that I reviewed back in the day that
was a pretty well infested this is when
I get into what was pre-installed um so
I think it you know this this is an
interesting commentary and since we were
already sort of bringing that up as the
price comparison I think we need to to
go ahead and talk about the 900-pound
gorilla in the room which is the new
surface pro and that Microsoft has been
making some changes to this product line
this isn't some radical redesign over
previous the even I would say even from
the surface pro 3 this looks like it's
yes a member of the same family of
products but it's getting a nice little
spec bump definitely addressing battery
life which I think has always been a
huge issue for the surface pro pro line
and again like you were saying it's
we're seeing some refreshes to the to
the surface pen and pricing which starts
very reasonably for that M core m3 model
at $7.99
I love the regime pen yeah but but I
mean without without the surface pen so
what are your thoughts new surface pro
not the most exciting update kind of a
tick-tock refresh does this keep
Microsoft at the head does this still
help Microsoft define what a multimode
Windows Device should resemble I think
so I think the new screen tech that has
the tilt sensitivity in the pen and the
increased pressure sensitivity and the
seventh generation Intel processors
brings it all up to up to speed I think
the new kickstand has some more angles
there and so that's good but yeah
overall if you already have a surface
pro 3 or surface pro 4 it's probably not
something you need to go out and run you
know run out and buy right away but if
you've been thinking about a surface pro
it's going to be the wake up right and
so I'm trying to see so it doesn't come
with a type cover is that right right
does it come with anything it's just so
so if we were to add the surface pen and
a type cover that's going to be another
200 210 dollars I think so yeah so a
base-model surface pro gets us right in
line with kind of that pricing notion
around where Huawei was with the make
book you were right that some we're
really starting to crack into that
thousand dollar price point yeah I I
kind of like that they don't have the
pen included now because now you can
choose a color for the pen and the
keyboard right so previously it was a
silver pen and that's what you get but
now you can have a red pen with the red
cover or a blue pen with a blue cover so
I kind of like that a see it's more
about choice but yeah you got a factor
in the process yeah I mean I would be
pretty disappointing if you weren't
really paying attention you're like yeah
I'm getting News Service Pro
why is there anything else in a box I
use my finger for everything I mean the
last surface I got I really spent any
time with it's actually on the bookshelf
behind me was the surface to the surface
RT to um and and I was kind of bummed
that they didn't continue their
experiments with the blades because I
got it on this weird like promotion
where it came with their music mixing
blade oh yeah he's like sliders and
these like these touch squares to
program in like like a synthesizer or
like a some sort of reading software I
just thought man this is going to be
cool and they can come out with like a
Photoshop blade and it can come out with
a video editing blade and they can kind
of do all this other stuff and none of
that ever came to that it's just
keyboards I kind of missed the touch
keyword - yeah yeah well and again it's
it's it's kind of like in using the
Lenovo yoga book I do not like typing on
this keyboard but it is nicer than
typing on an on-screen keyboard if I
have to punch out a short piece of text
like I don't want to write a full review
on this thing I the last time I did that
was when I was reviewing it and I
actually wrote the review on of the yoga
book on the yoga book and that wasn't
very fun all I did not enjoy doing that
um but I guess I'm with you I feel that
there are sort of brief interactions
that people might want something that's
QWERTY you know you've got all those
QWERTY pads but they don't necessarily
need like a full robust keyboard
trackpad like a traditional experience
and maybe that saves them 20 bucks or
something like that it is a great
keyboard but having that touch keyboard
that was just so thin was pretty gasps I
mean these are still very thin oh no
totally and I really do feel like there
there is an argument to be made just the
fact that the type cover is a hundred
and sixty dollars he's never like if you
could do like a $99 touch cover I feel
that
would be you know sort of an appropriate
way to give someone an option because I
kind of feel and you maybe you'll
disagree with me because you know you do
so much work pen touch and you've got
your your Wacom but I think for a lot of
people out there maybe the surface pen
isn't necessarily a must-have accessory
for a portable or multimode modular
computer but some kind of text entry
probably is I'm not seeing a lot of
people walking around with surface Pro's
without the keyboard cover or unattached
so a part of me kind of feels like this
7 $99 price point is a little
disingenuous in you're pretty much
guaranteed that like the accessory you
at least need to have is another hundred
and sixty dollar ya keyboard solution
it's I think maybe it should be
advertised as a bundle right you know
and well and like kind of list what
those prices might be when you kind of
put a little different things together
like that you're right it right up front
will show you know something like like
the port expander the surface dock
that's probably not you know a mandatory
purchase for every single surface
surface owner out there I know a lot of
people who need that kind of that kind
of addition but not for everybody right
I don't think I've ever seen a surface
without its keyboard cover in the wild
no neither and I am starting to see more
surfaces you know if you go hit a coffee
shop you'll see a sea of MacBooks and
like two or three people who are the
outliers you cook at your local
Starbucks punching away on Final on the
final draft you know trying to write
their screenplays on on a surface pro
instead I go to a bio tech conferences
sometimes and there's a lot more surface
pros there oh I would totally believe
that and and like my my sister and my
brother-in-law they're big fans of
surface and they work they do a lot of
work in physics and so again it's just
altra portable still a power
full computer um but you know it's a lot
more flexible for them to carry around
and you know I've seen I've seen a lot
of traction in markets like that for for
surface stuff so I guess I guess the the
philosophical question I would want to
ask we've been we've talked about the
galaxy book we've talked about the
surface pro we talked about the huawei
mate book has Windows peaked or or I
guess I should say is is this sort of
where we should expect Windows to stay
for the next generation is there
something else that we can do to make
this you know to sort of make these
devices more portable or to fulfill more
roles or to make them more flexible it
really seems that once we got out of the
surface Pro in the surface pro 2 that
we'd kind of landed on what this should
look like and then Windows 10 the update
to Windows 10 seemed to reinforce that
idea this is what Microsoft looks like
now and this is how you should use it
now and even if you don't have one of
these modular computers a lot of systems
are being sold with touch screens at
least that that seems to be where we're
headed or at least where we're going to
stay for a little while and now that
we're here I feel like it's going to be
where we'll stay for a little while
although I haven't the surface sales
kind of stagnated a little bit lately
yeah so they're not there they're not
growing I one of the last things I read
is that surface sales were still growing
but they weren't growing as quickly kind
of the same conundrum to Apple when
Apple is called a failure for a fiscal
quarter but they still demonstrated
growth they just didn't demonstrate as
much growth as Beck you laters thought
they should have one of the last things
I read was there was sort of um Oh what
is that
Osborn effect is that what I'm is that
the right whether it was an old computer
company way back in the day and they
made this computer and then before it
was really out in the market
yo was dumb enough to say oh and you're
not going to believe what we're going to
do for for the second generation shows
computer and then no one bought the
first generation computers as a company
folded before they could make the second
generation I believe that was the Osburn
um but there was I think there was some
hint of that because I think we had an
idea that these you know from the
surface to from the surface pro to the
pro - to the pro 3 to the pro 4 these
things have been really regularly
updated and then we kind of hit just
this little bit of below where Microsoft
didn't push the sort of the same sort of
update as aggressively and so I think
there was just a little bit of a slump
as everyone was waiting to see like was
this going to be some crazy new redesign
where we're going to get a new surface
book what was what was going to happen
and I think when people saw the surface
laptop and now that we've got the
surface pro 4 refresh I think I I think
those people who were sort of holding
out will probably jump back into the
market on that again but it's not to say
that they haven't been facing some solid
competition from their other the other
Microsoft partners yeah I've been seen a
few more Lenovo's out there and you're
still not going to be able to sort of
out undersell some of the other players
you know like Acer and a sous make some
phenomenally gaming hardware but they
still make a ton of less expensive gear
that consumers can kind of jump on
whenever they're walking around a Best
Buy
hmm I think last year we were all
expecting the surface pro 5 because they
were normally they would release or
announce them like every fall right
right so yeah everybody was waiting for
that but it didn't happen well and just
how do you feel about the the sort of
the name and the branding on this like
they're not really saying the number
it's just surface yeah
it's kind of like what Apple does right
into that MacBook or a MacBook right I
still think every company should just go
two years yeah you know if you have
if you have a mac book it's the MacBook
2015 it's the MacBook 2016 it's the
surface pro 2017 I think that would help
us especially us in the review world
right what helped us out so I know
totally I think that's what we're going
to start calling the surface pro I well
I think a lot of time we do yeah you
know a pocket now will lead the way what
Microsoft should have been doing this
2017 surface pro right excuse me
so lastly I just kind of wanted to get
your thoughts I I've been very critical
about sort of crowdfunding products and
you know when when it when it works it
works really well even when it works
really well it can still be kind of a
cataclysmic failure I've got this killer
battery that I funded as part of a was
an IndieGoGo bow before crap was it was
before
Aoife last year and I just got it a
couple weeks ago
you know successfully funded crowdfunded
it's a great battery but I don't think I
needed to wait for that um excuse me
sorry we've got this a dry throat I
can't shake it so we've got a Jules
posted a story on the chewy sir book
yeah light on its feet and it stomps all
over its IndieGoGo goal base model
starts within Intel Celeron and 3450 I
am not familiar with Intel chipsets
outside of the cores anymore I know they
still memorize I mean there they go in
their opinions but what it's it's got a
it's got a Celeron CPU six gigabytes of
RAM it starts with the 64 gigabytes of
storage there's an option to crank that
up to 128 one USB type-c and two USB
three type A's almost twice the battery
capacity of I think the last generation
surface pro 4 and yeah they're comparing
it against black the last generation
surface pro
current-generation surface pro
detachable keyboard and that starting
price is four hundred and seventy-three
dollars it's pretty much price that's
not bad and it it looks a lot like just
yet another surface clone kickstand is
built into the tablet itself the even
the keyboard does that little magnetic
pop-up yeah we're the the very top edge
of the board snaps so that's got that
little bit of an angle to it trackpad
built into the keyboard and it looks
like I don't know if it does if it's
going to include but I don't know
anything about the seller on and I'm
just kind of surprised because there's
that sort of jump between like atom CPUs
to sort of the core like the core m3 is
sort of the sweetheart right now if you
want a low-cost a lower-cost I shouldn't
say a low-cost a lower-cost fanless
design but let's see customers can also
get a full sir book set for the 128
gigabyte version for 399 Oh for the
super early bird okay I'm see I see so
if you were to go and help crowd fund
right now you could get the full kit
with the keyboard right and the larger
storage capacity for $399 so if you were
to get one of those I would say you'd
probably want to jump on a deal like
that
if it comes out if it comes at well I
mean it's it's funded so now it's just a
matter of when its last win so is that
something that you you could you could
take first bin get your work done it
seems I don't know it's probably a
little underpowered for weight a little
under parity yeah I mean except for the
battery life the battery life is
probably great yeah well I would I would
have to believe so if they're really
saying that this thing has its things
got a similar battery capacity to an
iPad pro and almost twice the battery
capacity of the last surface pro 4 so
that should mean it's it's at least an
all-day
but it doesn't come out for a year or
two this will always be so crazy nervous
about so I've had so many great
experiences with crowdfunding and just
the last two or three projects that I've
thrown my own money at one of them
didn't get funded and the other two it's
just like they took forever to to ship
those products so yeah I'm a little on
crowdfunded products but so do you think
that this is so I I don't even know
exactly how I want to even phrase this
question for you um we know that there's
sort of an idea of premium devices or
you know I'm going to say thousand
dollar price point you're talking your
iPad pros you're talking your base model
surface pro you're talking the the
huawei mate book trying to push that
experience to a lower price tear hasn't
really been very successful I think
Microsoft tried really hard with a well
surface RT and that was a misstep I
don't think they had a very good
software strategy even though I think
the hardware was actually quite nice but
then even with the atom powered surface
that they released that didn't really
seem to catch on as well with I'm too
nervous
well it can can we make that balance is
is there a way that we can say like this
is made out of nicer materials it's made
out of an a magnesium alloy it's got a
huge battery but will people care about
those things if they fire it up and it
doesn't feel like a nice as nice as a
software experience as the hardware
chasis feels when they're pulling it out
of the box I'm not sure about that
well I mean like do you think consumers
are really like is is there is there any
gap in this market that consumers are
really thinking you know like hey I need
something cheap but I needed to look
nice and it's okay if it's a little bit
slower is that a product segment that
we're just over looking it's a small
cheap or powerful pick dude right right
that choice we're gonna try and make our
like our business triangle there yeah
you never done fast you never done cheap
you can have it done well yes it takes
to do so because I'd be really curious
to see who who responds to a product
like this Windows 10 home I mean I I
think they do have their eyes on a
market demographic I think they have
their eye on a certain type of consumer
I just don't know how many people really
really want that you know other than
just they're they're the sort of people
that seem to jump on crowdfunding
campaigns let me see if I can pull up
because it sounds like this has already
been funded so let me um let me pull up
the IndieGoGo page but what what do you
think would be most important to try and
translate down into a lower price tier
is it the nicer build is that the more
emotional part of it or do you think
people are going to be disappointed if
it doesn't feel as powerful as a product
which looks similar I think they'll be
disappointed hmm it's hard to tow okay
because a lot of this feels like it's
it's close to older surface tech the the
stylus supports a thousand 1024 levels
of pressure to be and support it's got
that dual band Wi-Fi I love that they
advertised still advertised I've heard
that on the other hand it might be good
enough
now it's all about what's good enough at
that price right so for talking 500 $600
range maybe people will be able to
accept that the speed is not up to the
standards of the 1000 or 2000 dollar
tablet PC yeah see this is really this
is really interesting so what is the
okay so their goal was thirty thousand
dollars they're currently a two hundred
and four thousand dollars so there are
six hundred and eighty percent of their
goal but if I'm looking at the perks
their perks aren't maxed out and still
my mother yeah so you know they've got
their the 64 gig for $2.99 the 64 gig
with a keyboard and a pen for 349 and
the 128 gig with a keyboard and a pen
for 399 and all of them still have
plenty of room so the most popular is 3
the 399 128 gig but out of 200 units
they are claiming 120 so there's still
there's still a team or that you could
go and buy at the time this podcast was
recorded and if I just do a quick little
bit of math on this calculator here 20
times mmm it's 47 plus 49 times 77 plus
17 okay so they've been funded to two
hundred and four thousand six hundred
and forty nine dollars but only eighty
thousand dollars of that seems to be
from their perks oh that's kind of weird
right where the risk the money it's like
who's running over to an IndieGoGo like
you know what I'll chip them $5.00 that
doesn't seem like it would be a thing uh
yeah I'm kind of curious like how that's
how that's been backed and less there
maybe there were more perks I don't know
they readjusted their perks because they
got such a great response I have no idea
but I only see the three perks listed
and I see plenty of room on those perks
for this being six hundred and eighty
percent over its initial funding goal ah
another thing that I'm skeptical about
getting the drivers right because when
the surface pro 4 originally came out
the Thrive around were terrible yeah
they were bad GPU drivers and the
original surface pro had by bad a
graphics tablet drivers for photoshop
and paint turn it didn't work well those
they had a long time to get that stuff
right yeah so nobody knew are they gonna
be able to do that I was skeptical about
Huawei too though because that was the
maid book last year that was their first
thing mm-hmm but they really did a good
job they they got that working really
nicely well I mean this is also this
companies out of Shenzhen so you would
hope that they have access to some kind
of talent developer resources something
Bacolod uh yeah I just did that really
bought I like I really want to know if
there have been 562 backers who how did
this thing get funded reflect their bags
like I'm going through and I'm looking
at all of their backers right now or
nonnamous just five hours ago
the 399 perk I am got to stop because
I'm going to sit here and go through
their whole site um yeah I'll be really
curious I mean like I know Jules loves
digging up these kinds of things so this
was a fun one to take a look at but I'll
be really curious to see if this well I
first of all I doubt we'll probably even
get our hands on one unfortunately but
yeah this is one that I'm going to
bookmark because I want to follow up on
I'm really curious about that notion I
think with phones were starting to get a
point across that just because you
didn't spend seven eight nine hundred
dollars on a phone doesn't mean you
can't still have a premium experience
right but I don't think we've managed to
find a way to translate that into more
traditional laptop or hybrid computers
hmm and so if more of these companies
are going to start producing products
like this and we see good support and
it's not just you know some weird
manufacturer Chinese tablet from
banggood supply or something that's just
you know kind of stapled together from
parts that were leftover or something
then then I could be really excited
about that but the companies that I
think in the past we might have turned
to a company like Huawei they're making
the jump straight to the same tier the
same sort of premium tier as the
established competition that we already
have so I wonder if there's maybe not
even just a consumer idea that I didn't
spend a lot on this so obviously it's
not good hmm I wonder maybe a part of
that is just the emotional argument if I
only spent $400 on it then it can't be
as good as you know the $2,500 I would
have spent an act book or something like
that
here's a $59 Windows 10 tablet
which one is that new vision I have no
idea what that is but for the price is
actually really good oh that's quick I
don't expect it to do much right well I
was kind of bummed my Acer died um I got
in I forget which one it is but it was
the little 8 inch Acer and I think I
picked it up for $80.00 yeah and you
know I got it when you know Windows 8
was brand spanking new when we were just
starting to get these these different
tablet solutions out and so
unfortunately my user is now dead it
doesn't it doesn't boot up anymore but
my wife's Toshiba she doesn't use it
like she used to she kind of just has a
bedside I heard the bedside table by
buyer bed she kind of picks it up kind
of pokes around does a little read it
puts it back down goes to bed but it
still it's still kicking that thing has
well exceeded my expectations for $100
tablet yeah I had the 8 inch still $100
tablet for a while but the battery
started bulging boom
so yeah that's no good well I mean yeah
we've been covering enough like bad
battery news you know let's let's end on
that note
you know our products exploding on us
huh what Adam thank you so much for
joining I am just this was something I
really wanted to have you on again I
think your expertise really lend a nice
perspective because it's not just you
using these things to review them I've
seen you in action with these products
and I've seen the kind of work that
you've produced especially from your
photography business and that that's the
kind of thing that I always like that
taking that conversation to a point
where this is something that we're not
just like oh I benchmarked it and I kind
of poked around on the screen and I
loaded a couple apps and it plays this
one game really well there's at least a
little bit more of a focus or at least a
little bit more of a perspective on
getting some kind of work done Media
work entertainment work
on Jan Eddie InDesign signage for
building right now and websites and post
through some books and doing all of that
with these guys so back to the Wacom
that is not so I guess that's the
takeaway right is is for as good as
these things are it doesn't sound like
anything's unseated your Wacom no I
switch around you know I'll use the
first rope or I've been using the Galaxy
book it's very diplomatic of the Wacom
with those buttons I identical blends so
good I have I have no need for it and I
want one so bad I would just just just
break my heart a little bit if I were to
spec one of those out how much would
that hurt my wallet um I think it's
between the cheapest might be fifteen
hundred and then it can go up to like
three thousand that's not as bad as I
thought it would be the the most
expensive one has four Gate GPU NVIDIA
Quadro
oh yeah okay so that's actually I mean
like that's why I'm that's why I ended
up going with a gaming laptop because I
wanted a discrete GPU yeah that's
actually not as bad as I thought you
were going to say for something like
that I would maybe graviturtle doing
something like that when my when it's
time to replace my blade and my wife is
probably going to be very mad at me like
I'll have to replace my blade sooner
than I thought I did and that one has a
16 inch screen so that's that's even
bigger oh right on 13 I mean how could
you even look at a 13-inch screen this
is that's crazy pants
alright Adam thanks for dropping by man
I want everyone to go and check out your
Galaxy book review
thought that was a great write-up some
excellent photography of the product in
that review as well as I would have
expected and a really nice look at a
product especially from the perspective
of someone that really does use this
this class of product a lot and I really
enjoyed that review mm
