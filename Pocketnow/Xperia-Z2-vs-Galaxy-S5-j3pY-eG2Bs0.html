comparison desk each take the form of an
elongated water-resistant rectangle each
one runs the latest version of Android
and one of the hottest chipsets
available and each is made by a
manufacturer whose name starts with the
letter S but aside from that they've got
almost nothing in common so let's dive
into their differences see if we can
learn something I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is Sony Xperia z2
versus samsung galaxy s5 a brief word of
thanks our Sony Xperia z2 comes to us
from the good people at GSM nation one
of the first online retailers to stock
this device in the United States if you
want to see two like this one follow the
link in the description below order
yours today all of us at pocket now
thank gsm nation for the loaner device
that device takes the form of a sharp
cornered slab purple in this case with
glass back and front panels / a metal
and plastic mid plate studded with
controls ports and hatches it's larger
in nearly every dimension than the
curvier almost pillowy Galaxy s5 which
is made mainly of plastic and sits much
lighter in the palm than the Sony device
as a result Samsung's more curvaceous
build is definitely sort of ho-hum next
to the Xperia Z ARP right angles but the
Samsung phone is also much easier to
hold in the hand welcome back to that
the Sony phones larger footprint allows
it to squeeze in a display that's
slightly larger but it carries the same
1080p resolution and nearly the same
pixel density the printable difference
is in technology but the end result is a
stunning picture on each particularly
when vibrant colors are called for sony
has finally brought to touch unlock to
its smart phone line a big convenience
and it also deserves credit for finally
solving its horrible side visibility
problems of yesteryear the Samsung still
carries the day on darks though with
Sony's blacks more of a milky blue gray
and we also prefer Samsung's bluish
whites to Sony's reddish ones each
allows for minimal tweaking of the color
palette but only Samsung provides an
ultra dim setting from nighttime reading
which comes in handy more times than
you'd expect Samsung's display is also
brighter in direct sunlight and because
it lacks on-screen keys it usually
offers more usable area beneath each of
those displays sits the pride of
Qualcomm the Snapdragon 801 SOC that
heart beats a little faster on the s5
but the Xperia brings 50% more RAM to
back it up which we think is a more
significant spec bump each offers
microSD expansion up to a staggering 120
eight gigs and each chips with 16 gigs
of internal storage with the galaxy s5
offering larger options in some markets
those specs being neck-and-neck mean
these things sit right alongside each
other on the performance meter so don't
expect benchmark shutdowns and gaming
face offs from this comparison which of
these works better for you is a question
of lifestyle we mentioned earlier that
the Galaxy s5 is easier to hold in the
hand well it's also more comfortable to
talk on to shove in a pocket toss onto a
countertop and just generally use that's
partially because Samsung didn't really
shall we say try on the industrial
design but it's also because this is a
device aimed at active people it's heart
rate monitor s health fitness suite and
water resistance combined with its
unremarkable build make it a phone that
well you just plan to get rough and
tumble with now the sony phone isn't
entirely an indoor pet it does offer
immersion resistance in fact it's got a
slightly better rating where water is
concerned but with its glass sandwich
construction it's more cat than dog it
can get wet if it needs to but it
clearly wasn't made for it the Xperia is
not necessarily what you'd call an
active person's phone but don't for one
moment take that to mean that the Xperia
z2 can't keep up in the fun zone
because it surely can and that's most
obvious with its camera despite the
difference in resolution compared to the
Samsung device side-by-side shots are
often so close in quality they need to
be considered on a case-by-case basis
that's a big accomplishment for sony
whose smartphone cameras were four years
plagued by software that kicked out over
processed noisy images you can still see
that noise in the
front-facing camera shot but the Galaxy
s5s offering while wider angle is just
as noisy back on the primary shooter the
Xperia z2 does particularly well against
the Samsung phone in low-light where it
pulls more detail from a shot but
Samsung's HDR mode spanks Sony's
superior auto for doing the same in
variable lighting underwater the Sony
device is much quicker to get focus and
more likely to keep hold of it to
shooting video with each is a lot of fun
as well
both below and above the waves
as great as the galaxy s5s camera is we
find we prefer shooting with sony's
camera on the whole from the super fluid
software stabilization to the hardware
camera key to the more friendly
viewfinder and higher resolution the z2
s camera experience overall feels more
polished almost luxurious
which software shell you think is better
and will depend on your sense of style
and again we go back to active person
versus aesthetic person in our full
Galaxy s5 review we called Samsung's new
user interface a step on the road to
something greater but somewhat
incomplete in its current form with
hints of modernism held back by remnants
of previous versions that said it is
fairly speedy and it'll get the job done
even for demanding users in particular
Samsung's multi window is the best way
we've ever seen to do two things at once
in a smartphone Sony's small apps are
well not as useful but the experience
interface on the whole is actually
pretty snappy despite its weight
visually it's more consistent than
Samsung's UI but it also looks older in
some ways and there's just as much Sony
bloat as ever
while my magazine on the galaxy s5 may
be sluggish it's at least useful some of
the time by contrast it's doubtful
you'll ever make enough use of Sony's
what's new app to justify its prominent
position alongside Google now either way
you go here you'll be comfortable
knowing you've got the most powerful
version of Android running underneath
but without a custom launcher you're
going to be hacking away at an awful lot
of cruft to get to it testing these
phones side-by-side for only three days
on AT&amp;amp;T we're not yet ready to report
how things like battery life compare the
z2 s power pack is significantly larger
but Samsung's is removable meaning it's
also compatible with wireless charging
giving you by the right back cover
some talk time shed light on how these
phones handle themselves in voice calls
the galaxy s5 features much more
aggressive noise reduction meaning it
handles challenges like this wood
chipper more effectively but in exchange
it also clips the ends of words a little
too readily even in quiet rooms the s5s
earpiece was also louder and Basya on
our end than was the Xperia z2 s and the
galaxy was more comfortable to talk on
overall still neither would be our first
choice if call quality was a major
consideration and frankly that goes for
their loudspeakers too yes it's true
that Sony's moved its speakers around to
the front on the z2 and that's a move we
love to see but they're still too quiet
to carry on a speaker phone call on even
a moderately busy street and that goes
for Samsung as well the same is true for
media playback okay in a quiet room but
not in many other places here's how they
compare in the booth
you
okay so maybe there are a few more
similarities here than we let on you're
going to get that when two products are
vying for the same dollars in the same
category but we're still convinced that
these phones will appeal to very
different buyers at least here in the US
the gouge has five for those who like to
stick with a familiar brand and who want
more whiz-bang features than they might
even know what to do with the Xperia z2
is for those in search of finely crafted
hardware and a more refined photographic
experience for us it's the Xperia z2
that wins for edgy style but the galaxy
s5 that takes the cake in shear
capability which area you value more
will determine which of these belongs in
your pocket now once again a big thanks
to the folks at GSM nation selling the
Xperia z2 right now at GSM nation com

importantly thanks for watching we'll
