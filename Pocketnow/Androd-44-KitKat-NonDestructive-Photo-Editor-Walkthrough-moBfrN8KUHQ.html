these days now that camera may be great
or it may be mediocre sometimes it might
even be laughable but what happens once
you get the pictures on your smartphone
most of the time they just sit there
well thanks android 4.4 Kit Kats new
photo editor your pictures not only look
good but you can do all kinds of cool
stuff with them I'm Joe Levi with pocket
now let's go make some pictures
beautiful this is my nexus 5 it is stuck
and this is the gallery app so let's go
ahead and open this up these are
pictures that I've mainly taken on other
devices some of them the Galaxy Nexus
some of them the nexus 4 but most of
them not the Nexus 5 as such not
everything looks as good as it could
because they don't have as high end of a
camera that having been said let's go
ahead and open something from summer of
last year when we went down to zions and
if you'll notice right down here I've
got some pictures that I'd really like
to salvage it's my daughter will use
this one she's in the shadows right here
at the opening to the Narrows anybody
who's been to Utah it's probably been to
the Narrows but not that great i mean
great picture in the background and a
silhouette of her in the foreground
obviously not the best framed picture
that i could have taken but what are you
going to do in a slot canyon right so
let's open that up and see what we can
do first of all we've got all of these
cool filters that we can apply nothing
looks like what i want to do we can also
apply some borders and some overlays and
what not again not what I'm trying to do
we can crop straighten straighten is
kind of cool obviously still not what
I'm trying to do so I'll X out of that
we can mirror it rotate it all kinds of
cool stuff what I want to do is over
here here we can apply auto color we can
apply exposure and adjust that let's
bump the exposure up a bit and to see
what it's like versus you know what
you've just done versus the original
just grab over on the side and you can
see
or and after just as easy as that you
can also do that if you're careful off
the bottom sometimes it's easier than
other times to do that off the bottom
there we go off the top so I like in the
background all of the colors but the
shadows are too deep so this is kind of
washed but you can you can see kind of
where we're going with that I'm down
there let's go ahead and accept that for
now what else can we do well let's see
if we can play with the contrast a
little bit can help bring it out a bit
nothing there I particularly like let's
look at shadows and this is where we can
do some some playing around to see if we
can help pull that subject out of the
shadows so I like that it's helping
quite a bit let's go ahead and look at
contrast again in here see if we can
help that looks okay and I'm just
messing around in here to see you know
what we can do it's bump the vibrance up
a bit so we get something that color
back highlights nothing that i
particularly like there but you know
cool effects and if I don't like
something I can always go back and undo
there's a history that you can use and
this interface looks a little bit
different on tablet so I couldn't make
it do this in landscape on the Nexus 5
this layout is over here on the side so
you may have seen some videos out there
that show you kind of what it's what
it's doing what it's looking like that
way so add some structure that's
starting to look a lot better come on
over in here and let's focus local area
right on her bring the brightness up on
her a bit saturation and we don't mess
with that saturation but let's let's go
back into local I like to bring in that
that brightness up a bit just a little
bit so there we go lots of neat things
like I said you can do in here even
messing with the curves this is one of
the best overlays that I have seen two
to play with your curves you can do all
kinds of wacky stuff and playing with
the colors obviously I'm not going to be
doing that here but
you can usually you know get a nice
little curve like that and it helps a
bit so we'll say okay there and I think
we're going to call that good look at
the before look at the after and I'm not
a photo editor guys and this just took a
few minutes and that looks to me like a
much more usable picture than than what
I had before of course your thoughts may
vary let's go ahead and get out of this
will save it takes a minute to write the
full size we're going to come over here
this is a picture that I did earlier
this is my sister and my son at her
wedding and I've just applied some of
those filters in here to kind of bring
her out blur the background just a
little vignette to highlight really
what's important in that picture so that
was a look at the photo editor inside
the android 4.4 kitkat gallery app there
are lots of cool things that you can do
with it and all non-destructive now
something interesting and unique that's
coming up soon it's Google+ photos right
now the app on Android is relatively
basic and does a lot of the stuff that
we just showed you however the online
version has lots and lots of neat things
that it does automatically for you and
that you can apply manually eventually
we'll see that coming over to our
androids at least that's what I hope
thank you so much for watching if you
liked what you saw why not throw us a
thumbs up and of course follow us on all
of your favorite social media networks
