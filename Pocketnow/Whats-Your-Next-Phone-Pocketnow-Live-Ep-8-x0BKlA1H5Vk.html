yeah you didn't hear about that the
groundhog in Ohio I've heard it's
something it's something us rated but I
haven't heard a entire story behind that
the mayor there is trying to be kind of
tongue-in-cheek and saying that the
groundhog is accountable for
misrepresenting early spring the world
like Jill the best yeah so so they're
like hey lets you know put him to death
this uh good winter time presses me to
such an extent that I by maybe wouldn't
shed it here I would probably call PETA
though well we will talk about many many
things tonight hopefully you guys have
topics and suggestions and questions
we're going to do things a little bit
differently we decided to have only
three editors on today's full so that we
can free up as many slots for you guys
to join as possible and we will also do
the following thing if you guys don't
have any questions or any topics in this
conversation we will just say hi to you
and then unfortunately we'll have to
kick you out so that we can free up a
lot and with that and the bad guy and
here comes a good guy Michael with an
announcement oh yes yes yes I don't have
an announcement really i just have a
kind of like a plea for help because
I've I somehow managed to drop my phone
and a pitcher of water and I wondered
Tony or Taylor if you might be able to
help me out with that oh my god can i
call you i think yeah you actually can

there he is look at that it's ringing on
my end Hey hahaha the most random ah so

pretty much the coolest thing it can do
so now I'm done good and with that let's
not waste any more time let's start to
talk to people and since I am the first
one alphabetically I will choose
Medellin thumbs 10 yeah we're getting a
lot of feedback but I don't know what
it's from a lot of really high and
somebody not muted right maybe maybe you
can try to unmute your microphone from
the top right corner like that like that
exactly and congratulations you are
exactly the third lady to join us live
for which I thank you where are you from
Denmark Denmark we had lots of calls
from the mark yeah I noticed and
actually Matt it is it is it pronounced
Madeleine by the way yes it is Ann
Thompson Madeline you you are a frequent
commenter it's nice to talk to you on
the Hangout happy then scoop and
constant readership yeah um huge fan
huge fan thank you very much thank you
yes and the fan of me but yeah thank you
well actually I think the funny wow
that's great I don't get that often so
like like all your toys in the videos
it's funny yeah I love those things
ordered boards your arrangement with all
the androids being angry at the ISIL
your latest editorial yeah I had to do
something like that it was
I get it meanwhile i'm sitting over here
with like to plush angry birds being
like wish i was like Taylor and all your
Star Trek stuff in the other room oh
well yeah of course so Medlen what do
you want to talk about tonight well i
was actually wanting to talk about the
new nokia the u.s. um because that's
them i would like to get as my new phone
because the current wanna have this this
one oh good old HTC yeah actually I hate
HTC oh why is that them's fightin words
wow it's not that it's not like it's bad
but I'm threading a nokia and so anymore
I think the build is just much better
have you ever entered the HTT one new
change your mind on the build thing and
also the 1x dealer is a fan and that
thing with i was a big fan of the 1x as
well yeah yeah yeah I HTC at a point
there i think there was a point where we
were saying HTC is like the only thing
for doing well for a moment was hardware
design so Michael can you describe your
disappointment on a scale from one to
ten when you are at mwc at the nokia
event and you found out that there is no
HD is no Nokia EOS man it was close to
like an 80 so frustrated I mean you know
it's cool you know because the buzz is
kind of died down on the on the EOS so
the code name is device so I'm glad
metal and that you bring it up because
it would be stunning to see I think it
will be amazing when it when it drops
and it's interesting that it's going to
be a big enough device to get you to
switch platforms apparently i really
hope is going to be a baby between the
920 and the 808 beautiful baby oh man
that's gonna be my next daily driver
yeah except me you may talk it over that
yeah i think the design of the build of
the nine of 20 and the camera the 808
it's got to be beautiful nice up it's
the most important thing in the phone
for me it's a phone note the camera so i
think that's going to be a crazy
you can definitely agree with that I'm
another person who takes a lot of
pictures using their phone using your
phone a lot I don't think half a
thousand pictures on my thumbs and do
you usually post them somewhere on
facebook on Twitter on Instagram or do
you just keep them offline or maybe
occasionally print them well most of
them is on facebook and some of them are
used for work and but I edit pictures
sometimes so I think it's important that
the camera is good because I don't have
enough money to get a pic aspects
expensive camera so so despite your I
mean in addition to your current
feelings about not liking HTC the one
would really not be a good choice for
you oh they just did you see I have the
Xperia of new and currently just broke a
me just doesn't work so that's why I'm
actually just borrowing my sister's old
phone she has the galaxy s3 now by the
way not even the galaxy s4 could change
your mind no I'm not that Samsung fan
either why don't you like Samsung
because i think it's feel so cheap and
the bill does not rated that great come
on people don't hate on her i agree with
her yeah I'm sorry thing here mama
billion park about this all week yeah
that seems to be like the ok don't hate
not heard them hate on me hate on
Michael yeah yeah I'm new for some
haterade we've been the hangouts and
podcasts three days in a row we keep
coming back to this yeah it's like it's
definitely the discussion of the month
like is the yep it's always a variation
on galaxy s4 vs one so it's nice to hear
it's refreshing to hear somebody come
out with long and say is like what am I
excited about I'm excited about this
phantom piece of vaporware from Nokia
it's like okay sweet I'm a die-hard
hardcore fan of nokia or you're very
close to finland well i don't think
that's why well i'm just asking because
usually european people tend to be fans
of knock I was a huge fan of nakia
I'm European too and it's it's a certain
patriotism if you like well some of my
first phones were not here the most
pablor the third p10 right and i have
that and many more but yeah i'm just a
future not yet had Emily geographically
speaking like Tony I think you have a
good point there because I frequently
give the benefit of the doubt to
Motorola because it american company
that i grew up with and it's like it
doesn't he sneaks up on you so yeah
that's a good question i think yeah I'm
my stepfather he got the 920 now I'm so
envious but I supposed to get it by the
time something went wrong in the
payments so I'm just waiting for the
next one and if my calculations are
right maybe the next one will be
somewhere at the end of summer beginning
of autumn when microsoft announced
announced is a huge windows phone revamp
what do you think of Windows Phone have
you used Windows Phone do you like
Windows Phone I like it I love it I'll
love the user interface I love the
design of it and various beautiful and
simple and I played with my stepfather's
phone and I love it good it's good to
see that Windows Phone still has the
potential to get some attention Madeline
do you have any any final thoughts for
us we will have to move on because we'd
like to talk to as many people as
possible well actually no no thank you
very much for joining us don't leave
before you tell everybody where they can
find you on Twitter well my twitter name
is Matt SI cad they may be said e dat
and it's the same name on here back to
me okay spell it once again because I
interrupted you it may be said ie CIT
awesome everybody go follow her she's an
occupant a windows phone then thank you
very much madam for joining us and hope
you come back next week soon hello hi
dear bye bye and Michael to you oh I get
to choose somebody that's that's right I
forgot so many people have fancy banners
right now I want to see I want to hear
from well here comes my pronunciation is
is it Christie's it
Steve uh third from the left in my view
within a darker room with the awesome
his name is Christy soo choo and he's
Romanian right judging from from his
name you have unmute your microphone
from the top right hello guys you can
call me Chris it's ok actually I'd like
hi and I'd like to talk to you about the
two topics and after that I have a
question for you if it's possible the
first one right yes the first topic is
about the materials and the construction
of a galaxy s4 and HTC One which is
basically metal versus plastic I like
very much the design of the HTC One and
the materials that were put in this
phone but for the past couple of six or
seven phones that I lately had I just
used the plastic films mainly from
Samsung Samsung the problem is with
metal I had some metal phones also but
the problem with metal is that when you
are in winter it gets very very cold to
the touch I don't know it looks very
good but when you have to when you have
to put your hand in the pocket and grab
the phone you feel that is very very
cold and also in the summer it gets very
very hot another problem that I had with
metal phones is that when you drop one
usually get scars on it versus a little
plastic you one when everybody just pops
out and the energy is dissipated and you
usually don't get too much scars on it
and I'd like to hear your opinion about
these things because I don't think they
were talked about recently I feel like
Taylor Taylor and I had a such a long
conversation on this yesterday on a
podcast that Taylor's probably got a
fresh in his mind and he hasn't talked
in while Tony if it's okay with you I
was gonna suggest that the I talk that
Taylor talk Oh see well first I'm going
to
just hold this up this is my iphone 5 I
don't know if you can see this okay okay
I can't see it okay um if you look here
it's not a that's not a glint or
anything that is a big nice chunk out of
the corner that is waiting on the
pockets counterpoint right now if you
look at this and you will see that there
is absolutely no chips scars and scuffs
whatsoever going round and round and
round and round but they did happen to
move to drop the phone no this I was
explaining on the podcast yesterday i
sat down to my car it wasn't there i
sent my the phone on the seat and then i
hit the brakes once and it flew onto the
rubber format there was nothing there
for it to hit except for rubber and it
shouldn't have did it like that that's
really the only big blemish on there I
don't know where that came from that was
the only thing it could have come from
but there's no real explanation how it
got there so every metal foam that I've
had I've had that same kind of issue
with but i still prefer it over plastic
which is kind of odd yeah I had a feeler
for just yawns yeah I would like to ask
Christy something Christy how many times
do you drop your phone say in a year
usually I take a lot of care I think
Carol for my phones because I like them
i enjoy them and usually i don't drop
them but sometimes it just happens and
after that the product is not looking so
good as you would like to and do you
agree with me that phones are consumer
products and not tennis tennis / golf /
basketballs or other other things I mean
yes of course of course but they are not
ah you drop your DVD player it will
break if you drop anything else it will
break I mean they are not gods michael
has a god inside the water and you can
drop that as long as you want yeah okay
i will do doing demonstration just smash
it on the table that is great stuff guys
i think the problem is
the more important problem may be the
thing that we sometimes the phone can
get the hot or cold to the touch maybe
that is the problem that could be a
little bit more disturbing so I'm
interested on that net point for me I I
don't it's not the atmospheric factors
that caused me concern on that it's the
fact that you can if the processor is
one that tends to get really hot you can
start to feel that through the body and
a metal phone makes that feel horrible
go ahead go the nexus one I had it and I
left it in my car face down so the metal
was exposed in the Sun in summer I just
just maybe about five or ten minutes and
I went I grabbed the phone and it
literally burned my hand I mean I don't
have any scarring or anything but it
hurt like it just like all I could do
was drop the phone because it was so hot
and I flipped it over and and looked i
had a thermometer application on there
so not it would tell the battery
temperature the battery temperature was
138 degrees woohoo yeah and and that was
one thing about metal that kind of you
know I kind of I get what you're where
you're coming from there but the point I
was getting around to making was the
same one I made on the podcast is this
right here is by far my favorite
material that any phone has ever been
made out of it's a hard polycarbonate
that Nokia uses that HTC used in this
and we've seen it in a few places now
polycarbonate is just plastic so this is
technically polycarbonate but these are
two totally different types of
polycarbonate they're they're totally
different thicknesses have different
texture and I guess I don't know the
name maybe resilience well also the damn
sex got a layer of hyper glaze on top of
theirs which which makes all the
difference in the world oh yeah let me
just throw in my two cents your analogy
I'm gonna do another one you have to
watch is here one is a metal watch and
one is a rubber watch of course the
rubber watched when you put it on your
hand he will not feel anything but the
metal watch in the first five minutes
you're going to wear it you're going to
feel it being cold to your hand and then
it will get some warm from your body so
it's the same thing with any phone or
tablet or anything else which is made
out of
aluminum or any other metal so it's just
inside a metal itself it's its first
property yes yes that was one of the
problems that I want to talk to you
because I sometimes feel that is more
comfortable to hold plastic phones and
maybe that is sometimes an advantage
especially when you go out in the winter
you go to the mountainside and so on and
that would be another point of
discussion and when is the okay okay
just just quickly i was going to say
i'll give you another another
counterpoint to that this is a nice if I
don't have the flip cover on here the
flip cover gives me some grip but if I
don't so if I have the normal back case
or cover on my note 2 it's really hard
to hold on to it sticks extremely slick
I've not dropped it but almost dropped
with a lot of times it'll just kind of
slip out of my hand and sometimes
depending on the middle you get a little
more I don't know maybe a little more
tackiness I guess it really just depends
on what metal it is what kind of finish
it has but like a matte finish metal has
a little more grip to it especially
something like to eat one because it has
what appears to be a kind of a speckled
matte finish right can you can you
elaborate on that maybe a little Michael
or Tony you've both that am I haven't I
don't know that I believe I'm gonna show
yeah they're pretty it's pretty smooth
finish it's too it is speckled Taylor
but the as far as the field goes in the
hand it's it's quite smooth and it's I
can see myself dropping it fairly easily
just be extra of it but you know I think
this really comes down to and this will
be the last thing I say on it i mean
really plastic I think you could make a
lot of arguments for why it's more
utilitarian you can make a lot of
arguments for why it's a better material
for phones overall in terms of longevity
and durability and all that metal is
disadvantageous in a practical sense I
think if you're not as practical a
person if you value things like feel / /
practicality then metal is the one way
to go and I'll just I'm one of those
people so I love it I mean yes it
scratches easier yes it's has a bevy of
disadvantages but it just feels so good
that I will plus it looks so good yes
she won yes we'd like to wrap it up if
you have a question for us
I yes I have one question I'd like to
ask you about text reflow in browsers I
usually read a lot on my phone I have a
galaxy note 2 and i have a galaxy s2
that I'd like to switch with a 5-inch
are and i also had the ones an ipad and
it has a very big screen but you can't
read on it because it does not have text
reflow usually Android browsers don't
have text reflow and I think that is a
pretty big problem especially when Gary
in 2013 and things should be a little
bit easier to read I will I will
disagree with you Android browsers do
have text reflow and actually HTC one
has text reflow msh6 HTC phones have
text reflow in the default browser and I
also use a chrome google chrome in the
phone and it has some accessibility
options where you can increase the font
but from an OS perspective and for exert
that doesn't have by default is enabled
it's pretty hard to read text even on a
tablet like an iPad let's say oh yeah
that's the reason that's one reason I
never really web browse with the iphone
as I couldn't use text reflow I totally
agree with you there and the iPad it's
less of an issue because you can you can
see more per per page so you zoom in and
you can still read pretty much
everything at a decent font size but
yeah I agree that maybe maybe the iphone
but most Android browsers do have text
reflow yeah and in google chrome does
not this has been mentioned already but
I'm right in saying that right google
chrome for android does not have text
reflow built in precise some
accessibility options where i can use
the phone in quantized but yes i usually
use it that way but by default there is
no text reflow and it's very annoying
just to go left and right and especially
if you want to read the text to be
bigger so you can see clearer and it
doesn't affect your eyes because i have
nothing to add other than you are
absolutely right not completely agree
with you I think text reflow is one of
the best ideas to come to mobile
we're out and it should be on every
mobile browser in my opinion sorry the
black sheep and I will disagree with
everybody I hate extra flow I people at
the first second I get a new phone which
has it I disabled it on the HTC One and
the main reason for that is number one
it is slow whenever you zoom in you lose
one or two seconds until the text is
becoming refloat and number two I don't
really need it I mean with phones
nowadays having 300 plus PPI you can
easily read text if you are zooming into
the text column that's and reason number
three most of today's browsers have a
great reader option iphone has it on iOS
a HTC one or all the other flagship
androids have it on Android 4.2 it's
just basically a you know what the
reader option is it text and the
pictures and it brings you a very nice
representation of the content itself so
these three reasons why i don't use text
reflow the problem with the reader is
that you have to wait until the page is
loaded completely and after that we have
to press a button but if you use the
accessibility options in chrome before
the page loads the text becomes a bigger
and the last thing i would like to ask
you is if there is any text difference
text size difference between a 720p
screen and on 1080p screen have you ever
noticed this kind of problem at the same
zone level does a result resolution
effect to text size extra when I was you
used yeah there's different DPI settings
yeah that's all I was gonna say yeah
when I was using the droid DNA when I
was reviewing it my buddy actually got
it always after I reviewed but actually
he routed his DNA and I had a stock DNA
right next to it and his routed DNA he
had chosen to really really amp up the
ramp down the text size and like you can
take advantage of that display and it's
amazing but you really can't see it
unless you have the best I side in the
world but no if you're just you talk in
stock and you've got a 720p galaxy s3
next to a 1080p galaxy s4 the text size
is roughly identical which i think is a
little disappointing and the difference
is that I was probably one of the most
vocal people against 1080p screens on a
smartphone because I was like okay we're
where do I use it what difference is it
from 722 1080p now that i've been using
a 1080p phone for a week or so i can
tell you this much because of the bigger
ppi rating you can read text more easily
in a zoomed-out position do you have
more content on the screen no because
this the same aspect ratio is present as
on 720p but in zoomed out position you
can read texts without zooming in ok
thank you thank you very much much guys
for having me and have a good show from
now on thank you thank you thank you
very much like the camera on you so that
people can see your twitter account they
can find you right there ok awesome take
care bye bye goodbye mr. Martin okay
we've got two people I'm gonna I'm gonna
go with sim and I would have moved I
would imagine that I'm saying that
correctly just just said we were ok ok
I've slaughtered it easier names so are
you a nurse um well good no I am wow so
so many questions but I'm just going to
ask one thing we haven't heard a lot
about what we're going to see it google
i/o um i was asked yesterday what we
might see I thought maybe we co google
smartwatch before i read an article
about it and then anarchic a mouse and
has been a proper bo google smartwatch
what you guys are spent in the sea at
Google i/o this year and do you think
they'll bring out there a SmartWatch
data or US air first and Michael end on
me okay well I'd like to see a
SmartWatch of course because well the
pebble is on its way my pebble is on its
way michael has one and you know it's
it's really cool I can't wait to get
mine and I want to see what everybody
else has up their sleeve what I know
we'll probably see is probably a
successor to the nexus 7 because it's I
mean it came out last year at i/o and
you know that may be a redo of the Nexus
Q because they didn't totally kill that
they just kind of hold it and said hey
we're going to make it better so maybe a
second Nexus Q and um I don't know maybe
maybe maybe another nexus phone but I I
don't think so because the nexus 4 so
new still even if we have done it after
the puzzle yeah taylor i agree with you
i don't think it's time for a new Nexus
device I'm i suck at predictions I'm
always terrible even at events when Rue
Brendan's like we're about to shoot a
predictions video I'm like awesome I
will listen to what you have to say and
agree or disagree um so I you know I
think it would be cool to see a google
smartwatch at i/o but I don't see it
happening this early I I think they're
going to sit on that weight on that for
a little longer based on what i've read
but it would be it would be very very
time appropriate if we were to see a
nexus 7 successor Taylor I think that's
pretty good guess and therefore I will
agree with you on that and refrain
brother speculation and we're going to
say anything about glass hmm is exactly
between the two of you guys I agree with
both Taylor and Michael I don't think
there's a the appropriate time for a
google smartwatch but it is time for a
nexus tablet refresh so I think we'll
see that let's remember that nexus 7 was
announced one year ago at Google i/o and
the phone will probably come somewhere
at the end of summer and the beginning
of autumn so as far as I'm concerned and
then I will say a huge miracle but if
I'm wrong we can see a nexus 7 refresh
and maybe something else which will not
be the google phone the google watch the
only reason I even say that there might
be a possibility that there's a watch is
because I wrote an article when I was
still writing for phoneDog I think it
was the beginning of last year that said
that Google and Apple had put more than
anything in research and development or
than any other company for research and
development on wearable technology now
that could have been just google glass
but it could also be a SmartWatch
there's no talent I don't know the
people have been trying to make smart
watches for what we found out decades
now so yeah I and I I just want to say I
think that's pretty cool I think smart
watches are awesome i've been reading
about the concept of the personal area
work with various specialized devices
around your body for like over a decade
and it's it's really cool that Smart
Watch is is the new buzzword because
thanks in large part to to pebble so I
think that's pretty cool or alert 0 4
against Italy formerly known as alert uh
yeah I think there's still a company
there there actually a parent company of
pebble oh if i'm not mistaken i read
something one that the other day I
thought they rebranded to pebble but we
can find out off the air when we're not
yet gents let's get back to mr. Scindia
I'm just gonna say I'm I'm the
anti-treaty time is why you happy that's
why you had the bad guy here I think
it's interesting that no one has a
tradition for what the second possible
devices not me don't they usually give
approximately two devices maybe three
devices at there are 0 it's interesting
sold it Oh pixel you then they're gonna
give away a pizza I don't know I have no
idea but that I mean there's a lot of
devices I mean the pixels already out
there it's a little it's more than the
cost of the ticket in it you'll probably
get one free so there's the pic so I'm
just saying the number of devices if
they give them out they gave out next
excuse last year and then you've got the
second tablet so so that that would be
two devices who do you think is going to
make the tablet it's gonna be a sous
again I wouldn't doubt it because they
did so well the first time very well the
first time and then they created this
phone pad thing which I found to be
rather uninspired at NBC so I hope it's
not a rebadged phone pad yeah but it
wouldn't surprise me to see a suit again
because yeah as you said great job the
first time now let us let's prod the
cattle a little bit what if they're a
nexus padfone I probably know I believe
no I'm not saying there's gonna be but
if there would if there were so so a
beyond 1080p tablet shell with a home
and I've better going way off the
Bourbon femur I would and you would have
invented the entire bat phone concept
would you agree if I was google and i
will tell you
you hate Taylor why don't we do a google
nexus bat phone Devon I would love it I
would love it I'm only saying that
because Google would would maybe maybe
smacked asus around a little bit and be
like hey 1200 hours for this Pat phone
is ridiculous you could you know sell
some for you know six or seven hundred
dollars I I don't think that's gonna
hurt him off topic but and also I think
that a Swiss will not make the next
tablet if the Nexus phone is any
indication the first Nexus phone was HTC
after which Google shifted OEMs so
Google wants to give a fair share of the
market to every of its major partners
and it had its head yeah asus had its
share fair share of last year so I'm
thinking that the there are many tablet
players around that maybe Samsung would
be a good candidate for for the next
Google Nexus tablet I just started
samsung already did the nexus 10 right
is that what you're gonna say Taylor oh
you got it so what if what if all these
rumors out of HTC about them like
fiddling and flirting with the idea of
doing a successor to the flyer what was
actually a tablet from HTC that would
make me explode with joy I thought they
said they weren't doing the tablet
market for a while you're themselves
right they're all i got another
announced we're not touching that you
know no kissing a new phone HTC one
right yeah yeah they have a capability
to even make a tablet at this point if
she see ya me aren't they all in on the
phone well i went with with the
truckload of money google would shove in
yes yeah yeah yeahs by themselves that
you have a very good point i but yeah i
think with google's back up they could
take a definitely do it okay thank you
guys that's all i have yes I'm undergoes
too soon but yeah let it was lot my
screen on you while while the other
stock so they can see your Twitter
handle and yeah feat is so bad that I
can't even is it it's em right yes
alright sorry saying I can't see your
banner because I'm looking at you like
100 pixels wide sorry question thank you
thank you you guys have a great day yeah
you as well I to him and I think it's my
turn let's talk to somebody who is
closer geographically to me and also
historically related Fabio Vecchio what
if I I know his name will heal Elliot
make sure to unusual microphone and I'm
gonna hi Otto and Devon I'm gonna mute
you right now eat your microphone and
I'm gonna know Fabio hi hi Anton um I'd
like to talk about um HTC so what
somebody take that oh I'm Peter Chao
said he would retire if the one flops do
you think it will flop well now this
flopping thing is I think subjective
would it flop regarding the galaxy s4
yes would it flop regarding the
expectations of HTC I don't know what
their expectations are but according to
their press release the entire buzz and
anticipation and feedback from the
market is exceptional so I think it all
depends on their internal numbers and
projections and what they expect from
this phone to sell but again if you
compare the HTC One to the galaxy s4 the
galaxy s4 will sell probably four or
five times more than the HTC One because
of their huge brand recognition and
brand fans so it's it's a two-way street
they pull a 1x if HTC pulls another one
x then that people sell twice as many
ones like the 1x please oh yeah I go
there are more carriers I was just gonna
say just looking at the American scene
there are two more national carriers
compared to the 1x yeah that was their
big big hurdle last year's they they
were still bowing down to the carriers
here in the states and and providing
customized versions of their devices to
sprint verizon AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile so getting that problem fixed
might be exactly what they needed i said
that i don't know how many times last
year stop making carrier devices make
one device and sell it to everyone
that's what's worked for apple remember
for samsung member taylor that it has
been working for samsung only since the
note 2 and I think the galaxy s free and
at one point because the galaxy s tues
were looking differently across all US
carriers and there were buttons and no
buttons and logos and no logos so it
took Samsung like two years of being
probably the top android smartphone
maker to pull that I don't know yeah you
see has that power right now maybe after
the HTC One maybe yeah they do they're
expressing that now but that was
something they should have started
working on a long time ago but I don't
think it will if Peter Chou really
retires um what do you think will happen
to HTC I mean they built amazing phones
well I've got a good liar and how it how
would let go on with with the company I
mean um i get i get your courage to
question and I think a bitter chal will
not resign because the HTC One will not
flop but if it does hypothetically then
the company will move on if I or Michael
or or Taylor resign die or move on
pocketnow moves on the company moves on
Apple moved on after yeah you guys love
the analogy right so morbid yes that
we're good person Steve Jobs passed away
and Apple moved on so a company is an
entity which has the power to move on
I'm not thinking that the HTC One will
flop and i'm not thinking that peter
chao will resign but if if that happens
then we'll probably see somebody new at
at the chauffeur position and probably
some twists in in the direction of the
company
and what do you think about HTC windows
phone I mean we have seen the 8x and the
8's and now they're rumors about an HTC
tiara so do you think that rumors are
true I don't know my Quran service I
never want a phone named a tiara but
well I'm still like it is yeah it would
definitely be a code name um other than
that I don't know HTC has always played
this kind of we like Windows Phone but
we don't want to go all in so here's
what we'll throw at the wall this year
you know so it's not like a this is a
full-on you know flagship it's just kind
of like this is kind of what we did last
year with the Android version and the
new casing here you go and that's part
of the the specification limitations of
windows phone itself but i don't know i
don't know Michael anything you're more
windows phone yeah yeah Cindric that I
am well I would say that the what Dax
was a little more a little more
impressive than your painting it out to
be I mean that is where they introduced
their there from their wide angle
front-facing camera they introduced a
pretty cool casing design and that's
where they got their sweet branding
partnership with Microsoft kicked off
where the official windows found all
that stuff but um I think the execution
definitely did not pay off and obviously
they have said that publicly agencies I
thought very we were disappointed in our
windows one performs quite a second my
mom is calling me so I don't have I
don't have any questions anymore and no
problem Fabio thank you very much for
joining us and join us you again when he
can buy and with this I'm gonna hand it
over to Michael Fisher yes as quickly I
was gonna kind of finish what I was
saying they jumped into it and what I
was trying to get as they jumped in with
Microsoft and branded this phone as the
signature Windows 8 Phone and you know
ran with it for a while and then they
were just kind of like okay whatever you
know on back to Android they just kind
of deserted it you know that was kind of
my point you don't really see much about
the X anymore well I don't think they
deserted it i mean you
you have it well that I don't know hey
let's I hope somebody else asks us a
question about that you're not going to
talk about this all afternoon all day I
am going to pick someone it is time for
me to pick Hernan who has been hanging
out for a long time the green shirt and
the high quality picture amuture Mike
you do we have audio from right I always
forget to do that to you don't worry
about it Tommy top right nope no it's
not very good yeah no yeah its hold on
thing can I can I do it now we can't do
it there's no audio what's happening
okay let it to somebody else and we'll
get back to her alright and then
hopefully we get your we get your audio
work and work in shortly I want to talk
to Ceaser in that case waiting for my
frame to hop over he's got a cool
national flag over there which happens
to be the same as mine what I'm because
I have to what was that book bulgaria
what oh no oh now there we go ok your
microphone you couldn't stop right hang
out google has got to fix this you i
frickin element no I think it's good
there's a logic become behind this
because when people join in the
microphone is on them and they make
noises the camera automatically moves on
them for some reason nobody can
effectively unmute you know I'm you
young mute microphone is a toggle is on
right there on the top right no audio
042 I think I'm the I think I'm the kiss
of death I don't think I should pick
pick people in because i apparently i'm
just getting people who can't can't get
their mics work and that's unfortunate
I'm telling you there's something busted
in the Hangout hey hey oh yeah I got it
I was I have to configure a day he said
I had to add settings and change today
microphone so far that's his orphan yeah
um well I was actually going to ask if
you can help me too so what is going to
be my next phone yes I was well I was
annoying with
change to Android totally um and yeah I
stood the Hangout you did I know a
couple days ago about the samsung galaxy
s4 HTC One and an experience and the
experience a and I was actually well
experienced it at the only thing I heard
you you said about the experiences that
is good about the phone is the camera
and I was like well if the rest on a the
rest of the phone is not like data as
awesome as the HTC One and the galaxy s4
while you bring it up I was thinking
about well I am beat em between the HTC
one that I saw I saw the review I just
saw the review before i joined the
hangout and I was like well it's
actually that good and the the galaxy s4
that i will i'm using a galaxy s4 his to
our a man used to touch ways and that
kind of stuff and the Oppo find 5 that
well using mention and i think it was a
better fun and a more premium feel that
dish is 10 this is my papa love you i
feel like i like it to a station one
because of the screen and the people
have screen I like a high-definition
Francis for me is one of the main well
the way I choose my phones but also the
camera and as Anthony was Christa it was
a he wasn't a comfortable with the with
the camera because his forge a Pyxis
that is for pictures and for a pictures
of lung and I don't know anybody else
for her should maybe think about the
samsung device because that's what I
that's what I'm leaning right as i'm
here in cochran and I my mom huge did
you know I'm actually yeah i like i like
Samsung devices well you do know like I
you I I can see that you like you don't
like plastic just you know samsung use
plastics but well here in Mexico the
people actually don't know what its
Android and don't bother house there its
funds bill it's just what you have what
do you have an iPhone or Samsung device
that's it no
are you but I'm actually I know
wonderful while I i use ginger with from
when i when i get my samsung galaxy s2
but now i think that samsung is talk
with the same the same and a form of
visual of the phone because if there is
the way that they sell the phone and I
should they use plastic because it's
cheaper and these durable I think I like
I like plastics I like placing better
than aluminium or ago because it gets
the crash happen so if so what I'm
hearing is that you hear you like
plastics better you choose primarily
based on display and camera and during
those factors alone the only option for
you and as far as I'm concerned out of
HTC One Sony Xperia Z or samsung galaxy
s4 is the galaxy s4 I mean they're not
allow me to disagree only maybe on the
camera side the display on the HTC One
is amazing we don't know how display on
the s4 will be yeah we do I've seen it
Tony yeah you see the same super amoled
screen which is super vibrant and with
the blacks but the HTC one also has good
good black and contrast ratio and great
colors absolutely next to each other
they have they there they are excellent
but they're on they're on par I mean
what I'm saying is if it was a vacuum
and you're choosing on display alone yes
we could have this conversation Tony but
considering the confluence of factors
that Vernon is talking about I don't see
I don't see how anyone could recommend
the one yeah I kind of agree with you
Michael you you answered your own
question pretty much oh well I let me
let me get some some stuff i like i like
well I'm saw the galaxy s4 yeah I like
plastics and that's kinda stuff but I
like better than the HTC One down the
galaxy s4 I agree why because i know i
know the screen is better I know it's a
very good looking phone and I like this
looking even is aluminium and I always
say that yeah I like our AMOLED screens
but I've seen some friends that had the
droid DNA and the desire x and you know
i see the phones and they say oh that
actually i think there
actually better than a boot screen I
like HTC one screen let's search more
accurate it lets one experiment I'm a
lawyer at my core and let's try to do a
roleplay I'm going to ask questions and
you're gonna answer with yes or no okay
okay do you like metal yes Oh better
than I like more plastic so do you like
plastic yeah ok then as for do you like
removable batteries no I don't know HTC
One do you take a lot and I mean a lot
of pictures yes hello then the s4 do you
have to have a super amoled screen with
deep legs and vibrant colors or do you
have to have a screen which has good
color representation and i don't know i
just want to see a full htn I don't know
well I I like the HTC has more ppi
that's it ok then I think we have the
answer there are more in the HTC
category than in the s4 category I like
town is efficient efficiency that's nice
well I think I think hernan really wants
a phone that maybe depends on you and I
both want also it is an HTC one with the
galaxy s4 S camera maybe yeah the word
or the 808 PureView camera whoa oh yeah
that's that's more tons up but I don't
have that many right now available only
one we just go all up yeah that's
actually why I brought the Diablo find 5
because 0 is like premium build is that
he has had their 2 megapixel camera I
think and he has a actually gorgeous
display I've seen it I can well here
Mexico we don't have it here I know if
we will have it but i can buy it my
internet so it doesn't of the problem
that way I I bring it up but I haven't
heard like your opinion about the top of
five times higher well none of us have
have even had it I've thought about
actually trying it marques Brownlee one
of my friends yeah he did review on it
and I saw it and I'm just like man
really want to try to phone out what
what fun the Oppo find 50 yes yes yes
indeed yeah it's it's a it's a beauty
not alive it's it's a steal it's steel
it's not aluminum it's steel yeah I ask
you is there is there any circumstance
under which you could find yourself in a
I know it's difficult it may be in your
country in a in a retail store or
another setting where you can see both
of these contenders together Thank You
Mexico of you you can buy analog form in
any store you have to go to the carrier
and bite you can buy it without contract
buddies lock for I don't know he's got
me your hands on them both at the same
time you know it would be so useful to
you it sounds like to have them both
right here and be later actually like
better however return policies in Mexico
what I said Howard return policies in
Mexico well usually you you bought all
everything from the carrier and well I
am I could I could have both but they
are not yet in Mexico so I can you pick
it up and try and because I have when I
choose my first full night I pick it
from between I don't ever remember this
phone and I don't know some other and I
I take it I saw there i turn the screens
and play around with them but is with
the carrier a nice i love it here's my
opinion yeah you have the s to you for
the most part probably or fairly content
with it and notwithstanding all these
new phones hmm um you probably don't
have too many complaints with touchwiz
correct they have I just changed to
cyanogenmod 10.1 okay well you're not
going to get that on the s4 official
yeah I say honestly I would say go with
the ps4 I personally would choose the
one but from what I'm hearing you want a
better camera that displays are gonna be
so similar you're not going to notice a
difference they're both of their both
above 440 pixels per inch so you're
really not ever going to notice the
difference between those two both 1080p
the difference is you're going to see
aren't
saturation and blacks and if you're not
too worried about the color reproduction
you don't have to worry about the pin
tiles sub sub pixel arrangement you
don't have to worry about that because
it's such a high PPI so I say as far as
it goes it it sounds like you want the
ester doing but Tony disagrees Michael
agrees that it's a tough it's another
decision that's the last question and
how does house I can I don't know how to
say how is the grip like depending when
you hold the hand it is asleep early the
HTC One or this is a good at the head
you're just my learning your trance
Michael and Tony can I ask a well I ask
it because my stew you know it's very
light phone but and I liked it was like
the back of the Holy cover because you
know he's got a cat it sticks to my hair
but let is so thin that it just fly off
flightaware sliced away from her here
the first the first thought when I took
out the HTC One from its box and held it
in my hand was damn this is too thin it
is too uncomfortable it doesn't fit well
in the hand but after one day of using
it I just realize that I have to get
used to the tapered edge which makes it
the HTC lies to you so if you hold the
HTC One you see it's super super thin
because if you look at the the edge it
is very thin it is four millimeters but
at the middle it is more thick so it
actually feels in the the place here in
there I like that I like that it feels
very very good in hand but Michael can
agree or disagree to this it feels
amazing absolutely amazing in the hand
specifically talking about slipperiness
though it's going to be if they're
fairly well balanced holding the s4 up
next to the HTC One the s4 felt exactly
like the galaxy s3 fields which is to
say very very slippery in that in that
way that glossy finished objects are you
know there's there's a problem which but
for the HTC one was slippery in in a way
that that metallic smooth objects are so
it's different kinds of slippery right I
was about to say just one thing the
ladies know better and
gentlemen like Broly Michael knows
better I'm using hand lotion because my
skin is very dry if you happen to apply
a hand lotion and handle the galaxy s
free no two or even the s4 because of
the hyper glaze it will be as slippery
as ice but the HTC One and the iphone 5
for that matter if under the same
circumstances offers you more grip okay
so yeah the HTC one does it feel more
like a macbook that I just want to get
that is exactly like the macbook yes
that's a really solid analogy yeah
that's exactly what it feels like I'm
sitting here thinking no that's that's
got to be what it feels like yeah that's
what it looks like does it yeah we
probably have to move on is that right
time yeah hang on do you have any final
thoughts closing thoughts um in the wars
gate I will flick I'll flip a coin and
choose work at I don't know what we can
do to keep we will keep filming as many
comparisons and first impressions and
hands-on yeah I would like to see when
what were you get is for a comparison
between the HTC One will be great that's
gonna be reverse comparison and you had
yeah yeah that'll ever thank you very
much for the note don't tell us where we
can find you okay we have your Twitter
handle here right now the camera on you
so that's your Twitter handle thank you
very much for joining and please do come
back whenever you have time okay thank
you very much take care my bag look
thinner um just because I haven't spoken
with him in forever and he's always
commenting on everything I ever do
dominicano he always comes back he's
always here as you know that I'm you to
microphone yeah I know you know Don you
that I've got spinning beachball a death
over here so I can't see him but is this
mobile Dom yes yes I like him I can't
hear him nothing maybe you have to do
some hocus-pocus with your settings
things everyone has today okay until
until he fixes this I Michael Fisher I
had an interesting comment conversation
on my Google+ page with somebody and his
twitter handle is scene of it's too
complicated si an AC e tink8580 don't
remember the context of this
conversation but at one point it got
down to your comment about Scarlett
Johansson and he was asking me to ask
you online whether he would be able or
willing to smooch a picture of scarlett
johansson and at that point I said
Michael will probably never do that but
I'm asking you right now because he's
asking me and put it I appreciate you
for fulfilling your obligation to the
reader Tony I think that's it's good to
follow up on things like that yeah and
and one thing i like about you Tony is
that you and I can can can disagree and
often do but you you have your thumb
firmly on the pulse of me and when you
said that I would likely never do that
on the internet or elsewhere you were
absolutely correct i will never do that
but i'll consider a couple of scenarios
where you probably would consider doing
that I would yes I would give large
shipments of american dollars so so what
was the the request i think all i heard
was Scarlett Johansson I smooch her
picture ya like like I would be over by
chance no I had an out eight once that
was uh I just completely blanked and
love of reading something and I was like
and make sure and follow on twitter
scarlett johansson like I couldn't it
was just the first name that came to
mind I'm not even a giant fan of hers it
was just like a denied well my name is
anton d nog next time you have a blank
just just fill that in thank you thank
you make sure and follow aunt aunty
Nadja's or just thing or just say
google+ because there's nothing better
than a little google poss we're gonna
pass on the pad be do you have your key
or microphone ready I think yes very low
volume but yes then I shall get even
closer to the microphone house up a
little better if you can even closer any
clothes from I'm kissing this microphone
alright just about audible just about a
bit too there you go it's here it's a
little better much better I'm gonna play
a stop shot into the thing soon enough I
don't care and by the way do you have a
game or volume control on your
microphone on its back or maybe in the
settings unfortunately no it's all
software based and the software seems to
as well it's it's gone bye-bye and it
doesn't want to come back ok thats then
speak louder all right i'm gonna i'm
gonna go loud like a like killing myself
that stuff I'd say Michael did you get
the update on your pebble watch you know
I haven't yet I've been too busy
throwing my kyocera torque in the toilet
in places like that look I will
definitely I will absolutely i have not
put on the trial put on the bathroom i I
will absolutely try that have you why do
you do that running or what oh dude on
the student I'm nowhere near Richmond a
pebble I always assume the wrong way I'm
like oh I did you have a pebble and
people of course I have a pebble no I I
am not running the update yet and i
can't wait wasn't gonna run about see
you thanks for much and it's wireless
charging it's why the hell is it's not
standard yet i don't know i had the same
same exact question a long time ago
right after powermat first came out i
actually wrote several editorials about
how these things should be built into
tables and nightstands and couches and
everything wireless charging should be
everywhere you should be able to just
sit your phone on the most random thing
ever in charge it just doesn't make any
sense why we don't because i was already
there i was working from starbucks and
by the way that was probably one of the
editorials you wrote taylor at when you
were at phoneDog that you and I were
writing like concurrently where it's
like I'm dying on editorial on Taylor
hit me on twitter is like yeah I wrote
about that two days ago chief I'm like
what what's i was i work from starbucks
somewhat frequently here in boston and
it is a test market for exactly what
you're talking about taylor wireless
charging pads built
right into the table you drop your phone
right on there and it's it's amazing
it's amazing if you have a Duracell our
pact not if you use a chi powered device
though that is pretty cool it I
completely agree envy radiating for me
right now is so hot I tried to take one
of the tables from the Nokia Lumia 900
event home with me but they didn't like
it if I when my short very very short to
European sense I would care I would say
I care about as much about wireless
charging like Michael and Taylor care
about an earpiece on a tablet if it's
there and no no hear me out if it's
there it's good it's there because
people like Michael and Taylor and Joe
who love the the thing can use it I love
an earpiece in a tablet if it's there I
can use it but I would never use it
because I'm not a fan but yeah sure
let's make a standard let's make it
available on every phone and everybody
like me who doesn't like it can have the
option of charging via cables yeah
charging through a cable isn't charging
through a cable isn't terribly difficult
it's not that big of a deal but being
able to just sit your phone down and it
charge is is so nice because my nexus 4
it just when I have the wireless charger
on my desk I'm sitting here thinking
well I need to plug that thing up and
then I just kind of drop it on the
charger and there you go that the thing
is when it's built into things so say
like a lamp I think that was one that
the powermat had at their stand last
year at CES they had all these neat
little electronics that had wireless
charging built in so say you your kid
has a toy bin like a bagel toy bin the
bottom of it is inductive you throw a
battery-powered toy in there and it
charges overnight just being in this bin
and the same same concept was applied to
phones so there's a lamp on your
nightstand just sit your phone on the
lamp and it charges like on the base of
the lamp so there are a lot of really
cool things that that can be done with
it and that you don't have to carry a
charger everywhere you can go like to
starbucks and just sit your phone on the
table and oh they have
charge your built-in you know so it's
it's it's a kind of a cool factor
something that not everybody needs but
it's it's really nice and what I was
talking about yesterday on the podcast
there are a million things I'd rather
see over wireless charging such as the
the rapid charging where you where you
plug your phone in and it charges in 10
seconds so I dinner there do you have a
device that the charges wirelessly right
now Tom me oh hell yeah I've got a nexus
4 i've got a palm free a pre plus a free
to I've got a pixie oh you became my
favorite person today and so that's a
great collection right there have
anymore but I had a galaxy s i9000 with
a touchstone charger put in it and oh
yeah i did that mod was quick and easy
after six hours yeah i like that i like
it cuz i'm a lazy sob I it's like damn
it son charge it is like it's like
trickle charging it do you miss the
magnets as well on your nexus 4 do you
miss the magnetically guided placement
yes yeah oh yeah yes I think it's like
the the M material used to attach on the
Nexus 4 is like the material on the
bottom of the touchstone so she got a
bit dirty it's like yeah I'm not stickin
anymore right yeah when I do love the
unboxing I yep I'm sorry telegram when I
did the unboxing of this thing there
were a lot of people who comment in
there like it's not it's not sticky it's
magnetic that's why I'd stay in there
its magnetic Emily no I would have
noticed if it were magnetic it's not
magnetic it just sticks I was like it's
friction and they're like no it's
magnets ok that's the progression right
like which actually were mad kinetic and
we're really futuristic and put the
device exactly where it needed to be to
charge and it was it never failed I
never had a problem and then like what
like now we have the friggin rubber go
girl well on the touch don't know that's
you two points where the magnets could
that touch say if I was like just plunk
it down at night I usually got it if I
was putting out like during the day I'd
put it and if you put that slight bit
too high the top magnets will catch on
the bottom of the phone
and oh look L said LLL say a right angle
but it will not try yeah if you're like
if you're really inebriated or really
tired or it's really good yeah yeah like
when I appreciated that okay um what's
it called the the charging plate it
doesn t t100 well don't even have any
magnets at all so I I hate charging
areas that like it needs to be able to
guide me to it by feel if I can't if I
have to look at it to do it it's much
less convenient yeah the good thing
about the nexus 4 charger is that it's
kind of broad that the area that you
need to sit on there the charger to
charge it is you've got a big range so
you just sit down there and you know so
you don't have to worry about it but I
agree Megan sir are nice I mean I
remember when I originally got my touch
down I could literally like put it up
against the wall and it just stick so it
was like this is so cool and I was like
a week of users that is on my table and
when I took my phone off it lifts up and
then so smack back down and it's like
well it was great while it lasted Oh
memory though many good you have any
final thoughts um apart from why doesn't
the one have it and why doesn't he
xperia z have it built in uh not really
i mean the Xperia Z has it in like a wig
case but it it's yeah vogue is amazing
the phone is made of glass and glass
glass glass and has port or covers on
every port so yeah they should have
built it in they've got a doc which is
not the same somebody was like oh you
can charge wirelessly because you can
sit it in the stock no no it is no no no
it is not the same it's not the same
because there's no standard this only
works with this one product and you're
using contact points that's not wireless
yeah no but anyway there is a wireless
'he case that you can get for the Xperia
Z so you have to carry photos in a case
i had sorry ya know it's just a case you
pop on the phone and you can use any
cheat charger but the case i mean what
was like 60 bucks what's the point yeah
it's like I mean anything I hate cases
too yeah so yeah
that's that's why this is in the case I
mean it I had it before I put something
on the back because it's glass I don't
trust myself with glass this is crazy
and I mean I just I the scream tactic a
of my pocket yesterday and I forgot how
unnaturally smooth the front of the next
4 is 0 it is extremely it's like it's
like ice yeah it's like this is just
weird but it's like it sounds like
roofie I thought I kind of want to keep
touching every now and then because it's
really weird but there's like the the
Xperia said is the ultimate candidate
for everything wireless wireless
charging wireless headphones like NFC
anything wireless the experience there
would be the perfect phone to trial on
it's like oh you don't even need to open
the port for your headphones you tap it
they connect you put them on you don't
need to open a port to charge your phone
you tap it and it charges like it drugs
on you yeah man I'm only going I'm gonna
go quite this up in the corner after
this so we have to move on yeah now that
asked me done guys so um thank you very
much for the camera on you for your
Twitter account yeah yes thank you once
again dominicano and you didn't have an
app for me this time so i didn't i'm
still using glove box actually i was
treated actually I'm pretty I've got a
game blame their time just playing
pokemon right now I'm just jamming to
pokemon for anyone who hasn't for anyone
who hasn't said it i purchased all the
games legally i must say for anyone who
hasn't seen this is this is what I'm
using to type on my phone for the next
week which is confusing than your do you
have money any sadistic urges or you
wanna buzz oh I'm a glutton for
punishment I'm about to email you about
this anyway Tony so more on that later I
gotta wait on that eniko thank you very
much for joining us and by now see you
guys okay you're gonna see him who's
who's dead it's yours it is my turn yeah
and she's our scissor Caesar I don't
know how to pronounce it but he just got
audio and he just got muted so no
problem that's good what I
received a lot of comments to date on
Twitter why the hell can he yes but we
have muta G once again on why don't we
choose new people so today we have
chosen lots of new people and we don't
want to neglect the recurring people so
let's talk about the two people in one
frame right here they know who they are
pray let your microphones they're here
more often than I am exactly Mason
regulars yeah hi guys how are you very
good are you we are excellent thee do
you have any topic question anything you
want to talk about tonight good night
for me today for you yeah actually I've
been meaning to ask you guys this for a
couple weeks now um ok I kind of thought
of this idea while ago and I've been
wondering how you guys would feel about
it um what if what if somebody released
this a completely wireless phone so you
don't have any ports or anything there's
no there's no USB there's no headphone
jack you know it would have wireless
charging so you don't have to plug it in
and then you know it you know maybe
Google could promote google drive so you
could bring all your files over through
the cloud maybe include some bluetooth
headphones or something in the box and
it'd be probably expensive but I mean I
just think you're basically talking
about like what devices should already
be if you ask me you're absolutely
correct I I think that would be the
coolest thing ever a port lyst device it
would allow the device to be inherently
waterproof and dustproof I it and it
would just be so much cooler than than
having to hunt for a wire to put metal
contacts next to other metal contacts in
a little box what is this 1958
completely yeah that's the coolest idea
of her today you're awesome thank you
yeah the deer there are only a couple
problems with that and that's that the
rest of the world isn't caught up yes so
so you go on a vacation you forget about
you know your wireless charger then
you've got to go out and buy one that's
old sixty seventy dollars you know very
long vacation or something so you've got
all these problems how do you
listen to music on an airplane you know
like I said I could come with like
bluetooth headphones or something like
that oh yeah yeah I mean you've got
bluetooth headphones but right now in
America they kind of if you fly on an
airplane with with any wireless
technology whatsoever they're like
you're gonna bring us down out of the
sky and we're all gonna die like you
know actually unlike barcelona i
actually friend them if I either I can
listen to my own music or I will sing
all flight long and they want me to well
it's nice so I wrote in a long editorial
about that particular thing and you can
use them at altitude it's just below
10,000 feet and when the cabin door is
closed that they don't want you to do
that kind of stuff and that still sucks
but it sucks a little less so you could
use conceivably use these wireless
headphones that were were hypothetically
talking about on a flight so it would
sort but I mean right your thing about
leaving charger at home is totally on
par yeah that would suck yeah so I mean
they're they're just so small little
things like that but other than that no
I totally agree we should be totally
wireless and you probably have guessed
my opinion I couldn't care less about
this right if I was to vote I probably
vote against because i also have reason
so i'm not blindly and stupidly saying
no to anything so first of all wireless
charging is much much slower than than
charging by a cable having an option to
do that i can accept that going wireless
only I cannot accept that number two
having audio via bluetooth versus having
audio via a cable now first of all we
have some quality differences you will
never or at least at the moment you
don't have that fidelity via bluetooth
like you have via cable and streaming by
bluetooth is killing your battery fast
so if we can have both options but that
again will probably be against your
thoughts of going Wireless only so uh
I'll have to disagree I don't like that
I don't want that I wanted more points
that uh well just two more points that I
wanted to make 11 is the the charger
this thing is the wireless charger at
the Nexus charger for the nexus for it
its output is 1 amp so they
up the input so the the input that you
come from the wall to this thing is 1.8
going through this thing is one amp so
you charge about the same speed you
charge and and I guess just plugging up
that you lose some heat power but that's
that's about it and then the other I
can't remember while you remember the
other point about bluetooth streaming I
used to stream music via bluetooth on
the HPV r which is pretty much the
smallest phone ever made it was a little
bigger than a charcoal briquette and I
used to just stream music via bluetooth
and it it did diminish my battery life
it was about that sighs yeah and
diminish my battery life yes but not to
the degree that I needed to stop doing
it and that was a really tiny phone with
anything like an 800 ml amp hour battery
so you want me to take it out oh you
haven't me I forgot you have a beer turn
another the other point that I was gonna
make and he look he walks away who
walked away Tony he's gone oh my god
it's ringing who is it hello hello a
blog this camera right here hello yes
it's me it's the tiniest oh never yeah
it makes me think of zoolander I'm like
wow it makes me think of zoolander but
the other point I was gonna make is if
you don't have all those port so you
don't have something for um headphones
you don't have all these little internal
components that take up space you do
have more room for battery boom and just
to be fair and it's a shout out thank
you very much too at that technology for
this one oh yeah yeah Adam somebody
needs a hat yeah I think I met directly
we have had one we he's got one he's
wearing it we're grow Burnett apparently
someone needs a new monitor teammates oh
yes great as you know guys yeah great
idea yes anything else and you know I
think that's it then okay I had I have
something for for Devon have you sorted
out the
808 PureView / nikon the question you
had or problem you had with your blanket
I do I've solved it I I just have a
problem with somebody trying to compare
two very different things it's like
comparing an apple to an elephant you
know comparing a phone with a camera to
a phone with the camera is one thing
comparing this so a phone to this and
saying this is unnecessary in the world
now because of the phone is wrong well
it's it's you're not comparing that
phone with the camera they're comparing
now they're comparing that but it's the
same concept you know they're saying you
can there's no longer a need for a DSLR
in the world because you can buy the
PureView there I and I told you at one
point that I think that the truth flies
in in the middle there is no use for me
to take out my DSLR when i'm downtown
when i am in Berlin with Michael when I
man in Barcelona with with high may to
capture some great moments because this
is enough for me and it's better than
all my other phones but if I'm a
professional photographer like you are
then this is just something I will
probably put on the table and and that's
all exactly and I I can agree with that
if you're not a professional then each
their own but for somebody that to my
knowledge they don't even have the
PureView for them to be saying that that
can rank over top of the DSLR and I'm
guessing they probably don't even have
one of those if there hello it was alone
comparison by the way who are we ripping
on right now that was nearly this also
with it all stem from this argument I
was having with some guy on on Twitter
he was a he was basically arguing that
the UH the PureView is just dollar for
dollar a flat better camera than getting
a DSLR of the same price
whoa whoa yeah specimen is a bit like
saying you know you don't need an
airplane as long as you've got a bicycle
yeah thank you and that is also true
what a point but I think everybody has
to know exactly their usage scenario and
what kind of pictures they expect to
produce now the 808 PureView I've been
using it since day one produces DSLR
like images if you know how to use it
but that's not because of the
41-megapixel camera it's because of the
overslept the oversampling / down
sampling which nakia uses will it ever
produce better pictures than a DSLR no
will it ever produce more conveniently
great quality pictures yes yes yeah it's
the future a proof of concept that shows
where we're going that better cameras
are going to get smaller this is also
one of those a micro four-thirds they I
love love love love I can't say it
enough love micro four-thirds cameras so
I'm just gonna leave you with that as
micro four-thirds get smaller and you
know cameras on phones get bigger we're
all going to kind of converge to this
middle ground which I love okay guys
think I'm a grump about the subject when
somebody starts completely ripping on a
DSR saying that their phone can be that
much better without ever having the
phone and knowing what it's about yes I
saying read cameras are useless because
we've got video cameras and our phones
now it just yes it's absurd some some
people on the internet are jerks by the
way yeah that's a good point good in
rural hostel we're all hostile we have
to move to probably our final call this
evening do you have any final thoughts
any questions anything you want to share
with us I've got nothing other than
Taylor have fun at the circus surviving
minus the bear shown and I'm jealous oh
yes I will definitely enjoy that
definitely okay then I'm locking my
camera on you you got both your Twitter
handles right there and you can follow
them at the handles on the screen that
was a dumb sentence yes it was they are
inverted though so I think you will have
a good time if you try and follow a high
Otto at Debbie doodle I believe I
totally look like a debbie buell so yeah
I've already been followed by like four
people just sitting here using these are
the advantages of joining pocket now
live on a weekly visitor so thank you
very much for joining us and please come
back whenever you guys have time thanks
guys here anyway and with that I think
we had our final call because we're
reaching the one hour 30 mark and i also
have to attend a party still I'll leave
that pleasure to Michael Fisher wow I
wasn't expecting to do any more work on
this here call huh it hits you right
there I mad dhoni uh you said a while
ago that we were going to use the end of
the time you just fuzzy but you need
yoga oh cool sounds good I'm getting you
to Joseph ok awesome I got all the time
in the world because i keep getting
unresponsive script i'll boxes in the
beach ball of death so I'm doing real
well over here and gentle music himself
and I'd meet with him again thank you
Tony happen and for whatever reason he
keeps them you think himself and I'm
gonna keep on meeting here until I kick
him out oh no I think we got a breakdown
then please please please stay muted uh
Jesus I can't stop this up right I'm
right where the lightsaber guy I want to
I want to talk to it I want to finish up
on the lightsaber guy backlit I'm having
a real real computer issues today dudes
so he's immediately next to me with the
cross-shaped flag Marco mom hey man
hello Mac thank very well very well I
like that you have the the sunlight halo
again it's good to be able to identify
you easily in the right now oh yeah this
is gonna be permanently there for the
rest of the time i'll be joining the
Hangout so get used to it good god what
uh what have you got for you have fun
final caller and where I think we're
almost ready to wrap it up so what's
what's on your mind this week uh well I
got something for tape your first look
good whoa lost you hold on yes 8-pin
nice that's the old 8-pin nice yeah um
well yeah it is I've been dying with
this thing is like I think gesture all
the time my fingers are like I can write
it where'd you get the old a pen um I
actually downloaded through the internet
okay yeah I had done a long time ago the
new one is much better it is it but I I
liked like the white colors on it so I
don't get got the old one I got you I
got well congrats and you also are a
glutton for punishment haha of course um
something I want to say guys I mean
about the HTC One I'm getting the phone
and know that but people complain about
not expandable storage I mean the iphone
5 then any of the iphones never had an
expandable storage not even in the old
days when he was like really low storage
and people can never complain about it
so why they complain with the HTC One
you're getting 32 gates or 64 which is
more than enough for a very average user
I I think when you have a situation with
that Apple presents which is like you
have an iPhone and you have it on our
Terms and here it is you get a whole lot
of people who are who try to escape that
by going to another ecosystem an Android
for a long time is always positioned
itself by and large as like the more
open alternative with different choices
and stuff so I think that's why people
get more bent out of shape when a
manufacturer comes along and imposes a
different mentality on Android we're
like no you don't get to take out the
battery you don't get to take out the
memory cards you get to do it our way
and it's like I can see the argument
where it's like but I came from Apple to
get away from that kind of thing so I
get why they get a little more sensitive
about it I do I don't tend to find it a
big deal in my personal use but I'm just
saying to see their position I will
probably say that approximately one to
three percent
those who are complaining about it are
complaining truthfully the others are
just I'm going to quote my my british
friend Sanjay pool and haters gonna hate
and and that's it I think that 32 gigs
is enough for many 5% of users 64 gigs
is enough for one hundred percent unless
you're ill will so that's my two cents
yeah there I would I would go as far to
say that 16 / 16 gigabytes is good for
probably at least 80 yeah for me for
nine eight is enough 16 is not enough
for me but I'm a little bit different I
wrote an article on this yesterday and I
think I think Michael was on the right
path there and saying that one of
androids main features back in the day
when everybody was complaining about the
iphone not having a microSD card slot
because every other phone before that
had you know your blackberries and all
these others had micro SD card slots the
iphone came along and it didn't my old
feature phone had a micro SD card slot
so when android came out and it was the
big competitor to the iphone they're
like hey we've got micro SD card slots
they built the functionality into the
operating system made it integrated with
everything and now we're three years
down the road and they're like add just
kidding you know google has told that
there's no integration with micro SD
card slots with android anymore there's
the support there's no integration you
can't by default move your applications
and games over to the SD card so it's
kind of limited in what you can do with
it so I would rather have more onboard
storage than a micro SD card slot but I
just say everything open time I my note
and I'll show you that i have no micro
as the inside it because i don't need it
i say this a sale this and i have like
30 micro SD card slots I've got a 64 gig
one in mine of my note 2 but it doesn't
do me any good I had her nothing on it
there is one more thing to be said in
defense of integrated memory as opposed
to memory card slots I've been tossing
around this kyocera torque when I have
been throwing it in the sink full of
water of the bathtub I've been like
dropping it off the porch and what I
find even on this phone that is rated to
mil-spec 810g
an ip67 all this kind of stuff it is
built for this punishment you drop a
phone hard enough that memory card is
going to unseat for a second when it
does you get the stupid dialog box works
like preparing memory card maybe loosen
up like that it is annoying anytime you
have a movable object inside another
movable object it's like there's a
potential there for failure so that is
perhaps something another feather in the
cap of this non removable memory idea
yeah I upon my 64 gig card in my note 2
after taking it out I objected it I took
it out I put it right back in and it
told me I needed reform at ya so there's
that just doesn't sometimes happened
with uh with a dress right now I mean
people are bashing on htc because of the
way they're doing their phones and I
have this DC before guilty it didn't
have a removable battery I didn't care
it didn't have to it actually when I
drop my phone now I have the note 2 I
drop this form the back the back plate
falls off the battery goes out and I
have no power on my phone now I have to
turn it on again that didn't happen with
my EVO 4G LTE now he happens with an all
too well I try not to drop my phone to I
try not to use that as an excuse but
yeah I totally know what you mean but I
don't know I did drop my note once um
not listen but I John running it just
yeah everything kind of goes on opposite
directions and it's not like if I want
to drop the phone but you know it
happens sound like that happens and I
mean I will get the HTC One that's the
phone I'll get the camera is not a big
deal for me because I'm not the most
thing I do is Instagram and Facebook or
it was just this I'm going to interrupt
you there the camera on the HTC One is
not horrible the camera on the HTC One
is mediocre towards good so it's on the
low side of good so don't don't imagine
that it's horrible it's just that it's
not that good like the one on the iPhone
5 or the galaxy note 2 or the 808
PureView but that's my my personal
opinion so just just to keep it out
there well i think i saw the comparisons
that you did with the videos and all
that stuff
and I I like the camera I mean I was ok
with a camera on the EVO 4G LTE which is
the same as the one next I mean if I'm
okay without be better with this one too
so I'm dream hey what are you okay with
the camera you're good you're going yeah
that was my least favorite thing about
this phone yeah camera well you'll be
happy to know that the camera on the HTC
one is better than the camera on the HTC
One X yeah so the I saw the word DNA
comparisons that microfiche is dead and
you just are it was a big big difference
in in quality and lonely I already
provided higher quality than the 1x did
just due to software optimization in in
most cases the objects were the same of
the software software so yes it's did
the one is definitely a large step above
the 1x and photocall so yeah do you have
any final thoughts will have to we'll
have to end this broadcast soon oh well
not just I mean how I choose the galaxy
I mean the HTC one over the galaxy s4
for the reasons that I really don't care
about the expandable storage anymore I
don't care about removable body and I
like the camera HTC One and I think a
lot of people will be choosing basis you
want because of that I mean it's not a
big deal not having a removable battery
anymore I mean you can just buy the
chargers that Taylor has you know the
extra charges and I say the the eternal
debate will continue unfortunately most
it will that is true Marcos thank you
very much for joining us I'm locking my
camera on you that's where you can
follow him on twitter and come back next
week if you have time all right thank
you hmm all right happy easter and four
years for you to all right with this i
think we are wrapping this up it has
been episode number eight the guys in
the u.s. still have some work to do well
I have some partying to do I've been
I've been 'insahn denied managing editor
