scheme of the iphone 7 might be
different galaxy note 7 screenshots
reveal that this iris scanner is all
about restrictions we get more spec
information of the HTC nexus smartphones
I'm hi Mary that I and the commenters on
YouTube want my full name to be given
out raise your hand if you want it this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with the recent leaks of the
one plus three in soft gold that now
became official those of you that want
to get yourself a very unique variant of
the one plus three it's actually
available in limited quantity starting
tomorrow so I highly suggest you follow
more information link in the description
it's going to cost you 3 99 and speaking
of official news let's talk about the
China market for the longest time ever
Huawei has owned the market but this
time believe it or not opal is the king
of the smartphone market for June the
company has been growing like crazy over
the last couple of quarters now the
company currently holds twenty two point
nine percent of the market being trailed
by Huawei at seventeen percent and then
VEVO at 14 and for those of you that are
asking about the rest of the companies
you can learn more on the charts in the
description as well and we've been
following up on the feature of the nexus
smartphones for the longest time we've
got to HTC smartphones coming one of
these is going to be selfish and and a
recent random that was discovered well
we were expecting high rent
specifications here and apparently we're
not getting these it's going to be the
typical Snapdragon 820 processor
following the same scheme that we saw
with the Nexus 6p with the Snapdragon
810 last year so yeah for those of you
that were expecting HCC and Google to
innovate what the processor here carolee
that's not going to be the case at least
for the sailfish and speaking of
specifications that aren't really
innovating we've also got the samsung
galaxy note 7 we've got some interesting
leaks from sources to claim two things
number one is the fact that we're
getting the same exact 12 megapixel
camera that we have on the galaxy s7 for
the galaxy note 7 those of you that were
expecting innovation is the same F 1.7
aperture lens apparently according to
the rumor
now other interesting rumors come from
screenshots that show us the
capabilities of that iris scanner we saw
that you're going to have to hold your
phone rather close but to you're gonna
have a lot of restrictions and the list
is rather a starting with the fact that
if you're wearing glasses not going to
work yada yada yada it seems that this
is going to be a new feature that's
going to be cool if you're wearing
gloves but not necessarily something
that's going to blow your mind and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the iphone 7 and we're actually
not going to continue calling it iPhone
7 apparently as some other trusted
sources are claiming one very important
thing given the fact that the design is
not really changing for this iphone that
Apple is pretty much holding things back
another year for a three-year refresh
cycle here apparently even the name is
going to continue we're going to be
calling this the iphone 6s ii pretty
much special edition just like the
iphone SE and it makes a lot of sense if
there's not going to be much of a design
change and this is just the Ethier
iphone with better specifications that
it wouldn't make sense for the name to
continue iPhone 6 I probably don't like
the special edition because there has to
be something really special about this
fell for me to want to call it that way
but it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think should it be
called life 07 or iPhone 6s II which
would be your pick in my case I would
rather it be called iphone 6 something
because that's pretty much what it will
be but leave us a comment down below
