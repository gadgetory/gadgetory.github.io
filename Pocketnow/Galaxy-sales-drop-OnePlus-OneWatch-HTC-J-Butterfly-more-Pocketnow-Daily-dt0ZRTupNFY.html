company struggles in profits this
quarter 1 plus seems to be considering a
SmartWatch and it's near future and say
hello to the HTC j butterfly which is
the 1i mate that you always wanted I'm
hi Mary betta and I hate to break it to
you but if you woke up this morning
thinking it was friday it's barely
Thursday I hope it didn't only happen to
me this is out daily today is
packed with official news some good some
bad let's begin with some of the bad LG
has just announced its G Vista which is
a phone that we've been looking forward
to for the last couple of weeks and now
we're disappointed because this is
pretty much a g3 when it comes to design
but that's the only thing there's
actually a mid seared phone qhd display
not quad HD qhd display I can't remember
the last time I heard that aside from
other bigger specifications again if
you're looking out for a g3 but not want
to spend so much money this will cut
your undred dollars on verizon but when
you get the One m8 for the same price
tag that's a difficult one another sad
news today Apple has just announced that
it will be cutting jobs from its beats
acquisition the company's downsizing as
much as forty percent of the beats army
and that's about 200 employees that
they're cutting down redundancies like
HR supports other departments it's just
really hard to see people losing their
jobs in this economy but it was
something that was expected and at time
so we still haven't seen any
collaboration for both companies you'd
wonder what are we getting here now a
company that's definitely not worried
disappointing anybody is one plus as a
lot of people still want to get the one
and haven't been able to me included but
as it turns out it seems the company is
not going to end it there apparently
they're already working on a SmartWatch
you've got some leaked images of what to
expect it's around SmartWatch it's
probably going to have this interesting
round battery in the wrist strap and the
wrist strap actually looks smaller than
normal which is not necessarily a good
thing especially for the male ego thing
but yeah it's going to have a round
display apparently made by sapphire and
yeah Android wear is most probably
getting here but we still don't know a
cyanogenmod SmartWatch would be
really cool another positive news today
HCC has just announced its new j
butterfly for the japanese carrier kddi
there are a couple of reasons why this
is hot number one remember the first j
butterfly which eventually became the
droid DNA we have an HTC event happening
in a couple of days so you never know
but even hotter is the fact that this j
butterfly is the one m8 that everybody
wanted yes it has a 13-megapixel dual
camera it's got pretty much all the same
specifications of the HTC when i made
still struggling to figure out if this
is metal design but it's pretty much
plastic we assume but yeah it's pretty
much the phone that everybody wanted in
the one m8 hopefully obviously we have
to test that camera but stay tuned the
HTC event on August nineteenth could
reveal a lot of things and finally for
the very interesting and sort of
disappointing news of the day same-sex
quarter results are out and the company
is struggling they had actually
forecasted this they are down 6.1
billion in profits compared to almost 7
billion last year and the company was
warning to everybody that there is low
smartphone demand and it's odd when the
iphone is actually very high on demand
it's exceeding expectations and then
we've got Huawei and Lenovo making great
numbers in China and then Samsung is
down which is extremely interesting this
could only mean that the smartphone
market isn't really shrinking they're
just losing the man and lust for samsung
phones so that leads me to the question
of the day what do you think Samsung
needs to change to go back to its
limelight because of honestly in my
particular case it has to do with the
fact that almost every samsung phone
looks the same it has to do with the
fact that almost every samsung phone
looks like it did last year and there's
only so many ways you can design a
smartphone but whenever you have devices
like the HTC One m8 whenever we've got
the rumors of the iphone 6 it's really
hard for samson to remain relevant with
the same mentality leave us a comment
down below what would you want from
samsung in the future friends es you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming she follow us on the pocket out
comma scripture youtube channel as well
