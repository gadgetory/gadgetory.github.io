for the unused pixels on the Infinity Oh
galaxy s10 display some reports claimed
that all three 2019 iPhones will bring
an OLED display even the ten-hour
successor and students from Canada may
have just found a way to give us
batteries that are 10 times with more
capacity than the current ones I'm Jaime
Rivera and one of the main reasons why
this face is so I don't know it's Ninja
Gaiden on Nintendo Man
it's the best this is firing out daily
the official nor should I start with
deals those of you in the market for a
smart display I highly recommend
anything that has to do with the Google
home the Lenovo smart display would be
one of these and well surely you can
find the 10 inch variant for discounts
on Walmart online but if you go to
stores you can find it for as low as 99
bucks you learn more in the description
now let's talk about battery technology
which hasn't evolved in a while but some
students in Alberta Canada have just
discovered that there is another
solution
currently graphite is being used to
store the lithium ion but these students
have found a way to do it with silicon
in a way that's actually less expensive
than every single current technology
that we have and up to 10 times more
effective bringing ten times more charge
I think that's great
let's see how long that takes to reach
the mainstream hopefully now let's talk
about air power from Apple that product
that's almost the unicorn that we've
been expecting from Cupertino we were
supposed to get it what two years ago
and now we heard reports that
manufacturing had begun now it's
confirmed that it has the problem is we
were hearing that we were gonna get it
early this year but the report claims
that we're gonna get it until end of
year that's Apple for you now let's talk
about iPhones in 2019 as we've got some
conflicting reports that claim that
Cupertino is going to change the
strategy and make the even the less
expensive iPhone which is not less
expensive actually worth what it costs
up to the point where there's a jump to
oled displays on all three iPhones we're
not exactly sure on size or price
changes but definitely hopefully that
price tag goes down and finally the
hottest news today have to do
the two important things about the
galaxy s 10 es 10 + s 10 + courtesy of
Evan bless the first one where we see
case leaks we see two cameras on the S
10 e3 on the S 10 and then another 3 on
the s 10 + that's all fine we don't see
any fingerprint scanners so that's the
update for that on display fingerprint
scanner that we're expecting but the
motion porn the one is what's going to
happen with that infinity oh because it
seems that Samsung wants to use the
little circle around the camera for
something actually the notification LED
where it'll change colors depending on
what you're doing or it'll react to
notifications I believe that's rather
interesting listen in the comments down
below what do you think do you like the
whole concept and idea of having that
infinity circle whatever cut out surf
for a purpose because for me I think
that's actually genius I'd like it but I
hope it doesn't make our selfies look
worse leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
if you want to get the news earlier
follow us on par now what kind of script
about our channels English and Spanish
for more videos like this one and follow
me on twitter how they underscore
together on Instagram but I'm gonna
leave it at please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
I'm hi Mary thanks so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
