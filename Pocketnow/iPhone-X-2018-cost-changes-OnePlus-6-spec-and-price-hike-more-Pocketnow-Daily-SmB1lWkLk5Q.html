pricing and seems that cheaper is gonna
be part of it more sketchy leaked show
us the specs and pricing of the one plus
six and we've got more devices running
Oreo from last year
finally I'm Jaime Rivera and a funny
joke would be for Cupertino to get rid
of the knotch next year just as other
OEMs are adopting the knotch for their
phones imagine that this is PocketNow
daily the official news today have to do
with deals if you're in the market for
the LG b 30 which is one of the devices
we recommend for those of you that want
to start creating videos it's not the
best camera in the world but it is
really really versatile right now the V
30 plus think not the S thank you
whatever the plus V 30 plus is currently
available for just $600 on eBay and this
is a trusted seller you can learn more
in the description now it seems that
somebody at AT&amp;amp;T is watching the pocket
out daily yeah I know we're not that big
but hey for those of you that we're
complaining that you haven't received
the version of Oreo on your Samsung
Galaxy S a it as of yesterday's news it
is now available for the AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy s8
and the LG b 30 as well you can learn
more about all the updates and
everything in the description as well
and speaking of notches it's rather
interesting that we get more and more
analysts talking about the technology
behind face ID and just the fact that
for example companies like Samsung are
reportedly working really hard on
bringing this technology soon but as it
turns out more people confirmed that
Apple is at least two years of head of
any competitor and being able to
replicate the technology so much so that
we're already hearing possibilities of
it you know going to other devices like
iPads and who knows even MacBooks
whatever the case may be
yes Samsung is a company that's working
hard on this we wonder if they'll pull
it off at some point now let's move the
spotlight over to the oneplus six
yesterday we talked about design today
we're gonna talk about specifications
bear in mind these are sketchy rumors
but they're kind of obvious to a certain
degree if you think about it as the
rumors are the oneplus six will bring a
snapdragon 845 process from Qualcomm six
gigabytes of RAM in addition to 128 gigs
of storage to start
the problem is when we start talking
about the price tag this is what I'm not
gonna believe where they say that it's
gonna cost 750 bucks mmm that's not
gonna happen that's not what oneplus
stands for at least in my opinion
I hope the company doesn't prove me
wrong but we'll keep you posted and
finally the most interesting news they
have to do with Apple and the iPhone 10
2018 probably just one of the three
variants as we've got some sources
claiming that the company has a worked
hard on getting those the split panels
to become less expensive up to the point
where we hear that the five point eight
inch variant at least the cost of
manufacturing that display has dropped
by 10% making it a lot less expensive
for Apple to be able to offer the phone
and apparently that's gonna be one of
the big changes that have appliance to
bring to that next iPhone at least the
5.8 inch models apparently gonna be
significantly less expensive than the
other ones I don't think just by 10%
obviously we're not paying for R&amp;amp;D and
this and that and all that fun stuff but
in today's question let us know and
please Android fans don't ruin this one
or ruin it but hey listen how much would
you be willing to pay how much would you
consider is a fair price for the next
generation iPhone 10 because in my case
ooh I mean don't get me wrong I I just I
don't feel that smartphones are worth
900 1800 whatever all those price tags I
feel that a fair price for smart phones
was always six hundred and fifty dollars
which is the starting point of iPhones
up until the iPhone I think it was the 7
yeah it was pretty much a 7 still 750
wasn't bad but 1000 bucks that's too
much how much would you be willing to
pay for a smart phone let's put that in
general leave us a comment down below
