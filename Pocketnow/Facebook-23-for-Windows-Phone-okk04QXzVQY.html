packing.com and we are going to take a
quick look at the new facebook app for
Windows Phone let's check it out first
off it loads up the newsfeed and
actually when you first log in it'll ask
you if you want to use personal pictures
for the background banners I chose yes
and it looks pretty nice I think this
might be the best-looking facebook app
for mobile devices so here's our news
feed and we have buttons at the bottom
you got check-in added a status update
and take photo we also have refresh
filter settings change banner image and
logout change banner image doesn't let
you manually select one it just takes
another random set so let's go to filter
we can choose to filter by lists you can
also see just pages links videos so
that's the load just the videos in my
feed and scrolling is pretty quick let's
do another filter some people were
wondering where events when there's a
events option in the filtering but it
doesn't load anything so that's kind of
annoying
over here we have notifications and that
Scrolls playing nicely up here the got
the friend requests those will show
numbers if there's anything new you got
the messages let's just go to the inbox
and we can still pin the inbox to the
Start screen photos just kind of a grid
of different photo albums and then the
menu with you can pose to what's new and
here's your favorites but there's no way
to customize favorites and there's
groups pages and some apps photos and
notes of course you can see comments you
can add comments now the biggest thing
missing is the events however if you've
put your account into Windows Phone it
already made natively supports events so
see all these ones in blue are actually
Facebook events that i've been invited
to and you can read the details you can
see the wall there's the guest list
there's the details and I can respond to
it right here maybe attending not
attending so it's not hugely missed you
might also wonder where the messaging is
at the instant messaging that's already
integrated as well and when you go to a
person's profile
you get the normal stuff that you would
expect but it's also going to load a
nice banner image in background they're
kind of randomly
so that's one of their photos another
new thing when I post a message I can
choose who it's going to go to who can
see it everyone friends only me only
certain lists so that's pretty good
there is no automatic location
attachment here I would have to go to
check in first so that that button which
is good because a lot of people don't
want automatically posting things that
have their location attached to them and
pictures are similar to the previous
version
you do likes comments and of course in
the settings we have some options how
long cash is going to last and push
notifications you can choose toast and
tile updates for all those things or not
and obviously this is version 2.3 there
you go so that's the new facebook app
for Windows Phone probably not necessary
for a lot of people since Windows Phone
already has excellent Facebook
integration but for those looking for
groups and pages this is a good one so
give us a thumbs up if you like the new
facebook app for Windows Phone and
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
