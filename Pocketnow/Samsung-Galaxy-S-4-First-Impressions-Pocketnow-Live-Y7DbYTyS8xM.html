finally on the air it is time for the
samsung galaxy s4 event the one that
we've been all waiting for early some of
us I know that some people that are
joining me in this hangout today are
kind of skeptical about what will be
getting from Samsung obviously there is
we've got Brandon minimum we've got
Michael Fisher at the events Adam line
is joining us eventually from Times
Square everything is happening live
everywhere and it's kind of hot we're
kind of crazy here and we wish we were
there but joining me now is our managing
editor and Tandy knock good afternoon to
you sir good afternoon to you guys ah
good afternoon to you mr. Joe Levi how
are the chickens over there you are
muted Joe something's wrong I'm here I'm
really here I'm doing well thank you
well you probably add the chickens or
what I'm trying to keep them quiet okay
and from is it North Carolina or South
Carolina mr. Taylor Martin its North
Carolina everybody line it would it talk
about that Otis is that noise that is
Adam Lane coming to us live from Times
versus probably some men used to playing
in the bank yeah yeah we're trying to
get Adam to show with some footage from
Times Square obviously you can imagine
how many people are there right now so
most likely the transmission is not good
Brandon and Michael have told us that
the data connection at the event is
terrible this week again as expected and
we don't really know if they're jamming
it on purpose or well we don't know
they're probably just wanting people to
concentrate there's a lot to expect from
the galaxy s4 and the first person I
want to talk to about this the person
that is holding the HTC One right now
lift it on please show it up to
everybody come on make me envious of you
mr. anton dainik tell us about your
experience with the HTC One I mean are
you really expecting the galaxy s4 well
that's two different and difficult
questions and I don't want to spoil
everything because we'll have a full
review coming up on pocket now at the
beginning of next week but so far I can
tell you this much that the HTC One here
in
I hand is everything I ever wanted from
an android phone and it's actually a
phone which I regard higher than Apple's
iPhone 5 or 5s and that's a huge thing
but also this phone has some flaws as it
is right now and is an excellent phone
if only HTC could fix one major flaw in
my book and you will read about that and
see about that more on one of my
tomorrows pieces so so check back with
pocket now tomorrow to see that why am i
assuming that you're gonna start talking
about the camera you are assuming
probably right I don't know I and I want
to talk about this okay so for example
this is a gun you're talking to high
memory that I hear this is a guy that
wanted the HTC One X so bad ever since I
saw it in Barcelona I wanted that phone
and I went crazy over that phone and
Tony can tell you I mean he pretty much
had to grab me just to not go and try to
steal one of those from the demo units
and the problem is when I got the phone
help my experience was sadly that the
camera wasn't great it was a beautiful
phone well-designed and Men the
publicity behind the camera was awesome
but sadly it wasn't as great as they
publicized so I guess that's your
problem Tony yesterday on the podcast I
I said something about HTC and then I
said something about Samsung and I
managed to get people angry on both
sides and I said that beach to see HTC
is very good at doing some solid
hardware with beautiful devices and
excellent build quality but they don't
know how to make a good camera and then
Samsung on the other end is good at the
bringing you some huge specifications
and excellent user experience but they
don't know how to make beautiful phones
and the materials are not as good and as
premium as on the HTC One for instance
but i hope that samsung today will prove
me wrong now tell me something i mean it
was really cool you saw the photos that
we uploaded on facebook for those of you
that haven't noticed please follow us on
facebook facebook.com slash pocket now
or twitter.com slash pocket now as well
we've just changed our twitter handle by
the way and you'll notice in the feed
that Michael was able to capture a photo
of HTC employees or HTC
we hopefully hearing you know I paid oh
we have the live feed Adam you there can
you hear us oh man there you're
transmitting already and we are losing
Adam he's coming back let me see can you
can you focus on in Tony it's it's out
of him it's static on him but
unfortunately his image is also static
oh man well I guess the network there is
terrible but the point being is for
those of you that were following this
are on for those of you that we're
followers are following us on Facebook
you'll notice that Michael was able to
upload some photos of what was happening
at the event at New York City Music Hall
and you'll notice that there were HTC
employees showing off um you know they
were giving out water and chips and I
like what HTC is doing I I considered
cool i mean they're they're finally
being aggressive with their marketing i
find it awesome i don't know about you
guys you know I'm gonna hand it over to
Taylor and Joe after this you know what
I like what I loved this morning
everybody knows that I hated samsung ads
which were against Apple but I hate
every ad which is against another
company and now Samsung got what what
they did to somebody else LG posted huge
billboards in times square just above
Samsung's billboards so that when I saw
that thing I just basically started the
blood in here just like more on this
morning yeah more oh no in your case is
I mean Taylor and Taylor and and Joe you
both have had the galaxy s3 sorry just
disconnecting hey he also had audio can
hear as Adam how's everything at second
oh man we had at first I Dana lots of
dogs people there don't use what ok so
both you guys have had the galaxy s3 I
don't know if you still have a job do
you still have yours no you said it to
me no I I got to set it on I need to get
the packaging over to Taylor I finally
found it it's right here ok so are you
guys like boring glory
yeah so bottom line are you guys waiting
for the galaxy s4 is this your next
daily driver going forward no probably
not why not I don't own the piece on it
today I think we had Taylor i'll i'll
tell you about my pieces yeah i think we
both wrote on on the s3 and i don't know
exactly i didn't have time to read yours
but they weren't all that different i
don't think ironically uh I was never
really in really interested in this
device the day it launched or even if
the announcement I was just kind of
underwhelmed to me for samsung to market
this as a flagship device it holds a
very feature phone like design that's
what I've always felt that the rounded
corners less so in the white model but
more more on the blue model which really
I guess the primary might want it the
rounded corners just made it feel like a
feature phone no no I like I like the
blue model a lot more than the flag than
the white one serious I just didn't like
it and as you guys are holding up your
please both hold up your galaxy s3's
yeah there we go and I'm holding up my
notes too and we don't have an s3 mini
we don't have any of the other galaxies
but yeah as you can see guys all these
phones are looking the same and this is
my biggest problem with samsung i mean i
could put up with this for one year what
are your in 30 phones but can i put up
with this for an additional year and
plenty more phone i'm not sure even even
not LG how it is that no wait wait a
second Joe what is that oh wow that's
why I HTC g1 or g2 to whatever it is I
had to pull from my stack of phone so
I've got my galaxy nexus which is
essentially a an SG s 2.5 because it
came out between the two and the three
but I had to send the three over to
tailor so I don't have one of those to
show off so I just thought I'd show off
in a way my old favorite my old standby
so just for those who are joining now
right now
we are covering the samsung galaxy s4
event we are here live on youtube
michael fisher and brandon minimun are
at the venue in New York getting some
hands-on time after the event and Adam
Lane is trying to join us from time
square life and let's say how about guys
we recap what we know up until now or
what we think we Adam Adam is actually
being able to show us something there
there a lot of people there and it looks
like if it's raining Adam can you hear
us I don't think you can I never hear
you tell us about that is Clara I can
hear you sometimes but it doesn't stay
connected for very long it's okay I'll
ugly well there's like a line to go into
a box and do the haryana do they have
the phone the still working okay yeah we
can hear you yeah we can hear you and we
can't hear you anymore this was very
good in theory this is awesome in theory
yeah well a man i mean we sadly cannot
rely on data connections from everybody
but anyway sonal mexicali xes so far the
galaxy s4 is what i would consider oh
here we go Adam can you hear us Adam
killers yes yeah you're sure sure yeah
yeah we can hear you're telling us that
people are going into a box and he's
gone again gotta love it turn it I love
it anyways well the galaxy s4 in my
opinion is probably one of Samsung's
best-kept secrets I seriously do not
have a clue how these people had figured
out how to hide that phone from the
media and we have not seen real leaks of
the phone until the last week and I
think it wasn't that hard to hide
because it looks a lot like the galaxy
s3 um I think that the only thing that
changed on that phone and correct me if
I'm wrong we're definitely going to know
soon oh and the Samsung of that is
already starting by the way apparently
we're they're getting an ad
oh yeah they're starting right now yeah
it's counting down okay apparently the
the only thing that's really changed and
I have this old blackberry bold 9900
here whatever they've faith yet they've
added this metallic trim around the
galaxy s4 and the question is is this
really metallic or not because the
problem of the galaxy s3 is it looks
metallic but it isn't um the I guess
it's a Chinese site the one that had yak
and extensive hands-on with it and
posted yeah a 7000 word article 10
really I don't know how long it was that
they had probably 30 40 50 pictures on
it um they did a key test on it and it's
plastic boopie like like the s really
like the note 2 yep oh it said it's got
a metal rim they said there's a metal
trim I can drop the Lincoln if you want
it to my article please so you know I've
been asking myself that question i mean
i know the galaxy s3 is fully plastic
but on the note 2 I don't know but this
feels it feels strong is it plastic or
not well I I'm banking at the right now
but I cannot tell him oh I don't know
it's a fact it's kind of hard to tell
Adam can you hear us I could actually a
symphony at this place you're not
playing around it was a sin funny last
year when i was in london for the galaxy
s free event then that was cool i was
going to ask you how was that galaxy s3
event when you were there tells us it
was majestic samsung managed you to have
the london orchestra actually stringing
the samsung tune on the stage after the
introduction of the S free which was
which was awesome thing is that
everybody as usual with what events like
these whenever the event was over and we
got invited for some hands-on time
behind the stage everybody was just
rushing in like crazy but the event was
good see I hadn't imagined yeah go ahead
go ahead I was about to ask you how
about we tell people what we we know
right now from the league's and then
maybe compare what we think we know with
what will happen yeah go ahead you
started off ok so so far so far we we've
we've been hearing lots of rumors and
the recently a Chinese version of the
dual-sim variety of the galaxy s4 or the
alleged galaxy s4 got leaked and the
specifications include a 5-inch four
point ninety nine inch full HD super
amoled screen then we also know that it
might be powered by an Exynos processor
which is the octa-core processor in
Europe and in the u.s. it might be
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
then again we have a 2 gigabyte of ram
and a 13-megapixel camera ok let me
interrupt you for a second we've got
Samsung's president already on stage
he's obviously most likely gonna
announce the phone I like this guy on
stage because he doesn't really he
doesn't really talk you know he doesn't
really talk at all he's just like this
is the galaxy s4 there is directly say
very brief letter the vote he's saying
this in the best few weeks we've heard
an amazing combination of rumor and
speculation about what I'm going to
unveil tonight so is it may be a
confirmation of the rumors or is it may
be but it was just rumors and we're
gonna learn something completely
different well think about it I mean
they've kept this so well a secret that
they could have leaked that phone in
China on purpose and you know probably
will be getting something else I mean
you never know nobody saw the galaxy s3
by the way I don't remember any leaks of
the galaxy s3 before we actually saw it
on stage if you guys remember that there
were a lot of them but nobody knew it
actually looked like yeah because it was
in the Konami box was in a dummy box
thanked exactly who never knew about the
specs yeah we know about the specs and
all but we didn't really know how the
phone was gonna look and I don't know I
was underwhelmed by the galaxy s3 when I
saw it for the first time I mean when
you saw just you know let's just go back
a little bit in time here I mean if you
look at the design of the One X and you
compare it to the galaxy s
the One X is a beautiful phone there's
just no denying it and it was really
hard to improve on the One X when it
came to design and the only thing that
Samson really did was do better
marketing and delivered on what they
promised so I guess I guess there was a
lot to expect but now one of the biggest
rumors is on software apparently there's
gonna be something huge on software and
we've it is just I don't know it's been
just confirmed that the eye tracking
technology is in smart scroll and smart
buzz and also the floating touch as in
air view is also in so for those who
have the galaxy note to know that the
when you hover the stylus the S Pen over
the screen it will automatically allow
you to interact with the device and
Samsung is bringing that to the galaxy
s4 you will be able to hover your finger
on the screen and interact with the
phone by the way readers and viewers if
you are catching us on YouTube you know
there is so much stream that we sadly
cannot read the comments on YouTube yet
so please do us the favor of joining us
at pocketnow.com on the post that it is
a sticky it's right there on the front
page and you can leave all the comments
you want there and we will definitely
read as much as we can during the live
feed we sadly cannot do it from youtube
at the moment it's it's a really a
struggle but I don't know about you Joe
whatever you thought about all the leaks
of the galaxy s3 of the galaxy s4 time
well you know I really haven't
considered them leaks I've considered
them just a whole bunch of speculative
rumors based on odd information because
it you really can't call it a leak it
they've done so good at keeping things
quiet keeping a secret it's all been
just speculation it's been people in the
industry who think they have some
information and are making iterative
gases about what they're going to come
out with whether or not it holds true or
not we'll find out in a little bit well
we already heard about we already heard
about Taylor on on his impressions on
the four do you want the galaxy s4 Joe
you're a nexus guy God between the phone
that I have now and the the sgs4 no I'm
I'd like to see what I'd like to play
with one I'd like to have one in the
hand just to see if they've improved on
their hyper glaze and whatnot
and the whole touchless experience that
that they're talking about right now at
the event sounds impressive but I don't
know if the specs are going to justify
let me interrupt you for just one second
we also have some new details about the
software we also in addition to smart
scroll smart pause an ear view we have s
translator and group play which is going
to make you be able to listen to the
same music on multiple devices and then
we have s health which will help you
make stay healthy and Samsung Knox km 0
X which allows you to use the same phone
for both work and play you know the
interesting about that group sharing
music you remember that well there is a
capability in the galaxy s3 where you
can take a photograph and share with the
people that are around you how many
times have you actually used that thing
Tony never zero you know if this is okay
wait a second apparently apparently they
are about to unveil the phone let me
just hopefully hopefully we'll see it
come on shows the phone let it not look
like the galaxy s is and it's the galaxy
s oh boy oh well whoa hey where is your
live stream faster than mine or
something so we need to wait apparently
as faster than mine too ladies most live
stream ladies and gentlemen the phone
we've seen leaked from china is the
galaxy s4 yes and it looks like the S
free and it looks like the note 2 and it
looks like all the 30 other galaxies
from 2012 the galaxy honey we can't see
your stream than mine hey this guy has
got 100 megabits per second down that's
that's what he's got I'm not gonna allow
him to brag I'm gonna say that for okay
so by the way it is not gonna be called
the galaxy s4 as in Roman numerals
anymore he called the galaxy s number
yes I am remember trying to to drop of
the picture here but I cannot so I'm
gonna just shoot it over to Taylor
because he knows his way around much
better than I do Taylor please shared
this picture with us where'd you send it
your email okay so looking at the phone
does that bezel look quite a bit smaller
than what we're used to on the s3
probably a melon well if you if if you
take a look at the note 2 it's about the
same bezel I'm trying to put it in the
same perspective as the picture which I
have and it's it's exactly the same and
it looks yeah Jase it's kind of hard to
tell you don't you know what I'm
probably most underwhelmed about is the
fact that TouchWiz looks like TouchWiz
uh I don't know why you as and you know
I love the fact that Samsung has been
able to figure out TouchWiz meaning it
is not laggy it is extremely responsive
but it is just so oh it is just so water
directly it it will be available in 155
countries starting the end of April so
far no information about US market and
specific US carriers but it will support
LTE networks on all frequencies and here
we have the picture 7 operators here we
have that's gentlemen ladies this is the
galaxy s4 and you had already seen it
and we had about 50 this week uh what do
you guys think Tony happy underwhelmed I
hope I I said at one point that the
Samsung has to deliver two things in
order for me to get the s4 over the HTC
One the thing number one a better camera
which they will probably deliver and
thing number to a new different design
because I'm sick of the design of the S
free end of the note 2 and apparently
the design is the same and even if the
camera is pure of you like I'm still
going to go with the HTC One and this is
by no means a pocket now opinion this is
my personal opinion no no it's great and
in my case you know I actually like the
the the Santa the galaxy s3 design I
just I don't know man I'm gonna look
like everybody that has an s3 already so
what's the point of swapping the phone I
mean probably the only difference is the
camera and I'm sure that Samsung is
using the same sense for Sony they
always do so you could probably tell us
a little more about that sensor with the
Xperia Z that you just reviewed Taylor
um it was pretty impressive I'm not
gonna lie it's not the most amazing
thing I've ever shot a picture with a
new in my life but uh it's impressive
Brandon actually complained to me that I
posted two nights of pictures in my
review and and the problem is i guess
this is it's half me trying to take the
best picture i possibly can but it was
half the performance of the camera was
impressive the low light was awful low
light was absolutely terrible but I
think everything else was pretty good
right it was hard to take a terrible
picture thinner i also have a question
for you is just likely related to this
if I know well you had a beast today
which was entitled wolf samsung full a
apple iphone 4s with the galaxy s4 i
wanted to tell you about that i changed
it to five because it's a slightly
design slightly bigger so i went with
five on that okay do you still believe
that yeah it is that's exactly what it
is their location software features then
okay listen so it's a four point ninety
nine inch display full HD 441
pixels-per-inch how much was on the
Xperia Z or the ZL I believe had a
better pixel density right Taylor the
same lip of that the same 5-inch 1080p
display so it's 40 Gabba yeah but how
much was oh it was the same TV i right
yeah but they're calling the screen full
five inches and it's 441 PPI buddy mi
HTC One has a 4.7 inch screen just a
slightly smaller width 468 PPI it not
that it matters because you won't see
that difference anyway there's just this
that's also it's also pentile at least
that's what the the chinese site said so
it's pinto and 1080p pintail isn't as
significant live in tomatoes it might
not matter but I under the microscope
they could definitely tell a difference
um what maybe the thing is it white or
gray excellent the pack of the problem
is the pixel arrangement and the color
accuracy with pentile displays you have
an extra green pixel everywhere so sorry
if that and
in highly saturated images you get the
the graininess you don't get a solid
color you get grain and I don't know if
that will carry over to 1080p but I
don't know about you guys but my Twitter
feed has gone crazy apparently these
people don't like the design of the
galaxy s4 I would like to ask Joe what
do you think about this because you
haven't spoken that much today and I
want to hear your opinion as the android
guy well I I don't dislike the design of
the samsung galaxy s3 and we just have
exactly the same design in today's phone
the four looks like the three you're
gonna be hard pressed to tell them apart
just looking at them I looked away for
just a second is he showing off the s3
on stage or the s4 you know it's hard to
tell man it's kinda it's got an it's got
an IR LED it's got bluetooth 4.0 which
is duh it's got 4g LTE cat3 with
apparently different bands a you're
you're getting an iphone 4s uh meaning
it's a better iphone 4 but it's an
iphone 4s is a you're getting a you know
I consider that it's really not
necessarily a bad thing for them not to
bury the design um again I do like the
design I just don't like the materials
chosen for the phone I wish that they
used a little bit more aluminum or a
little bit I don't know I've had bad
experience a little English hydranoid a
little less hyper glaze I my mind my
galaxy nexus broke on one fall one fall
and that's my same worried with the
galaxy s3 you know that this phone has
never fallen and I worry of the day it
happens you know probably now with its
this is gonna be a heck sub and 4G LTE
phone wow that's you know that's
probably like wow but how many people
actually roam around the world that
would be a heck Seban help solo just me
that you just have one phone for every
carrier out there it's it makes sense to
put everything in there not for roaming
before ubiquity of device you can take
your device and it'll work on any
virtually any carrier out there without
switching over to something else
something else in the specs with this it
does have 802 11 AC so it's even to be
on the 802 11 n so soup
our super fast Wi-Fi if your home router
supports it I found the picture of
interesting that the pixel layout of the
s4 oh wait a second wait a second these
are beat okay wait a second let me just
interrupt you for a second this is not
just any two gigabytes of RAM this is LG
ddr3 is there NE sone out there okay so
for example on your Mac you've got ddr3
1666 um but there is ddr2 to ddr1 and I
believe that every smartphone out there
the farthest it's gone and technology is
DVR to know as a video I think you're
wrong on this I think I i think i've
heard I've seen some LG devices which
have sported the dr 3 for quite some
time well mmm that's that I don't know
about you Joe you're the most technical
guy here he do you know about that
because I do know that obviously ddr3 is
gonna make your phone a lot faster yes
and no I think we're hitting a
technological plateau where how fast
you're you can talk to your onboard
memory is probably not the bottleneck
right now true but I do like to step up
to ddr3 dator please show us the the
bent I'll thing oh yeah sorry sorry
about that I'm off on another tangent
now you guys just missed out sorry and
apparently we are getting what was the
battery on this galaxy s3 was waiting
six hours 2600 is on the s4 now okay so
only 600 up so that Chinese site called
this pin tile and it's actually the same
arrangement you see on the galaxy uh no
I'm looking at this backwards so it is
it is pentile it's not the same
arrangement you see on the the note to
which the note 2 is not as not Penta
right well i was looking at it backwards
it's mirrored so i was looking at it no
like wait so it's mirrored for me um
yeah so it's not it is pinto actually so
it's the same pixel density or pixel
AOSS three I don't know why okay so for
example in my case for those people that
don't consider a pentile to be an issue
um I have an s3 and an 02 and those the
both both devices have the same 720p
resolution you should actually consider
that the s3 would have better the better
it should handle images better because
there is a lot more pixel density on
this phone because the screen is smaller
but in my experience if you look at a
button anything that's drawn on a device
looks much better on the note to it
looks smoother on the note 2 that's non
pentile then on the s3 that's been my
experience so I agree with you the I met
up until the point where I'd say that at
five inches full HD with a 400 plus BB I
you won't really see that that's the
hope Adam is trying to show us times
croaking you can use the camera is love
Duncan ok cool Adam we can't hear you
can you hear us now it looks like
pandemonium there that's not an awful
lot of people and that is a lot of
unhappy people alright so we're um gon
go ahead got if you look here this is
the experience II galaxy s3 and galaxy
s4 compared at a I don't know what zoom
level um it doesn't look exactly framed
the same for all of them but as you can
see here the Xperia Z whites are white
doesn't matter how close you go they're
still looking white I mean if you go
much closer you'll see individual pixels
but at the same zoom level you get a
really grainy picture from the s4 and
even more so from the s3 and that's you
don't get white white you get individual
pixels those are pretty large so it
looks real nice one pixels like to weigh
in on something a LG this morning sent
out a press release that the optimus g
pro which we've seen at mwc will soon
receive a value back and that value pack
will contain some enhancements like I
tracking and like dual camera capture
and both of those features which LG
announced
are now being confirmed for samsung
galaxy s4 which is interesting now this
dual camera feature thing is pretty
simple you take your phone out you snap
a picture and it instantaneously snaps a
picture with the back camera and also
with the front camera and it stitches
them together so that you can have your
moments ready and share them interesting
we're looking at Adams at time square
footage which is is on and off there is
pandemonium there and then we have a
couple of comments in our pocket now a
post one person we've got do haha 82 is
every android fan should buy an HTC One
Sampson is pulling an old HTC yeah
you're right and by right but this is
Jaime giving us opinion and by no means
pocket now's official opinion no no no
that this is actually a comment on the
post and you know you are absolutely
right this is HTC 2010 where we had like
a million copies of the sensation uh in
different different flavors and
different colors you got it in red and
purple in whatever color you want it but
it was still the same sensation you've
got it don't introduce them with a tap
dancer in orchestra so exactly exactly
you know Samsung is good showmanship but
the phone is really what we're there for
and sadly uh it says it's got a dual
camera as the G Pro's dual camera that
exact feature which I told you about
right it uses a front-facing camera at
the same time right right to stitch
things together right but it's actually
not necessarily like like the HTC one
that uses to do all four megapix no no
no this is a you take one with the the
good camera and you want to be in the
picture as well so it'll take a picture
of you taking a picture of them and put
you into the picture but it doesn't do
it really cool it does it was a weird
Photoshop overlays yeah i just gotta do
I'm gonna censor this a little bit but
who wants a picture of the photographer
so so about another guy j-rok k is
saying low using dual screens to be able
to watch you guys and watch the
presentation at the same time thank you
very much for staying with us um let
them do a scene looking over here i'm
watching a stream on another monitor
yeah we have someone we have some more
features like drama shot and like the
eraser feature for raising photo bumpers
but i would like to ask a serious
question from joe because i know that at
the point when back in january samsung
announced the Exynos 5 octa-core
processor he wrote a lot of the lot of
tutorials on how it compares to other
cpus now we're specifically talking
about the s4 vs the one will the Exynos
5 octa be that much better than the
snapdragon 600 or will it be negligible
overall performance i think is going to
be negligible when you go to the octave
with the the big little technology
you're you're not using eight cores
you're using two sets of quad cores and
you're just going to get very good
performance with very very good battery
life so you're not going to see
performance increases but you are going
to see theoretically a better better
experience and better overall life that
you'll be able to use your device that
battery will last longer so your money
is right now on a five to six hundred on
the 600 I believe all of that when I see
it they've been promising or saying this
this prefer this processor this chipset
is more battery efficient than this one
or you know they've been saying that
forever and the the improvements are
negligible they say it's thirty percent
more battery efficient but you don't
send us their time setting to turn
thirty percent more yeah yeah you don't
see a thirty percent return on that you
see something that is invisible I don't
see that you know yeah probably the only
reason why I'm excited about this phone
and is that the hexa ban LTE because for
example for me I avoid buying unlocked
phones you know the carrier unlock UK
version phones because they lack LTE so
when I travel to the United States I'm
stuck on on hspa+ and so what I do is I
get AT&amp;amp;T
bones I legally unlock them this guy and
I bring over here I get stuck on edge
okay I don't even want to hear it and i
will just interrupt you we have a
working live feed from Times Square
right now the camera is locked on that
so as we speak you'll see what happens
in Times Square in New York yeah nice
Omar just a lot of people yeah it's it
but it's still pandemonium there that's
amazing yeah that's amazing III you do
you wonder if these people are paid for
or is it really it depends on how many
people there are there are a lot of
people there and Samsung has a lot of
money all right question by the way we
had nothing against Samsung we asked
ourselves the same question for the
Microsoft Surface announcement I just
got a question on Twitter Xperia Z HTC
One or galaxy s4 honestly it wouldn't be
a toss-up between any of those one I'm
to get emotional over there I thought
you were saying like wait no note for
one um I would it would actually be a
toss-up between the ZL and the one um I
really like to see but the build was
just it wasn't organ ama Chi had trouble
using the device and the camera was what
really sold me on it and the CL has the
same camera the display kind of kinda
sucks a little bit a little bit and the
rest was really good i like the rest so
what about you what about you Joe I
haven't helped any of the devices
enhance though having said that based on
the specs that I've seen based on all
the pictures that I've seen I'm putting
my money behind the one yeah um that's
my final answer is I would go one but
the CL is really kind of the only thing
pulling me in another direction I'm
journalist royal actually impressed i am
going to spoil everybody right now
because i am my next phone is gonna be
the gs4 oh why is it going okay why is
it gonna be the gs4 okay so the one is a
beautiful phone okay so for example why
do I always use an iphone okay I'm gonna
answer the question now because you're
okay no I am NOT a fat boy
Adam we can see you I had to see it okay
okay so the reason why is because this
is a non compromised camera um i buy a
64 gigabyte iphone and I get a non
compromise camera and we can see Adam
there but sadly it's it's kind of choppy
hopefully it's it's a lot better in the
final stream that all our viewers are
watching but what I like about the
galaxy s3 is or the galaxy s4 now is
that it's the only other phone that can
deliver that image quality and can give
me the replaceable battery and the
expandable storage that I want our does
reason are those not safe for work
ladies there Adam cake Aniki you talk
about total question about the ladies
right now wow it must be freezing in
Times Square right now so I wouldn't
want to be in their shoes I can't tell
if they're wearing khaki pants or no
pants that's the beauty of the Internet
okay it depends on who you ask if you
ask Tony he'll give you an answer and
then if you asked Joe he'll give you
another answer um kind of know I just
want to know if it's pentile or not fine
right on Twitter just ask does it
feature s wealth to who wouldn't like
that okay so Tony you you are the only
one that's holding a one right now so
talk about you I mean you are gonna keep
that one or you're gonna try the s4 no I
got okay so as a pocket now editor I
will try the s4 and i will try almost
every phone out there but if i wasn't
working for a pocket now i would go
personally with the one okay okay we'll
see ya there are a lot of software
enhancements that are coming to this to
the galaxy yesterday you see that's
that's the problem i don't care about
those i don't care about the smart stay
I don't care about I tracking I don't
care about air view I don't care about
anything I care about that looks good
camera fast performance great user
experience full stuff you know and I
can't imagine myself holding the phone
and hovering my finger over it and and
and doing that I mean why not just touch
the damn thing and
you're there why not just just think
about it I mean if the phone I would
love for the phone to be in the kitchen
and for me to be from here like okay
like you know that would make sense
that's as fundamental mention when it
makes you feel like you have powers or
something use the Force to open this app
they should know what you want to do
before you know what you want to do
right I just don't even have to point a
finger why should I have to lift a
finger so this is the Darth Vader phone
right so Tony since you're in Europe and
talked with a lot of people with
different different languages probably
more than any of us what do you think of
the S translate feature they've got on
there well I don't know it's it's it it
for me who I'm used to writing texts and
emails in at least three languages every
day it would be something which I would
not use because I speak these languages
very well and I can i can write texts
but for somebody who isn't that good
with with the keyboard with typing maybe
they will find that useful as i'm sure
people love smart stay now december you
any of those any of the samsung features
I've never used a single one of them can
you can usually in sooner unless you
don't have to do the s-pen one go oh
yeah that's a teacher I have never eaten
I have never to this day used Papa
browser by the way okay sorry I take
that back i have used a browser okay
let's do one that's the one but other
than that like papa video was completely
entirely useless now there are there are
a couple of there are a couple of things
that are happening in the presentation
that i don't consider gimmicks um you
remember that samsung box that was
released recently apparently you're
gonna be able to use that box as a
homesync media hub for your devices but
obviously it's something that's sold
separately okay so i understand how does
this differ from i guess its airplane
ear well if this isn't the fact that not
ever it differs in the fact that not
everybody wants an iphone so if you're
in the same
world it makes sense for you know I love
the fact that if i buy a box i get the
features and i'm not forced to buying a
samsung smart TV for that the i'm
going to cost you 100 bucks and you're
gonna get the features as opposed to
buying the Smart TV for three thousand
dollars ya know I actually said the
wrong thing allshare play is what i
meant to say not airplay but all share
play okay your top you're talking to me
about a feature that i have on my phone
and that I've never used so tell me
about ok rock this we have got all share
play I was sitting in kind of kind of
turn the stream volume down but
orchestra is crazy so I was sitting in
my living room watching probably walking
dead on on netflix and i was looking at
a video of my phone on the note 2 and
there was a little thing that popped up
on my screen and I'm like what does that
even do and I hit it and it closed out
of the netflix app on my 360 and started
playing the video on my TV through my
360 nice so it just worked I didn't have
to do anything and it was because it is
a network that is basically basic dlm a
Apple yeah yeah but well yeah and we've
got that nails packaged up on Android to
come out with jelly bean or was it ice
cream sandwich jelly bean I think it was
jelly bean yeah yeah so yeah so how did
less rebranding in this box well I
apparently you'll for example one thing
that I like and this is something that
we do a lot here at the household it's
like when my older son is here for
vacations we want to play Monopoly uh
you know we play through the same Wi-Fi
connection and not necessarily you know
have to use any sort of network
bandwidth or anything it just happens
through Wi-Fi so I you know I guess this
box will enable you to do this that's
that's pretty much it you know just or
either sharing things with everybody
like comb sharing like if you have a Mac
you can activate home sharing on itunes
and everybody can hear your music
library you don't necessarily have to
have it on a specific twice just one now
I have a question for for Joe because I
know he recently posted something about
this when we were reversal oh no what
Michael we both
Rock the no.2 and we have the we have
been bumping phones which means that we
took pictures and we use the S beam
feature with the with the NFC in order
to transmit the picture from one phone
to the other but by touching their
back-to-back now right do you think that
the galaxy s4 will be I know it should
be but will be backwards compatible with
the galaxy s3 and no two that's one
question and will they fix the issue of
incompatibilities with other phones on
the market right now ok so backwards
compatibility absolutely you're going to
be able to use any of the Samsung Galaxy
NFC enabled devices to two s beam back
and forth one another if they don't s
beam is dead so they have to do that
they're going to do that and it works
fabulously works great as long as you're
going from a modern Samsung device to
another modern Samsung device to your
second question about compatibility if
you turn off s beam but leave on Android
Beam compatibility is across all those
devices it works great on any ICS device
with NFC on up samsung or not the
downside to to Android Beam / S beam is
it's a little bit not as advanced it
doesn't have all the features it doesn't
do the the high-speed data transfers and
whatnot that s beam does so in basic
makes that compatibility it transfers
through bluetooth and not through Wi-Fi
that right what I direct credit do they
change that I thought they changed that
in the latest jelly bean update nature I
haven't tried it yet to see if they have
or not but I haven't been able to get it
work over the direct I think it's listed
on the developer page that that uh that
could be totally I could be totally
wrong but I thought they updated it okay
only I may be making some updates to it
but it's still separate it's still
different from from SB my don't think
there's a compatibility between Android
Beam and s beam using Wi-Fi direct to
try so I would be basic Tony Tony I am
sad to report that there are white pants
sadly you got this as a
breaking news listen there's this
there's this question from a commenter
it says it's really intriguing that to
hear that Tony your first phone with 4
megapixels can we hear why especially
when he's been waiting for the next
curve you phone so they want to know why
are you gonna put up with performing up
I I put up with the 4 megapixels because
I always have my 41-megapixel handy no
no no no so here's here's the deal the
the HTC one looks so good and feels so
good in the hand and it is so fluid and
everything except for the camera and
then on the other hand it's the samsung
galaxy s4 which which does everything
well except for the looks so it's just
my personal preference that I prefer
this phone over the other one because I
have other phones with which to get your
pictures if this would be my one and
only camera phone then I think twice
about it so but you you wouldn't be
considering getting just one solution
meaning what would it would for example
the the average user only has one fall
so let's forget about the fact that
you're going to be using the 808
PureView if you would have to choose
just one phone and obviously let's not
talk about the iphone 5 because we know
that's your next one but you know
between the one and the galaxy s3 which
would it be under those premises if i
was a typical user and i would have to
choose one phone with which to stick for
two years on a contract i would probably
go with the samsung galaxy s4 see there
that's that's really my point i mean
that's it's really the only phone out
there and this is the stupidest thing i
mean you bring out the one and then you
bring out you bring out the 1x last year
and then you bring out the one in there
like oh we had to invest so much in this
beautiful design to make this phone thin
and light and then you get the galaxy s3
and galaxy s4 and they're thinner
lighter and they have expandable storage
so there's really no excuse as to why
you cannot offer these services on the
HTC One so I'm sure that HTC made a big
bet with that camera but i would have
preferred i mean i would pay
HTC for them to give me a phone ala
carte you remember that editorial yeah I
would give me the one give me the one as
it is with sense and everything but with
the 13.1 megapixel camera David I say
sum that up fire away this is this is
something that hit me as I was sitting
down for this hangout otherwise I
probably would have written an editorial
about it earlier today but I looked over
and I thought that's all this thing Oh
pizzas Tim and this is exactly why like
or not why but what would it make you
want good flavor settings on your couch
well you can use my music hold on let me
move only maybe without ya hahaha so we
finally get immunity Oh Tony can you try
he's made it now oh cool warming up man
go ahead yes if they had made the s4 out
of the same soft touch material it would
be an entirely entirely different story
that that was that's all it would take
this right here this is one of the most
well designed mobile devices so Samsung
has ever made the Nexus tent I
absolutely love the bill but call it
quality of this device they made the s4
obvious it would be a no-brainer you
know guys what's what's not funny not
strange it's I think said that we are
here right now in 2013 and we are being
torn between two phones which should
offer basically about the same
specifications and in 2013 he would
expect that every phone should have a
good camera it's not 2007 or 2008
anymore and here comes HTC with the HTC
One and that it was the HTC One X and
the one x+ last year and everything is
good about them except for the camera so
I don't know what HTC is doing but do do
you guys know who is making the image
sensor and the chip inside HTC phones
yeah a wacky dude because he was the one
that actually he was the one that came
out with the first 16 megapixel sensor
on a phone on the Titan
two and then why not bring that 16
megapixel sensor which was not really
that good but you know bring that
enhanced into the HTC one can you
imagine that HTC one with a 16 megapixel
sensor of yes I can imagine that but
when I heard about the four megapix of
the four ultrapixel camera I said okay I
can live with four megapixel images it's
not a problem but that image at 4
megapixels has to be absolutely the
image okay it's not but but here's the
problem here's the problem you are not
using a Retina Display MacBook Pro um
700 you 700 pixels wide is like this big
on your screen yeah I learned this this
week I just upgraded and everything is
so small okay so all computers right now
and even the Chromebook pixel but that
expensive gimmicky thing out there this
has a rep at this way okay so the
problem with retina displays and let me
just explain the technology is one
second i'ma quickly liquidly I just got
an email from from ATT they will carry
the yes for I don't know if that was
already hotter or not but do we know any
availability and pricing official
statement was we're gonna carry it
basically ok let's see make sure they're
plump they're playin college ok att.com
/ galaxy s4 so now so they're the s the
number for the number for they're
playing they're playing golf at the
event right now so let's continue
talking about fixes um first of all I
have a question because I don't know
what a Retina display means on a macbook
or on a computer can you translate that
to resolution so that people like I'm
knowledge I'll explain I'll explain it
right now ok so what the computer does
is that it'll give you for example you
get 2048 x 1536 which is the iPads
resolution but what they'll do it is
that they'll divide that by four and
quadruple those pixels and make you like
a
a thinner pixel or a larger pixel I
think it would be um into that same area
so what you're doing is this is the the
image but what you're doing is
quadrupling it to look like this okay so
what happens when you have a 1920 x 1080
photo or image on a Retina display even
if your resolution is set to quadruple
itself what it's actually doing is it's
shrinking itself so when you open that
image it looks small on your on your
retina this way and it's really
confusing if you're abused oh my gosh we
lost you for a second there Timon we
lost you for a second can you just
repeat your last sentence okay so it's
extremely confusing that's the problem
meaning resolution what it's doing its
quadrupling pixels and it doesn't make a
difference on a tablet or on a phone but
it does on a computer so basically yes
so the problem on a computer it's really
non controllable for example if I try to
take a screenshot that's 1280 by 720 on
my display it'll tell me that it's 1280
by 720 and it actually takes up that
area but then when I try to export that
photo it tells me that the photo is 2550
bye-bye I don't know what number it's a
crazy number because that's really the
amount of pixels that are within that
photo so here's a question for everybody
I'm sorry go on tater oh you you're
asking for the resolution of the retina
display and that's 2805 or 2880 by 1800
that's basically approximately the same
as my 27-inch imac so I haven't looked
for you guys yeah but the difference is
you're twenty-eight year 27-inch imac is
not quadrupling the pixels yeah you know
it is really giving you real pixels so
you will see the photo in real in real
resolution not the way we get it on a
Retina display so everybody kind of
agrees that the best cameras out there
on the market are on the iPhone on the
Samsung Galaxy and on the Sony phones
that's because all these free phones are
using use sony imaging chips the other
end then there's nakia not as using
their own imaging chips with sometimes
carl zeiss optics
why wouldn't according to your opinion
guys HTC try to license or purchase one
of those imaging chips at the IC tailor
its please express your feelings in
words their financials are not that
great right now and they're on the track
to recovery and that means that they're
going to have to cut some corners and
that's one reason I imagine they don't
use micro SD card slots anymore that
that's just I guess is that they put
everything into the display and the
design but they believe you know how
much would it cost for a microSD
expansion slot to be included on a phone
one two three five dollars just think
about it how much do they deported oh
it's a baseball sense but the problem
which do they pay apple for further
phones just think about that for this is
the problem is that they're they're
paying you no licenses to use android
now basically because all these lawsuits
I got a comment on Twitter it said I'm
watching a Broadway show for a phone a
bit too much I forgot the specs already
and this is kind of ridiculous it's I
mean the production is awesome but this
is a play it's a it's a show yeah it is
i'm wondering if michael fisher is is
there at the event on stage so can I
leave in his hand and saying to be or
not to be yeah Tony Tony there is a
question for you on the post its asking
if Anton is talking about look that
looks are not important then I would ask
him if he would notice a difference
between the girl next door and Scarlett
Johansson just take a pic I'm not gonna
dignify that with an answer I don't know
I I feel again I I just feel that the
galaxy s4 is the only phone out there
that's not compromising your money
you're paying the same amount of money
that you're paying for an HTC One and
you're not gonna have good low-light
performance uh well it's really hard to
get good low-light performance anyways
you have to be like with a freakin
tripod trying to
photo for it not to look Jackie anyways
so it doesn't really matter if you've
got great low-light performance unless
you you you just can you just completely
written eight you resign from breathing
to try to turn that is also a problem
with the HTC one I mean the HTC One has
exceptional low-light performance those
pixels those huge ultrapixels are
capturing a lot of light but the output
is a lot of well-lit pixels which are
basically noise and that's the problem
yeah yeah yeah it's over exposing
everything and it's cool i mean it's
cool that they figured it out but i feel
that the technology is still not there i
feel honestly that the only company
that's really figured it out now is
nokia yes yes I said it I feel that the
only kind of that's figured it out right
now is nokia oh you're ready they have
it until they get it in a slimmer phone
tony is gonna hit me over this but I
don't want the 808 PureView because it's
three inches thick you know I don't want
that I I agree with you totally but the
the 8-week review was a proof of concept
phone it was this is the order you want
two megapixel let me switch the camera
over to me this is this is a
41-megapixel sensor now imagine how
thinner this would be if this would be a
16 megapixel sensor yeah but I wasn't
gonna bow down to me from 16 let me let
me interrupt you for a second the event
is over as of this moment the hands on
tables are full of I don't know they
don't look time when these girls oh I
don't know where they're from but the
event is full of people that are going
to show off the galaxy s4 now we have
Michael Fisher we have Brandon minimun
at the event right now we will
definitely have a lot of hands-on
coverage so stay tuned but please
continue the fictional tacos really i
really want to hear about hear this from
Tony I got the question Taylor so how it
will how it will great that super pixel
x over sampling well it's easy right now
the 41-megapixel sensor is over sampling
as in down sampling for 41 megapixels
2825 or two three
that means a ratio of you guys do the
math I'm just saying numbers 8242 I
don't know how much if this would be a
16 megapixel sensor then this would
probably be able to have sharp images
delivered in a 4 megapixel outfit so
then the output would be a 4 megapixel
image using super pixels and they form a
capital image using ultrapixels which
one do you guess will be better super
poor so that's it all gets back to the
object HTC One but doesn't do any it
depends vs. actually you know it depends
on the size of the sensor though and and
how big those actual pixels are how big
that the individual pixels to relate to
on the sensor itself so are they two
micron pixels or you know because
because that's what HTC is banking on is
having a sensor the same size as an
eight megapixel sensor but the output is
only 4 megapixels so yeah it would
really depend on that end of the day as
to how much light you're gonna bring in
and and things like that but I totally
agree yeah and here here's the point for
everybody that must be just hating us
right now for those of you that say that
megapixels don't matter um in the times
when your monitor was 800 x 600 you were
right um but the new tendency is to go
retina all monitors are going for higher
resolution on tablets and on phones and
on computers it's the pixel race right
now and if you're gonna buy a phone that
you're gonna be caring for the next two
years two years think about that with a
4 megapixel sensor that's probably gonna
be obsolete by the next year the utmost
then it's not already obsolete if it's
not already obsolete so why couldn't
they bring you know in my opinion was
like okay HTC tell you what the
ultrapixel concept is great let's just
just bring that back when you are able
to do that with 8 megapixels at least 8
megapixels yeah that's kind of the
standard in smartphones today is eight
if you don't have an 8 megapixel camera
you're a budget device you're a budget
phone you are not a
ship the product assistant I redid that
with 8 megapixels the sensor itself
would have to be double the size so you
would have you would effectively have a
sensor a 16 megapixel sensor only
outputting at eight megapixels that's
exactly what you would have met that
would be perfectly acceptable if that
output it would be a downsampled image
of that 16 meta so for every 2 pixels it
will create one pixel for sharper images
for better contrast but it's not the way
it works on the HTC One right right hey
and then again you know going back to
the galaxy s3 I've galaxy s4 sorry I am
to say before you have to worry you some
interchangeably okay you know HTC does a
lot of bold moves but for example you
know that 8 megapixel camera you know
it's currently an industry standard but
it was started by HTC of the 1st Lt
phone the first wimax phone the first
phone that's fully aluminum that Tony's
holding the first phone with dual
speakers which is smart I mean HTC has
done a lot of bold bets were they the
first 3d or was that don't you know do
it LG is first on a lot of things as
well because they were the first with a
dual core smartphone yeah they were the
first with the first comparing the first
on HTC and LG at least in my in my
looking at things HTC has been first
more things that have stuck and that
more people emulate than LG has judy was
awful three day was awful well as LG was
the first with 3d also i'm referring to
the galaxy s4 moving forward i'm going
to call it the galaxy 3s so the galaxy s
3 s 3 s and this is a good thing that
you brought this up because i want to
take this opportunity to ask each and
every one of you too I don't know maybe
tell me your opinions tell me and
everybody who's watching your opinions
about what we've seen officially at what
we've heard today does it impress you a
conclusion if you will let's start with
Jaime uh so far I would say that the
galaxy s4 is gonna be my next daily
driver it's because of the fact that I'm
gonna most likely have to pay for it and
I would rather get non compromise for my
money you know it's not I I don't see
the galaxy s4 design is awful it's just
not
as sexy as the HTC One but at the end of
the day you know a phone after the two
or three months of use doesn't look sexy
anymore anyways um so for me I would
rather have a phone in which I don't
want to be at the beach and be like oh
man I wish I would have brought this
phone because I'm carrying this other
one that has a terrible camera or I'm
carrying this other one that doesn't
have this or I don't have expandable
storage or this and this and that this
is just me I prefer a phone for no
compromise for my money I am in the
perspective of the person that's gonna
pay for this phone for two years after
two for two years for contracts so for
those owners of the galaxy s3 there is
no reason for you to upgrade there is no
reason for you to upgrade the galaxy s4
looks identical to the s3 it's got a but
it's got better everything but it's not
like if you're down on the road right
now at the s3 most likely the galaxy s
mini will die the s3 mini and the s3
will probably remain as the cheekbone
force for a while and then the s4 will
be the high end so there's really no
need to upgrade so and they'll get us
don't get us wrong I'm sorry for
interrupting we said exactly the same
thing about the iphone 4 and the iphone
4s yeah yeah yeah you know they were
there 145 yeah there was no reason so in
my my conclusions and bottom line is if
it's my money if it's gonna go for
two-year contract I would rather go for
the s4 that's me by the way not
necessarily i prefer the HTC One in
design but that's really pointless if
the phone is not gonna give me
everything that I want just for a pretty
design that's me oh hi Joe how about you
Joe so if you're using an sgs2 right now
and your contract is getting close to
when you can upgrade skip over the three
go to the four that's that's an absolute
no brainer move you'll love it it'll be
great or go to the HTC either one but if
you're on an sgs3 I didn't see anything
in this presentation that would make me
want to move from the three up to the
for the four is iterative it's got some
new improvements in the software some
additions that probably going to take a
little while to to vet out and to shake
the bugs out and there's going to be
some updates to them no doubt so
if you're on the three right now wait
for the SGS five and let's not forget
that probably all the software features
from the s4 will at one point either
officially or from from the front the
community come to the s3 you got
probably come to the community before
the S 4 hits the market but car maybe
they're probably already there but yeah
if you've got if you've got a device to
sell like Samsung does you're not going
to release those new features out to the
sgs3 until after you have done the best
push that you can to sell all your new
device it's gonna be on the sgs4 for
good several months before we're gonna
hear anything official on the sgs3 or
that because updates take forever yeah
and I think I'll just because updates
stay forever I didn't believe it but
you're gonna drag their feet on purpose
anyway yes I think the only exception by
the bins hard interrupt would be that
covering finger thing because that would
require a different type of display
that's the reason why the s pen does not
work on the s3 by the way for those of
you that didn't know and I wonder if the
s pen works on this s4 with this new
technology that's really probably one of
the things that's cooking me the most
right now I want to know that this the S
Pen is inductive so if you don't have
basically induction beneath the screen
or I guess it might be actually a layer
above the screen I don't know exactly
but if you don't have that inductive
layer you can't use the S Pen no later
how about your conclusion your thoughts
on the sgs3 on the sgs3 s s yeah that's
sorry sgs3 s sg3 i don't know too many
guesses and threes but um only 13 but um
I'm kind of indifferent I didn't really
like the s3 to begin with um it didn't
impress me like I said before I feel it
it kind of resembles a feature phone or
one of Samsung's low end models it
doesn't look it doesn't have the appeal
of just a truly high-end device like the
One X this is one of my favorite design
phones ever i love this i picked it up
today and thought man if this just had
you know a better camera a better
battery life i would probably use it
still yeah now I'm kind of conflicted
and a lot of people probably call me a
hypocrite because I loved the note 2 I
absolutely loved the note 2 I don't like
the s3 and the differences between them
is really just sign here same here I
don't know what it is um that the harder
corners I don't know if it makes you
feel better I hate it and I completely
hate the nexus 10 right now but I loved
the note 8 point so we're in the same
boat yeah I don't know what it is and it
may be a society I don't know and maybe
a 5-inch s3 or s4 whatever they're the
same thing a 5 inch Galaxy S will change
my mind I won't know I'm gonna try it
I'll reserve my final opinion until
later but no I'm not impressed and I
agree with what every one of you have
said if you have an s3 there's no reason
to upgrade it's the same thing yeah what
about you Tony tell us about yeah well I
am I am deeply disappointed because I
see the same design but kidding aside
and design aside the samsung is
continuing to innovate and they've been
doing that for quite some time and
that's that's the thing which which got
them to the top of the Android food
chain they are right now dominating the
android market share and the s4 is a
great device if it's going to be an
upgrade from the s2 or if it's going to
be your first device if you're coming
from the s3 and you have to have an
update then go with the s4 but don't pay
for the s4 if you still can't live with
the s3 because of course the specs are
better but how much better incrementally
better is not enough because with jelly
bean all the systems are running
smoothly so it shouldn't be a problem as
far as I'm personally concerned I will
go this year with the HTC One okay I i
I'm really am eyeing the HTC one
developer edition same here but I don't
know I feel honestly you want me to
break the chain here I'm waiting for the
note 3 well those free will look exactly
like the s4 and like the note 2 i'm
waiting for the no Henry I am NOT lose
hope that the note 3 will have the same
exact design as the nexus tin I can tell
you the specs of the note 3 right now if
you wish it will have the same design as
the s4 as and like the amount to it will
have a full HD screen it will have an
Exynos 5 octa-core processor clucking at
a little bit higher speeds than the s4
it will have 2 gigs of ram s-pen and all
the functionalities on the s4 and that's
up here it is you heard it here first
yeah I think that that's gonna be the
case so far well bottom line and I guess
that's it's time to wrap it up we've
been live for an hour so far we really
appreciate for everybody to join us I
this was a you know obviously sans the
showmanship and all the tap dancing and
everything the tap dancing we got
everything that we were expecting we
pretty much got the phone that we
thought that we were gonna see it's
probably not the best thing out there
but i'm sure that samsung is gonna make
it the best thing out there with your
marketing that's just the way they
handled they're gonna push the marketing
hard yes and we have no notes go ahead
go ahead we had no doubts that it will
outsell the S free and it will be
probably the best selling phone the
wrestling android phone of all times but
yeah it's a long bitter also good if
that chinese site was correct it doesn't
have wireless charging neither and if it
does have wireless turning it's not
compatible with chi it was one of those
charging it will have wireless charging
via a additional cover at which you will
buy probably if you want from most
probably i will not buy it I just for me
if I keep at it for me if the charging
pad is bigger than the wire then for me
it's pointless but that's I'm when I'm
with you I know you guys love that thing
but but anyways to wrap it up thank you
very much for joining us at this live
stream of the galaxy s4 announcement so
far some of us love it some of us are
disappointed we really want to hear what
you think please there's a comment
section downstairs please let us know
what you think about the galaxy s4 is it
gonna be your next daily driver is it
really something you want I mean just
think about it you most probably have a
great phone already and probably the
galaxy s4 is not necessarily your best
bet it's very different to the times of
the galaxy s3 since the s2
was cool but it didn't have a 720p
display and sadly you know when it comes
to smartphone 720p and 1080p is really
not that big a difference on the phone
sadly it's cool but it's not that big a
difference so there are not significant
differences so far I think it's the
general consensus we have a lot of
content coming up we can't even stress
enough how much content we have coming
up with all the hands on that edited
that Michael and Brandon are gonna film
they've got a lot of phones with them
they've got their smartphone goody bag
so they're obviously gonna throw this
phone to everything right now so please
stay lock to our YouTube channel and our
front page because we are not going to
sleep everybody's got coffee here it's
like nine it's to 13 am here so you can
understand me yeah we are not going to
sleep we have a lot are actually our day
starts right now so please stay tuned to
the channel and please we expect to see
you there please share your comments
tell us what you think thank you so much
Adam you are over there trying to do
your best with with the network it's
it's been great up you know the event
looks really cool accents the tap
dancing but so far thank you very much
guys for for joining us again and let's
see what the galaxy s5 brings because
the rumors start right now for the
galaxy s5 anyways thank you very much
for watching and we will see you next
time hopefully bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
