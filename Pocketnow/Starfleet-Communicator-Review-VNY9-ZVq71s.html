thousands of kilometres no cellular
network needed can your mobile phone do
that I'm captain two phones this is
PocketNow it's April first 2260 and this
is our Starfleet communicator review the
Starfleet communicator of the 22 60s is
an essential piece of landing-party
equipment if you're selected to beam
down to a strange new world you'll want
this and your type 2 phaser at the ready
type 1 if discretion is called for the
communicator body is built from micro
mill duranium and other more classified
materials rugged enough for some rough
and tumble with a Gorn or a Klingon but
keep it away from androids with powerful
fists the metallic cover doubles as the
subspace antenna opening it also
automatically activates the
communicators transmit mode allowing you
to Hale other members of your team or
your orbiting starship the user
interface includes your channel selector
and volume and game controls which
include emergency modes for discrete
signaling in case of a condition green
situation the device makes use of
several notification LEDs to inform you
of such things as transporter lock
status the emergency channel selection
and power level remaining above the
control panel sits the transceiver
assembly those display also functions as
a signal meter the communicator is
powerful and advanced technology the
best Starfleet has to offer so the last
thing you want to do is leave this
device planetside among members of a
primitive Society okay so it's April
Fool's and Starfleet communicators don't
really exist not outside of Star Trek
anyway but the device we're showing here
is a legitimate custom built mobile
phone accessory and it's pretty cool no
April Fool's to build it an enterprising
Star Trek fan took an art asylum diamond
select communicator toy gutted it and
added a wholesale Bluetooth speakerphone
component inside the show the
speakerphone pairs with any Bluetooth
enabled mobile phone and it's controlled
by a button on the back of the unit
custom cut into the form of the
Starfleet logo the speakerphone port is
also custom drilled into the Starfleet
Arrowhead we're the 23rd century
versions magnetometry ssin area hmm
patch of velcro would be alongside a
very 21st century
mini USB port for charging the
communicator works fairly well in quiet
environments though performance varies
based on what phone is paired to callers
come through loud and clear but they
also frequently have trouble hearing us
especially if there's a lot of
background noise on the plus side the
battery lasts quite a while even after
three years of on and off use and the
Builder didn't skimp on details
despite the all new electronics inside
he was able to cram in a sound board
from a hallmark communicator ornament so
the communicators distinctive chirp
remains speaking of the Builder he's a
one-man operation and we weren't able to
get in touch with him for permission to
link to him before press time we're not
sure if he's building these anymore
we will drop his information in the
video description if and when he gives
us permission to share it in all the
custom-built Bluetooth communicator is a
mediocre performer as far as Bluetooth
speaker phones go especially for the
price you'll pay which back in 2010 was
between 200 and 300 dollars but for the
die-hard Star Trek fan it's hard to
think of a more perfect addition to the
collection or a more admirable promotion
of toy to collectible it remains a
cherished part of our collection that's
going to do it for our Starfleet
communicator review hope you enjoyed the
brief change of pace we are pocket now
