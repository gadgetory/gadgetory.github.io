good and bad numbers on a few fronts we
hear more details on when to expect the
next motorola and even walmart has
decided to launch its own payment system
I'm hi Mary Vanna and yeah I'm back in
New York I'm dealing with a lot of jet
lag but the t-shirts are back this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with acer there was a new
york city event today i was actually
part of it even though late because of
my flying but we've got a new liquids s+
smartphone that's mid-ranger in design
but again it's not really a bad phone
either in addition to a new alpha 12 a
tablet that looks a lot like the surface
pro but is actually better than the
tablet in more ways than not we also got
some very interesting gaming pcs and
laptops we have more details in the
likes of the description for those of
you that have been waiting for Sam
Zing's new stint into the 360-degree
cameras we've been waiting for that gear
360 for quite a while and we've got some
price points already it seems that at
least in Korea this camera is going to
cost 360 euros or the equivalent to such
which is kind of a crazy price tag I'm
not saying that the technology is not
really worth that much amount of money
the only thing is well not a cheap
camera anyways and it's sadly a project
that's still yet to be proven so it's
kind of hard to see that it will sell
but to pay we can't wait to get our
review in and until you more and
speaking of weird products a company
that just surprised this today with an
update to its application is Walmart the
company has just launched its own mobile
payment system it doesn't really work
the same way as the current ones we have
through NFC it actually works through QR
codes up in a way where you actually
scan what you're paying for sort of like
the way the starbucks application works
whenever you want to buy coffee it's not
really a bad idea obviously it just
brings more fragmentation to the market
but then again I like it very very sharp
said walmart are you and for those of
you that have been in the market for the
next motorola smartphone I know I do the
company CEO and we're talking about
lenovo CEO was recently on record
over what to extra for the company
coming soon and well he pretty much
teased everything according to him we
should expect something very hot in the
smartphone front to be announced on jun
9th so i would highly suggest you set
your calendars i do know that i want the
next moto x but then again all the links
we've seen our of the Moto G we'll see
and finally the very interesting news
that they have to do with a Microsoft
the company's quarter results are out
the company is well in revenue 20 point
five billion dollars and then when it
comes to profits 3.5 billion which is
decent but then when you can pair the
way the company is performing when it
comes to hardware well surface tablets
are up 61 percent and it makes a lot of
sense with the surface book this is
actually a very good computer that we
recommend but then again on the
smartphone front the company is
forty-six percent down compared to last
year which is crazy if you think about
the fact that last year at the same time
there was no real flagship to talk about
which leads me to the question of the
day hey what has kept you away from
windows 10 mobile visit the hardware's
at the software I'll be honest with you
in my case it's both I've had a windows
10 mobile smartphone in my drawer ever
since launch date I haven't even
activated it because of so many bugs on
Windows 10 addition to the sheep
hardware in the Lumia 950 and this is
from a guy that would love the Lumia 930
