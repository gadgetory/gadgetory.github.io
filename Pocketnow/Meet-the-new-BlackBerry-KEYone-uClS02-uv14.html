couldn't really tell you much about at
CES well we just spent some quality time
with it at MWC and now we've gotten more
than just the name I'm everywhere I will
target now and meet the BlackBerry t1
best way to describe the new BlackBerry
key1 starts with its purpose at a time
when most devices are becoming gigantic
for the sake of content consumption the
BlackBerry ki1 is a different breed
blackberry became famous two years ago
for making really secure and reliable
communicators and the key one is mainly
focused on serving this market as such
we have a phone designed around that
mentality the textured coating at the
back and a curved metallic trim that
makes it feel premium in the hand I mean
from simply holding it for the first
time you get the impression that this
phone can really take a beating match
this with a body that's narrower than
your standard smartphone and it's almost
unintentional that one and I drifted to
using this phone in one hand just
naturally below it there's the legacy
blackberry curity keyboard with 35 keys
that support capacitive touch in
addition to fingerprint scanner on the
space bar and since the primary focus of
a communicator is to help you remain
communicated all day PCL and BlackBerry
decided to go for a more power-efficient
Snapdragon 65 processor three gigs of
ram and 32 gigs of expandable storage in
addition to a whopping 3505 battery that
supports quick charge 3.0 now the area
where blackberry continues to
differentiate is in its software
experience surely we received the full
briefing on how this phone is secured at
a chip and femoral level but what's most
important for communication is really
the simplicity of its user interface as
such this device is running on the
latest version of Android 7.1 one unit
under a - skin that's unique to
blackberry and let's focus on helping
you access information faster apps like
the BlackBerry hub are here for all
messaging in one place and the VTech
application makes a return to give you
granular control over what applications
can access on your phone
now as much as many could care less
about the hardware keyboards there is a
lot of common sense here BlackBerry has
designed the crazy 52 shortcuts that you
can program with it meaning that if you
want to navigate home with Google Maps
you can simply program a key like the
letter H for example or calling someone
specifically by pressing and holding
another key or again simply start typing
on the keyboard to start a search
swiping up on the keyboard is still here
and you can select the text being
predicted by swiping on either of three
areas depending on where it's being
suggested and to make matters better
predictions are multilingual so even
that saves you the need to fumble around
language searching so the lights and
more we've got a 12 megapixel I am next
please 7/8 camera sensor with f/2
aperture at one point five five microns
and for those of you doing the math
because it's actually the same sensor
that we have on the Google pixel and in
addition to that we also have an 8
megapixel wide-angle selfie shooter to
complement that now whether all this
combo with features reaches that level
of the like that diehard blackberry fans
really loved about the company years ago
really depends on implementation and our
experience with devices like the
privilege and really the case even
though the BlackBerry D Tech lineup is a
different story
pricing is said to be aggressive at $449
or somewhere around there and we saw a
very snappy performer over
pre-production software which is a
really good thing so we will have to
wait for a final review over the next
few weeks as we hear that launch times
are happening early in q2 2017 while
that happens make sure you follow us on
social media and hit that subscribe

this one you can also follow me on
