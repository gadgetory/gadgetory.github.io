now Tony behind the camera we are at
Yoda phone we had the opportunity to see
their phone last year and now we're
going to see their new generation here
at mwc 2014 so this is the old
generation yotaphone that was launched
last year we saw it and this is the new
generation that will actually be
available in q4 2014 and this is one of
those projects that we want to succeed
and mainly because what else do you do
with the back of your phone if not to
complain about it whether it doesn't
matter what texture you have this is the
only phone that will allow you to
actually use your back for something
smart some of us carry ereader some of
us don't I am a particularly big reader
of ebooks and I have the problem that I
have to carry an extra device with me
now the good thing about this yotaphone
is that first of all this is a very
high-end device when it comes to
specifications we have a Snapdragon 800
processor 5-inch display that's full
that Super AMOLED and we have the
advantage that we've got two gigs of RAM
and 32 gigs of storage we have a 2500
milliamp hour battery for good for good
battery life and it's running android
4.4 point one kit kat now probably one
of the coolest things is again we have
this specific UI that allows us to use
the back of the screen now keep in mind
this is actually a developer product
meaning that developers can take
advantage of the yotaphone to enhance
the experience of their applications
meaning developers will have to use the
yota sdk for them to be able to enhance
their apps to be able to be exported
here and the cool thing about this phone
when compared to last year's models that
this one has a full touch screen so you
can for example read your news you can
see photographs it even has interactions
where for example you're taking a
photograph and it'll act as a camera
while you're taking that photograph and
ask other people to smile it's a really
really cool feature and the cool thing
about this is we have stock Android here
it performs really really well really
love the display but again what I like
the most is being able to enjoy more of
the phone at the back and the greatest
thing about it all is of your battery is
low and you're probably navigating with
google maps for whatever you have the
advantage you can actually continue
using the ePaper display of the ink
display sorry at the other side and not
frame your battery life all you're using
those key features that you need at the
end now about this
back screen this is a 4.7 inch display
that's a inc and probably the coolest
thing is that aside from the fact that
it's a touchscreen it is curved it feels
great in the hand I love the way that
its lands and it just looks Matt it's
great I'm you know in the five minutes
that I've been using it I love the
experience of reading with it and you
know to be honest with you this is
probably one of the products that I
would definitely want to review very
soon once it's available so this again
is high meadow a better from
pocketnow.com a quick hands on Tony
behind the camera this is the yotaphone
second-generation you will want to try
this phone out seriously see more very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
