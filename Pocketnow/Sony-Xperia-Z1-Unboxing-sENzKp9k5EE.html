now it's here in our own webs we're
going to analyze it compare it submerse
it and review it but first we're gonna
unbox it I'm Anthony Knight this is
PocketNow and you're watching the sony
xperia z1 unboxing here we have the
packaging and while we're breaking the
box free let's talk a bit about the
phone itself which was rumored a lot
before its official introduction of
course the quad-core Snapdragon 800
processor clocked at 2.2 gigahertz and
the 2 gigs of ram are impressive and so
is the water and dust proofing but what
we really like to see is the camera we
have a twenty point seven megapixel
shooter on this baby and sony claims it
to be quote the world's leading camera
in a smartphone we'll make sure to check
that statement out but here it is the
box of the Xperia z1 the Xperia Z
follow-up the front of the box is rather
clean with only an image of the device
but turning it to the back we see the
available colours and some call outs for
its key features like the camera sensor
and its technologies the display as well
as the processor nothing on the sides
except the make and model but let's see
what's in the box
staring at you from the side as you open
it is the device itself the Sony Xperia
z1 which we'll put to the side as usual
until we check out the rest of the
packaging and bundled accessories we
have all the usual stuff in here like
the USB cable for syncing and charging
the power adapter some literature which
we always advise you to read especially
if your phone is waterproof because you
have to know how to close all the flaps
in order to keep it waterproof and a
pair of premium looking headphones we'll
make sure to check specifically out the
sound quality for both the phone's
output as well as the headphones
themselves and some multi sized gels to
pick your ears in addition to a clip
which you can use to stabilize your
dangling cables and lock them onto your
clothes moving on to the phone we'll
switch to our special screen protector
peeling camp for some plastic unwrapping
action for the fans
you
sony has kept the sandwich glass
construction of the Xperia Z meaning
both the front and the back of the
device are made out of glass it looks
very good we'll give you that however
it's not all about the looks the Xperia
z1 is waterproof and dust resistant
rated ip55 and ip57 be kept under one
and a half meters which is close to five
feet of fresh water for up to 30 minutes
let's take a look around the z1
the right side holds the SIM card slot
with the flap for waterproofing right
below which you'll find the power button
then comes the volume rocker and further
down below there's something which would
really like to see on any thumb a
dedicated two-stage camera button for
focus and shutter oles the bottom edge
only features the speaker grille while
the left side has a docking station
connector which is magnetic a microUSB
syncing and charging port with its own
cover and the same goes for the micro SD
card slot up top the top has a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and you'll
notice the lack of a flat cover for it
Sony managed to make the phone
waterproof under the aforementioned IP
ratings while keeping the headphone port
uncovered the 20.7 megapixel camera pops
out on the glass back with the LED flash
below and I've seen logo indicates where
the contact point is and then the Sony
Xperia logos remind you of what phone
you're holding should you forget behind
the front glass there's a 5 inch full HD
display with triluminos technology from
the latest Sony TVs up top you can find
a 2 megapixel front fascia the usual
sensors as well as the notification
light let's put it up for the first time
and well it starts will remind you of
the specs 5 inch full HD display with
1920 by 1080 resolution 2 point 2
gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
800 processor 2 gigs of RAM 16 gigs of
internal storage expandable via microSD
card 20.7 megapixel main camera 2
megapixel webcam
Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi NFC GPS MHL support
and Android 4.2 jelly bean with a 3000
milliamp hour non removable battery
wrapping up the specs we're looking at a
waterproof IP x5 and ipx8 as well as
dust proof IP 5x enclosure construction
everyone we're going to have a lot more
coming on the Sony Xperia z1 including
comparisons analysis submersion and the
full review until then check out our
friends at club Dakota at UK who

usual social media channels a benign
