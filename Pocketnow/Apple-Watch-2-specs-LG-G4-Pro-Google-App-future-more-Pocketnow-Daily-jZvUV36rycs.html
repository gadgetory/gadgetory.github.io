points and more features we get the
possible specs of the LG g4 Pro and the
1+2 doesn't seem as affordable as we
thought I'm hi Mary Vera disliking the
whole fact that I'm in a country where
there's great summer and no Beach this
is pocket out daily the official news
should I start with the one plus two as
we kind of get an official statement
that's probably the oddest one we've
ever read but then again there's nothing
normal about 1 plus the company is
teasing that the price point of the
oneplus 2 will be superior to the
oneplus one because the Snapdragon 810
is a lot more expensive than the 801 so
apparently it'll cost more than three
hundred and twenty two dollars but
notice they say more than three hundred
and twenty two dollars that includes a
thousand dollars as well and no it's not
going to cost a thousand dollars i just
wish they would give us a specific price
point we'll keep you posted as we learn
more there is this very interesting
report coming from the information that
claims that google is working on this
new secret project that is apparently
focused on making your applications work
on the web work in the cloud in a way
for you not to need to download them but
that there are two sides of this catch
apparently they want you to stream
applications but given the fact that not
everybody can stream applications
because of the lack of permanent
internet then obviously there is a
challenge so apparently this is part of
a google search project where if you
want to search for something on facebook
it'll give you a facebook application
within google search for you to be able
to find what you're looking for so it
does make a lot of sense from the google
search standpoint we just don't know if
that'll ever happen to android
particularly and for all three of you
that are excited for this a blackberry
android phone don't raise your hands
please we've got some more rumors that
are not necessarily impelling we've been
hearing about great specs like a
snapdragon 808 three gigs of ram in
addition to everything else but
apparently this is more of a
budget-minded smartphone and all we can
think of now is the fact that well
blackberry launches a lot of phones and
it makes a lot of sense for the company
to launch more than just one blackberry
android phone apparently that will be
the plan going forward we will keep you
posted as we should learn more and more
rumors coming soon now one product to be
excited about is the LG g4 Pro we start
getting some specification leaks
apparently
this product is happening we've got a
quad HD 5 28 inch display in addition to
a Snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigs of ram
options for 32 and 64 gigs of expandable
storage and so much more but apparently
the design I just about everything is
just the bigger gee for which is great
even though we are hearing that there is
a 27 megapixel camera here hopefully it
gets the same aperture we will see soon
apparently Aoife is going to be the time
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day even though some people
are already returning their first
generation Apple watch out of boredom
and I'll probably join them it seems
that Apple is already working on the
Apple watch too which makes sense and
there are some significant changes here
number one a FaceTime camera and no
don't laugh yes a FaceTime camera we
don't know why but yeah apparently that
in addition to the fact that there are
some pricier price points it seems that
Apple wants to focus on the one thousand
to ten thousand dollar market oddly at a
time when everybody figured that the
Apple watch was too expensive and for
those of you that are waiting for this
product to launch in 2015 well
apparently it will happen in 2016 as a
Apple will probably just add some more
watch bands in their September or
october event but yet it seems that the
apple watch will be this it seems that
yeah there will be a better built in
Wi-Fi to make it less dependable to the
iphone but it leads me to the question
of the day what would apple lead to do
for you to want to buy an Apple watch
too because in my case I would need a
circular design or something as hot as
the Moto 360 in my opinion but leave us
a comment down below what is your case
and you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video
was filming she follow us i'm talking
