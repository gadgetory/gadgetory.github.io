information on your lock screen in
widgets unfortunately if you want a lot
of information you have to have a lot of
lock screens across a lot of panels that
kind of defeats the purpose or you can
put them all into one but there aren't
that many widgets that let you do that
I'm Joe Levi for PocketNow and I've got
another option just to replace your lock
screen with C lock screen and get it all
in one this is my Nexus 4 and when I
turn it on you'll notice I've got a new
lock screen this lock screen is showing
me what time it is what the day of the
week is the date the time in 24 hour
clock because that's how I like it even
the weather and it lets me control my
music it's also got this little lock
down here that I can pick and drag to
whatever I want so I can quickly of this
stuff even the weather up here let's go
ahead and just unlock it that takes me
to my home screen from here you can see
I've got a couple of widgets installed
now these widgets are see widget and
they're kind of a companion to the C
lock screen that you just saw there
let's go ahead and lock again well
unlock and we're back here we can come
all the way around launch our camera our
flashlight YouTube our default web
browser Google Maps or mail client the
dialer and like I said just unlock like
that jump right into you know whatever
we want really kind of cool down here at
the bottom you can also see what our
battery status is that doubles as some
extra real estate so we can come down
here and drag our lock on that and get
to the lock screen settings so on this
screen we can enable or disable the lock
screen this does not turn on and off
your stock lock screen if you want this
to replace it you have to go into your
settings come right over in here and
from settings go to security and in
security change your screen lock to none
now I know that sounds kind of silly
because hey aren't we talking about this
screen lock well yes we are but this
screen lock is just a widget that takes
that place it's not the default built in
stock lock screen and as such it doesn't
have a lot of the added security just
something to keep in mind
we can go in and check the display we
can hide the status bar which is what
I've done it does not come defaulted
that way you can also choose your
homescreen wallpaper choose a picture
from your gallery or just mix some
colors together show or hide missed
calls show or hide the media buttons go
ahead and hide those for now those will
show up when your music is playing so if
you want to have a cleaner play screen
or a clean the lock screen that doesn't
have those play buttons and whatnot on
it except when there's music playing you
can do that too relatively easy show and
hide the square blinking indicator on
the lock screen that gets kind of
annoying after time in my opinion so
I'll turn it off show and hide the
battery information I like that there
and then enable or disable vibration
when dragging the icon on the screen so
when you pick and drag over one of those
hotspots it will vibrate to let you know
that you're there and you can do what
you want with it you can launch that
just by letting go you can change your
clock settings you can change your app
shortcuts to whatever you want and quick
revert back to default if you want to do
that if you've installed that C widget
you can also have lockscreen weather
right here now this is a free app both
widget and the lock screen so it is paid
for by ads that you'll see down on the
bottom of your settings I haven't seen
them anywhere else so it seems like a
small price to pay so as you can see now
I've got my system wallpaper on there
it's a little bit hard to read but
that's because I chose to have my system
wallpaper on there you could pick a
different wallpaper to make it easier or
even change the colors see lock screen
is available for free in the Google Play
Store for Android version 4.0 and up if
you liked what you saw here please give
the video a thumbs up and while you're
at it why not tell your friends about
pocket now on Facebook Twitter or even
Google Plus pocket now showing off cool
apps I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
