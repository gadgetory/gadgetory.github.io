flagship from last year the galaxy s3 is
defying all odds by still being one of
the most popular handsets on the market
how can it compete with devices like the
Xperia Z though I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is the Sony Xperia
Z versus the Samsung Galaxy s3 both the
Android flagship models the Xperia Z by
Sony and Samsung Galaxy s3 are two
totally different devices both in design
and software with the galaxy s3 Samsung
is all about the user experience it's
designed for humans but is inspired by
nature it's cues from nature are evident
in its design and its software the wide
radius corners resemble that of a smooth
pebble and all throughout the software
there are cues from nature as well such
as water droplet sounds on the
lockscreen and scenic wallpapers the
Xperia Z by Sony is a complete 180 from
that it's hard edges and sharp corners
give it a much more industrial design
and as software doesn't have nearly as
much inspiration or imagination behind
it it's all about the Sony experience
and that's not necessarily a bad thing
it gives a much more true to its roots
Android experience than TouchWiz and
feels much more like the stock interface
although there are some customizations
put in place by Sony for anyone looking
for a one-handed phone the Samsung
Galaxy s3 is the better of these two
it's rounded back and slightly tapered
edges make it slide to the center of
your palm and it sits comfortably there
it's notably smaller than the Xperia Z
and s button layout makes it easy to use
either left or right-handed the power
button if you're right-handed sits right
below your thumb and your volume rocker
sits below your index and middle finger
if you're left-handed the volume rocker
sits right where your thumb should sit
and the power button is either under
your index finger or middle finger with
the sharp edges and hard corners the
Xperia C is not nearly as comfortable in
the hand and its 5-inch display makes it
a little larger too which may make it
unwieldy for anyone with smaller hands
the button placement is really awkward
as well if you hold the device with your
left hand the power button rest right on
to your index finger or middle finger
and the volume rocker is under your
middle finger or your ring finger if you
hold the device with your right hand the
volume rocker sits right under where
your palm should be sitting and the
power button you have to extend your
thumb downward or shift your grip so it
makes the device feel a little awkward
to hold and it's not really easy to use
one-handed
the true difference between these two
devices is the materials they're made of
and how well they're built the Galaxy s3
is made of pretty much all plastic or
polycarbonate with a hyper gloss finish
it feels very lightweight and it has a
faux metal trim around the edges it
looks cheap fills cheap and it doesn't
feel substantial in the hand its durable
and it fills as such but it doesn't feel
that great it doesn't feel like a high
quality flagship device the Xperia Z on
the other hand has a clasp on both the
front and the back the front is dragon
trail glass and the back is Gorilla
Glass and around the edges it has a blue
metallic trim and around the outside it
has a high quality plastic with a matte
finish that gives it a grippy feel it
feels much more substantial and
high-quality in the head and hands down
it wins in the design department
although a little older now these
Samsung Galaxy s3 still has decent
specifications on the front it has a
four point eight inch HD Super AMOLED
display at 720p resolution and there are
two different versions beyond that there
are US versions for AT&amp;amp;T Sprint Verizon
t-mobile and regional carriers and then
there's the international version the
difference between those is the 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
processor for the u.s. variants and the
1.4 gigahertz quad core Exynos chipset
for the international version the US
versions also have 2 gigabytes of RAM
versus the 1 gigabyte of RAM in all
other variants beyond that the
specifications for all the models are
pretty much the same it has either 16 32
or 64 gigabytes of built-in storage an 8
megapixel camera and a 2100 milliamp
hour battery the Xperia Z on the other
hand has a 5-inch 1080p reality display
a 13.1 megapixel camera 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage 2 gigabytes of RAM a
microSD card slot a 2330 million power
battery and a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset but the Xperia
Z is also waterproof and dustproof it
has a rating of ip55 and ip57 to keep
the elements out the downside to
waterproofing and dust proofing on the
Xperia Z is the need for covers over all
of your ports the headphone jack the
microUSB port the micro SD card slot and
the micro SIM slot all have watertight
gasket covers over them
although the Xperia Z has a slight
advantage in specifications there's one
area where these two smartphones truly
Duke it out and that's displays the
Xperia Z clearly has an edge when it
comes to displays considering it has a
5-inch 1080p display this display is
larger
has a higher resolution and likewise has
a higher pixel density however the
contrast levels of the Xperia Z's
display are noticeably lower than that
of the galaxy s3 Super AMOLED panel and
the next part saturation is a little bit
subjective it depends on whether you
like super saturated colors or you like
something a little more accurate the
galaxy s3 Super AMOLED panel is
notorious for super saturating colors
making yellows seem more orange or pink
seem more red but the Xperia Z's display
seems a little washed out considering
that contrast level is low blacks seem
slightly gray and only galaxy s 3d those
blacks look very inky at the end of the
day it comes down to whether you want a
larger display at a higher density or a
more moderate sized phone with
supersaturated colors there was a pretty
stark contrast some one another so
choosing your favorite shouldn't be
terribly difficult so in terms of
hardware it is a near landslide victory
for the Sony Xperia Z but how does it
fare in software let's find out but
simply the Xperia Z's software should be
familiar to anyone who's used to Sony
product before and an Android device
think of the two as being combined into
one icons are taken from other Sony
products such as their televisions or
Playstation 3 and save for some widgets
wallpapers and the way some things are
done such as applying those widgets
icons and wallpapers to your home screen
the experience feels very much like the
stock Android experience and there are a
ton of differences between TouchWiz and
Sony's custom interface for example
adding a widget to your home screen
using TouchWiz is now a hybrid between
the new method in jellybean and the old
method in Gingerbread simply long press
on your home screen which is the old
Gingerbread method select apps and
widgets and you choose either between
your apps and widgets tab to add either
an app or widget which is the new jelly
bean and Ice Cream Sandwich method the
method on the Xperia Z however is almost
a direct copy of the old TouchWiz method
which is your long press on your
homescreen and a bar at the bottom will
pop up allowing you to choose between
either applications widgets wallpapers
and themes it's a bit ironic to say the
least an area where these two are kind
of similar however is the notification
shade when you pull down the shade you
have quick access to toggles Wi-Fi GPS
Bluetooth mobile data connection etc but
using TouchWiz you get more options you
get two pages of these two toggles and
you have a brightness slider right there
in the
shade using Sony's customizations you
only get four quick toggles and then a
shortcut to the settings application as
far as extended software features go
beyond theming icons and other
customizations the Xperia Z comes with
Playstation certification screen
mirroring and power management software
these extended software features are
where Samsung truly sets its devices
apart you get features such as blocking
mode smart stay smart rotation a power
saving mode multi window pop-up browser
pop-up video and many more these ample
settings and features really add to the
experience on the galaxy s3 these are
the things that make the lackluster
hardware and the dating specifications
really kind of melt away you forget
about them because the software really
makes up for all of the hardware
shortcomings when it comes to
performance these two devices are pretty
evenly matched they both have quad core
processors clocked at 1.4 and 1.5
gigahertz the difference in daily usage
is pretty negligible on the galaxy s3
there's little to no stuttering when
scrolling between home pages and pulling
down the notification shade switching
between applications and the same could
be said for the Xperia Z there's a
little lag and stuttering on the Xperia
Z that I've noticed but it's not that
much it's very minor but if benchmarks
are your thing the Xperia Z is an
absolute benchmark beast using the
quadrant standard benchmark the Xperia Z
scored at seven eight for one versus the
galaxy s3s five nine zero three and
using an two to the experience he scored
a staggering eighteen nine one nine
almost 19,000 versus the galaxy s3s 15
eight nine five just shy of sixteen
thousand the Xperia Z blew through these
benchmarks pretty easily but using
SunSpider to test the browser speeds the
galaxy s3 using the stock TouchWiz
browser scored an eleven ninety nine
versus the Chrome browser which is the
stock browser on the Xperia C scoring a
1355 the lower number of course being
the better number all in all both of
these devices are powerhouses they both
have quad-core processors and they're
capable of maintaining a solid
consistent experience on the home
screens during video playback and in
gaming one area the galaxy s3 has
remained almost uncontained 'add in the
android market is cameras image sensing
it is regarded to have one of the best
image sensors on an android smartphone
to date but how does it stack up against
the thirteen point one megapixel camera
on the Xperia Z quite well actually
when outside pictures taken with the
galaxy s3 tend to be a little
and it's quick to overexpose and the
Xperia Z's camera airs on the side of
too warm but it offers a wider angle
shot to be fair the wider angle shot at
16:9 aspect ratio is actually only at 9
megapixels it steps down from 12
megapixels at a 4:3 aspect ratio to 9 at
a 16:9 you can't actually use all 13.1
megapixels and the experiencies camera
but outside when lighting is favorable
the Xperia Z's camera has a clear
advantage it produces more accurate and
detailed images when you move inside
when the lighting isn't quite as nice
the two seem to be on a more level
playing field the galaxy s3 clearly
doesn't over expose as much both seem to
be on par in color reproduction lighting
contrast etc all in all I have to give
the win as far as image sensing goes to
the Xperia Z outside in a general
shooting it seems to be more accurate
although the build quality of the galaxy
s3 isn't exactly amazing or outstanding
the software features more than make up
for that and that makes it a more
well-rounded device but if what you're
looking for is a device with an
extremely high resolution display setup
for raw power and performance excellent
build quality and a great camera the
Xperia Z is more your speed so that
