pocket now calm and our initial unboxing
video of the samsung transform we were
able to give you a brief look at the
actual hardware of this device well in
this video we're going to go deeper and
get the nitty gritty and some of the
hard specs of what makes up the samsung
transform we're also going to compare it
side-by-side to at the end of the video
to the big brother the samsung epic 4g
so let's begin all right now the first
thing you're going to see when you look
at the samsung transform is actually a
front facing camera here right above the
Sprint logo and toward the bottom you're
going to see your standard for
capacitive android buttons that is your
menu home back and search key now moving
right on to the side here the right side
we're going to see a dedicated camera
button which is always a nice addition
to have because that makes taking
pictures on a touchscreen much easier
we're going to have a dedicated voice
activated or command voice command
button moving on from there you're going
to have your power / lock screen switch
the top of the device will have your 3.5
inch or a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and you're going to have what samsung is
kind of started to include now on every
device which is actually very cool it is
a sliding mechanism door for the micro
USB port and what that basically means
you're not going to damage that port
because you're actually at protection
now as you see there it actually clicks
into place moving to the left side of
the device you're going to of course
have your volume rocker up and down it's
going to do it for that side and the
bottom will have your mic port as well
as actually a little spot where you can
put your fingernail in to get to the
battery which we will see next before we
do look at that though we want to
actually flip over to the back of the
device and you'll see a 3 megapixel
camera with an LED flash this of course
has the sliding keyboard which makes us
a different alternative from some of the
other touchscreen devices that are on
spring and the other carriers out there
now as you'll see the keys are very
evenly spaced and they're actually a
soft key it's almost like a gel but it
does provide a good amount of tactile
feedback it does click with every key
that you hit so you do get that feedback
that it is in fact working now before we
do take off the battery the last thing
we want to talk about here is actually
the screen it is a 3.5 inch screen
with a resolution of 320 x 480 and that
is an LCD screen it's not a super amoled
or anything too special in that case but
it's not the bottom of the barrel now
lastly it does also have a 800 megahertz
processor as well as 256 megabytes of
RAM and 512 megabytes of ROM now it's
going to get to the battery by actually
prying off that back panel there you're
going to see your typical Samsung 1,500
milliamp hour battery which will
actually provide you at least of what
it's rated to provide you is six hours
talktime as well as 350 hours standby
time then let's does have a microSD port
this will come with a 2 gigabyte microSD
card included but it's compatible up to
a 32 gigabyte microSD card lastly as far
as the connectivity options go you're
going to have the bluetooth 3.0 that's
going to be there as well as Wi-Fi be
Angie so the typical connectivity
options are here with this device now
the device weighs actually five point
three seven ounces which is actually
hundred fifty two grams if you're able
to convert that very quickly which is
much smaller than the samsung epic 4g we
actually have a 4g here with us we can
do a direct comparison so what we'll do
is we'll actually zoom out here a little
bit and bring the samsung epic 4g in
side-by-side now the epic 4g is the
bigger brother to this device it has a
faster processor it also has the 4g
hence the name and the first thing
you're going to notice is actually the
screen difference here this screen is
actually a black or a blue or this is
the typical almost like a graphite
appearance and that is because this is
an LCD screen where's this is a super
amoled screen but where the transform
really shines is actually going to be
just in the overall size in terms of the
thickness it's very tough to tell here
but they are actually pretty much right
on par the transformer is actually a
little smaller than the epic 4g now of
course these size is a very different
story so if you're looking for a smaller
device when it's easier to hold in the
hand is not going to take up too much
space in your pocket the transformer is
definitely a viable alternative in that
case but will do actually slide open
these keyboards and show you the two
different differences in the keyboards
and as you can see they're the top
keyboard is going to be your epic 4g so
it has the extra row whereas the bottom
will have the transforms keyboard now
looking at these two side-by-side it's
actually somewhat easier to type on the
transform only because those keys are a
little recessed so it makes it harder to
have a typo as well as you get that
softer appearance so your fingers will
actually grip to the keys whereas these
are of hard plastic on the epic 4g now
in terms of these screens of course
these are both capacitive screens these
are actually both set on automatic
brightness right now one thing you're
going to notice is that the epic 4g is a
much brighter screen now what we have
found is that the epic 4g is also a more
responsive screen it tends to be a
little difficult here to actually get
you know exact details with the screen
sometimes scrolling through will
actually render a false click on some of
the different shortcuts so this has been
our hardware overview of the samsung
transform as well as the direct
comparison to its bigger brother the
samsung epic 4g as always thank you very
much for watching everyone our next
video will actually be the software
overview part 2 we're actually going to
compare some of the browser test speeds
as well as the YouTube application
speeds to the epic 4g here as always
please give us a thumbs up if you liked
this video and stay tuned for the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
