calm we're on the car today at the test
out HTC's new locations at this is a gps
navigation program for HTC windows phone
7 devices let's check it out okay so
here we have HTC locations and one first
starts up you're going to see a couple
little bubbles with texts that explain a
few of the buttons so you can learn how
to how to use it so right now we have a
map screen here and if you tap it it'll
go to the map you have some buttons you
can do directions search download maps
let's go to here's our map download so
you can download a map data for offline
usage and let's show you which countries
we can do
and let's compare it with the Anokhi
drive
so you see by continent here and we see
also by content in here Asia Europe
so we see a lot of the same countries so
it looks like we're pretty covered both
on HTC and nokia maps and now HTC has a
panoramic view so we can quickly go to
the recent locations over there and
footprints which are kind of like
favorites but you can add pictures
here's a new favorite a new footprint
rather so there's your title you can add
a voice memo and put it in a category
and you can take a picture if you want a
picture for your location favorite enoki
drives interface is a lot different much
more simple all we really have is a set
destination button and then you can do
search
over here we have a search
and we have the phone number we can call
we can see what's nearby we can just
show it on the map you see everything
here we can add a footprint with a
picture and everything we can share it
and we can drive to it your route has
been calculated after 100 meters let's
see how it goes
that's give me some good voice prompts
for directions I'm going to turn right
instead of left and we'll see it
recalculate didn't recalculate yet now
Joe right there we go
now what happens if I am in a different
program after 300 meters turn right
voice prompts finish but it doesn't keep
going
so you have to swap back into the app to
get the directions back
now another thing that neither these do
is integrate with vain search or bing
maps so say I found a location using
bein or local search or bing maps
ideally a GPS navigation program would
have a navigate to button here or it
would show up in the apps listing so
that you can really easily just start at
navigation to the allocation
unfortunately HTC locations does not
show up here neither does nokia drive so
that's kind of a pain it's seems like an
easy thing to do
and you see it has to recalculate the
route after 150 meters turn right but we
have a good display of information here
so looks pretty good
now let's go to settings we have
automatic map language we have units as
metric let's make that p real you can
choose different colors for the map well
no just night colors or day colors and
we have options for voting different
types of roads and fairies and what not
there so that's pretty good we also have
alarms for speed cameras as well as if
you are going over the speed limit
there's your other options and that's it
and while driving HTC also has a cool
feature that will tell you which lane to
get into before you turn so that's
really helpful we don't have that on
nokia drive overall I think the winner
here is HTC's navigation program it has
a few extra features that really work
well so that's our look at HTC locations
give us a thumbs up like this video and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
