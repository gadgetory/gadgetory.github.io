pocket now calm the promise of real-time
video chat over our mobile phones is
somewhat unfulfilled
we've got FaceTime which will only work
over Wi-Fi and it only works with Apple
devices we've got quick which works
pretty well over Android and some other
platforms but not everyone is a quick
account and then there is Skype the
mother of them all everyone's got a
Skype account and it is finally being
rolled out in an on beta version that
will work on Android phones to take
advantage of your front-facing camera as
long as you have a higher-end Android
phone running Gingerbread and in this
video we're going to test the non beta
final version of Skype with the video
chat built right in should be pretty
cool let's get to it
okay so let's get started previously we
tested this version of Skype in the beta
form on the HTC Thunderbolt back many
months ago they've been working on this
for a very long time and now it's ready
to test so we're going to call Tony here
and see how it works so there's my face
there's the beautiful light on the
ceiling and there's the camera and
something's going to happen I hear him
and I see him oh hey Tony oh very good
so so the video quality is quite good
we've got an annoying reflection your
output the tilt the device down and you
can move the little thumbnail preview of
yourself around on the screen or you can
actually minimize it altogether if you
realize you don't want to see yourself
you just want to see the other person
yeah and the the video quality is quite
good you're over Wi-Fi right Tony oh
yeah actually I connected directly from
the desktop so I'm talking to you from
my PC and I believe you're talking to me
from your phone oh so he's on his PC and
I'm on the phone right now and it's it's
it's working quite well we're going to
test this over HSPA+ and let you know
what the results will be but obviously
it'll be slower a little bit more choppy
but probably good enough and and
certainly the the audio is coming
through quite clearly I'm about two feet
away from the device it's picking up the
audio and then coming through quite
clearly can you can you also switch it
to handset mode so that you don't have
to hold your phone in front of you so
you can put it to your head let's see so
let's see what options we have we've got
mute this button which will turn on the
back camera or turn off a video that
will enable the preview window and the
menu button will put you on hold so no
there's there's really there are really
no options here to be able to use
handset mode although if I would have
made this call as a audio call I think
those options would have existed very
good so Skype for skype Final Four for
Android looks to be pretty good and a
it's it's fulfilling its promise for
video chat over mobile devices you know
what's funny I've tried this end on my
Android 2.2 Froyo HTC Desire and attract
placing a audio call to that service
which is coming from Skype the audio
testing service and I could hear barely
almost every sixth word so it was awful
and I was over Wi-Fi and it's so strange
what isn't isn't the requirement for
this to work to have Gingerbread
although you're making an audio call so
it shouldn't have any even matters yeah
also those video calls on on Froyo to
but it works only with the bad camera
regardless if you have a webcam or not
but but the audio quality was was awful
maybe I should try to get maybe I had a
bad connection that is possible curious
to see what other people think if you're
out there trying this on Android let us
know what you think of the quality of
the video quality of the audio quality
let us know which device you have and
how it's working so thanks Tony for the
call and catch you later Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
