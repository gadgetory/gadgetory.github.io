from the Google Play Store trust me
you're not alone no Nexus 7 tablet
already running into a lot of bugs and
investors to Microsoft over the surface
RT I'm hina Rivera and let the record
show that the reason why there are no
iphone 5c rumors of this video is
because i'm bored of them this is pocket
now daily thats starts day off with the
sort of official news as Motorola's
adviser Guy Kawasaki has just confirmed
that they will be selling the Moto X on
the Google Play Store and the reason why
this is odd is because for those of you
that were expecting for there to be a
google edition of the Moto X actually
that's not necessarily gonna be the case
apparently there will only be the
official Moto X being sold on the Google
Play stores and other means to sell the
phone and not necessarily to different
types of phones that you could choose
from though obviously that is still not
finally confirmed let's stay tuned even
though I'm sure none of you want to pay
650 bucks for Moto X anyways that's me
of the google play store for those of
you that are having this horrible issue
of package file and valid every time you
trying to install an application on your
tablet or phone well you're not alone
i'm having exactly the same problem on
my first generation Nexus 7 as it turns
out google has just acknowledged that
the problem exists that they know that
there is a problem at Google Play Store
but the problem is they're not actually
telling us when they're gonna fix it so
expect for there to be some sort of a
fix eventually though we're still not
sure if that's hardware related or does
it have to do with the Google Play Store
to stay tuned for that and speaking of
Nexus 7's or at least the new generation
tablet well the bad luck of early
adopters continues as people are already
confirming that they have problems with
their GPS and they are also having
problems with multi-touch on the tablet
and pretty much makes it unusable in
certain times google has also
acknowledged that they know about this
issue but again they're not confirming
when they're going to fix it so stay
tuned as if this is a software issue
they'll most probably send the patch
some time now for those of you wondering
why HTC is not bringing us any more
compelling windows phones as they have
in previous years well kind of the
reason for that is because apparently
the company is backing away from the
platform according to trusted sources
and the reason why is because they feel
that Nokia is doing a better job selling
windows phones when actually
the real truth is that nokia's doing a
better job building better
differentiated windows phones than HTC
lately still it's really hard to see
that the manufacturer that pretty much
started the whole windows phone thing
back in the days of the pocket pc HTC is
an odm is moving away but anyways we'll
see how that goes and finally for the
sad news of the day if you thought that
losing Windows Phone Oh Williams who's
Microsoft's only problem trust me that's
actually the smallest one the company is
being sued over the surface and the
reason why is because according to
investors the company knew well ahead of
travel was not selling well and did not
let investors know about the overstock
until three months later and obviously
there are lots of losses right there and
investors feel that they were cheated on
with this whole surface project as the
company probably overlooked how well
that tablet was gonna sell in the end so
anyways we don't know how this is gonna
play out but that leads you to the
question of the day what do you think
that Microsoft should do with all these
tablets that they have there an
overstock what do you think that they
should do with them in my particular
case I mean if they're having trouble
with people liking when those are to
your liking Windows 8 why not sell those
things at a hundred bucks apiece get the
platform out there and get people to
like them so that developers could jump
on the wagon and build more applications
for the surface RT particularly I think
that's probably one of the best
solutions I mean you're losing money
anyways but the overstock I mean why not
just make money somehow at least not
necessarily from the tablets leave us a
