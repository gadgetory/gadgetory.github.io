pocketnow.com and if you remember in the
last video where we compared upper
mobile 9.52 skyfire skyfire was much
faster now we're going to compare
skyfire to probably a more close
competitor opera mini both skyfire and
opera mini render the the web web site
on the server of the company and then
sends it down to your device whereas
opera mobile renders everything right on
your device so let's see which of these
two is faster we're trying to find the
fastest mobile browser that you can have
in Windows Mobile so here I've got the
HTC touch pro again and I'm going to
time launching both programs and we're
going to go to different websites let's
start with skyfire and see how long it
takes to launch and then we'll compare
it to opera mini go
okay that was about eight seconds and
let's go to the wall street journal com
so wsj.com and when a click go and start
and there it is it was about six seconds
and next we're going to go to adobe com
which I know has some flash content
there okay let's hide the keyboard and
go
and it's done at about six seconds again
and there comes the Flash content coming
up on the screen so we'll call it about
seven seconds okay so let's take a look
at opera mini now now in order to launch
opera mini you have to first go into the
java java application and launch it from
there so i'm going to include that in
the time that it takes to open the
program remember skyfire opened in about
six seven seconds so let me start upper
mini okay that was about five seconds so
faster than skyfire and let's go to Wall
Street Journal now so we're going to go
up to the address bar and this is what
how you enter an address in opera mini
Wall Street Journal calm and ok and
start whoops it always asks you this
when you start the application so let's
reset the clock and do okay and start
and there goes
and it's done at about 11 seconds now
just like skyfire or not for mobile to
double to zoom in on a part of this page
you DoubleTap and it will resize not as
well as opera mobile opera mobile still
the best and resizing to fit the screen
but it does a pretty good job at letting
you get an overview of the web page and
then zoom in and then let's do adobe com
now so I'm going to go to menu enter
address whoops it's kind of hard to tap
on these very small buttons that's one
of the problems with upper mini so we're
going to go to Adobe and get our time
already and it's done at about three
seconds much faster than skyfire but as
you can see here there is no flash
content because opera mini doesn't do
flash unfortunately and that's one big
leg up on opera mini that skyfire has
that it does support flash content now
like skyfire Opera Mini is free in the
way that you get it is you go to opera
mini calm on your mobile device and you
can download it right from there one
thing that I do like about opera mini
that skyfire doesn't do is give you more
control over settings image sizes so if
we go down here to menu and we go to
tools and settings we can actually
specify how big the font sizes we can
change how large the image or how the
image quality is so low medium and high
and of course high will slow down page
loads and things like this skyfire just
doesn't have this level of control but
that said this is a speed test and
skyfire did get the fastest page loads
compared to opera mobile and now a
closer to competitor opera mini so I
think in the end so far skyfire is the
best the fastest mobile browser that you
can get on your windows mobile device
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
