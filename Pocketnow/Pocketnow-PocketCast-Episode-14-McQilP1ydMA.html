you ever seen Ernest remember that that
movie there was a few of them I think I
saw one or two maybe yeah there was a
whole series um I heat that guy actually
died anyways I'm Varney Jim Barney ya
know how old is he I don't know
wikipedia knows though yeah ernest p war
l fictional character played by a guy
named jim Varney oh well he didn't die
sorry Laura assuming that he did he just
became irrelevant kind of like pee-wee
Herman but few Herman was actually like
volume going on alright so let's get
started hey everyone welcome to the 14th
pocketnow podcast I will be your host
Brandon minimun editor-in-chief of
pocket now also on the line is Evan
glass managing editor of our fun site
say hi Evan hey guys hey Brandon yes and
we cover smartphones as you know but if
you're listening to this podcast you
probably like smartphones to and we're
going to talk about smartphones for
about 55 minutes which should be pretty
exciting if you care as much about these
things as we do so a lot to talk about
how do you want to sit have a whole show
just on the galaxy s2 couldn't read yeah
we should i'm a whole show on the galaxy
s2 that's a great idea in fact i could
probably just skip out this week and let
you talk about that and then work out
just fine i don't think i could talk
about the galaxy s2 for 55 minutes but
we put our review up and for i think the
third time in our 11-year history we've
given a phone 5 out of 5 stars the
reason that we did that is because the
galaxy s2 is such a well-rounded device
in terms of hardware and software and
battery life and performance it's just
it's pretty ridiculous how good of a
package Samsung put forth here and
everyone that holds this phone in their
hand says wow that phone is thin because
it seems that the trend has sort of been
going in the other direction we got the
thunderbolt and
the even evenly inspire 4G which seemed
to be thin to me is actually thick in
comparison to the galaxy s2 yeah it's
sort of interesting and it made me
wonder you know today we ordered I'm
sorry yesterday we learned that that the
variants that are coming to the US are
probably going to be nearly identical to
the international version at least in
terms of their form factor right it
don't made me wonder do we really need
to review um you know the American
versions at least three and possibly for
you know phones that that are you know
just going to be the the galaxy s2 with
you know a little bit of software tweaks
well I think what's going to happen is
exactly what happened with the galaxy s
which is you'll have the very very
similar devices but the casing will be
different the weight will be different
thicknesses differently the software is
a little bit changed but generally
speaking they're all going to be very
similar but you owe the whole thing that
that I think we learned yesterday though
that I mean it the case if these
form-fitting cases are made for for
three devices I mean there there can be
almost no difference in what the
physical shape of the phones like don't
you think that would be almost
unprecedented right to have a phone have
the exact same form factor to where even
a case which is very sensitive to even
small variations in size just lost my am
lost my sentence there no I see what
you're saying well how about the the
touch pro two about that was I mean it
had that had different key layout on on
each of the carriers as I recall but in
general you know I think you know
physically they were they were basically
the same phone I think that they were
very very similar but they were slightly
off to where you couldn't used cases
interchangeably between the verizon
touch pro2 sprint touch pro2 a TD so too
and the t-mobile what are the khan see
mobile
I think it was just the the touch pro
two the only one were where it wasn't
was the tilt two yeah yeah so but these
names that that may or may not be the
names for the the galaxy s2 in America
they're very they're the names they're
kind of boring someone used to get fired
at the marketing department so that the
AT&amp;amp;T attained the verizon function and
the sprint within well first of all I
don't think it's going to be like that i
think it's going to be the sprint galaxy
s2 within so the main part of the
branding is going to be is going to be
galaxy s2 and and it's just sort of
different to differentiate them I could
be wrong about that but I feel like
that's how they're going to do it and I
feel like like Samsung had a lot more
bargaining power here then then the
first time around when they were just
trying to get you know the galaxy s and
all the carriers so you know I think
that the carrier probably could have
said you know we want we want ours to
have a flash we want this one to have
better build material you know make it
look a little bit different but I think
this time around them you know Samsung
was really in the driver's seat because
this is a hot device that people want
and so you know like like an iPhone this
is something that the carriers are going
to want to carry em probably are going
to make concessions to Samsung in order
to be able to carry it yeah i mean the
the galaxy branding was secondary to the
first wave of devices and now it's
Samsung as more more farming powers you
say so yeah and the listing for the
successor e says galaxy s to attain so
if we're taking that literally to mean
that the galaxy s branding will be in
every will be will preface every name
that will be assigned to the carriers
what do you think's going to happen for
tmobile since that's missing from the
list I read somewhere that well who
knows I forget where I read it if it was
just a comment or if it was an article
that someone said that the t-mobile
would be getting a version that was
definitely different hardware wise so
that you know enough so that that like
the epic 4g it it was sort of an outlier
but who knows if that's true I suspect
that that t-mobile is is just not going
to get one especially because I'm you
know Samsung sees their their
subscribers bleeding now that everyone
knows they're they're going to be
consumed by 18 teen they don't want a
phone that's going to be obsolete even
though it's not really going to be
obsolete so right I suspect that that
Samsung didn't want to put it to
resources into into tmobile right now
and I think well probably going to start
seeing that more and more don't quote me
on this well maybe if it happens you can
quote me but I think I think maybe the
double shot might be the last high-end
phone will see from HTC on t-mobile well
here's what I think I i think the merger
of these two companies is a little bit
too far off to speculate that already
OEMs are making decisions but how about
this have you ever seen a slide-out
keyboard device that had a 4.3 inch
screen though that was able to know I
haven't made one yet if they took a
galaxy s2 which is remarkably
ridiculously thin kept the 4.3 inch
screen like they did with the epic and
the Galaxy S line of devices you can see
where I'm going with this they could
make the most ridiculous light out
keyboard device if they could keep the
device thin keep the 4.3 inch display
and have an awesome keyboard that would
be a creamy device for de mobile mmm
yeah think of even better if they could
make the the keyboard detachable you
know so you could have a slate when you
want it and you could have you have the
pro-style when you want it you know both
the best of both worlds that would be
awesome I think that that that would be
a lot of moving parts that that would be
probably the ultimate right to be able
to have the extremely thin form factor
of just the galaxy s and if you're going
on a business trip or whatever you bring
along the keyboard for really fast
emailing that would be probably one of
the coolest of
of all time I mean they didn't they try
to do that with the UM was it the
advantage which was sort of like gone
yeah the intermediate sized device that
was actually one of the first uh you
know one of the first attempts at a
little tablet you know like how big was
that five inches maybe maybe a little
bit more yeah also known as the Athena
so HTC advantage that had a very big
screen I don't think many people bought
it but it was definitely a really
powerful device and it likes 16
gigabytes of memory and this was just a
yeah 5-inch screen vga resolution so the
pixel density wasn't great but it was
like the streak of its day though kind
of it was the streak of its day that's a
funny name streak um um very good very
good let's move on well another piece of
galaxy s2 news is custom roms have begun
which is very important for this device
because it's so ridiculously powerful
and it's got a lot of software on it
that most power users aren't going to
like that much it's got a heavy email
app that doesn't allow you to
multi-select easily the browser has
customizations it's got TouchWiz and
naturally you cannot uninstall or i
should say put a certain party launcher
on top of that but you still at the end
of the day have to deal with a lot of
the built in stuff that weighs it down a
little bit so very big news for the
galaxy s2 Oh news I mean it's always
good news when you can you can fully
take advantage of the hardware
capabilities and like you said you know
whenever you have cents or TouchWiz on
there or blurts it's always going to be
at the expense of some performance
absolutely another big surprise with the
galaxy s2 is that it supports not only
AT&amp;amp;T 3g but AT&amp;amp;T hspa+ up to i believe
it's 21 megabits per second and actually
some good news to report because if you
listen to the podcast you know almost
every week I bitch and complain about
the lack of hspa+ for AT&amp;amp;T
i was in washington DC not last weekend
but the weekend before I ran a speedtest
while over HSPA according to the
settings and I got like six down and I
ran it again and I got like five down so
Washington DC has ATT hspa+ so you
saying that that that's a place where
our really hardcore readers should move
if they want that most bang for their
buck yeah they should although I mean
six megabits per second I shouldn't be
complaining that's sort of on the bottom
end oh yeah what are you what were you
getting with the with a thunderbolt the
Thunderbolt will clock in at around ten
between eight and twelve i should say
and i'm sure it's only a matter of time
before that goes to 15 or so it's funny
though if you benchmark the Thunderbolt
over LTE you'll get between eight and 12
but then if you use the hotspot feature
and benchmark on a laptop you'll get
like 15 20 plus huh well I guess you
know you at that point you have a faster
processor in your laptop so so do you
know maybe you can move bits quicker
that way I don't know what I think it is
yeah that that's probably exactly it i
mean it's it's almost a little
surprising that the first 4g LTE devices
are single core but we should see some
pretty interesting performance up tix
once we get to duel poor LTE devices
yeah there is a truck outside my window
and so hopefully you don't hear that
sound I can't hear it good moving on so
the next version of android will become
ice cream sandwich so that's three words
um and it will officially by the way
google i/o happened that's why we're
talking about ice cream sandwich where
they talked about that they also talked
about honeycomb 3.1 so I ice cream
sandwich the the headline here is that
it will be a singular version of Android
as to try to reduce this issue of
fragmentation and Android so the same
version of Android
will run on phones and tablets and TVs
and refrigerators or whatever now do we
know what um what number it's going to
be yet in terms of is it what do you
think it's you know 2.53 point what they
didn't they didn't talk about that but
what do you think maybe four yeah i'm
thinking the the whispers I've heard
would would be that it would before and
it would make sense you know to have
such a to have such a big upgrade that's
you know combining these these two
different what do you want to call them
you know these two different build
families I guess 21 it would seem
appropriate to uh to have a completely
new you know number as opposed to you
know putting in the in the two family
would be weird because then you're
you're lower than then honeycomb and
putting it in the three family would
also be a little weird because then it
sort of just makes it like you know a
honey honey comb aw shoot yeah so I feel
like what makes the most sense is that
is four point X you know probably 40 at
oh definitely and don't forget version
numbers are also a marketing component
so they want to they want to show that
they are jumping in of what honeycomb
was jumping way ahead of what you know
gingerbread froyo Eclair were and going
straight into the future there they're
saying that it will bring a state of the
state of the art you I but at Google i/o
they really didn't talk much
specifically about the UI except that
developers can build basically an
application that is sort of hybrid so if
it's it senses the higher resolution
screen for the tablet it will display
like a new panel of information if it's
detects a phone it will keep it in a
singular column there will be more stuff
with the action bar so less I mean
they've been talked about this for a
while less less commands buried beneath
menu systems that make it difficult to
find I think this is there I think this
is their opportunity to really do some
amazing things with very robust
multi-core support higher resolution
displays really take Android into 2012
and beyond any any thoughts on what what
will be the defining characteristic of
the UI for ice cream sandwich I have no
idea um I'm so bad when it comes to to
you is and you know being forward
thinking I'm always because I'm always
amazed by by what these companies are
doing and it always surprises me so I
really I have no idea what what to
expect hmm I like that for an answer no
I mean it makes sense it's hard to and
let's just sit around thinking about
this stuff all day thinking about okay
what would a user wanna experience what
would make what color taskbar would make
the you I feel light and fast it's yeah
I mean so many of the changes are are
you know it's something that you
wouldn't even think about it it seems
like it's so minor but you know these
people they did you know who the people
are designing it they they just you know
that's their whole the total day it's a
little job and you know so so obviously
they're going to come up with just and
they should be coming up with things
that are just more amazing than than we
can even you know conjure up ourselves
exactly and an interesting hint from
andy rubin he announced that there will
or most likely will be a new nexus phone
to run Ice Cream Sandwich just as there
was for Froyo with the nexus one and the
nexus s for Gingerbread and what he said
was this google is definitely looking at
introducing another phone that should
blow the socks off of everyone and that
should be able to handle ice cream
sandwich with ease notice anything
interesting about what he said um should
be able to blow the socks off everyone
well that sounds like a challenge yeah
yeah that that too but also that it's he
says that it should be able to handle
ice cream sandwich with ease making it
sound like ice-cream sandwich will
require some significant hardware oh
yeah yeah no doubt
which would be a little bit uh I mean if
it's that big of a jump it'll be a
little depressing if we can't upgrade
our current phones to ice cream sandwich
maybe that's a hint that well I think I
think one of the main holdups on on the
current generation of phones might be
the graphics hardware I'm not sure if
the GPUs are going to be enough some of
the stuff that we've seen Android doing
where it's sort of um where they use the
camera and then the the perspective of
the of what you're seeing is shifted
based on on how the device moves
augmented backing I'm not sure that that
current gen devices I mean I know that a
lot of them couldn't do it you know
especially your mid-range devices and
your entry-level devices yeah yeah I
think you're describing augmented
reality a little bit sure um speaking of
updates this is very interesting but it
seems like a last-minute thing google
announces timely commitments to Android
updates and they've got basically every
company that matters I don't see one
that doesn't on board with this verizon
sony ericsson all the carriers in the US
Plus Vodafone in overseas then we've got
HTC sony ericsson LG AT&amp;amp;T oh that's a
carrier XO that motorola and samsung not
really sure about exactly the details of
this on the idea here is to give people
a better understanding of whether their
device will see an Android upgrade yeah
I think what they're doing is they're
they're committing to to to to a pretty
tight schedule for for 18 months out
from from any given device release so
they're saying you know for for 18
months you know here's here's almost
exactly what you can expect in terms of
upgrades 18 months so that only seems to
lie mean the average person has a phone
for two years and after year one I mean
I think 12 months would be awesome but
obviously there's a lot of work
goes into these updates and they can't
just you know yeah I think one of the
problems we've seen is they just they
know that they can't push the updates
out fast enough for me if you look at
what went on with the galaxy s you know
I don't think it's that you know they
weren't pulling it back just to be jerks
you know they they were they were having
really real world problems with with
pushing them out so so yeah like you
said you know they know that there's
there's going to be problems and they're
giving themselves an 18-month window
because there's only 12 months I i think
there's there's some devices they
probably you know couldn't get even one
upgrade out for you let alone two yeah
yeah so hopefully we get more precise
information about that you know maybe
when you go to a verizon store you'll
see a little next to a little placard
there will be like a star that says this
device is eligible for the ice cream
update and it will happen in 18 months
or something like that I don't know what
a weird game by the way you think it
shows a little bit of arrogance on
Google's part to name something like
that because they know that that that
word is going to be used endlessly I
mean you know how many times do we have
to write honeycomb or gingerbread or
read about it and now you know you got
to write Ice Cream Sandwich powered
that's that's a very good point I was
thinking that too huh it is a little bit
arrogant think you call it whatever they
want and you know it's going to be huge
and so they're forcing people to we're
gonna have to put it on like quick copy
paste maybe there's a browser extensions
when I'm the type of so many times yeah
or you know we could just start calling
it ice cream it's not as delicious
though because ice cream sandwiches are
very good but ice cream alone isn't as
interesting how about ice cream sundae
ooh I wish they would have went with
that I mean that was the t's wasn't it
when that and they celebrated like the
the hundred and 19th anniversary of the
founding of the sunday so obviously that
wasn't a hint which we were talking
about several podcasts ago well I mean
in general you know that it was it could
have been pretending the the arrival of
ice cream something perhaps I mean I
doubt
that they could have found an Ice Cream
Sandwich event that was worthy enough of
you know doing the what do they call him
google doodles yeah I don't want to
sound gross but uh when I was a kid I
would eat ice cream sandwiches in a very
particular way I let it melt a little
bit and then i would lick the sides and
then i let it melt some more um that's
not gross is that is that how you eat an
ice cream sandwich no I just eat it but
I don't think there's anything moment
you know it to each his own so you just
you just bite it like it's a sandwich
yeah I mean I might give it a lick here
or there but but in general I I go
sandwich style that's what you use it
don't gotta do it all right oh my god
you're gonna have to edit that out of
the podcast there's kids that listen to
this actually there's a clause where
everyone listening has to the 18 or
older see if you hadn't see that
anywhere anyway moving on google also
announced google music and google movies
and these are cloud-based services the
the movies is very self-explanatory
they've hooked up with some studios the
selections not that great right now it's
only for tablet and for computer but
they are rolling it out two phones very
very soon so that you know you can go on
market.android.com rent a movie for two
to four bucks start watching it on your
your computer watch it on your laptop
not well yeah your laptop watch it on
your tablet watch it on here your phone
sort of like the the iTunes model a
little bit all right so it there is a
degree of you can move it between
devices in other words like you know the
old model was you buy something on your
phone and then you have tits days on
your phone and you have to watch it on
your phone so and who wants to watch a
movie on their phone yeah I mean it
basically since it's all stream do you
go on your phone it knows that you
purchased this and you have it available
for 24 hours just picks up where it left
off okay that makes that makes a lot
more sense i mean you know I've rented
I've rented movies on the computer where
you have to you have to download the
whole movie you know just just to watch
it once
and it just seems you know it's a it's a
big hassle and you can't move it from
device to device it that I think that's
why that model hasn't taken off yet yeah
you're right i mean it's it's pretty
amazing that that we've come to this
point where you can watch content on
multiple devices and pay for it one time
and not have to worry about transferring
things yeah that's also interestingly
they've launched google music which is
very similar to the Amazon music cloud
offering quite simply you upload all
your music then you access the music and
stream it through a browser through your
tablet or through the smartphone app
right now you have to sign up for the
beta they're not giving access to
everyone it's free for now 20 gigabytes
just crazy to think about you get free
20 gigabytes it's very possible that
they'll charge for this probably like 20
bucks a year but this brings up a very
interesting question about how we listen
to music and how we consume music
because for some people this doesn't
matter that much for example I use zune
I I love using zune it's fifteen dollars
a month for unlimited music streaming
its end unlimited music downloading you
know are they paying you to say that
Brandon a lot uh they don't you don't
you don't get to own the music except
that you get 10 free downloads per month
but I don't care about that I wouldn't
mind paying fifteen dollars every month
for the rest of my life if it means that
I got quality or access to high quality
endless supply of music which is what
zune affords but with this music service
from google and from amazon this doesn't
matter because there's no app for iOS or
for android for zune or there's no way
to even use this on a windows phone 7
device zoom music has to be synced
manually and it's a crappy model and it
kind of bothers me but I can't get out
of the ecosystem because it's so it's so
appealing well yeah and you have all
your playlists made now you know if you
if you moved over to another ecosystem
even one that that gave you you know all
you can eat monthly you know you still
have to build everything up again yeah
exactly i mean even if itunes came out
with a subscription service which could
be great I've got you know 5,000 tracks
already downloaded from zune that I
don't want to have to recreate what do
you do for a for music Evan I mostly
listening a group shot but and then you
know I have some songs here there but
I'm starting to get old Brandon I mean I
just don't I just don't discover is that
what the kids called music discovery you
know I just I don't pick up as new as
much new music as I used to you know I
listen to a lot of the same stuff that i
was listening to you know five ten years
ago along with stuff that you know pick
up you know this is a serious sometimes
or Pandora or whatever but but it's
mainly just you know the same 188 or so
songs well grooveshark probably isn't
the best tool for music discovery but
itunes and zune they let you see the new
releases every day they'll let you get
music recommendations they do like a
smart mix where they put similar artists
together but yet so you use grooveshark
I know a few people that use that so
then there's an android app for
grooveshark where you can stream you're
basically streaming it's full songs
right from right but then you have to
pay that's that's the grooveshark models
if you want to get any of these you want
to get any of these mobile clients you
have to pay a monthly subscription I see
and how is the quality on grooveshark I
think it's great certainly you know but
you know I think I think 128 kilobit
mp3s are great so that's so funny that
we've been sort of programmed to like
128 kilobits I remember back in the days
of Napster I always tried to download
320 Killa Killa Killa bit music kilobit
per seconds I guess the term and then of
course out there they have flac lossless
audio and then they've got the audio
files that was into vinyl and say CD
suck digital is ten times worse than CDs
and all of you are crazy but itunes and
zune and all these guys are streaming us
128 k sometimes a little bit higher most
of the time
lower and we don't really fuss about it
yeah yeah I mean I think I think people
are starting to become more cognizant of
that though and an advertising now is
these companies are marketing a little
bit more about you know that there was a
big deal when when itunes went went to a
non drm model or work you know where you
could you can pay a little bit more for
for the non drm song and it will also be
a higher bitrate so you know i think
that um i don't think that there's many
there's many places that are doing less
than 128 at this point unless it's it's
free music from somewhere yeah I mean
you get some shoutcast streaming radio
it can be like you know 90 something
kilobits but what's what's frustrating
is that unless consumers are writing
about the lower quality lower quality is
cheaper for these music purveyors
because it's less bandwidth the stream
so they're very happy to keep it at 128
k I remember listening the shoutcast on
a tree out like that you know like back
in like 2003 or something wow how was
that oh it was like so low quality and
you know you can only listen out of the
little speaker is it you know if you
didn't have the proper headphone adapter
but it was great listening to to music
from a phone oh man at the time I'd
bloom online i would just put it there
on my desk even though i had better
speakers you know and i could be
listening to music through that i would
listen to the phone just cuz i could
yeah fun stuff fun stuff let's uh let's
bounce on to the next array which is a
droid x squared okay so very full specs
have been revealed also a release date
is is out there 26 i believe is the day
right mate 26 this a date it's
interesting because when we first
started talking about the droid x
squared we saw this device that looked
identical to the droid x and the rumor
was that is going to be very much the
same except for one or two things which
i think we're the screen was going to be
qhd and
was the other the processor the you know
the dual core processor now yeah well I
think right originally we thought
originally as I you know and this is not
to knock on engadget because at the time
they had good information but you know
they published something where were the
the droid x2 was only going to be it
wasn't even going to be an upgrade it
was that all they were going to do was
swap out the 16 gig micro SD card for a
two gig and it turns out that that was
just another skew for costco i believe
instead of obviously the the droid x
squared that we're going to come to know
and love over the next year so as it
turns out it's not going to be just that
it's going to have a Tegra 2 processor
gigahertz in each core qhd display 512
megabytes of ram 8 gigabytes of rom what
what is clear here and we were going to
sort of ask why Verizon's keeping the
same design except on the back it says
droid x squared and it's very clear
because obviously this is a very winning
design that a lot of people like and
this device obviously has a lot of
momentum right now and they want to
extend the momentum of this device as
their big screen phone for as long as
possible well i think i mean if you're
asking why they didn't change the design
I sort of think there's two reasons one
of them is just more practical in that
they can keep the prices the cost down
because you know they have the machinery
to fabricate these all set up and also
you know obviously accessories are going
to work with these so case manufacturers
don't have to reach while they're um
they're there know their machinery
either but i think the other reason is
you know if they made this two different
and two too much you know too much like
a 2011 device it might eat into sales of
the droid bionic that's true you know
they're they're very similar devices
except for the delta LTE on the Bionic
which you know it has obviously been
delayed
but I think that's you know that style
is sort of there it is what we're going
to see device is looking like from from
Motorola in the next year and you know
if they if they change the body style of
the X to the x squared too much then
they would have had very similar devices
both on verizon do you also think that
maybe because the droid bionic was
delayed this maybe this is was a way to
sort of bridge the gap possibly I mean I
I think that they have these they have
these um in production for quite a while
before we even hear about them or you
know for instance there was you know a
joy to x squared being imagined you know
during during CES when when the droid
bionic is being introduced right I
suspect yeah so I'm just not sure um the
Bionic you know gets introduced earlier
and is going to come out later well
another thing that happened relating to
the droid line is that it's not a big
deal that's kind of entertaining you
motorola verizon has updated its verizon
has updated the droid does calm website
check it out if you've got a few minutes
of boredom it's kind of interesting I
don't check it out did you did you like
it yeah I do it well I I do like it for
sure it's funny because they've got this
robotic voice explaining all the
high-tech features of all the droids
then you click down the droid pro and
I'm thinking like how is this robotic
voice gonna make the droid pro sound
awesome and then it was like this phone
has a massive 3.1 inch display with 300
or you know hvga itch vga resolution in
them right face pie I actually needed it
so I didn't even know that there was
there was robotic voices yeah she had to
check it out it's pretty funny I didn't
like the last joy does I thought it was
very confusing about you know how you
got from how to navigate around the site
because there was all these lines and
and then the lines would would would
would you know break out into more
and it just didn't make any sense to me
this one it a little bit more yeah yeah
um very good let us move on talking
about the HTC holiday a device that give
me a hot phone what ya might be pretty
darn hot so we've got some specs on it
now that comes from 9-11 I / coupled
with a picture that we acquired kind of
helps to put the story together a little
bit so 4.5 inch display looks like the
infuse 4g isn't going to be the only one
in town to have the larger display a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
basically the same chip that's coming in
the sensation and the evo 3d a gig of
ram dual eat megapixel cameras so do you
think that this is going to have a 3d
display since it can take 3d pictures
and such ah wait where did where did we
hear that i could take 3d pictures oh
I'm am I am miss reading the post so
there's a 8 megapixel camera on the back
and a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front
I thought that to mean there were two 8
megapixel cameras yeah as far as I know
that there are no phones yet that have
dual 8 megapixels the the ones that are
doing 3d are all dual 5 megapixels yeah
yeah so so those things plus it on a qHD
display um basically what the holiday is
going to be is 18 T's version of the
sensation 4g but with a bigger screen
isaiah exactly that that's how i would
classify from the specs at least so far
yeah that is going to be an amazing
phone I hope the battery life isn't
horrible um Wow I mean it looks like it
looks like sort of a big device all
around so you know maybe they they were
able to stuff a you know a 1700 milliamp
battery in there or whatever maybe maybe
do you think it'll ship with that with
ice cream sandwich
no but I do think that I think because
of the front facing camera I suspect
that it's going to be an LTE device you
think it's going to be an AT&amp;amp;T LTE
device really yeah you think it could be
the first eighteen t LTE device I
suspect and what I need to talk to to
Gabe about this and see what he thinks
but um yeah this is inside scoop here
folks so I'm hopefully this that the
podcast doesn't get published before we
can we can put out a post on this but
but I think this might be one of the one
of the LTE devices that they're gonna
launch with that guy I'd bet money on it
oh yeah how much know what do you got
when you got your wall I'm just kidding
uh let's see okay if you win I let's say
you f if I know if you win I have to get
you one of these phones shuffle that
that's a good diver this feels like a
like it's going to be a very notable
device and and I saw someone in our
comments put out some supposed specs
from the the wrong that say it has LTE
but you know until I see it for myself
or someone I know and trust chose me I'm
you know I'm not willing to say for sure
yet but but I'm sort of confident on it
so that's why i said you know i do want
to put down some money fair enough fair
enough i'll write that on the wall then
so that's very interesting let us move
on beyond the holiday which should
launch near the holiday appropriately so
the HTC Sensation 4G on t-mobile is
almost here actually according to a
leaked launch date from TmoNews june
eighth is the magic day we also saw at
target for a hundred ninety nine dollars
which is kind of cool because right now
that the the highest cost smartphone out
there that i can think of as the droid
charge at three hundred dollars and the
fact that the super high-end t-mobile
see some sensation 4300 are cheaper is
really good sign yeah and it all you
know it'll have it will be a 4g phone
just like it's like the droid charge so
you know what what are you paying for
what's that extra hundred dollars
getting you totally and you know it's
going to be thinner than the droid
charge it's going to have a higher res
screen it's going to have dual I mean it
in almost every way except for the LTE
modem it's it's superior and it doesn't
have the the boot up by the red eye ah
oh well I'm sure with some hackery you
could open a red eye um very good just
move on so we are going to New York we
meaning me and adam or adam and i and a
steven wright is gonna be there I don't
know if Stevens going but maybe well we
are going to to New York for the 24 may
event for windows phone 7 where there
presumably going to be talking more
specifically about mango in fact it's
very likely that they'll talk about a
release date and who knows maybe it'll
show some hardware running mango some
new devices probably not that but that's
what I was going to say what do you
think I think there might be you know a
device or two there Microsoft knows that
that the bones out right now are getting
really really stale and that it needs
some new hardware get to keep people
excited and can't wait for the holiday
season you know that's that's like a
over a year after the first phones came
out true and and now with you know mango
having a much faster browser and having
fast app switching the phones could
really benefit from multiple cores more
RAM and no windows phone 7 device has
multiple cores and over what 512
megabytes of RAM so there's that yeah
there's a good opportunity here for them
to drop some hardware but I mean at
least in terms of the the cpu there's
there's not a chassis spec out there yet
that that that allows for for dual-core
processors right well maybe they'll
announce that too I don't know what's
going on there but yeah I mean even if
if these devices don't necessarily need
the door
core four for marketing purposes i think
you know that's that's sort of becoming
the new the new high-end if you know if
you want to have a hot hot phone you got
to have a dual core processor or at
least you know in the next three months
you will it's so funny this dual core
thing the galaxy s2 is the first dual
core phone and i've reviewed and have
been using and i can't find many
situations where there's a tremendous
difference in speed except for some
reason what will not for some reason but
web browsing obvious they're definitely
a huge improvement web browsing into
installing applications from the
marketplace is like fifty percent plus
faster than the fastest single core
android phone abused huh but i mean
they're browsing alone to me that's
enough you know that's fair point your
web browsing is one of my main
activities on the phone non calling
activities that's a fair point fair
point um i like to say that word fair
point torrents so yeah mango some some
recent changes talking about the
lockscreen having some dynamic displays
with with you know visuals of the music
you're playing and office 365
integration a lot of microsoft products
this most recent a little bit of
information about mango isn't terribly
exciting it's just sort of extending
microsoft assets and brands to Windows
Phone further I think consumers are most
excited about the stuff like fast app
switching ie9 faster browsing better
performance across the board twitter
twitter integration and i'm sure of
though i have tight skype integration
soon yeah yeah that would be interesting
to uh that would be great to be able to
know in the dialer screen choose to make
a call over skype oh no doubt that's
coming i mean you can i mean you know
they'd be silly not to to leverage this
as much as possible to get there you
know 8.7 billion dollars worth or
whatever it was anyways yeah you know
they that they
need to really push this hard and to
make to make skype really like the de
facto prompted to make skype you know
the the facetime of the windows world
yeah yeah and that you know it's easy to
our it's easy to see how skype as a
standard in video chat with Trump face
time because facetime is still very
closed and you know everyone is skype
but not everyone has you know the the
right tools to use facetime so it right
I mean I suspect that that facetime will
will eventually be universal meaning you
know you'll be able to get a facetime
app for your your android phone or for
your your windows phone 7 but i think
that the bigger point is that skype as a
company you know that's all they do and
that's all they've been doing well while
FaceTime you know is just a division
within Apple on Apple's a big company
but I don't think that they have the
resources to devote to to facetime the
same way skype has de and now Microsoft
backing skype has the resources to to
devote to this hmm this is all assuming
that Microsoft doesn't you know mess it
up and you know do do the opposite of
what it's intending that is encourage
innovation they don't want to stifle
innovation with their extremely large
company bureaucracy and with with rumor
today of Microsoft possibly buying Nokia
aura I mean crazy it's crazy and it's
it's almost like I don't know we're not
here to analyze companies but it's very
interesting it how how Microsoft is just
deploying its cash and stock to just buy
these companies you want to talk about
that first step because I don't think it
would be a bad move i mean it basically
gives Microsoft the same vertical
integration that Apple has which which
Apple really leverages to its advantage
hmm you know what I mean because
Microsoft would have the the Nokia
hardware then which is which is very
good hardware and you know that's they
can have a real compelling package there
to other people I think them people have
been calling on Microsoft to make a
microsoft phone for a very very long
time and they don't do it because it's
going to piss off the OEMs their
partners I mean that would be like
Google literally making a google phone
and that kind of is is a bad vibe to
send a motorola HTC all the phones that
are making Android hardware they're
thinking wow am I going to compete
against the parent company now this is
ridiculous I don't want that model
anymore I mean there you really have two
models out there you know you have the
Apple model which is you know we'll make
our all our own hardware which is you
know one phone and it's just such a
great device and you know we're really
going to work the vertical integration
to to our benefit selling all these side
services along with it but but also
making the experience really tight and
then you have on the other end of the
spectrum the the Android model which is
you know we're we just have a platform
and you know you can do with it what you
want to put it on to any phones but you
know that that actually came from the
original microsoft model with windows so
what I think that I think that Microsoft
is finding that that model for four
phones isn't working out as well for
them as as it did on the desktop and
certainly now you know when it when it's
coming from a weaker position and you
know windows phone is certainly doing
okay but but android is the blockbuster
and you know I phone too so you know if
it's not if it's not working you know
maybe maybe it's time for a change maybe
it's time to let to let Samsung and LG
and really it's only a handful of own
hands that are making windows phones and
and they seem to be much happier and
concentrating much more on their android
on their android devices anyway you know
maybe maybe you have to change that
model cut the cut the OEMs off you know
let them move to to android only devices
and and you you make just your own
hardware with your nokia team that i
think that would be too risky but i
think to think i do a hybrid model
where they they make like one specific
microsoft nokia phone and then they
still allow their partners I mean date
Microsoft is kind of spoiled in that day
baby now they've been having this
licensing model since they're the
beginning of their existence and it's
it's it glorious if you're you know
extremely forward thinking into
appeasing the shareholders and you know
if I well it's it's great if you're if
what your licensing is is the de facto
standard like Windows is but but when
it's you know a more of a luxury item
that that where people have a lot more
choices in a given market then that then
I don't think it's it's working out that
well for you and you might be better off
you know uh you know offering a better
experience I mean that's that's
something that the iphone really offers
that that android doesn't and i think
that android is trying to catch up in is
you know being able to to offer a more
integrated experience and you know it's
difficult because you have you have this
big ecosystem of manufacturers and now
we'll put what's going on the google end
of things and then the carriers of
course so i think i think it gets a
little bit too difficult to manage and
that's one of the reasons that that
apple is is so deep it Apple has a much
easier time in pushing out updates then
then we're finding the anything based on
android does absolutely vertically
integrated is definitely and again
microsoft with the problems with no
dough no dough um i don't know why i
jist of it they'll all right let's move
on to our final story so it's possible
that the iphone 5 might not be called
the iphone 5 at least for now and that
we are going to see an iphone 4s kind of
like we saw a 3gs and if you think back
to sort of the timeline we have the
original iphone than the iphone 3g which
was very
any different than the original iphone
in terms of appearance and of course i
have the 3g radio the 3gs was basically
the same as the 3g and yet it's sold
very very well and then the four was
dramatically different in every respect
and now with the 4s and analyst from
Jefferies &amp;amp; Co Co Jefferies &amp;amp; Co is
probably some financial institution is
saying that the next iPhone will be the
4s it will have the a5 dual-core CPU it
will have hspa+ support on tmobile
nothing noted here about screen size
which would be disappointing which which
is interesting because there's been so
much clamour about a four-inch screen
and now we're talking about a keeping
the screen size the same but bumping
specs yeah I mean I think the only thing
that we could stay with pretty much
certainty is that they're going to use
that same a 5 chip that's in the ipad
when you say yeah absolutely so I think
that's almost a definite other than that
you mean it it makes total sense for
them to to expand the size of the screen
you know that's at this point you know
4.3 now now we've got a couple 4.5 inch
bones it looks like so and what's the
iphone screen 3.5 inch yeah i mean
they've got it they've got a pump up and
I mean that would be a very very
compelling next-generation iphone
offended a four-inch screen a5 chip
hspa+ support call it a day there i mean
that's that's going to be very
compelling to people hey what else what
else were we hoping for for the next
knowledge it's on the home screen maybe
uh yeah i mean we we also are are
praying that there's going to be a new
operating system released with the new
iphone because a desperate need of a
change well how about you know Apple
ties up with with like American Express
like it did with Nike and you know
incorporate some hardware and therefore
NFC that'd be cool although I
I mean the consumers care about NFC is
that a selling point at this point I
think the early adopters care a lot
about it and it's going to start
filtering down once people see some of
the the conveniences like you know when
you're at the store writing a check and
then and the guy in front of you just
like swipes his phone and his
transactions done you know that that
might be a compelling use case scenario
for you have you ever been in a
situation not yet but well at the gas
station you know they they were pretty
forward thinking of all the gas stations
where you know you could get these
contactless payments at the right at the
prompt and even inside so yeah I yeah I
use that the PayPass you know the
contactless payment but what frustrates
me about that is that first of all it's
deployed in all the convenience stores
gas stations it's very widely available
what's annoying is that they don't show
you where the con RFID or whatever is on
the card so sometimes I'm like swiping
the upper left corner tapping the upper
right corner is about you know it's so
confusing yeah yeah it needs to be and
the needs to be explained better to
consumers date they basically need to
make it like dead easy be like you know
tap here and so you tap there exactly
and another big inconvenience although I
think this is a safety measure is that
with the contactless payment you can't
just pull out your wallet and tap
because it's not strong enough you have
to actually take out the card which kind
of defeats the purpose of contact lyssa
slightly there yeah although you know
you have to balance between security of
thing they could easily make the the
radios more powerful on these things but
then you know you have someone a couple
feet away that could could read your
information and potentially decrypt it
that would suck yeah and you just
recently have have an issue with some
some unauthorized so you know exactly
what it's like to have your identity
stolen or to have to deal with that sort
of thing yeah
yeah I can be frustrating securities
definitely a a big issue and I think a
lot of people are are worried about it
especially when it comes to identity
theft and people using your credit card
when you don't ya see the key is you
keep all your cash under the mattress
and you I you just you run your credit
down so bad that even if someone does
steal your identity they're not going to
be able to get a card or anything is
that yours is that your tactic I'm not
saying necessarily that's what I do I'm
just saying you know that that that's
that's really your your best defense
against that sort of crime hmm so for
any young listeners out there take your
money out of the bank put it under your
mattress now get one credit card and
really just run it up and then never pay
it off that's a great way to don't
you'll never get identity theft in well
that's probably not best practice I
don't listen that but uh yeah right
isn't this a smartphone show people
don't want to hear my yeah I know
personal finance awesome alright well
that will do it for the podcast number
14 we will see you all number 15 thanks
