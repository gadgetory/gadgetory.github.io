launcher why we don't know but what does
this move mean for consumers and
smartphone manufacturers well let's take
a closer look to start off it's worth
reiterating just what is a launcher
unless you're really into jailbreaking
there's really only one way to use an
iPhone you have pages of apps a slider
on the top for your notifications and a
slider on the bottom for quick actions
like controlling your Wi-Fi the Android
ecosystem is a lot more diverse that's
why when you get used to one Android
phone and you pick up a different
Android phone it feels different one way
to help improve the familiarity on
Android phones every time you buy a new
Android device you can install your own
launcher and customize it so that it
feels the same as previous phones you've
owned Android is made and supported by
Google so maybe consider installing a
Google developed launcher while other
companies look to add a ton of features
Google's approach focused on a fluid
interface and ease of use well we now
have official word from Google that by
the end of this quarter the Google now
launcher will be no more for
manufacturers there's an official list
of apps that google requires companies
to install on their phones before they
ship them out not only is the now
launcher being delisted but any phones
manufactured after the cutoff date will
no longer be certified by Google that's
a pretty stark encouragement to major
manufacturers get on board for those
companies the feel of Google launcher
should be maintained one of the
hallmarks of the now launcher is the
left swipe to the side where you have
your feed a customized list of
notifications and news articles and I
can still be activated by companies
looking to maintain that look and feel
so a manufacturer could go with the
stock Android open source project
launcher add that left swipe speed and
most consumers probably wouldn't know
the difference it does get a little
trickier for consumers however the
Google now launcher app will be pulled
from the Google Play Store so for any
future devices you might buy it's going
to be increasingly difficult to install
that launcher though the app will be
pulled from the Play Store as long as
you keep updating your Google Search app
your Google now launcher will continue
to receive support we're not entirely
sure how that's going to work if you
sideload the Google now launcher after
the cutoff date but we would imagine
Google will continue to support that too
but the tricky part for those folks you
don't want to have to manually install
apps on the side what might this mean
for them if they want to install a
simple and free launcher to clean up
their phone doesn't look like Google is
going to be
singing the rains on the pixel launcher
that's going to stay on pixel phones
there are a number of fantastic
third-party options and I'm a big fan of
Nova Launcher for example it really will
be a bummer if there isn't a first-party
Google Android solution for people
looking to customize their Android
devices and of course we want to hear
from you do you use the Google now
launcher are you looking at what
alternatives you might be able to
install or are you hoping that this is
going to be a move where Google will
open up the pixel launcher for more
devices drop us a comment down below
