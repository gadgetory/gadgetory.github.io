you know we do a lot of talking to our
phones or do we you see we talk on our
phones to other people but today i'm
going to show you one way of several how
you can actually talk to your phone
let's go take a look alright so when
you're on a phone call you're not really
talking to your phone you're talking to
someone else through your phone or your
listening to them talk to you through
your phone that's not we're going to
talk about here what we're going to talk
about is a series of different ways in
which you can use your voice to interact
with your phone rather than interact
with or communicate with someone on the
other end so first and foremost we've
got the search widget now every Android
comes with this unless you know motorola
or whoever else takes it out and i don't
think any of them have what that does is
it very simply lets you search google
for stuff and it has this little
microphone next to it that's really
where we first saw that you can talk to
your android and have your android do
stuff take that to the next generation
and you have the google search widget
which is a little bit different it's got
this little G with a drop-down arrow
next to it now what you can do with this
is search for a whole bunch more stuff
but in the background it also adds a
little bit more stuff that you can do a
centering around something called
intense and we're going to get to that
in an upcoming video but for today let's
look just at this search widget first of
all if you've got android 2.2 or above
you can go out to the market and search
for google search widget download and
install it and there you go if you want
to put it on your screen of course you
want to go to widgets and add it right
there don't get confused with the search
widget this is called google search so
its up in the g's alphabetically so what
can we do with it well first of all
you've got this G when we tap on that it
brings up this list of stuff that we can
search for you can search everything
which really is everything in this list
you can search the web you can search
for apps contacts there's just a whole
bunch of stuff and this is going to vary
depending on what you have installed on
your device and what you have configured
to search so if I want to not search my
kindle book
I can uncheck that if I don't want to
check my Dropbox files I can uncheck
that that looks pretty good so let's go
back now now when I come down and tap on
that list I have a much smaller list
which means that my search results
should come back more accurate so what
I'm looking for and they should come
back quicker which is always a good
thing so let's get in here and take a
look now at what we can do of course we
can tap on the text box and just type or
swipe in this case to get text input
that's not very cool I mean it's cool
but that's not what this video is about
so let's see what we can do okay the
first time you're going to tap on this
microphone icon it's going to bring up a
tutorial it's a very good tutorial I'd
recommend going through it it only takes
a couple minutes and it kind of gives
you some hints at stuff that you can do
that you might not have otherwise
thought that you could do for now we're
just going to skip it and we are going
to do a search pocketnow.com and you
could see I had a little text indicator
there it says hey that sounds like a
website and sure enough right over here
at the end this bar is kind of green
it's got this little spoken text line
next to it saying that I input this
using text and it goes right out to
google and finds everything that's
related to pocketnow.com which the first
result is our website of course and then
we've got some exclusives and look at
that we just dominate the whole front
page so really cool but what else can we
do well let's come back here and see Joe
Levi now of course that's me so let's
see right there there I am it's got all
my personal information so don't abuse
it please but that's my contact if I
were searching for anyone else in my
address book I could just as easily do
that and have access to all of it and
now I can do any of this stuff really
quickly and really easily it even has
this aid did you really mean Jolie by
the person or did you want to do a
google search for Joe Levi so we're just
going to go ahead and cancel that if we
want to limit things down let's go ahead
and see I don't know if I have any music
on here but let's
check and see if we can limit that just
by music and it looks like it's just
bringing up a list of my music which you
know that's okay when we get into
intense i'll show you something really
cool that you can do with music what
else do you guys want to do what else
you want to search for anything that you
want literally is just right there your
fingertips and you can get to it through
that widget now here is your bonus extra
tip for the day you're ready for this
what if you don't want to put that on
your home screen I understand your home
screen space is very limited so what can
you do well you can either put a voice
search button which launches the app
just like that which only takes one
thing you can't limit it like you can
over here at least not on the first
screen it's just bring up that speech or
here's your tip find your search that
your little magnifying icon tap and hold
it and it will ask you what you want to
do the first time in this case I can
either use messaging or i can use voice
search i'm going to use voice search by
default Joe Levi and very quickly very
very easily I've got my contacts again
so really cool really powerful what you
can do with this of course this is just
the tip of the iceberg so make sure you
stay tuned for our next video which
we're going to get into intense and no
that's not intense its intense you meant
to do something we're going to go ahead
and show you that and some tricks on
what you can do to make that very useful
make your phone a little bit faster and
more user-friendly if you like this kind
of stuff go ahead and give us a thumbs
up so that all of your friends know that
