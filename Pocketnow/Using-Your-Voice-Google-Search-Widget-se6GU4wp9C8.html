you know we do a lot of talking to our
phones or do we you see
we talked on our phones to other people
today I'm going to show you one way of
several how you can actually talk to
your phone let's go take a look
alright so when you're on a phone call
you're not really talking to your phone
you're talking to someone else through
your phone or you're listening to them
talk to you through your phone
that's not we're going to talk about
here what we're going to talk about is a
series of different ways in which you
can use your voice to interact with your
phone rather than interact with or
communicate with someone on the other
end so first and foremost we've got the
search widget now every Android comes
with this unless you know Motorola or
whoever else takes it out and I don't
think any of them have what that does is
it very simply lets you search google
for stuff and it has this little
microphone next to it that's really
where we first saw that you can talk to
your Android and have your Android do
stuff take that to the next generation
and you have the Google search widget
which is a little bit different it's got
this little G with a drop-down arrow
next to it now what you can do with this
is search for a whole bunch more stuff
but in the background it also adds a
little bit more stuff that you can do
centering around something called intent
and we're going to get to that in an
upcoming video but for today let's look
just at this search widget first of all
if you've got Android 2.2 or above you
can go out to the market and search for
a Google search widget download and
install it and there you go if you want
to put it on your screen of course
you'll want to go to widgets and add it
right there don't get confused with the
search widget this is called Google
search so it's up in the g's
alphabetically so what can we do with it
well first of all you've got this G when
we tap on that it brings up this list of
stuff that we can search for you can
search everything which really is
everything in this list you can search
the web you can search for apps contacts
just a whole bunch of stuff and this is
going to vary depending on what you have
installed on your device and what you
have configured to search so if I want
to not search my Kindle book
I can uncheck that if I don't want to
check my Dropbox files I can uncheck
that that looks pretty good so let's go
back now now when I come down and tap on
that list I have a much smaller list
which means that my search results
should come back more accurate so what
I'm looking for and they should come
back quicker which is always a good
thing so let's get in here and take a
look now at what we can do of course we
can tap on the text box and just type or
swipe in this case to get text input
that's not very cool I mean it's cool
but that's not what this video is about
so let's see what we can do okay the
first time you're going to tap on this
microphone icon it's going to bring up a
tutorial it's a very good tutorial I'd
recommend going through it it only takes
a couple minutes and it kind of gives
you some hints stuff that you can do
that you might not have otherwise
thought that you could do for now we're
just going to skip it and we are going
to do a search pocketnow.com and you
could see I had a little text indicator
there it says hey that sounds like a
website and sure enough right over here
at the end this bar is kind of green
it's got this little spoken text line
next to it saying that I input this
using text and it goes right out to
Google and finds everything that's
related to pocketnow.com which the first
result is our website of course and then
we've got some exclusives and look at
that we just dominate the whole front
page so really cool but what else can we
do well let's come back here and see Joe
Levi now of course that's me so let's
see right there there I am it's got all
my personal information so don't abuse
it these but that's my contact if I were
searching for anyone else in my address
book I could just as easily do that and
have access to all of it and now I can
do any of this stuff really quickly and
really easily
it even has this a did you really mean
Jolie by the person or did you want to
do a Google search for Joe Levi so we're
just going to go ahead and cancel that
if we want to limit things down let's go
ahead and see I don't know if I have any
music on here but let's
check and see if we can limit that just
by music and it looks like it's just
bringing up a list of my music which you
know that's okay
when we get into intense I'll show you
something really cool that you can do
with music what else do you guys want to
do what else do you want to search for
anything that you want literally is just
right there your fingertips and you can
get to it through that widget now here
is your bonus extra tip for the day
you're ready for this what if you don't
want to put that on your homescreen I
understand your home screen space is
very limited so what can you do well you
can either put a voice search button
which launches the app just like that
which only takes one thing you can't
limit it like you can over here at least
not on the first screen it's just bring
up that speech or here's your tip find
your search that's your little
magnifying icon tap and hold it and it
will ask you what you want to do the
first time in this case I can either use
messaging or I can use voice search I'm
going to use voice search by default Joe
Levi and very quickly very very easily
I've got my contacts again so really
cool really powerful what you can do
with this of course this is just the tip
of the iceberg so make sure you stay
tuned for our next video which we're
going to get into intense and no that's
not intense its intense you meant to do
something we're going to go ahead and
show you that and some tricks on what
you can do to make that a very useful
make your phone a little bit faster and
more user friendly if you like this kind
of stuff go ahead and give us a thumbs
up so that all of your friends know that
you like this kind of stuff if you
haven't subscribed to our video channel

a lot of really cool videos like our
upcoming speech videos so make sure you
