specifications Verizon's HTC one gets
leaked renders in a possible release
date and the iphone 5s seems to be all
about lte-advanced I'm hi mera neta and
the million-dollar question I have for
you is if you remember what you did this
weekend because I don't and this is
 out daily I'm going to call this
rumor day and you're gonna see why let's
start it off with Apple is we've got
some more information on the iphone 5s
we know it's going to get some
enhancements in the camera in the
battery but apparently the company is
also working on bringing LTE advanced as
a standard on this phone and did you buy
the fact that t-mobile and other
carriers are confirming that they're
gonna have LTE advanced by the end of
this year that is good news now let's
talk about verizon and hccs I know many
of you are waiting for the one to reach
big red because the droid DNA is sadly
not cutting it anymore so far well it
seems that we have some leaked press
renders of this phone and it's got a sep
tember fifth date on a display which
usually leaks the date that the phone is
gonna get released so I know it's gonna
be a long wait but for many of you it's
worth it as long as the HTC to doesn't
make it before that and for those of you
waiting for the galaxy note 3 most of us
were speculating that Sammy was going to
hold a separate event as they've had
with pretty much every galaxy if they
launched this year but as it turns out
some links say that it's gonna be
announced on September fourth and that
happens with an ephah in Berlin which is
the time that every Galaxy Note has been
launched in the past so we're gonna be
at Aoife and regardless if they're gonna
have a separate event or an event with a
neat but we're gonna be there so stay
tuned and if there's one tablet that I'm
waiting for this year is Google's future
Nexus 7 I don't know what we're waiting
for but as it turns out we've got some
leaked specifications from an employee
to shoes and it's going to have 1980 x
1200 display 32 gigabytes of storage
will apparently be standard now and as
it turns out we are gonna get a back 5
megapixel camera as well along with
other specification 'he's links down
below for full details and descriptions
on these specifications and android 4.3
will definitely make it the question is
when and finally for the hot rumor of
the day because it's all been rumors
well we've got some leaked press renders
of the Sony onami
and even though it does seem quite
simplistic on the photo wait a second
there's a wrong done from this phone and
listen to this you get a Snapdragon 800
but you get a 20 megapixel camera on
this phone and no forget about the 20
megapixels apparently this camera is
capable of filming and 4k resolution
that means 4 x 1920 x 1080 that is
amazing really amazing it would be
pretty much the first phone that's able
to film in 4k resolution even if I'm
probably not going to be able to afford
one of those TVs for the next five years
but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day with 4k filming and
a 20 megapixel camera make you consider
Sony as they really haven't taken off
and their expiry lineup lately in my
particular case I would love the idea of
having it I just don't know if I'll be
able to actually watch it for the next
half decade as i said but anyways leave
us a comment down below what do you
