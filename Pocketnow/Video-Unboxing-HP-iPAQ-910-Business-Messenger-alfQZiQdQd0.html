out
this is the video unboxing of the HP
iPAQ 900 series just got a 9/10 business
message arriving on my doorstep today
which we'll be testing for the next
couple of weeks what can you expect well
this is one of the few if not only
windows mobile 6.1 professional devices
sporting a permanent landscape purity
bar form factor something I really do
like it sports a Marvel PXA 270
processor or offering for 16 megahertz
quad-band GSM edge and tri-band 3g HSDPA
Wi-Fi 802 bici bluetooth 2.0 with EDR
multimode GPS navigation which I don't
know what it is and I'm gonna try to
figure out later on an interesting
combination of a QVGA resolution on a
tiny 2.4 inch screen 3 megapixel camera
with a flash 128 megabytes of RAM 250
256 megabytes of ROM it weighs 154 grams
measures 2.5 by 4.5 by dot 6 inches
let's open the box I'm gonna close it up
a bit to see what HP chose to offer with
this device give me a second here sing
really nice arts here nice box I really
do like it looks exactly like the 200
series box and well here's the device
work that I look into that a bit later
we have a 1940 milliamp hour battery wow
this is one very big thing I like it
let's see we have standard headphones
nice USB cable ok that's good we have a
standard charger and that it's also many
of us be good I like this we don't have
any leather cover and we do not have any
spare stylus ouch I don't like that we
have a welcome via veneto and I don't
know how you say the French part and
then we have the rest of the warranty
information we have some CDs here which
I'll look into later see what they are
and well let's move all this aside let's
look into the device let's see what we
have here
okay so do you want to know my honest
first impression well look at the glossy
finish in front the metallic finish on
the side and the rubberized feel at the
bottom this device is very elegant I
like that I like it to be elegant
honestly if you're business oriented you
need the device to be elegant
blackberries are elegant I love their
design and this looks like a really
really nice Windows Mobile 6 device
fitting into a BlackBerry casting if I
would say so I definitely love the
design HP kudos for this this is the
comparison most people want to see what
does the q9 look like beside the 900 and
look at the keyboard on the q9
definitely a bit more ergonomic but then
again and you get the same size screen
on both devices
but then the q9 is a bit wider the q9 is
though a bit thinner but the q9 is
Windows Mobile 6 standard if you're a
professional guy you're really
interested in more functionality and
definitely the specs on the 900 are much
better than the ones on the q9 my iPod
Touch would fit into the category of an
iPhone and if we look at it it's the
same size obviously thinner I'm not
really a fan of the iPod Touch anyways
my HTC here'll which would fit into the
category of slidable cura DS and the
same size almost as the titan ii is
definitely smaller vector if you had a
slidable curity like this device and
then obviously another device from HP
that was built with business and mine
was the 200 series but my honest feel
about the 200 series is even though you
get a VGA screen look at the size of
this device compared to the other one
the 200 series is definitely big I am
gonna miss the fact that we don't have a
belt cover and I am gonna miss the fact
that we don't have a spare stylus but my
first impression is gonna be very
positive on this device
I love how professional it looks and I
am definitely going to enjoy testing it
for the next couple of weeks so keep us
posted on the forum in case you have any
specific questions about the Neal 900
series from HP thank you very much for
