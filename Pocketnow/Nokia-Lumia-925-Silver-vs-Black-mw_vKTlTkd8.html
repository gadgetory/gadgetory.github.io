it's black or white we are still in
London at the Nokia Lumia belt and we
had the two Nokia Lumia 925 s the black
version and the wide / silver version so
let's take a look at these how they
compare which one would you like to get
the black one obviously has a black
shade around the edges this is again the
part where the aluminum lives so this
part is aluminum and if we take a look
at both of these this is how it looks we
have the natural color of the aluminum
like the one on the HTC one pure here
and the black version here and it goes
all the way around the phone nothing
else is is different on the front part
but on the back part of course you have
the same shade of black here on the
black version and the silver on the
silver version now in terms of
fingerprints that's an eternal problem
as you can see we're trying to get a
glimpse of it on the camera the black
version is more of a fingerprint magnet
than the silver version but that's
always the case with darker colors as
far as my reaction my personal favorite
right now I'd go for the black one I
don't care about the fingerprints
because it looks more classy but what is
also an awesome option so this was it
again from London I've been Anton denied
you've been watching pocket now with the
two Lumia 925 and thank everybody for
from
that's it for now take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
