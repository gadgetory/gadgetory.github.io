smartphone division now run by hmd
global is rising like a phoenix from the
ashes and while it's taken way longer
than we wanted to get our hands on a
high octane spotlight product we'd like
to welcome you to the party and in the
museum 2018 I'm hi Natalie that would
Jules wrong on camera this is our hands
on of the Nokia H Shaka and the Nokia 7
plus brought to you by invisible shield
what is a Nokia these days you know
besides the one odd that they put out
every so often to get nostalgia freaks
through the door which includes me a
hundred percent well simply put it's a
classy hardware design along with some
fancy Zeiss camera glass a very clean
near stock Android experience making it
smooth and fast with almost any spec
sheet take the don't get seven plus for
starters while polycarbonate isn't
exactly as luxurious as diamonds
there's been care taken to accent the
frame with a splash of copper to
contrast the wide spots of black and
white and give a definition in the hand
here you'll find the six inch full HD
display a two by one aspect ratio the
snapdragon 616 ur the dual camera system
can capture 12 megapixel wide shots and
13 megapixel telephoto pictures with two
times optical zoom sure it's a pretty
good phone but we can definitely go for
it here and for that meet the Nokia
eight Sirocco Ciroc oh I hope I
pronounced it right well the name like
that it has to be a piece of art and it
really is in fact we think that the
Sirocco pulls off glass sandwich design
and vogue today better than any other
two panes of curved Gorilla Glass to
meet up in a super thin beam of
stainless steel and you can actually
feel that stainless steel when you hold
it the same dual camera system of the 7
plus is placed right near the top of the
back adding in a traditional 16 by 9
plastic OLED display a 2k resolution and
you have a capable yet stout looking
phone you know its distinctive design
and something we don't mind being unique
for uniqueness sake with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 no kit is also putting in
the ability to record 24-bit audio and
up to 132 decibels that's supposed to
keep fidelity high even at loudness
levels that are supposed to damage your
ears permanently
the two new Nokia's are Android one
phone so they're subject to fast
security and OS updates expect the seven
plus out in March somewhere around 399
euros and the eight Scirocco and April
for closer to 749 yeah I know that's
steep obviously there is more coverage
from Nokia we did have an opportunity to
play a little with the banana phone and
that's a separate video because it
deserves it while you wrapped that hey
here's a warfarin wash sponsor
