camera and some other features LG has
just provided more details on when to
expect its LG g5 and the iphone 7 seems
to go big or go home this time I'm hi
Mary Vanna and I'm looking at you fedex
guy where's my package this is parking
out daily all the news lately have
everything to do with the Galaxy s7 and
everybody's asking themselves when are
we getting the LG g5 the company hasn't
really come clear as to the launch dates
but we hear that the Canadian variants
of the g5 will reach retail stores on
april eighth which is a full month away
from now so we could expect that the you
know us variants might make it to
retailers before that but we could be
wrong we will keep you posted in the
news another device that has been slow
in news lately but is still making a lot
of buzz is the iphone 7 or should we say
7s because we're talking about the
AMOLED variant for those of you
wondering exactly what will change with
this phone we've got some very
interesting sources claiming that it's
actually going to be a larger device or
at least its display is going to be
larger five point eight inches in the
diagonal compares to the 5.5 inches on
the iPhone 6s Plus this is definitely a
major difference it could mean that
Apple will invest in making the bezel
smaller or at least we hope our company
in dire straits that's doing a lot of
great stuff to reinvent itself as HTC we
hear that the company is working on a
Nexus device with Google or two but hey
apparently there is more we hear that
apparently there are up to three years
of Nexus devices being built by HTC
which is a rather interesting deal not
sure if again this starts this year but
it would be great to see both companies
partner again as they did so many years
ago yeah yeah let's move the spotlight
over to the Galaxy s7 we hear some very
interesting differences with the phone
yesterday we talked about the GPU
performance differences today we hear
that the camera sensors are different
again apparently we get the ISO
self-censor from Samsung and the Sony
sensor just like we saw with the galaxy
s6 we will definitely be testing this
out hopefully ROV units are going to
bring different sensors for it to check
for the differences but hey it seems the
battery life is not really that great on
the Galaxy s7 we've got users reporting
even less battery life than its
predecessor we will definitely be
confirming this in our review and
finally the very interesting news today
again about the Galaxy s7 mainly come
from the korea times it seems that the
company isn't really selling as many
phones as expected at least for
pre-orders it's really hard to
predictive just the Korea market doesn't
really like to preorder or if Samsung
was unable to meet the man but
apparently it's sold less units than the
galaxy s6 during the pre-order period we
have to confirm these numbers going
forward and the sad part is that Samsung
doesn't really provide these numbers
specifically for a model so hey it leads
me to the question of the day why do you
think the Galaxy s7 would sell less than
the galaxy s6 do you think that people
haven't really noticed the major
differences between both phones just
because of the design changes in my case
I believe it has a lot to do with that
marketing could only go so far leave us
