pocketnow.com and this is another look
at the software on the HTC hd2 we've
already talked about the HTC Sense
interface we've already gone through the
settings we've talked about the
multi-touch capability and the
capacitive screen now we're gonna kind
of fill in the blanks a little bit and
talk about the other pieces of software
that we haven't yet talked about and of
course we're going to talk about
everything in full coming up in the full
review where to start off by tapping on
the notification area on the top of the
screen this comes from previous versions
of HTC's touchflo 3d or HTC Sense as
they call it now from here you can
action on any notification so if you
even knew mail message can jump right to
your inbox new SMS you can jump right to
your SMS application new voice mail and
so on and so forth
you can also see what data connections
you have going on and also your battery
life by percentage they broke it down
here nicely some other HTC devices has
60% 70% now we have 68 bers percent a
more precise and measurement and of
course we can tap on any of these things
and jump to their respective application
so let's take a look of what's in the
Start menu and of course we can get to
the Start menu by tapping this button or
by using the hardware key down here now
a lot of these things listed in the
Start menu are just links back to HTC
Sense for example if we type tap HTC
calendar we're taken back to sense if we
tap on footprints or taken into HTC
Sense and so on and so forth
let's talk about the things that aren't
part of HTC Sense or at least that
homescreen interface if we go to people
we are taken to the application that
manages all of your contacts so we can
flip through all of your contacts or all
of my contacts in this case we can
search by opening this little search bar
here closing it and we can go to
favorite people and these are the
favorite people that show up on the
people tab in HTC Sense and what's
really cool about this is then it'll
give you a little icon next to any of
these favorite people if they've sent
you an email or an SMS or if you have a
voicemail from them and so for example I
have an email from John rent injure
there if I tap on his name it will
outline the email for me to the right of
that is the listing of GRU
oops that you have assigned to various
contacts to the right of that is
Facebook integration we're going to talk
more about Facebook integration in a
second and to the right of that is call
history which is something we've have
seen before in the past so let's dial
into a contact and talk more about that
so I kind of have a dummy contact set up
here and what we have here is a listing
of information for the contact we can go
in and edit the contact and we stay in
the nice HTC interface we're not taken
into the ugly windows mobile interface
we have this kind of gray look to it so
we can add more information about this
person I'm gonna click cancel and we can
go to the SMS screen this is the new SMS
screen which actually puts a little icon
of you and the person that you're
talking with it's pretty nice it's a
great way to see the threaded message
much nicer than the standard windows
mobile 6.5 the rented messaging
application to the right of that the
device will look out for email from this
person and put it all in this one screen
it's a great way to really view all of
the communication you're having with one
person to the right of that is Facebook
integration and let me show you how you
do that let's say I want to link this
person with just going down the list
these are some of my Facebook friends
I'll pick anyone even though it's not
entirely accurate I'm gonna pick this
dude so I'm gonna say yes I'm gonna link
the profile and so what's gonna happen
is that the picture is going to change
to be that guy and so if his contact
information will update and also I'll be
able to see when his birthday is
and it says updating and that will that
will continue to update we're over Wi-Fi
right now so it'll be up in a minute
and here we go it says no update no
events found no updates this person
hasn't updated their profile you can see
the little picture has changed there as
well and the birthday even updated
August 23rd is this person's birthday
and you get the idea and what's also
pretty cool is you can open their
Facebook album from this screen so it's
searching for this particular contact
and I can go to profile pictures of this
person and view all of their Facebook
pictures right on the device it's a
really great way to really interact with
someone so I'm going to go back and out
of this screen and get back into the
start menu so let's go down a little bit
more we have phone we're gonna talk
about that in the for review music which
will link you to the music tab and HTC
sense let's go to YouTube to see how
videos playback on this very large 4.3
inch display so right now it's
downloading the most viewed videos of
today okay here we are and I want to
just make sure that the settings is for
the highest quality so that you can kind
of get a feel for that let's go to high
quality and here's John Rhett injure
with a video let's take a look at how
that looks and how it streams on the hd2
and here the video comes it took a
little bit of time to download because
it is on the highest quality setting but
here it is the video quality is
fantastic I know the cameras having
trouble zooming in but believe me when I
say the quality is super smooth and it
looks really really good let's get out
of there so the YouTube application is
fantastic you can go to the program
guide this is the same YouTube
application that came on saying the HTC
Touch HD so we can drill in per category
we can search we can favorite certain
videos and you get the point from there
back into the Start menu let's see what
else we have here we have albums which
we've seen already you have the pinch to
zoom capability in the album's we have
the camera we'll talk about camera and
video quality coming up in the full
review if we go into multimedia we have
the picture and photo viewer we also
have FM radio which of course you need
to use with an attached headset to get a
signal streaming media so you can listen
to or watch em youtube.com streaming
video if you don't want to use the
dedicated player mp3 trimmer to make
ringtones from mp3s stuff that has come
on HTC devices before if we go into
games we have Teeter no solitaire no
bubble breaker and you may or may not be
happy to see that gun going down we've
get it's getting started my phone live
all this stuff you've seen before let's
go into tools and see what's in here
we've quick GPS to help get a faster GPS
signal internet sharing so
that you can tether this to a device or
a laptop or desktop remote desktop
mobile and we're gonna have a video that
talks about the desktop experience the
remote desktop experience because a
widget with such a large high-resolution
display using a remote desktop is
actually quite nice a printing utility
program for reading PDFs recording your
voice searching the phone all basic
stuff that we've seen before we have the
new HTC calculator here let's go down
the list some more in Outlook we
actually just have some PIM applications
like notes and calendar tasks and
contacts sort of the default Windows
Mobile stuff in messaging we just have
mail setup and Windows Live Messenger
going down the list if we go into cause
we have just the sim manager a lot of
empty folders not much in some of these
but HTC just put them on here to keep
the device a little bit organized we
have File Explorer which we talked about
previously here's the Wi-Fi router
program and what this allows you to do
is take your 3G connection and turn it
into a wireless hotspot it works really
well if you have a 3G connection we've
tested this program on other devices
because this is a European import I can
only get edge so it really doesn't make
sense to use this function but when it
comes to the US and you can use it as a
3G hotspot it's going to be great and
let's bounce back into the Start menu
continue down the list we have the
Facebook application which is the same
Facebook app that you can get in the
marketplace we have Bing which is of
course like Google Maps that lets you
look up the nearest gas station it lets
you do some navigation we have Opera
browser
Skyfire which I've added peope which is
a link to HTC Sense and the Twitter
application and finally copilot which
we're going to talk about in the future
video this is the onboard navigation
solution for this device that provides
really high quality navigation as good
as in most cases what you would get in a
standalone GPS unit so that was a look
at the other software that we didn't
talk about in the previous videos we've
got some more videos coming out like I
said to talk about the navigation
program and some other features of this
device if you want to see all of the
videos that we've posted about the HTC
hd2 I'll put a link up on the video now
to our
so you can access them we'll be back
soon with more content on the sexy new
HD - that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
