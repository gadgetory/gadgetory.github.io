for in-depth reviews there's a memory
for phrases like flagship killer
associated with this company and that
emotional identity can be difficult to
separate from real-world performance now
you're about to hear quite a few
criticisms in this review which might be
shocking to some of you if this is your
first real camera review on this channel
we're going to dive deep into different
shooting scenarios reviewing this phone
camera how we might review a standalone
shooter now we're all big boys and girls
so that's enough hand-holding buckle up
folks we have a lot of ground to cover
and I'm going to move pretty quick the
philosophy for the 1+5 is expanding on
the flexibility of the phone camera
oneplus includes a newer sony camera
sensor but one which is the same size as
last year's phone packin the same 16
megapixel resolution just with a
slightly faster aperture the
manufacturer focused more on improving
JPEG processing and speeding up
autofocus for the main camera sensor
this year one Plus wanted more reach and
the secondary sensor delivers the
equivalent of a 2 X optical zoom 20
megapixel resolution while also
providing fun software background bokeh
blur starting off with exposure and
saturation this phone meters really well
most phones push exposure brighter than
they need to trying to impress consumers
with juicy vibrant images and while the
one plus 5 is no exception it's one of
the more reasonable performers we've
tested this year occasional clips
highlights but happily this phone is not
trying to overtly boost brightness
colors are kept in check while saturated
with a little eye candy to please
blues and greens are looking great
though uniformed sections of sky can
feel a bit busy moving over to warmer
colors like yellows were hanging on to
terrific petal texture reds are always
tricky for digital sensors but they look
great here considering less of the funky
magenta we might see on some competitors
and we're not clipping as many details I
would like to see just a touch more of
the difference between these two
varieties of blossoms the right flowers
are a bit more pink IRL but this is
overall very good color processing white
balance leans on the warm side which in
los-angeles afternoon light is very
pleasing oneplus plays well with the
quality of light and this prevents shade
shots from feeling too cold ditto
low-light photos where there's a
priority placed on the color of light
over trying to find the true scientific
white of your subject it looks a bit
gross here on this terrible security
light but it'll look great on a concert
shot looking at dynamic range we get a
good amount of info to work with in RAW
files but overexposing by two stops as
the phone meters we can't walk back this
brightness on the wall users get a solid
stop and a half safety zone for
overexposing which isn't bad but is
another reason I'm very happy with how
this phone meters when shooting in auto
mode it was exceedingly rare I felt the
need to dial back more than half a stop
lens quality punches above the price tag
a very nice piece of glass with a
minimum of flaring even at night lamps
stay pretty crisp this lens is prone to
fringing and ghosting though on high
contrast borders but it's most
noticeable when pixel peeping so just
don't do that the wider aperture can
make your subject a bit soft when
working at the phone's closest focusing
distance but otherwise we think folks
are going to be happy when viewing their
compositions as a whole now speaking of
macro the phone can get a bit confused
at its absolute minimum focusing
distance but this aperture helps balance
the slightly smaller sensor size with a
pleasant bouquet you got to work close
to naturally blur a background with a
phone but with dual sensors we can also
fire up the portrait mode pretty much
copy pasted from the iPhone line up your
subject and if the distance and light
are right the effect pops into place
it's software so sometimes edge
detection will miss but it gets our tiny
phone sensors a lot closer to the depth
of field of a larger sensor camera by
design that second sensor is included to
give us more reach a single press pops
us over to the 2x zoom and from there
cropping will zoom farther image quality
is good when you feed it good light
whether this is your cup of tea depends
on what you like to shoot some might
find a wider angle shooter more flexible
but at its maximum this setup will get
us a little closer to a far-off subject
especially when compared to a lower
resolution camera the zoom sensor is the
same size but with smaller pixels and it
has a smaller aperture so it's not the
strongest in darker situations at night
often the phone seems to revert to the
sensor at least in manual mode the raw
capture seems to come from the main
sensor only I'm not sure that the extra
resolution on the zoom sensor is a
benefit though it gives you a bit more
room to crop but the smaller photo sites
often result in more aggressive noise
reduction even in good light and after a
minor crop zoom shots can come out a bit
splotchy or with details looking a bit
like a watercolour painting speaking of
low-light dull we're working with a
slightly smaller sensor with a higher
resolution than many flagships and
without Hardware stabilization nighttime
captures are handled well the user has
to hold a bit steadier but it wasn't any
great difficulty pulling off a rear
camera selfie knowing there would be a
longer shutter speed even for candid and
Street shots the action of firing up and
quickly taking a shot discreetly these
results are much better than expected a
bit grainy er than some might like but
easily competitive and usually besting
phones like the LG g 6 oneplus has
spruced up focusing speed and accuracy
it won't unseat a dual pixel camera but
the actual focus acquisition has a
really pleasing slide into locking onto
your subject looking at this video it's
almost smooth enough to be a rack focus
between subjects free of the pulse or
overshoot recover action found on many
other phones and checking out high
dynamic range oneplus also delivers one
of the better solutions for merging
multiple exposures highlights are nicely
balanced against boosting shadow
information the phone is already
restraining brightness with standard
shots so we're not having to recover
from clipped highlights without Hardware
stabilization the user does need to hold
steady for the shot to be completed a
subject in motion can also ruin an HDR
shot trying to merge the differences in
several captures unfortunately panorama
performance is rather poor the 1+5 will
let you capture a full 360 degrees but
over the course of several tests we
found very strange aberrations in photo
stitching these are early days for the
phone and we're confident what we see
here are some software gremlins which
need to be addressed I'm not the biggest
fan of selfie shots but the oneplus is
front camera is a respectable option
like the rear camera exposures are
well-balanced and the app includes the
requisite skin blurring modes people
seem to enjoy these days a video maxes
out at 1080p in the front glass is a bit
more prone to flaring but this is a
better-than-average option for folks
looking to do some vlogging on the go
the oneplus rear cameras capture a
high-quality UHD video with similar
exposure and saturation to the still
shots we enjoy but it becomes clear
rather quickly that there is a lack of
any image stabilization when shooting at
the max resolution all handheld shots
are going to be shaky which is a shame
we've seen what older phones with less
powerful chipsets can do to smooth out
video switching to 1080p we're treated
to deliciously smooth output more
evidence for my hypothesis that mixing
hardware and software stabilization is
often more destructive than picking one
or the other this is great but comes at
the expense of clarity and resolution
definitely the area we most hope to see
addressed in a future update adding to
the video disappointment audio
performance is also poor the phone is
working significantly harder than is
necessary to reduce noise so most videos
in real world situations suffer from a
significant reduction of quality that's
often manifest as an airy or hissy sound
with little clarity or detail even in
fairly quiet environments
now looking at slow-mo the oneplus tops
out at 720p but it's a respectably high
quality bit rate while captured decent
detail it's not going to be
class-leading but it is fun to play with
examining the apt layout and performance
the hardware is obviously inspired by a
competitor but the camera app has more
of a oneplus feel simplicity rules the
day with three primary modes available
through gestures additional modes
available through a hamburger menu which
thankfully doesn't completely remove you
from your composition window though
additional settings through this gear
icon will a video remains mostly full
auto but folks who want more control
over photos will enjoy this manual mode
and I like this slider layout for making
quick adjustments performance is
excellent firing up the app saving
photos capturing RAW images and shooting
video we found precious few moments
where this app fell unresponsive
occasionally on this early software the
shutter would lock up while the focus
was hunting we'd get a burst of shots
all at once after recovering while I
really like this layout it does
introduce one small gripe for video this
shaded bar housing the shutter button
takes up quite a bit of space almost a
third of the display where you can't
focus it causes a tendency to center
punch your subject or frame left just to
make sure you can focus and speaking of
that focus while the system is much
improved the actual focus indicator is
rather large if you're trying to lock in
on fine details it can sometimes obscure
enough of your subject that you won't
quite know if what you want is properly
in focus and lastly there is an oddity
with exposure in manual mode where
adjusting the brightness doesn't stay
put once you tap spot metering takes
over so even if this is showing +2 it
will reset and expose back to zero you
have to tap focus first then adjust this
slider and the setting won't stay the
next time you focus so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us with the
cameras on the 1 + 5 well this is a fun
little shooter it's not pushing
boundaries it lacks the character we
might find from more exotic photography
partnerships it
missing the consistency in the video
stabilization we might find on a
similar-looking phone but oneplus mostly
delivers where it counts the core photo
experience is good - very good in most
conditions we faced evolution is
critical while I'm a bit disappointed to
be losing the hardware image
stabilization we enjoyed on the 3t we
see a number of improvements in other
areas over last year's phone with the
addition of a zoom camera sensor to
expand on some of the fun there's
certainly room for improvement a number
of issues we hope are sorted out in
future software updates but this camera
shouldn't disappoint casual shooters
