secure communications above all we had a
look at it in Barcelona back in February
and now we're going hands-on in the
pocket now review booth I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow join us as we
unbox blackphone the handheld that looks
to take mobile privacy to the next level
our review unit comes to us from our
friends at GSM nation a premium
smartphone retailer and wholesaler if
you want a black phone of your own do
what we did visit gsm nation comm and
tell them PocketNow sent you if a device
calls itself the black phone you can
probably assume it's going to come in a
black box no disappointments there and
thankfully it's not the indestructible
type cutting the security seal gets us a
fairly standard unboxing experience once
we get past the cardboard top layer
anyway
the phone itself is wrapped in a soft
plastic envelope that protects it from
damage and also heightens the mystery
underneath it is the usual bevy of inbox
accessories including documentation
battery with a slightly concerning 2000
milliamp hour capacity a data cable and
various charging adapters and finally
something we're always grateful to see a
set of earbuds that look very fancy
indeed pulling the black phone from its
recyclable pouch we're struck by how
completely nondescript it is besides the
logo on the back side there's nothing on
this Hardware of any note whatsoever and
even after we pop in the battery and
snap the cover back in place it's
incredible just how light the device
feels will withhold judgment on this for
now and content ourselves with peeling
the screen protector in the hoity-toity
way to which you're accustomed
quiet please powering on the black phone
for the first time gives us a prompt to
choose an unlock pin and then an
invitation to encrypt our data now this
is not just a throw away security buzz
phrase it's a long process that takes up
to an hour to complete you have to plug
the device in using the top mounted USB
port which is kind of awkward but it's
not the first time we've seen a power
port up there
but once encryption is finished you're
welcomed to a phone that looks
suspiciously like stock Android but in
place of the usual Google Apps there's a
suite of pre-installed titles from
silent circle and it immediately puts
you to work choosing and entering
passwords to jumpstart your new life of
private mobile communications how well
does it all work we'll see in our black
phone review coming soon and stay tuned
also for details on a special black
phone giveaway till then let us know
down in the comments what you want
covered in the full review and tune into
the pocket net weekly podcast Friday
August 8th where we'll have this very
black phone live on the air and we'll be
taking your questions about it until
next time this has been michael fisher

twitter thanks again to gsm nation for

we'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
