gives us a glimpse at a better modular
design more rumors claim that Samsung is
taking steps to iris scanners on the
Galaxy Note seven and we get more
details on the pricing of the one plus
three I'm hi Mary that I end up yeah I
have to admit I've watch Deadpool
probably one too many times this week
this is parking out daily the official
lose today begin with deals those of you
in the market for a SmartWatch what if
my all-time favorites has always been
the first generation Moto 360 sure the
new Moto 360 is cooler more powerful but
I love that design with no lugs from the
past if you're in the market for
smartwatch it's currently ninety nine
dollars on ebay for the full metallic
variant that is a steal I would highly
suggest you get it and after the teasers
for the camera quality of the one plus
three obviously everybody was like yeah
right let's just see how it performs at
night because almost every smartphone
can do a good job during the day and
well we've got that answered there are
some teasers over night photography of
fireworks and so far so good even more
interesting apparently there are various
variants up to three price options that
range from 308 dollars a 380 can't wait
to see what we get now everything that
we've talked about when it comes to the
iris scanner of the galaxy note 7 is
mainly either speculation or predictions
this time we actually find the modes
within the smartphone that turned this
feature on or off and given the fact
that there is this galaxy tab iris that
was designed for the enterprise and it's
completely horrible it does make sense
for samsung to want to make this
productivity phone a thing that's
focused on the enterprise just think
about it we've got the rumors of the
blackberry hub type software update in
addition to this iris scanner it seems
that samsung wants to make this phone
and enterprise thing even though yes
consumers will go crazy about it
including me now for those of you that
have been following lenovo world today
true the keynote was a sort of terrible
but we did get some very good products
today including the new fab to pro which
is their first project tango
product it's a smartphone it's huge six
point four inches in diagonal when it
comes to the display specifications are
premium mid-range pretty much but
obviously the whole showcase here is you
know project tango the whole concept of
sort of augmented reality and be able to
map an area and want even recording some
videos on his Instagram he was at the
event showing us how he could augment
the reality of his nerve shooting it
looked all very cool can't wait to get
our hands on one for review and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with the new moto Z lineup because these
are two phones the Moto Z and the Moto Z
force the force being the device that
brings a shatterproof display in
addition to a larger battery but in the
specs are the same we've got the same
cameras we got the same Snapdragon 820
processor all flagship specifications
but what makes these phones cool in
addition to their sleek design is the
moto mods because Ashton Kutcher was
actually on the keynote showing us that
hey you can replace the backs with any
colors you want or fabrics you want you
can replace these with an extended
battery you can replace these with a JBL
speaker back in addition to a pico
projector that nobody's going to use or
spend money on but hey the sky's the
limit as this is open to third-party
developers you want to know what the
only problem is the fact that they are
exclusive to verizon at the beginning
and we don't know when they're going to
be open to gsm carriers but hey it leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think about these two new moto Z's
one and what do you think about the fact
that they're exclusive to verizon I hate
exclusive smartphones I totally do I
feel that it completely hinders the
possibility of the market and in the
case of moto moto needs that traction of
other carriers these products are
actually very cool we cannot wait to
give them a try but leave us a comment
down below we would love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
