pacu now calm and this is another
episode of the windows phone 7 app
roundup in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started this application is called
big oven and there's over 170,000
recipes on this application alone so you
can either search through a recipe or
you can use up my leftover so that's a
pretty cool feature lets go to there and
I like to do is add three ingredients
and I'm going to choose the third one
let's choose some rice and what can I
make and wait for to load so let's say I
want to make the southwest chicken
skillet I can click on here get an
overview of the directions and
ingredients go to photos and view
previous photos and also go to reviews
handy scan is great application if you
want to save receipts take photos of a
book so you can read it on your device
here or just save other sort of
documents so I have a receipt here that
I have so let's say that I'm tired of
carrying this receipt I'll have to do is
hit scan you document and go to start
and now I have to do is take a picture
of this hit accept and it will render
the image into a more clear format so i
click this one here and now i have the
optimized image the harvest is a rather
visually intense xbox live game in which
you must defend Earth from the incoming
aliens so let's move along and I'll find
some more enemies and it's pretty simple
to use I like to do is drag my finger
across the screen to navigate my little
character here and to destroy an enemy
I'll just lock on I can also use a
seismic jump let's click this I can use
a seismic jump and DoubleTap my
character so I just continue to the game
to try to destroy more enemies and save
the world hockey is an air hockey game
in which you can play with your friends
so this is a two player game so it's
pretty simple all you do this with one
person on the blue side and one person
on the red side so the arch of the game
is pretty simple all you do is shoot the
puck into the opposing team's goal which
is this a semi-circle greyed out area
over here so let's shoot the puck and
it's kind of difficult playing by
yourself but let's see if we can get
over there and let's shoot again oh darn
okay and once you score a point it shows
up on the scoreboard Yelp is a great
application if you want to find
practically anything in your proximity
so let's say that I wanted to find a
restaurant I do is click here I can
search for a specific name so I'm just
going to click on restaurants and it's
going to search for the restaurants
nearby and i found this peking garden
that looks somewhat interesting so i'll
just click on there it looks like
they've got three and a half stars on
its rating and the price is moderately
priced Chinese food so I can view images
down here I can also view other reviews
that people have written I can also call
the restaurant and get Matt so this has
been another episode of the windows
