everyone it's anton front pocket now and
we are here at CES slow at samsung and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.4 with
the earpiece so let's take a look so
apparently Samsung wants you to use this
tablet in 8 portrait mode because it has
an earpiece up top which you can of
course will to your head and the entire
front fascia is following that portrait
orientation with the buttons placed
right here and not on the sides now
since we are talking about the front we
have an 8.4 inch display with the same
resolution as on the 22 inch display
which is a whopping 2560 by 1600 for a
huge PPI rating I don't know it by heart
but the you can calculate yourself on
the back we have the a pronoun pixel
camera with the LED flash and there's
the same faux leather with the stitching
which samsung grouts uhit's entire
tablet lineup from CES up top there's a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
turning it to the side it will have the
power button volume rockers the IR
blaster going to the bottom we have the
down firing speakers and the other side
holds a slot for the micro SD and of
course for a sim because you can use
this as a bone if you're willing to put
that up to your ear behind the screen
there's a Snapdragon 800 processor or an
Exynos 5 processor depending on the
version 2 gigs of ram 16 years of
storage which is of course expandable
and powering everything up is android
for a quarter to
which is of course get get I have no
idea how to bring out the red screen
like this okay I'm jumping back on top
of Android we have the new magazine UI
which looks a little bit weird in
portrait so you can always switch it
into landscape and that's more like it
as far as multitasking goes you can of
course access the menu from the side you
can open as much as many applications as
you wish and of course you can use while
dragging these no more than two on this
smaller version of the tablet let's try
once again with the dialer because of
course we don't have a screen real
estate which allows us to even though
I'm trying to do so but now it will
replace the second spot so we'll have a
lot more on this of course with the
other comparisons coming up and an
in-depth look at everything Samsung has
to offer ICS have an aunt on Michael
behind the camera Taylor still doing
video but a good job at that thank you
very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
