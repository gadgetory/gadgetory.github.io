new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and when it's not shiny and new
anymore I'm having that event with
pocket now this is the HTC One m8 and
this is episode 36 of after the buzz
it's been three months since HTC
launched its HTC One m8 to the market
and after our extensive coverage of one
of the most beautifully designed phones
of the year it's time to take a second
look at times when samsung is making
headlines with its galaxy s5 and LG with
its g3 and all the rumors of the iPhone
6 but we still recommend that you buy
the HTC One m8 after the buzz in a quick
answer yes and let's go through the
reasons why surely HTC devices aren't as
popular as iPhones or Galaxy phones
today but trust me that has nothing to
do with the quality of its products I've
been using the HTC One m8 for a month
now and in all honesty this is finally
the Android phone that made me forget
the iPhone it's not just the fact that
it's beautifully crafted nor the fact
that it's got the year's hottest
specification z' it's really the fact
that this phone does everything well are
probably better than most of the phones
that I've used for example hardware this
brushed aluminum doesn't only look great
but it feels great there's this
coefficient of friction in the metal in
the display that I really can't explain
but when you hold the phone it really
feels great and that matters to me even
more important is the fact that I've
dropped this phone twice already and it
even seems to hide dings on the corners
quite better than almost every plastic
and aluminum foam that I've used
I haven't babied this phone at all and
really it looks like new I'm not a fan
of cases but this dokdo case is actually
the first one that I actually enjoy
using it doesn't make the phone look any
thicker and surely I wish that the hinge
was not as stiff as it is but you know
the fact that I'm actually able to
interact with the phone and the fact
that it makes it look like something out
of a science-fiction movie just makes
this case relevant for me I don't know
for you aside from that it's the display
that's gorgeous and the color accuracy
being one of my favorite features though
yes I would have preferred a phone with
less bezels even more important the
quality of its speakers and the fact
that their front firing is just making
me ask myself why other OEMs don't take
your experience consuming multimedia
content with the speaker's more
seriously honestly this should set the
bar for where speakers are placed in
smart phones going
forward no excuses whether it's the
specification x' or the features my
overall hardware impression of this
phone is that I'm actually getting more
for my money and that's really something
that I do care about then if we go to
software the story gets even better I'll
admit that I hate every single Android
skin that I've used except for this one
if CC Sense 6 gives Android an added
level of elegance and functionality that
I haven't found anywhere else I love how
you can slide from left to right in
different filters for your contacts your
calendar and I simply love the fact that
this whole skin doesn't bog the phone
down at all now my favorite feature is
the way you can activate the phone
through gestures having the power button
at the top is extremely annoying but the
fact that these gestures make you be
able to activate blinkfeed or activate
the phone or go directly somewhere just
makes this phone actually really cool to
use and yes speaking of blinkfeed uh
even though it's not one of my favorite
features it's there it's an added value
it looks quite cool and it's even aged
better than most other software options
because honestly now you can do more
with it specifically with social media
which is really something that you care
about and that's really what I like
about it even though I'll admit I rarely
use it all this paired with HD sees
excellent track record when it comes to
software updates in the past 2 years and
the fact that it's already committed to
Android L and even more important I
don't know if you've noticed this but
Sensex actually looks like Android L in
a way it's all code for an excellent
experience the more this phone ages down
the road now probably my biggest reason
to keep this phone over every other
phone that I've tested is honestly my
user experience they give you an example
I was reluctant to get the HTC one last
year mainly because of the four
megapixel camera but I'll admit that I'm
not disappointed in using this camera
first of all it's a different sensor and
yes I do admit that I miss being able to
zoom into photos that I've already taken
to get rid of some areas that I don't
want but you know for everything else
this camera actually takes some really
nice photos both in daylight and a night
they are good and you know this phone
takes photos faster than any other
camera that I've used and that's
actually very important
when you couple that with the software
experience that okay effects that you're
able to create with the dual camera and
its unique gallery application just
makes a difference
once you couple that with HCC Zoe the
video quality of the camera and again
the fact that you can actually enhance
the photos a lot after you take them and
it's actually a good reason to use this
phone especially again if you only use
this camera for social media performance
has also been good I've never seen this
phone stutter on graphic intensive games
nor on the basics and the fact that you
have expandable storage makes the
experience a lot better though I will
admit when it comes to games in
particular that this phone does heat up
a bit and if you're not in the game this
battery life folk get you through more
than a day probably one of the best
experiences in battery life that I've
had so far even though yes this is no
Galaxy Note 3 but you know even cooler I
don't know why but this phone charges
faster than every other phone that I've
used then that even includes the iPhone
5s which was the best in my list using
this phone for phone calls is also a
pleasure whether it's up to your ear or
using the boom sound speakers for phone
calls honestly there is just no way to
go wrong with these speakers they sound
better than anything in the market and
yes this should set the bar for
everybody else it's really hard to stop
using this phone for something as simple
as the speakers and the call quality
and with that final phrase it's time to
answer the basic question that
everybody's here for but we still
recommend that you buy the HTC One m8
after the buzz well if you want the best
smartphone experience that most of us
have had the HTC One m8 is right for you
I would have personally liked this phone
if it would have had a the same display
on a shorter chassis and because of my
personal fitness needs I would have
loved this phone if it were waterproof
but that aside when it comes to your
experience honestly I've been using the
iPhone 5s I have the galaxy s5 available
to me and I honestly will not let the
HTC One m8 go I want to keep this phone
I've enjoyed it a lot I don't want to
stop using it and I really have to
praise HTC for that particularly they
have a well thought out phone here and
honestly this HTC One m8 a superior it
is just superior than every other phone
that I've used and I want to keep using
it that's it for episode 36 of after the
buzz thank you very much for watching do
