taking advantage of the solar eclipse
for a reason rivers of the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plain that the phone is going
modular and it seems that Google wants
to compete with air pods though adding
an assistant touch I'm Jaime Rivera and
yesterday was crazy but it was worth it
we have an essential phone expect
coverage very soon this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for a
really good and inexpensive Android
smartphone the Alcatel idol 5s continues
to be one of our favorite phones one
rooted recently and really it's too much
of a phone for how much it cost and it's
currently available on Amazon for just
216 dollars obviously there are kind of
a couple of catches you can learn more
about them in the link in the
description now it's all about Samsung
and Bixby I have yet to set up Bixby in
any on my phones I mean I just don't
really care about it yet but the company
has finally decided to expand it 200
countries have been added to the list
you can now pretty much start using
Bixby on your Galaxy s8 as a plus or
active the only thing is that it
currently only works in English for
those expanded countries but hey it's a
step in the right direction at least
it's working and speaking of Samsung
let's discuss the Samsung Galaxy S 9
because yeah the rumors are already
early we've got trusted sources claiming
two things number one that the
snapdragon 845 will pretty much be
exclusive to this phone at the beginning
because the company has already made its
deals with qualcomm and you know the way
that goes and the second thing is that
apparently this device is going to be
modular this is going to be one of the
major features of the galaxy s 9 though
obviously we wonder exactly what that
modularity would be as the company is
now implementing dual cameras on the
note 8 and we kind of don't like the
idea but anyways stay tuned as the
rumors will continue to expand now let's
talk about Google as a source code that
was recently leaked shows us what the
company is doing when it comes to
devices apparently they're working a new
project called Bisto and it seems that
it will compete with the air Potts the
whole concept here is a smart pair of
headphones that have some sort of Google
assistant functionality how will that be
or when will this product be available
hopefully whenever the next pixels get
announced we should learn more soon and
finally the very hot news
yesterday obviously we had a very busy
day had to do with Android 8 dotto Oreo
which was pretty much announced with the
solar eclipse now we totally understand
the purpose for Google to do this
announcement particularly on August 21st
we have the new operating system faster
boot times for the pixel in addition to
picture in picture mode better
background management a lot of cool
things are coming to this new operating
system and obviously it's already
available for those of you that are
testing out betas etc but you know the
biggest and most polarizing question
that everybody is asking is what do you
think of the name Oreo I mean do you
think that it's a good name do you think
that there would better options do you
like it or not in my case I wish they
would have just stuck with Android oh
and that we would just stick to letters
going forward I mean what is Android Z
going to be called anyways leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
