together there HTC's flagship
smartphones from last year and 2015 and
we're putting them head-to-head to see
what's changed and what hasn't I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is HTC One m9 vs. HTC One m8 if you
don't see much difference on the outside
here well you're not alone both the m8
and m9 are tall aluminium slabs with
intricate details and distinctive
adornments like prominent front firing
speakers the screens aren't just the
same size they're the same resolution
and the same display technology if it
weren't for the slightly cooler and
greener whites on the newer phone I'd
say they were the same exact panel pick
them up and the differences start to
bring out you won't find the unlock
button up top like it was on the m8 for
the newer phone it's off to the side
where it probably should have been all
along
also you're less likely to drop the one
m9 it's got a grippy or coating on the
back cover and its sides are boxier with
more pronounced edges and a glossy
finish to contrast with the brushed
hairline many changes are even more
subtle than these the volume control has
been split from a single rocker into two
buttons on the m9 and the bezel around
the display is now single piece as nice
as these improvements are on camera
you're going to want to hold both of
them yourself to see which you prefer
while I came to find last year's ma both
too slippery and a bit too tall I still
prefer it's smoother thinner more
ergonomic feel in hand the crisp edges
of the m9 are good-looking but they're
definitely not as comfortable at least
on our silver and gold review sample
same with the m9 s new button studded
side rail which is attractive but
confusing under a thumb I do appreciate
the grippy or coating on the m9 though
and the sapphire lens cover on the new
phone's camera should help save it from
becoming the scratched up mess that many
m8 lenses became the one I made already
got an Android lollipop update and it'll
soon receive an upgrade to the newest
version of sense that ships on the M now
that's since seven and it brings a host
of improvements that we flesh out in our
full review just to touch on the main
points since gets full theme ability in
the new version with everything from
typeface to icon packs to keyboard color
fully customizable and you can finally
choose which toggles you want down in
the home key Road - since seven also
uses the lock screen to show you nearby
dining destinations around mealtimes and
it tries to predict which apps you'll
need and when based on whether you're at
home and work or just out on the town
that functionality comes courtesy of a
widget that also includes folders for
downloaded and recommended apps part of
HTC's attempt to rescue us from the app
launcher which it equates to antic ated
desktop computing models other changes
are very minor and there's little in the
hardware to make me believe that any of
it will be exclusive to the m9 so let's
move on to the biggest comparison point
the camera with the one m9 HTC didn't so
much ditch its ultra pixel camera as
move it the four megapixel sensor has
been switched to selfie taking duty on
the new flagship without standing
results the ultra pixel photos are
sharper cleaner and brighter than those
of last year's more conventional FFC
meanwhile back in the back the old
much-maligned duo camera depth sensor
has been eliminated for the m9 making
room for a more traditional 20 megapixel
shooter and F 2.2 lens on the newer
phone comparing photo outputs
side-by-side it seems at first like HTC
made the right call here while some
shots don't look all that different
others dramatically illustrate the
advantage of more pixels there's a
massive upgrade in sharpness with the m9
there's less chromatic aberration and
also less lens distortion at the edges
it's the same deal indoors with ample
lighting everything's crisper and
cleaner on the m9 even though the m8
didn't set too high a bar in this regard
the newer phone superiority is striking
and a back-to-back comparison contrast
sees a sizable boost too and it's pretty
easy to get a nice bouquet effect with
the m9 without the fancy duo camera and
without losing any of the added
sharpness but don't go thinking this is
a slam-dunk
and 100% crops the m8 still picks out
detailed at the m9 misses also the
dimmer the scene gets the tougher it
becomes to get focus with the newer
device in fact everything gets worse for
the m9 after the Sun Goes Down it's
low-light photos are almost always
greener grayer and grainy err than its
predecessors things get a bit better if
you switch the m9 from automatic into
night mode but then you've got to deal
with a really terrible framerate in the
viewfinder and the output gets much
noisier to note the lack of readability
in the sign when we switch from m8 to m9
despite having many more pixels the
newer phone produces the blurry or photo
not to play the what-if game but it's
hard not to wonder what benefit optical
stabilization would have been in this
situation
take away the m9 s resolution advantage
by switching over to 1080p video and
things don't get any better there's much
more saturation in the m8 s footage the
m9 just makes everything sort of look
grey and lifeless by comparison
that's indoors outside the newer phone
has a different kind of problem with
color I have no idea where this bizarre
bluish cast came from also notice the
focus issue here this is because the m9
comes set to lock focus in video right
out of the box which doesn't make much
sense to me fortunately you can set it
to continuous autofocus and it gets
better but it's still quick to wander
and as noisy as anything turn the lights
way down for the dark tea tunnel test
and well do I really need to spell it
out
fortunately for the m9 it's capable of
shooting in 4k resolution while the
older phone isn't and more importantly
the m9 also has tons of camera tricks
that are so fun they helped you forget
the sensors shortcomings for details on
each of those check out our full review
as for which camera is quote-unquote
better the answer depends on what time
of day you take most of your photos and
videos and yeah that's as disappointing
an answer as ever the one m9 gets its
processing power from a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 system on a chip though
it's just a digit swap away from the
Snapdragon 801 and the older phone it's
a completely different beast in terms of
architecture and design and you know
what it's basically impossible to tell
the difference
performance-wise the one m9 and One m8
are almost indistinguishable outside of
benchmarks whether it's everyday
scrolling and swiping or hardcore gaming
there's an additional gig of ram in the
newer phone but again you wouldn't know
it not because the m9 is bad but because
both phones are so Swift of course
that's for now the m9 will likely be
supported for longer because it's the
newer phone and it may age better to its
Android and it's apps take better
advantage of 64-bit architecture over
time there's one small performance
reason some folks might prefer the older
phone it's boom sound is a little boom
here it's impossible to illustrate on
microphone but in person the newer
devices sound is a little thinner a
little tinny err whether we're in music
or theater mode this is likely a result
of HTC focusing more on Dolby
optimization with the m9 shooting for a
more dynamic sound rather than just a
louder one but it sure surprised me when
I preferred the beats coming out of the
m8
other changes under the hood mainly
favor the m9 depending on which version
you buy the newer phone offers up to 21
bands of LTE compatibility three times
that of its predecessor it also packs a
bigger battery more color choices and
simplified storage options in the US the
m9 comes only in a 32 gig trim
thankfully it offers the same microSD
expansion as the earlier phone given the
relative parity and performance the
inconsistent camera improvements and the
very similar builds here folks looking
to choose between the One m8 and One m9
will need to focus very closely on the
details the m9 is less slippery but also
less economic the m8 has a better
low-light camera but an older processor
that may not age as gracefully and that
goes for other elements too like it's
battery still it's kind of crazy how
much you won't miss if you decide to go
for last year's model rather than this
year's if you're in the market for a new
Android right now clearly we recommend
the newer device but if you just
recently bought a One m8 and you're
kicking yourself
well don't you're not really missing out
on much remember everyone this is just a
point by point comparison for much more
on the HTC One m9 including feedback on
software battery life and more see our
