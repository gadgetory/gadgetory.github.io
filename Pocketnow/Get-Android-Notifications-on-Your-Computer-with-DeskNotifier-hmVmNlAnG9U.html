it's nice to get notifications on our
smartphones or our tablets but a lot of
us spend quite a bit of our time sitting
in front of our desktop or laptop
computers wouldn't it be nice if we got
those same notifications instead of on
our small screen but on our big screen
you can with this app I'll show you how
so the app that I'm going to show you
today is called a desk notifier you can
see I've got it connected right here
there's also an icon for it up in the
status bar I'm going to go ahead and
open that up and you'll see my settings
this is a two part solution there's a
part that runs on your smartphone or
tablet and another that runs on your
desktop PC I'll show you that in just a
moment you can see here I've got an
option to stop the service so it's going
to essentially stop doing what you want
it to do which is notify you you can
test it I'll show you that in just a
moment that's where that test is going
to be coming from and then you've got
some accessibility settings let's jump
in there
now this lets you essentially show some
third-party events if you will an awful
lot of stuff that you can do in here
just leave it a default and we'll be
good now let me clarify these are the
default accessibility settings this is
the new one added by the the desk
notifier app itself
it adds itself as an accessibility
service so that it can expose some of
these notification events through well
your accessibility service you can turn
that on or you can turn that off just
very simply right there of course you
should probably have it on to make it
work properly auto start you want this
thing to start automatically when you
turn on your your phone or your tablet
make sure that's checked show a
notification bar that's that little
circle I if I don't want to see that up
in the status bar I can tap and you
notice that that just went away I can
donate if I want to give money to this
app developer now also you've got the
current version this is
one point one point zero and then you've
got your Wi-Fi state that's somewhat
important because we're gonna use that
on the desktop side as well so that's
really all there is to it
once that's all set up you're good to go
you do need to note this IP address or
connect via another way that we'll
mention so let's get right to the
desktop side all right guys so what
we're looking at and right now is my
desktop I've gone ahead and installed
the desktop version of a desk notifier
and we can see that right over here desk
notifier got three icons a link to their
website link to their uninstaller and
then the program itself let's go ahead
and fire that up and you can notice
right down here I have it running and
it's successfully connected via Wi-Fi so
you remember what I was talking about
the Wi-Fi setting let's go ahead and
open this up but a connection settings
and right over here you can see I've
selected Wi-Fi my other option is USB
we'll leave it on Wi-Fi but I'll talk
about the settings for both first of all
Wi-Fi since that's how we're connected
we have to type in the phone's IP
address now this is a local IP of 192
168 I just basically got that right from
the app itself plugged it right in and
hit OK we were done the other way you
can go about doing this is over USB
if you've connected your device to your
USB port and you have ADB installed that
comes with the Android SDK and you have
all of the drivers set up and working
properly and you're pointed it to the
right path then you can use the USB it
seems like an awful lot of work but if
you want to do it that way you can one
of the things that's missing here is a
Bluetooth if I have bluetooth on this
computer I have bluetooth on my phone
why can't I pair the two with Bluetooth
it seems like that would be a lot easier
than Wi-Fi or ADB over USB but I digress
so we'll go ahead and say ok now we'll
just go ahead and work on this so here
we are this is PocketNow
look launcher Wars open that up now what
I'm gonna do is over on my phone I'm
gonna launch desktop and notifier and
now I'm going to send a test
and right there you notice I've got a
test notification we'll send it on and
not alone have another one huh basically
a whole bunch now anytime I get any kind
of status or notification update I'm
going to get an update right there in my
my notification tray that's great
if I get say a Gmail or a text message
just gonna pop up there where it's not
so great let me go ahead over on the
phone and fire up rum manager and I'm
gonna tell it hey I want to check for a
rum update oh look at that
update available that popped up it's
great I'll say okay and now you'll see
aa
status update I'm gonna be getting
CyanogenMod 9 2012 Oh 5:30 now as soon
as you start seeing that then the
progress start to increase on your phone
you'll notice I'm gonna get a new status
indicator update for every percentage
see if we can get that to pop up if
you've got a really fast download you're
gonna see a lot of those it's gonna fill
up your whole screen from the bottom all
the way up to the top it's ridiculous
how much you're gonna get and honestly
you're probably gonna want to turn off
desk notifier when you are getting your
CyanogenMod updates then you see I got
an incremental update now I don't know
if this is a weird way that CyanogenMod
is doing things or if it's the way that
desk notifier is doing things but it's
really really annoying and this is a
slow download so I'm just getting one at
a time but I've seen them stacked up all
the way to the top and beyond so overall
very cool now this is something that I'm
not gonna use all that often because
I've got Google Voice for my voicemail
and my text messages I have Gmail for my
mail and I get all of my notifications
right there
if you're not using those or if you
don't have those set up this is a good
way to get them all integrated together
and get not just those types of alerts
sent directly over to your smart phone
and I go ahead and turn this off quickly
so we can stop hearing that sound but
overall I think it's a great idea I'd
love to see the inclusion of Bluetooth
but I don't know what
you think head on over to pocketnow.com
and leave us some comments for pocket
now showing up desk notifier for Android
