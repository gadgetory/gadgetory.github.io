calm we've got something really nice to
unbox for you this is the t mobile hd7
so let's check it out first off let's
take that bag and there it is the box
and we got some cool graphics over there
and so on the back I'm just going to
really quickly show you the hd2 box so
this is the hd7 which is upgrade to the
hd2 we've got similar kind of box here
that's how that looks and here we go
take off the top and there it is really
nice looking got a nice cloud motif in
the background HD seven down there just
take this out try not to get
fingerprints on it haha that's not gonna
happen okay there we go there's our
device will set that down for now what
else we got in here have some
information Start Guide recycling warm
tea discover more windows fun to come
okay blah blah we also have headphones
do those your work and those do have a
microphone and padding AC adapter with
the USB port usual suspects and a micro
USB cable so there we are let's just
take a quick look how this device
compares to a few others let's try the
hd2 so here we are very similar size
same size screen this one seems to be a
little more length on the bottom
weight-wise hd2 seems heavier on the
side very similar thickness
top we got some chrome and power buttons
up there bottom very similar microUSB ok
and let's try also the HTC surround so
you see the design is very similar got
some nice black and chrome rims some
that speakers you can see the hd7 is a
lot thinner than this surround ok so
there we go now we're going to fire this
up charge it up and take it for a test
ride thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
