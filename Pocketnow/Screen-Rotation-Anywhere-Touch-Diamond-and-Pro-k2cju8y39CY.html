pocketnow.com and if you have a touch
diamond tour a touch pro you know that
the accelerometer will not rotate the
screen in every part of the operating
system it only works in Opera Mobile and
if you're looking at pictures there's a
program called gyrator - and I'll post a
download link over in the sidebar in the
description that will allow you to have
screen rotation in every screen and it's
really great it's a really light
application it's not that big let me
show you what it looks like here it is
just a simple application it has a lot
of advanced functionality if you want
but I'm just using it for the purpose of
having it do the screen rotation and
every screen it has to be minimized at
all times it has to be running in the
background which is a con but it like I
said it's a very light program that
doesn't use very many resources ok so
let me show you the screen rotation here
we are in programs you can rotate it
this way totally upside down back to the
other side and then normal again it'll
work in any program so if we go to file
explorer for example it'll work here and
it will also work in a program like
Google Maps mobile obviously once in a
while it will lag there goes I just
didn't turn the device around enough so
I'm going to go into Google Maps okay
here we are in Google Maps and I rotate
it and it will read your all the screens
connected to Wi-Fi so gyrator - a really
good light application to use if you
have a touch diamond or touch pro and
that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
