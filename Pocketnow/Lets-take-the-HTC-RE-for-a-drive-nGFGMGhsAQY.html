and I'm in my car it's kind of cool
isn't it I'm using the HTC re the HTC
camera the little periscope looking
thing that my wife thinks looks like
kitchen faucet but I'm in the car and
I'm driving and I'm in traffic and this
is something that I normally wouldn't do
there's my little automatic tripping
down the bottom but I don't have a mount
for it yet so I'm just holding this in
my hand as I make my morning commute off
to the day job so just want to see how
it does in this kind of an environment
it's a little bit bumpy here I don't
have any external microphones or
anything at all set up just driving with
three in my hand while I got both hands
on the steering wheel kind of an
interesting device it's a lot smaller
than I thought it was going to be it
fits very nicely in the palm of the hand
and not difficult at all to hold on to
and to use it's something that honestly
I'm having fun with and I've only been
using it for about five minutes now if
