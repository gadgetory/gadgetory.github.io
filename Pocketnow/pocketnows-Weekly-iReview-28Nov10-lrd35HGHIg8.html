point one is out for your airtunes and
airprint pleasure yeah you guessed it
it's already been jailbroken and a
probable data counter bug on the iphone
4 left a norwegian user with a 750
dollar phone bill all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi everyone and welcome to the pocket
now I review the show we go through all
this week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
as always let's start off with the cool
well iOS 4.2 point 1 finally makes the
scene for iPhone devices ipod touch and
the ipad and it finally fixes the Wi-Fi
issues that were found on the ipad
really don't understand what happened to
iOS 4.2 but it's being released as four
point two point one out of the cool
things we get is obviously the air tunes
and airplay features that we were
talking about in the past but one of the
interesting things that we talked about
last week is that even though we're not
going to get the full mobileme suite on
the iphone 4 or on you know iOS devices
what we are going to get is to find my
iphone service for the iphone 4 really
don't understand why this is not being
pointed to the iphone 3gs or the 3g
apparently but really not sure if Apple
is going to release that eventually but
as it stands it only works on the floor
though there are ways to walk around and
get it on the 3gs so just set us up at
pocketnow.com to give you the real scoop
on how to get it working though we do
think it's not that easy but aside from
that that's pretty much it iOS 4.2 point
one brought a lot of bug fixes for the
iphone 3g though we haven't heard from
3g owners to see how it one for them so
again let's see what happens and let's
hope that Apple keeps pulling up these
releases quicker than they did with this
one and yeah well it didn't take the dev
team much time to release their
jailbreak for iOS 4.2 point 1 this
jailbreak is being called redsnow which
is it's currently not perfect because it
only works tether which means that you
need to connect your device to a
computer in case you need to reset it or
in case you meet run out of battery
power you're on the road or something so
it's really not perfect for now and
until their jailbreak is expected to be
out soon but we're really hoping it
comes out before iOS 4.3 comes out
some time with in December as it's been
rumored so let's see what happens we're
really hoping that the dev team gets to
speak soon another cool thing that's
happening is that the ultrasnow unlock
feature that's been really expected by a
lot of the community is supposedly going
to be out by sunday which is pretty much
what this video is going to be live so
we're expecting that when you see this
you're also able to download your unlock
feature for your iphone the only problem
of the unlock right now is that it's
only going to work for the iphone 3gs
and the iphone 3g but according to
muscle nerd it's only going to be a
couple of days later for the unlock
features to be available for the iphone
4 so i know you and me and a lot of
people out there are waiting for this so
let's hope it happens too and yeah we've
said in the past and we'll say it again
jailbreakers have all the fun it seems
that airplay is working for iOS devices
but not for third-party applications yet
so even though Apple could you know
scoot off by saying that it's a prom
because developers have not really
worked on supporting it it seems that
there's this jailbreak application
called air video in a blur that allows
for this feature to work on third-party
applications without the developers
having to do anything so again if you
jailbreak your device even though it's
tethered currently your you'll also be
able to bring I don't know Netflix or
any sort of third-party applications to
stream live through an apple TV on your
TV so again Apple why don't you just
contact these guys from the dev team and
get them hired I mean they do a better
job than you do sometimes
alright so that does it for the cool
that's continuing on with the
not-so-cool a norwegian iphone 4 user
complains that his October phone bill
came out a bit weird it seems that the
guy was actually using the iphone 4s
built-in data counter to calculate how
much is data usage was because he didn't
have an unlimited data plan and well he
was expecting to get a five-dollar bill
because he no downloaded somewhere
around 12 megabytes and it actually
ended up downloading about 1.1 gigabytes
of data now what happens i mean this
users actually complaining that he
actually used Wi-Fi for most of his
tough downloads and not really the
iphone 4s data plan so it could either
be one of the two things either the eye
thing for has a bug where it doesn't
really indicate how much data is really
being used or there's a problem with
Wi-Fi where you're actually relying on
the phone to switch between data plans
between your Wi-Fi connection and the
carrier's data and the phone's really
not doing a good work there's the only
reporting we have yet it's not really
confirmed but you know just watch your
phone bill if you don't have an
unlimited data plan B where you never
know what could happen my advice to you
is if there's a way for you to keep up
to what you've been using online do so
you never know and yeah well iOS 4.2
point 1 is out what was uncool well as
mentioned earlier the iphone 3g m 3gs
did not get to find my iphone feature
but another weird thing is that the
weird ugly ringtones that were rumored
months ago on the betas did not make it
to the iphone 3gs or the 3g only to the
four I'd actually say well thank you
very much for no more torture on these
devices but why didn't these devices get
it in the first place I mean
fragmentations really getting weird with
Apple lately let's see what happens well
Thanksgivings in Black Friday's in and
you know cyber monday and sales are out
a lot of companies out there had really
good smartphone sales except Apple Apple
had imax on sale macbooks on sale I pots
on sale but no iphones the only way you
get an iphone on sale for as much as
half off as if you bought it refurbished
which is not bad considering that
refurbished
phones have pretty much the same
warranty but again Apple I mean we know
your company doesn't bring out much
sales but you know customer loyalty is
really doing good for you and it really
would be cool if you would consider more
sales for customers we do know that
there were a lot of apps out there with
a lot of sales like for example all the
gameloft games a lot of really cool ones
out there had sales but again Apple
think about it for next year thats it
for todays i review thank you very much
for watching any questions your comments
if about this video that's up on the
post and be sure to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
