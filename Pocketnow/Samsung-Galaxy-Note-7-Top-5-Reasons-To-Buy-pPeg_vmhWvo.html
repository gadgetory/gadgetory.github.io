a7 the s7 edge and even an active of
Iran AT&amp;amp;T and now you have the Galaxy
Note seven sure there are a ton of
similarities but also dramatic
differences I'm hanging out a VAT with
pocket now let's talk about our top five
reasons we recommend you buy the Galaxy
Note seven instead
number five is the fact that it is still
the best phablet you can buy the note
started the market the note continues to
be the best option out there the biggest
problem with phablets is that you're
literally just buying a phone with a
larger display that display doesn't
really serve a purpose the Galaxy Note
ever since its inception had the idea of
giving you a Productivity device not
everybody needs that productivity but
the advantage is that you have it fair
that it's available to you and that it
can be useful to you at some point the
note offers unique features like being
able to sign PDFs on the go things that
you really can't get with other Galaxy
devices that mainly is one of the
biggest reasons number four that most
unique feature is the s-pen sure you
don't need it sure you can live without
it but it's always great to have it
Samsung has done a lot with this new
s-pen it's now more ergonomic the tip is
better you can actually feel like if
you're riding with a marker on a piece
of paper which is great it's now a
translator if you want it a surrogate
Mouse when you want it yes you can write
on the display as well and if you think
about it have you ever tried to use a
display whenever it's wet I know it's
pretty much impossible but in the case
of the Galaxy Note 7 you can use the
s-pen so that's even more power to it
number three speaking of the uniqueness
of the s-pen is the new always-on
display the biggest problem with Galaxy
devices is that they provide the most
beautiful and less functional always-on
display in the market not the case with
the note 7 you can actually use the
notes that you write with the s-pen to
be available to you on the always-on
display I think that you wrote a phone
number right now you quickly want it at
a glance or whatever list of things you
want to do during the day it is
extremely useful I love that feature a
lot and I know that I will be looking
back to it every now and then I think
that it is something that actually
provides more functionality than just
the fact that you're getting the time
every now and then number 2 the feature
that we believed was going to be a
gimmick and actually isn't think about
the iris scanner think about the iris
scanner is no you don't need it but it's
always cool to have when will you need
it well if you're wearing gloves because
it's cold it's always cool to unlock
your phone with your face if you're in a
pool and your hands are wet that
fingerprint scanner is not always going
to work nor will the display but pay the
iris scanner will it provides that added
functionality and Samsung actually wants
to push this further the company wants
to use this for mobile banking the
company was to use this for
authentication and everything that's
provided by Samsung Knox you have the
advantage that you can also lock
particular features of the phone and
you're sure that it won't be unlocked by
the fingerprint that you probably let
your kids add to your phone it will only
be available to you which is also very
cool and finally the top number one
reason why we would recommend you
consider this Galaxy Note 7 over every
other galaxy out there or smartphone for
that matter is because it'll be the most
future-proofed galaxy out there whether
you like it or not the Samsung Galaxy
lineup has been the best smartphone
lineup of the year we proved it in Rober
views got the best cameras the best
everything but also because you're
paying the most money for this phone
it'll probably be the first one to
receive Android 7 dot Onew gets it'll
also be the first phone with USBC from
Samsung so peripherals with USB type-c
will work on this phone only number
three and most important think about it
the only other phone that really
competes with the galaxy note 7 is the
galaxy s7 edge and all the edge features
are reported to this phone so it really
doesn't serve a purpose to not invest a
little more money in the galaxy note 7
if you're getting everything but that
leads me to the question of this top 5

not and if not why we'd love to know
your opinion in the comments down below
