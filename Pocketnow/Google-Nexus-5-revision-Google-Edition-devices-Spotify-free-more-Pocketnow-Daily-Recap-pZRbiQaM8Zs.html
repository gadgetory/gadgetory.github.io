like that Jaime are you going for some
sort of speed talking record geez and
yeah I'm actually winning ooh 360p close
the potato quality all right that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
I'm every bit of this is pocket now this
is our pocket now daily recap for last
week so on Monday I asked you if you use
the SMS bundled application that you get
on your phone or do you use are there
alternatives because the news were about
Google fixing their hangouts application
in order to bring better SMS integration
aside from the fact that it brings out
on a support etc we have three igniting
one comments out of which one of them
says no I stick to normal messaging
because I use whatsapp more often and in
my case that's the same thing what's
happenin ated my messaging and the
messaging almost everybody so I guess
SMS pretty much will die soon and photo
analysis pocket now yes I use hangouts
for SMS only complaint is you can't
separately snooze hangouts I'm and
hangouts SMS my biggest deal with
hangouts is if you're using samsung
galaxy phones they integrate the first
and second day and then they forget
about it so you get to alerts for
everything and it's just totally
annoying I guess that's the reason why I
don't use it the mother Condor says I
use stock-outs ms application I don't
really understand why people need to use
some other why well some stock SMS
applications from galaxy phones
particularly use a black background that
looks terrible and you get uses like for
example chat heads from facebook which
is actually quite cool so there is a
point for alternatives then on Tuesday I
ask for your thoughts about the new
google edition tablets for example the
LG G pad 8.3 that just came out and the
Sony Xperia Z ultra Google editions
aside from the new white Nexus 7 and
while we have 261 comments out of which
akmal says agreed i prefer the sony z
one google edition over the z ultra and
yeah i agreed to that was a terrible
google edition photo that i still do not
understand then so while says google
should actually ask people for google
edition iphone and ipads and i'd like to
see the reaction and we got 14 thumbs up
for this one that's the only reason why
it's there but it's never gonna happen
then Timothy easily says the new LG G
pad google edition is very tempting for
next tablet it is I did
really like the LG tablet even though I
don't like the LG you I it does feel
great in the hand even though when you
competed against the nexus 7 that is one
tough pick then on Wednesday ask you
what music streaming service do you use
because the news we're about Spotify
going free for mobile devices at least
on tablets and then on mobile devices
like smartphones you get a little catch
where you have to shuffle your songs but
it's still better than pandora we have 5
11 comments out of which says are says I
don't have any available in my country
yay for Romania and you know hearing on
Lotus I don't have it either what I use
is a VPN you all you need to do is
actually purchase Spotify the first time
and once you do that you can actually
use it without the need of a VPN so I
think that's actually doable for
everybody the Moose antenna says google
play music all axes great service the
problem with this is that sadly Google
services are not available in mostly
every other country that's not the
United States in part of Europe and that
is really a big farm because here VPNs
don't actually work they do a little bit
but you have to actually be using it to
have it active so it is a problem that
google music is sadly not available
everywhere but put everybody else in the
United States it is cool just not the
best service though that Matthias
Johnson says I was a pirate but nowadays
i'm using spotify premium just for the
simplicity both now and then and i have
to agree with this we were all pirates
at some point and the reason why i love
spotify is because there are a ton of
songs out there that i love but that i
don't really want to buy i just want to
listen to them every now and then and
that's great to have a service like
Spotify for that then on Thursday I
asked you if you would buy a micro USB
flash drive for your smartphone or
tablet because the news were that Sony
had just built one for themselves and
we've got 701 comments out of which
jordan says poor Apple users and I have
to agree with this man definitely but
Michael best says I'll definitely buy a
micro USB flash drive it'll come in
handy for nandroid backups and yes you
nailed the perfect usage scenario I
don't really want to be carrying backups
on my phone and there are some old
photos that I want to carry on my phone
either but it's great to have a flash
drive in case I lose my phone get it wet
or whatever I don't have things on the
phone I can use them or whatever other
phone i get then sameer says nexus
problem solved and yes that would be the
perfect solution for Nexus devices with
all their storage limitations that on
friday i asked you what sort of
innovations would you
back from the recent internal merger
that Samsung had just done what they did
was merge their digital imaging
department with their smartphone
Department and mobile which we do expect
to see happening starting next year we
have 145 comments out of which Angelo
says flexible displays new UI and better
camera that matched the Lumia 1020 15 20
years this would be perfect i would love
to see a samsung phone with great
imaging quality they kind of nailed it
this year this year's cameras on their
phones are great they were not so good
last year but we are expecting something
better for next year because this is the
future mercure says 3d photo capturing
more high res slow motion video and
video mode that can play the video back
forward after capturing it um you know
we have had 3d photography on phones and
it sucked oh not everybody use a slow
motion it's great things to have but
this is mainly software I mean what we
really need our better optics for phones
and that's really what we want to see
with this whole merger and everything
and hopefully no big camera hops and so
that says nokia lumia 1020 type samsung
iteration and android basically a phone
4.5 inch or 5 inch with a good camera
good specifications and with removable
battery and microsd slot yes those two
last things what is the point about
having a beautiful camera on that lumia
1020 if you do not have expandable
storage or replaceable battery and yes
you can get that big accessory to get
those things but then you come to the
point of why would i want to buy or make
my phone more bulky if i could do it on
a samsung phone with everything
replaceable and that's really a good
point that's it for a pocket out daily
