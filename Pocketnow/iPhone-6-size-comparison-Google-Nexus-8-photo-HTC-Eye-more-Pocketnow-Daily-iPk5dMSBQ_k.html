show us some size comparisons we
apparently get the first leaked photos
of the google nexus 8 and the HTC I or
so the code name is could be the
ultimate selfie phone I'm hi meri beta
and even though we've been taking
selfies for decades isn't it hilarious
how now there's a term for it and they
make comments about it and even songs
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with the official stuff as Google
has just announced its first tablet for
project tango we've seen some very ugly
clothes that the company is using for
that 3d mapping solution and it's using
by taking photos and videos of a place
and now there's a tablet and it's
powered by the Tegra k1 processor which
would be the second device that we know
that's being powered by it and speaking
of nvidia we also noticed that the new
nvidia shield is just arrived at the FCC
hopefully this one takes off and
speaking of google let's start on the
nexus 8 we get the first leaked photos
and this tablet is definitely not made
by HTC at least five looks of it but
still apparently it will be we don't
know but we had some specs apparently we
get the first snapdragon 64-bit chip
powering this tablet aside from the fact
that we are running android 4.5 year
according to the least three gigs of ram
aside from other goodies stay tuned as
64 bits and three gigs of ram we don't
get the point now let's talk about
Microsoft and more specifically Windows
Phone 8.1 is even though we still don't
have any specific dates for a launch the
company just talked about new OEM
partners like blue yes and prestigio
which are mid tier drones one phone from
blue is actually quite good looking but
it's a matured for the United States and
the Latin American market that more
interesting though about this event is
the fact that the company confirmed its
renewed partnership with HTC so we
should be expecting the WA coming very
soon and hopefully with everything
hopefully it's the same phone as the MA
just the different operating system
moving over to Apple and the iphone 6 we
get some more leak cases and that's
going to be the thing until the phone
gets launched in october but this time
these cases are refined they actually
look like something that came out of
production to actually be sold and we
get some size comparisons with the
current iphone 5s the iphone 5c and
other models a second comparisons
between themselves
even though nothing has changed in the
layout or anything these more refined
cases do show us that this phone is
extremely thin and it's definitely going
to be extremely big in comparison to
whatever Apple has launched recently so
hopefully this happens though how many
of you believe that this big 5.5 inch
iphone is really just an ipod touch I
believe that's going to be the case and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day famous tipster efflux was just
on record talking about the HTC I and
yes this is the codename HTC is famous
for weird names but this apparently is
going to be the ultimate selfie phone
that will be launched at q4 this year we
don't get any specifics on the phone or
anything only that the company is going
to be bringing this great front camera
for photos and they've done a great job
recently they've made wide-angle lenses
available HS ever since the HTC 8x and
stuff and it is cool but that leaves you
to the question of the day what a selfie
factor be a reason why you would buy a
phone is this really something that you
do a lot I do know that people in my
case turn their phones around because
the front cameras are terrible so it
does make sense but still this is the
only differentiating factor for the
phone I wouldn't buy it leave us a
comment down below to see what we get
and yes friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is Phil mushy follow us on
Parker now calm structure youtube
channel as well you also follow me on
