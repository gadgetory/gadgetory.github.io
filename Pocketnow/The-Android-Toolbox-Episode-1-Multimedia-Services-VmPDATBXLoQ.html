this is the android toolbox part 1 the
android toolbox will be a six part video
series to cover android essentials
whether you've had an android phone for
a while or you're just getting one now
in this first part we're going to cover
how to get multimedia whether that's
music TV shows or movies onto your
android phone so without further ado
let's get to it so we're going to cover
a variety of subscription services that
let you consume in an unlimited amount
of content for a low monthly fee but
first let's talk about the obvious
choice which is to download content to
buy content from the google play store
which is of course on every android
device now if you buy from the google
play store it's going to be more
expensive but you actually own the
content for example if we go to top
albums here we'll see that albums are
twelve thirteen fourteen dollars as much
as you would pay if you walked into a
store and bought a physical album what's
great about buying from the google play
store is that the content is
synchronized across all of your devices
so you can listen to the album that you
just bought on your android tablet or in
your web browser on your laptop or
desktop so that is a really great
feature of google play music now for
movies and TV shows they also get very
expensive if you watch a lot of them if
you want to buy an entire movie and own
it again it will synchronize but the
problem is that it's $15 in a lot of
cases from HD movie which is a little
less expensive than a DVD but still it's
a lot of money if you're watching a
movie a week or two movies a week now in
some cases you can actually rent a movie
which is great a lower cost option for
three dollars and ninety-nine cents you
can rent a movie and watch it within a
24-hour window or like like I said
earlier you can buy content for fifteen
bucks there are much cheaper options and
better options out there that are
subscription services so let's start
with music now one of those popular
music services subscription-based is
Pandora it has two levels of service one
is
three and one is premium and the premium
service costs three dollars per month
it's really thirty-six dollars per year
now Pender of course allows you to input
an artist or an album or a song and it
will intelligently pick music that
sounds just like we're similar to what
you've just input so you kind of get a
custom radio station and over the years
I've accumulated a lot of different
radio stations music that I like now if
you pay that subscription fee for three
dollars you get a higher quality of
audio it streams none of this is stored
on your device and you also get no
advertisements so Pendor is a really
great service especially if you want
something that is free so let's go back
to the home screen here and talk about
the next music service which is spotify
spotify actually has three levels of
service a free level which allows you to
listen to a limited amount of streaming
content a middle ground level which
increases the audio quality lets you do
offline playlists and then a premium
service which increases the audio
quality the premium service is about 10
bucks the middle tier is five bucks and
obviously free is zero dollars the great
thing about Spotify back beyond having a
really really good selection of music
really everything that you search for
appears on the results there's just so
much content is that it has a gorgeous
application so if we go over here to
related artists we get this beautiful
cover art that just looks fantastic on
this Android device and we can really
use this for music discovery and
bouncing around and looking at the
latest related artists you can even
swipe to the left and read some
biographical information about a
particular artist then if you like the
album you can save it for offline and it
downloads to your device and you can
listen to it if you're on the subway if
you don't have an internet connection
and you don't want to stream it so
Spotify is a great app at 05 or around
10 bucks for almost unlimited music and
it has almost everything really great
service and finally to other services
I'm not going to talk about their
similar to Spotify but they don't have
that free level of service we have our
do and rhapsody both have big catalogs
of music they have different features
they have social features and again
there about 10 bucks per month for the
premium level service
now what if you want to stream movies
and TV shows to your device but you
don't have to pay up every time you
watch something well there are several
different services i recommend starting
with netflix for about eight bucks per
month you're able to stream an unlimited
amount of content and it also works
across so many devices tablets xbox 360
Apple TV and if you start watching on
one device it will save this the state
and where you left off so that you can
resume on the next device that you're
watching on and it just has a really
good selection the downside to Netflix
is that TV series are particularly slow
in being added and so are movies but in
terms of things that have happened and
aired about two years ago and all the
way back it's got like everything it's
really fantastic in terms of how much it
has and again it's only eight dollars
per month the video quality is fantastic
you can stream HD in 720p if you have an
Apple TV and some other devices it goes
up to 1080p so just really good quality
really inexpensive and a pretty full
catalog here now if you want the latest
in TV shows Hulu Plus is what you want
again it's about eight to ten bucks per
month and the great thing about hulu
plus is that if there is an episode of
the office on yesterday chances are by
today it's on hulu plus the downside to
hulu plus is that it has commercials
only two or three per episode and it's
really not that bad just like Spotify
we've got a beautiful visual application
here that has different categories
recommendations and it's just a very
nice application to interact with again
inexpensive way to get a lot of great
content streaming on your android device
and of course this is streaming you
don't own it but it's always there for
you over Wi-Fi or cellular data if you
want to watch a TV show you even have a
handful of movies the movie selection
isn't that big on hulu but you're able
to watch some of the classics some of
the bigger screen pictures and of course
you always have YouTube which is a free
option really high quality in a lot of
cases if the video sources in HD and it
just works very well in Android it's
well integrated into android and it has
just so much great content a lot of
people don't think about it by
you can spend a lot of quality time in
YouTube seeing some awesome content
without having to pay a dime so that was
a look at ways you can get multimedia
onto your android device there are so
many great streaming options out there
that are very inexpensive you don't have
to spend tons of money in the Google
Play Store to own everything you want to
watch these subscription services make
it very economical to consume multimedia
on your android phone and that's going
to do it for part one of the android
toolbox be sure to check out part 2

about ways to control your home with
your android phone or your apartment or
