pocketnow.com today were excited to
unbox a brand new smartphone which is
made by Nokia or Nokia whichever you
choose it's one of the two smartphones
which Nokia the Finnish company
announced recently they have announced
the Nokia x7 which we have here and
being Nakia e6 both of these smartphones
are running the latest version of
Symbian which is called Anna and we're
pretty excited to see how an Anna
smartphone looks and how a smartphone
which is one of the latest generations
from Nokia compares to other smartphones
on the market regardless if they're in
the iPhone Android Windows Phone or even
me nakia and let's get to the unboxing
so we've got the obligatory scissors
packaging there we go here's the Nokia
x7 it's a nice blue box as you'd expect
from from Nokia actually all the latest
generation Nokia smartphones come with
these types of boxes we got the picture
of the smartphone on the front says
Nokia x7 nothing on the side we got
makya movie which recently got branded
ob/ob services and products of Nokia
have been renamed so there's no more Ovi
Maps or Aldi market Oh beast or they are
rebranded to Nakia on the back we've got
some numberings
and no specs so let's see what's in the
box we've got the smartphone itself
let's put it aside for a second let's
see what else is in here we've got some
literature it's in Romanian there's no
colour pictures but basically it's a
Quick Start Guide and we'll give this to
aside this is also a Romanian we have a
wall charger which is a bureau PM with a
micro USB connection
and we got a small box which bears most
probably the headphones here yes we got
a pair of headphones which are noise
canceling earbuds so these are in ear
headphones with some nice controls on
the remote on the cable this probably is
for volume up volume down for answering
the call camera has problem focusing
words trying to force it to focus and we
got some web controls for multimedia
playback blade pause forward and
backwards we'll put this to the side
some custom butts there your ear size
and we've got the micro USB cable for
syncing up with your computer enough of
the accessories let's take a look at the
smartphone itself this is the Nokia x7
which is marketed by Nokia as being a
multimedia aka and entertainment
smartphone and wow this thing's feeling
really good in hand it's got that
rounded back and it's pretty lightweight
it's it feels solid let's see we got a
metal back let's take this one off - to
reveal the camera it might have pixels
but we will take a look at the hardware
in another video and that's a first
impression it feels really really good
in the hand it's lightweight it's solid
there's no squeaking sounds and oh
you've got the button here
which is also functioning perfectly so
that was it for the unboxing of the new
Nokia x7 stay tuned for pocketnow.com

and our thoughts on the new Nokia x7
smartphone running Symbian Anna this
wasn't some dinner from pocketnow.com
