are live I'm gonna play a Tony here good
morning good evening good afternoon
everyone did I miss anything Tony no
you're not this is our first editorial
round table for 2014 and the reason why
is because the previous ones we've been
on the shows either we've been at CES a
tour at mwc live and the whole team is
just put out this has just been
impossible but we love the fact that
we're back to our first editorial
roundtable where we go through the
opinions of everything that we saw at
this event so you know exactly what we
think about what we just saw so first of
all let's start with a little roll call
here mr. Taylor Martin senior editor how
are you I'm good I'm good still trying
to catch up with the whirlwind of
getting this thing set up so I don't
know what's happening right now well you
see on you look good and then we've got
our own editor-in-chief mr. Anton d Nagy
good to see you hi everybody good to be
here I'm happy that I finally don't have
to post another HTC m8 League post I see
some temporary Romanian license plates
over your once I got the final ones oh
so now is when I need to go to Romania
know is what I need to go and now we've
got our own senior editor Adam Lane for
the first time in our editorial round
table and Michael Fisher on the show
floor hello to you guys hello gentlemen
that falls to be the same low forehead
i'm laying his devices still love
getting caught up with our hangout he's
using a surface that's the problem it's
using a certain stupid I will have you
know it's working just fine all right so
we have Q&amp;amp;A enabled us for anybody that
wants leave is a question but for some
reason google hangouts changes every
single like 30 seconds of a day so we
don't know if it's really working for
you guys please drop some questions
there if not you can find this on
twitter as well at pocket now and
hopefully you can send us your questions
here but overall this is the HTC One m8
round table I'm Michael out after the
event what should we call this thing the
audio HTC One the HTC One m8 the NL 1
2014 so all that all that bullsh is
dropped it's
just the HTC One m8 so it ruins the
elegant some of the elegance of the HTC
one friend is Islam but I would be very
surprised if they didn't events we drop
the MA so you're saying that actually
the codename the m8 is as of now a
official part of the official name of
the product yeah we're looking at a lot
of banners around here HTC One m8
subscript indices so so it's like we saw
in the past with the One X and the 1s
and the 1v right ah yes except of course
in and out it's an eight right it's a
little different you know I don't think
it's too bad I think it's some almost
necessary but it's a really bad way of
doing it because how are they gonna
they're gonna have to HTC one's and name
one the 2013 in the 2014 we never saw at
all period ed the next is seven with the
goggle no no we have just not from HTC
not from HTC correct right so that would
have been one way to go they could have
been it could've been the one two or the
one plus with one pro I mean there's
just no so that's the question right
there was that trap how do we do this
how do we actually make this effective
effectively separate this from the m7
without making ridiculous because if you
call it is the one do we would be hello
Ellen right now yeah we will we will but
but tell us about the event Michael how
was it overall I mean I I don't know
about you guys but I really do love your
child's or Peter true it is that's the
correct way to pronounce it was good a
shout and so how the good years I know I
know but when but when the the company's
chairman cher Wang came on stage as we
were in Barcelona with Tony she called
them Peter chew so I guess Peter chu is
the correct way just like Jaime that
eyes the correct way hey Adam good to
see you dude
hey so so tell us tell us guys I mean
how what are your impressions of the
event I love his showmanship what do you
guys think you know I thought that it
was I thought it was really presented
certainly there were things a lot of
emphasis on your 60 seniors completing
what about this is our identity the MA
deuce it rises tomorrow I'm going to end
an intrical track problems hearing what
you're saying so Adam can you please
mute your microphone yeah we're gonna
have to meet one of you guys because
there's just we're getting feedback from
both of you sorry about your that
actually we're hearing yet him better
than my yeah we're getting her hearing
Adam better actually just kidding me and
Adam just muted himself yeah yeah and
I'll let Adam talk for a second okay
let's let's do that okay anything you
can hear me now perfectly yeah service
sounds really annoyed me that they it
really annoyed me that the color
temperature of the lighting was
different on the people than it was on
the background so yeah the people were
orange electrical problem 44 the camera
it's a 4 megapixel camera eyes do you
think that's got a mess it up more than
it did on once i got you know if it's a
timid feedback yeah this way with i just
picked Adam out of some spots okay I'm
the best ever can you do a rundown of
the spec so that we know know what we're
talking about with this huge what am I
wish it'd probably mentioned that the
review is tough at pocketing out right
now and along with a bunch of
comparisons but looking at a Snapdragon
801 running a 2.4 gigahertz and Western
Asia it's a 5 gigahertz then 2 gigs of
RAM microSD which is great for 228 gigs
and 16 and 32 gig flavor Tony of course
he recovered by the candle which is an
entirely entirely different conversation
oh my god yes this is going to be an
entirely different conversation but you
know overall you felt that the event was
good Michael you felt how what was your
impression of the event so far I think
we know the press event is really
difficult to to extensive Adam just walk
across a room ready listen it we have
high speed internet been well taken care
of there's interviews going on all
around where it's really nice to see it
takes hi everything there's nothing bad
to say good good and well for those of
you that didn't know we have our full
view of the HTC one is already like the
m8 we have a full comparison of the HTC
One 2014 m8 with the n7 with this last
year's phone we have a comparison
between HTC's One m8 and the samsung
galaxy s lineup because obviously we
have the galaxy s4 right now but the
galaxy s5 will not be ready until next
month so we have a michael did this
really cool comparison of what we can
expect from either of these offerings
that you would like and we also have the
unboxing because yeah we can't live
without unboxings that's just the way it
is oh absolutely and the important thing
about the advancing is that not only the
HTC throw in the headphones that they
usually do but they also through payson
but yeah on a device like this which is
not like which is which is gorgeous but
also not necessarily one of the most
durable products ever probably on a
scratch resistance example it's nice to
have a base in the box so hopefully
American errors don't screw it up too
much oh they will happen yeah you're you
know and for instance I mean Tony you've
told me and I actually got to try those
headphones out while i was in Romania
and I mean hey for bundled headphones
those are probably the best sounding
headphones ever yes and that's what I
said that I think that either the
headphones themselves or or the
combination between the headphones and
whatever HTC did would that beats audio
thing resulted in perfect audio at one
point there was a speculation that those
bungled headphones were actually some
lower and beats by dr. dre headphones
but I don't think that that's the case
but still
sounded perfectly with the with the HTC
One given that they are muddled yeah
yeah so Michael overall you've been
using the device for what six days we've
been under embargo I think we know you
don't have any problems I was on mute
just to keep the noise down yes we were
using the device for six days and
actually seven now and yeah that's what
a lot of us all the time if you needed
to forget for rice before dropping out
extra step now yeah my Adam work I gotta
for the world are you forget of you do
it sorry guys I I can't be close to me
I'm agree good i'll show you stuck in
the other room and adam we're gonna need
to meet you man sorry yeah Adam so Adam
actually just had a great idea is going
out to the to the other room to
broadcast I see from so yeah it's good
mutum he's using the front-facing am
running service do so this is an
interesting thing see we get some
footage awesome but that's the first
thing I heard one say you started
talking about cameras at the step be
very important thing I've heard is
someone anything to say yeah hmm so you
know that is something that it's really
difficult to overcome if we were talking
about 16 I really think it is quite hard
to get past four megapixel primary
shooter in suit you know honestly I've
you've tested the phone I've obviously
seen your videos already you can watch
them now they're all alive the playlists
already created and our full review is
already live as well written and
everything um I mean Michael I I don't
know dude I'm kind of disappointed that
this this was gonna be my phone for 2014
and I've come to a point where I'm like
oh my god I mean mega think i'm sorry
but i have a Retina display computer
megapixels do matter in this computer I
mean whenever I get a 4 megapixel shot
it's like this small in the display
yeah I mean I guess that's sure I don't
have a Retina display on my machine but
I do use high res tablets all the time
to be my own maybe i'm just very easy to
clean I don't need to get bothered by it
my frustration is not so much with the
end result the quality of the photo
camera because honestly for ninety
percent of pieces we're going to be
posting the face to Instagram Twitter
whatever these images are already losing
contestants it's not fatal plus we have
the people making things up so late
that's not the restoration subsection C
isn't perhaps we'd like to see any
meaningful progress from last year to
this year and then cutting us off one
feature that I really like the Wiz yeah
I have managed I have managed to cut
some slack to HTC last year and I was
about the person on pocket now who was
the most pissed about the ultrapixel
camera and I'm no longer willing to cut
them slack they should have learned I no
longer buying that thing that 4
megapixels is enough for you for
facebook for Instagram no no forget
about that just do a regular camera and
you know what they've taken the camera
from the HTC One they removed o is add
another thing that creates bouquet
effects well nakia does that with a
single camera and the software side but
not carry focus so I'm what I'm saying
is I'm no longer buying this bull thing
that well it's enough for your facebook
and social needs no no I one more no
it's not how about you Taylor how do you
feel yeah so I was really convinced that
the the one was gonna be or the m8 was
gonna be the phone that I was going to
buy it because I galaxy s5 not at all
even on my radar don't even like it it's
not my thing um so that left the z2
which still kind of not my thing the one
and who knows what else um now I'm not
even really that interested in the one
because the camera experience for me is
a very big thing I'm dealing with the
Moto X the camera on the Moto X is not
great it's horrible and I'm left
thinking like
I mean I would rather use the we're
gonna have to get Adam to view again
yeah you can do it he's just a lot of a
lot of ambient noise I am there and yeah
it's just a 4 megapixel camera I
understand that they're doing some sort
of innovation in that they're using
stereoscopic cameras but I really don't
care as much as having a camera that can
take a nice picture by itself I would
rather have an 8 or 13 megapixel camera
they can take decent photos than a 4
megapixel camera that can take decent
photos and create some sort of fake
depth of field that mean it's it tell me
something any it is it your impression
or is it just me but do I why is it that
i feel that i already have a not
necessarily a better smartphone but a
good enough smart phone to compare with
the one I mean I've got to know three
and i use a 5s i mean i've got a great
camera here I mean the only thing that
I'm missing here is boom sound is going
to be a tough sell for for HTC because
you remember we were in Barcelona and
we've seen the galaxy s5 and again
galaxy s5 was much below what we
expected and at that point we didn't
know what to expect from from vm eight
and we thought that this might be HTC's
chance if they fix all the problems AKA
removable battery it's still
non-removable not that I care but a lot
of people seem to do hey Dad I don't see
that quite honestly I don't see that
being an issue and we we've had not the
Nokia is a great example of like stellar
success in terms of sales but that
exactly for hosting yeah we creator
there's a segment who cares about it
they did not address that but that's a
small chunk of the market but then there
was the microSD card thing and it is
included and my biggest rank was the
camera and HTC not only did not fix the
camera but they downgraded if possible
yeah so they we have Adam hearing I
think we should not waste the
opportunity to yeah Adam yeah we have a
full professional photographer here come
on Adam tell us your impression to tell
us yet
that they've refocusing thing yeah yeah
just too horrible it wasn't even doing
the depth very well I can conceive into
the foreground were in focus that
weren't supposed to be if it was a real
character yeah yeah Adam leaned over to
me at one point and said wow you can see
the seam in the bouquet effect and
that's very true I mean if it works well
it you know it can look pretty cool but
it's some do you think it's worth the
addition of that little secondary I ball
up there it doesn't compare to the way
the network which you have to hold still
for a long time to do the depth but I
think that matters on know it and really
at Adam you're a photographer man I mean
whenever you want to really create that
shallow depth of field effect I mean you
take your time you're not like oh you're
not gonna want to go like snap and oh
you're expecting for that to happen
you're like oh wow this is a great photo
opportunity you stop you take your time
you take a couple of shots until you get
it right so I mean athlete subject yeah
it's gas style something moving quickly
you need a quick Strutter to get that
yes yes and speaking of which I think we
which i should mention that one good
thing about this dedicated depth sensor
is that it does allow the camera to grab
focus very very quickly meaning that if
you're shooting in an absolutely dark
room which I did a couple times of
review the camera is able to get focused
with that with that flash like instantly
well Michael please clarify something
for me and I'm sure others also have
this question that secondary eyeball on
the top it's not a camera or is that
just a sensor or doesn't have a Salter
it's just a sensor that that gauge its
def
so he's not a camera per se it's pretty
much like the heart rate monitor on the
s5 which is just a sensor yeah it's a
camera that behaves as a sensor I guess
yeah I think hi Mei hasn't right i mean
i think it's a cabman it's an optical
sensor that is the enemy because it has
the leg sitting that's the exciting for
me if you think about the potential of
it because they know HTC's can release
the SDKs with that thing so I'm not that
I'm confident that this will necessarily
happen but there are a lot of smart
developers out here I don't know you
think any of situations where a
developer can write some software to
take advantage of that dedicating and
it's different if they can attach to the
video you've been kind of do still
picture to the move separately from
background talking about doing some some
more artsy effects yeah yeah yeah now
Adam I Adam I know you're more of a
windows phone guy but would you I mean
if you had the money and you want an
android phone would this be the phone
that you would get or or this apartment
oh definitely get this over interesting
interesting yeah even with its what do
they call it I can't even think of its
HDR mode is oh my god she has funny face
super rich ultra glam obvious now
overall if you have not seen Michaels
comparison of the m7 and the m8 please
do look at it it's live but I want to
hear Michael you're not reviewer but
your user perception your you've been
using the m7 on your left hand and the
emek in your right hand from a
day-to-day usage perspective scenario
would I as a user require or what I need
to upgrade to the m8 or is my m7 still a
cash bail so that isn't that's a really
really good question because so many of
the improvements we saw today in the new
blinkfeed have been up in the new phone
our software right so yeah I bet I look
like I'm squeezing with other mistake
oh sorry kobo interrupt the question is
valid and it's an open question as to
whether these software thinking's would
be an operational you're the hold on to
the n7 system software but i have to
tell you the feel in hand of the m8 is
unlike anything that I've felt in terms
of nothing yeah and I've heard that most
of the software things including sense
will come to the m7 c lane to the same
time so that's that's the component if
all you're looking for is a sophomore
enhance and odds are of what you want is
going to come to the end setting to get
sense sext it's going to get that
teenagers the FCC has promised to that
fancy software a great time but the
hardware improvement first of all the
5-inch screen is very nice but in the
bluesound agreements are substantial yes
bm7 is already an excellent audio
platform yeah I can't overstate how
impressive is improved on that in terms
of volume dynamics of it this hard work
is better in every way no let me ask you
something because I noticed this on the
video but we haven't really had a chance
to talk about this because you're on it
you've been on NBA with that device um
so it on the on the display oh where the
speaker grill is is that glass or is
that aluminum like on the m7 so where
the speaker grill is on them on the
front above and below the display yeah
you seen Walter put into yeah the
question seems impossible I mean it
looks like glass no it's not glad it's
brushed so it has the same brush defect
as the aluminum onda on the back plate
but how you want to think it's a little
we have to ask about it should be it
should be aluminum because it is
aluminum on the m7 as its aluminum on
the m7 right but on the NAI I was
looking at me at your micro shots and
and I see them sort of a reflection in
the speaker grill yeah but really
because of the brushed thing of and it's
also a darker it's not the natural
aluminum but it's the black one this is
something we can we can ask here and
i'll see if i can get an answer
but done HTC has gone back again and
again and said that where the m7 was
seventy percent aluminum this is ninety
percent aluminum Jason and you only go I
can see to get ten percent worth of
plastic in there is their kind of over
the last three the only way up until you
get ten percent classical there is to
put the place go to talk about the
screen I think that's what I think it's
polycarbonate with in effect but that's
not confirmed i'll go find out the way
Michael what would you improve on the m8
for me it's the camera in the camera I
would I would ditch the duo and I'm
going to start with OAS and a higher
resolution so if this would have had a
16 megapixel Elias supported camera it
would have been the phone if if this is
gonna quick Leslie I might've I might
have given it a talent I know I'm gonna
tell you this guy's i mean i've seen so
much sand you know after this whole
collaboration and licensing deal between
HTC and apple you know we have that true
tone flash on the on the m8 for example
that i'm not sure we have the true tone
flash I mean we have the three colors
just like the iphone has and then we've
seen a lot of HTC's enhancements on the
iphone 5s as well will you seen this
sort of collaboration i mean i can't
really understand why couldn't they have
collaborate on the damn camera and a
look at the iphone's camera on the m8
and that would have made this is the
perfect phone it's a good question i
will say well we're talking about the
camera that the software improvements
are very welcome once again Tony as you
said you know those are some of the
improvements that we welcome to the m7
but the noob you plunder is stellar the
features that ship with no cars are
excellent so if you are give HTC 10 hoop
this happen takes to the way from
negative look like they tried to do with
the m7 and they didn't succeed I really
think they didn't they succeeded to a
degree but they didn't do it enough
because the marketing volume was not an
opportunity but if they're able to do
that I really think this candle would be
a lot of fun for a lot
not people like that if you want I'll
tell you this much and and I I think
that I didn't really get the grasp of
this until Tony let me use the Lumia
1020 for a couple of days obviously this
is a phone in another category this is a
camera that's also a phone but what is
the advantage of megapixels let's forget
about the whole retina display argument
and everything but you know there are
some shots that I take with the iphone
that don't necessarily look good but
then I'm glad that I'm able to zoom into
them and cut the piece that I like and
have the thumb and have the photo still
look usable the problem with using the
four megapixel shot is that what you
took is what you get if you use oom into
that thing or crop a little portion of
it easy to be a very small shot yeah
we're talking about devices we're
talking about a 4 megapixel camera in an
age where we have 2k displays on tablets
and phones the exact looking yeah and
also i wanna i want to make the point
that also in addition it's not just the
megapixel objection pond you know it's
great to have low light performance from
a camera and we loved how its able to
pull all that light from the scene but
noise sacrifice that it makes once again
you're now it's fine with it last year
to see that much noise sink the same
basic performance in low light with the
exception of a little better than white
balance and open that's disappointing I
um I'm looking forward for me a HTC One
m8 plus which will have a flash on the
front firing camera come on Daniel in
terms of battery life because this
because I'd okay I just want to say that
I object with what you said Michael and
I want to hear your rebuttal on this you
said that most people ninety percent of
people who would buy this phone would be
okay with the camera performance but our
people actually going to buy it because
what a main consumers or basic consumers
typically go for mega pixel counts they
don't care about all the other stuff
they they listen to marketing and they
buy what you know they sell I think it
sounds better I think you're right that
they listen to marketing and that's why
I said that HTC is going to have a smog
ahead of it in terms of friend
profession so I think you're violently
agreeing with you because you're a dork
okay guys guys I know you guys are
running out of battery Michael are you
keeping this phone or are you waiting
for something else are you satisfied
after your review over or are you going
back to your 1020 I the Moto X would be
there on the net go back soon and
honestly I think I would hurt this you
know what i mean and i don't mean
because i'm a rough-and-tumble guy river
but this is carrying this around i said
this about other from before but it's
torture here than ever before kind of
feels like Keira Knightley's and jewelry
this is the phone i would keep around
for for an expensive night out to dinner
where i wanted to wear a student in pain
you're so mean i wouldn't a nurse i
wouldnt serious i could I wouldn't take
this boat yes dangle it like a pendant
and i right you look Flav I hate a heavy
pendant but Adam ok so we've heard that
you you agree that you you would
definitely get this phone if youíve
Android was the only operating system on
the planet right well looking at the
camera just now I tested in few shots
it's pretty noisy so I don't know Adam
by the way is going to spend some time
with the HTC one m7 yeah I'll try that
cool cool cool just Kato it like dealin
yeah you know I like HTC sense anymore I
you know to be honest with you the only
reason why I want to try that phone is
because I do like HTC Sense am I the
only one service plan another you're not
the only person time actually when i use
the google play edition of the HTC one
for a while then blasters it's too um i
got missed sense i really think it's a
very nice engine with a hardware between
our own software I ma'am and it's
impossible to slow down I can slow down
kitkat on the Moto X more easily than I
can slow down since six now tell me
something I already I already watched
your review and everything but tell us
about the battery overall you did
mention in a new review but overall it's
a you know we need more testing the view
period was so like I had to keep this
thing topped up all the time what you
stream power saver mode is awesome
because apparently it guarantees it'll
give you like something ridiculous like
30 hours of standby at ten percent in
two weeks is San by boundaries i think
it's just not nice wow what a nice
religiously well go ahead go ahead and
Taylor come on um I was just skimming
through your review I didn't get to read
it yet but I was going through the
pricing and they did announce a google
play edition correct correct yeah that
isn't asked seven hundred dollars you
know huh if you're the type of person
that's gonna buy a google play edition
device I don't think it's that I don't
think if that was more expensive than
the m7 was gonna promote dude i paid
eight hundred fifty dollars for this one
I mean yeah and Vinny guys when you
actually hold this thing it is it is
very easy to understand why someone who
pay that amount of money for this I
don't understand why people would do it
for another device you know either set
of devices that are maybe made of poly
are visiting but this this is just feel
instantly working we need to get about
you know it was an expensive absolutely
not I agree with you it is very clear to
me that HTC is positioning the one as a
premium product as the highest and in
luxury and performance and everything I
just wish they didn't wouldn't have
crippled it with some of the I think
basic things which a smartphone has to
have in 2015 I guess that's the camera
Tony I don't know what goes it is the
camera for me the camera but the cameras
big enough man I mean we've got
companies like Nokia making big
investments on pier view we've got you
know a samsung adding an extra lens to
that to that you know to the casing
we've got Apple doing the same with the
iphone 5 with the six the rumors are
there already experimenting you know so
the problem is this phone feels two
years old when it comes to the camera
and that is really a problem because you
know hey you go to Facebook and your
photos get bigger and bigger more
resolution as being added to these and
you know it just makes the argument
difficult I think
if this were a company known for its
effective and prevalent marketing
messages this could we can treat me as a
non-issue but we can't and honestly we
haven't heard enough about the new
marketing intentions how to know whether
they'll be successful or not but that'll
be the thing to watch with me with the
one you know how you know I think that
the comparison that I don't want to see
I want to see this comparison from you
Michael is the desire age 16 compared to
the one existing a 16 megapixel shooter
from HTC compared to a 4 megapixel
shooter or probably we can do the
front-facing camera comparison I don't
know I mean that is just the biggest
irony in history it would help I think I
do want to ask if Adam and give a final
thought or two before we are forced to
any by our rent expiring battery and
Peter to discuss not consult no I was
just rolling I beg my own job but mean
I'm looking forward to to your thoughts
on it after spending a little time but
we will be looking to add them for
camera advice I'm Italian we still have
a lot to cover on Thursday so yeah can't
wait for Adams impressions on this
especially compared with that optical
image stabilization lacking because
you're going to test the m7 first I
imagine the m8 later oh and then you
know I'll definitely be looking forward
specially to Tony's impressions because
tony was really looking forward to this
phone and was gonna send me the m7 now i
think i'm getting an MA right Toni Elias
I was messing out now that the HTC m8 is
out and the galaxy s5 is out and that
the Sony Xperia z2 is out i think i have
my 2014 so yeah I think the I think
you're going for the z2 right yeah
Taylor about you um I'm gonna wait and
see what Motorola does this year but I
have to do this because it doesn't feel
right because Brandon is not at this
editorial roundtable Louie
he just tweeted he said this Elias
earlier you say you mate or camera is
mediocre while HTC just can't get the
camera right early reviews by the way
Brandon didn't make week i'll review
immediately after tweeting that he and I
are leaving right now you might need to
be for them yeah his next tweet was that
said of course I'm gonna buy one smiley
face yeah yeah yeah the guy that
complains about megapixels the most is
about to buy the phone that does it less
but but anyways guys before Adam and
Michael run out of battery we are going
to sign off i think we've we've covered
all the points that we've we wanted to
cover with this event I guess that I
don't know I i sadly feel disappointed i
love the design Taylor I have a major
takeaway if you take selfies this is the
camera to get actually a direct of
verbatim vote for my review is it I have
a regimen I don't know but yeah it is or
the oppo n1 I don't know because it has
the the rotating camera but yeah I just
can't get behind something that's so
behind I can't there there is no excuse
yeah there's just no excuse for it to be
a 4-megapixel camera I don't care what
HTC says there's no excuse no I think
they were doing this just for the sake
of being different just for the sake of
be unique and artistic friends with the
m7 md condition without a stubbornness
because i'm sure it's not out of me I'm
sure they could have lovely figure
letter sensor in there already expensive
film hey Leanne same here i mean i would
have rather they made that phone thicker
but anyways final thoughts Michael and
Adam before you guys go yeah if there is
a thursday pumpkin i'm with buying my
phone available right now I'm getting my
junk that changed until the mother
that's an ad looking man this thing's
season threats with Michelle take a lot
of pictures and I understand the
objections of Education and they're in
my review as well but I'd love this
device and deserves every bit of the
high school no I'm sure man I'm sure if
it wasn't for that camera this is pretty
much the perfect phone seriously yeah it
solves so many problems i mean i hate
the speakers on every smartphone and
then again the HTC stalls that we got
we've got a great display we've got
great build quality you know again if it
wasn't for the camera this would be the
perfect most thought you know which was
the only the only reason I waited for
the upgraded over dm7 uh-huh green not
the processor not the software not the
speakers it was the camera yeah yeah
Taylor final thoughts there's a reason
that my m7's is in the store it hasn't
left this drawer in about three months
four months um but there is another
thing it's a battery 2600 Mega Million
ours is an improvement but it's when you
see I was looking at a space Johnson
sorry I don't forget that it's not wrong
you don't yes this is a no one it is an
801 but I'm just saying that some of the
competition as Omega 1 and it had to
have bigger batteries I don't care how
much standby or how much stamina this
battery has a 2600 milliamp hours if
there's no denying it would have more
3,000 so why not just shoot for their
know his name and the average user
doesn't care how the phone performs an
ultra standby mode we want the phone to
perform great before it falls into ultra
standby that's really what we want don't
so I'm sorry mom so sad I'm so sad after
living of it part of the China we have
to be visited by Michaels to go do the
news guys club thank you guys yeah take
care of dudes talk to you guys later
alright so we are I guess we are signing
off sadly Michael and Adam had to had to
leave battery problems and there is more
interviews with Peter choo coming up so
I guess we are done we are
wrapped anything Taylor the one most
impressive thing I said that I would
applaud HTC if they did and that is
launched it the day they announced it
and they did yep it's available as of
seven minutes ago at verizon right now
you can walk in and buy one today and
that that's impressive they deserve huge
huge huge kudos for that but they also
missed the mark so i'm going to write my
editorial on that i'll put together
actual thoughts that make sense in text
form in a few minutes so and you know
that there is a cool thing i don't know
about you Tony but for example in in my
country camping in the United States you
have a I think it's a what is it a 15
day return period Taylor watching 14
here it's a 14 day return period I mean
if you know to be honest with you HTC is
one of those companies that we want to
succeed and that we were expecting for
this to be the phone to pull them out
and we wanted that same thing from the
m7 so you know I tell you something
probably this could be your camera
probably this could be your phone
michael has fallen in love with it I
have fallen in love with his videos so
far i do want to give it a try but sadly
in my country there is no return bureau
you biting you keep it so i will have to
wait for my next trip to the US and
probably give it a try and see after a
week if i decide to keep it or not but i
guess that is pretty much it for us Tony
anything okay I'm a little bit i have a
bitter taste in my mouth because i was
expecting more of course we knew that
nothing more will come so I'm a bit said
I hope it won't cripple their sales I
hope they will have increased sales over
the m7 for the sake of HTC as a company
there's no doubt Samsung will outsell 10
times the HTC One with their s5 and now
when it comes down to that there's also
the z2 and there's also the fine seven
so we have great great players there's a
phone for everybody here yeah I really
really want to try to find seven because
I wrote the editorial about its camera
yesterday and and what they're doing it
sounds really stupid and when I heard
about it I was like that is a terrible
idea it takes 13 megapixel images boobs
or bumps them up to 50 and then I
actually look better than the 13
megapixel images
oh yeah well we'll have to give it a try
i'll definitely be in our pocket our
labs very soon but anyways you can
