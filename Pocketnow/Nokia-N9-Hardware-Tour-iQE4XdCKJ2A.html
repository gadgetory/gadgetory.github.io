pocketnow.com and this is the Nokia n9
which is probably one of the most
beautiful smartphones on the market at
the moment Nokia is trying to impress us
with a brand new design policy and so
far I think it works and don't forget
that the Nokia n9 will give its housing
and its aspect to the upcoming Nokia 808
AAC ray which will be running Windows
Phone 7 next week on October 26 fingers
crossed for that this is the Nokia n9
and is there anything else rather than
the aspect of the phone let's go take a
look under the hood and find out
okay so let's kick this one off with a
quick size comparison between the Nokia
and nine and the Apple iPhone 4 or
iPhone 4s for that matter that's the
same as you can see they are
approximately at the Saints honest but
them again the screen on the Apple
iPhone 4 and 4s is 3.5 inches and the
one on the Nokia and 9 is 3 point 9
inches now in terms of thickness of
course the Nokia n9 is somewhat thicker
it measures 12.1 millimeters in
thickness but if you take a closer look
it's not that very well discernible
because it has tapered edges and round
edges which make it feel thinner and
even better in hand compared to the
iPhone 4 now just for the sake of
comparison let's take a look at the
European Samsung Galaxy s2 which is huge
compared to the Nokia n9 of course it's
a lot slimmer as you can see well if you
take a look at the hump at its back they
are approximately at the same thickness
but if you look for instance at the
middle of the phone the samsung galaxy
s2 is the thinnest among them but let's
take a look at the new design on the
Nokia n9 ok so in our previous video we
told you that when you grab the phone it
feels like a single slab of plastic but
then again it doesn't feel plasticky and
this is right because the Nokia n9 is
made out of a single piece of crafted
plastic and as you can see except for
the top where you will see all the
places which house the SIM card and the
micro USB slot we'll take a look at
those later there are really no gaps in
the phone it's made out of a single
piece of high-quality plastic and it
doesn't feel cheap at all it feels like
the excellent
malkia quality you've gotten used to by
now the screen is protected by Gorilla
Glass and it's very very very well
crafted around the plastic as you can
see it's not recessed it doesn't stand
out either at the top nor at the bottom
so it's very very very high quality
design nokia have really managed to
bring something new to the market of
course this will appeal to some and some
will not like it
but it's a new design and we have to
applaud malkia for this now let's take a
look at the specifications of the phone
on the inside you have a Texas
Instruments OMAP 36:30 processor walking
at 1 gigahertz which is the same
processor which is on the Motorola Droid
X then we have one gig of ram and the
processor is aided by the power VR SGX
530 GPU which brings a really good
addition to the overall smoothness of
the phone we have an 8 megapixel camera
at the back which we'll take a look in a
moment and the phone comes in two
varieties one with 16 gigabytes and one
with 64 gigabytes of internal storage
the strange I've not yet chose these two
extremes we would have liked to see a 32
gigabyte model this one right here is
the 16 gigabyte version and we'll take a
look at the phone right now so on the
top you have the speaker grille which is
really carved out of the plastic body we
have the Nokia branding and here is the
place you will find your proximity and
light sensors then again you will see
the screen which I'll try to make it so
that it reflects light you can see that
it's blueish and this is Nokia's
response to Samsung's Super AMOLED plus
screen it uses clear bright technology
for true black clock colors it's an an
OLED screen and it's pretty pretty good
compared to the Super AMOLED plus on the
galaxy s2 it's got three point nine
inches and it shows F WVGA resolution
images 854 pixels down and 480 across at
the bottom you will have your front
facing webcam which is we believe a VGA
webcam because it doesn't appear in
specifications but it might as well be a
1.3 megapixel camera we're not quite
sure about this one and right here in
the bottom I'm not sure you'll be able
to see it let me try to light it up
no you cannot there is a notification
LED right here which glows in white okay
so let's take a look at the back of the
phone as you can see it's a single piece
of plastic there are no doors you can
open there is no way of changing or
replacing or extracting the battery
which is inside our iPhone 4 and 4s it's
pretty interesting concept but it's what
Nokia decided to go with there's
absolutely nothing at the back except
for the camera and the Nokia branding
the camera is a 8 megapixel camera I'm
sorry which uses Carl sighs test our
optics and the camera believe me is very
very good and of course we have a dual
LED flash to light up the room now since
we're here let's go to the bottom and
you will see the speaker grille on the
bottom and absolutely nothing else on
the right side you have your volume
rockers volume up volume down and the
power screen lock button and when we
said that this phone is a pure touch
phone without any buttons
we didn't refer to these ones because
these ones are really not needed to
operate the phone and we'll get back to
this at the top you will find your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and these two
latches right here which are really the
only two bindings you will find on this
phone this part holds the SIM card and
this part holds the SIM card part and
the USB slot and how is that again take
a look at this you push this little bump
here like this and it unveils the micro
USB syncing and charging port this part
slides up and then up to reveal the
micro SIM card slot nokia uses micro
Sims
Allah iPhone 4 you insert the SIM card
you push it down pull it down close the
latch
and this is just about every moving
plastic part on this stone there is
nothing from the left side whatsoever
getting back on my previous thought
regarding the power button and that you
don't need it to operate the phone well
you see what basically you always need
to push a certain power button or a home
button on the phone to wake up the
device when it sleeps well you don't
have to always push the power screen
sleep button on the side of the n9 in
order to wake it up you just have to
double tap the screen like this and it's
up and since we've already managed to
wake it up from its sleep mode let's
take a look at the screen as you can see
colors are beautiful vivid and the
blacks are really rich and deep blacks
let's just see here a black screen as
you can see there is no backlight you
just have the white icons and the gray
text and nothing else let's get back to
the screen and since it's already here
let's try to compare it to the Super
AMOLED plus screen on the samsung galaxy
s2 and we've prepared a fairly similar
image to be displayed on both for the
sake of comparison let's get these two
up and let's see what we have here we
have WVGA on the Left we have fw VGA on
the right and as you can see in terms of
color brightness contrast and how livid
the colors are there illy really isn't a
huge difference between the galaxy x2
and the AMOLED on the nokia n9 to be
quite honest I prefer the screen of the
Nokia and line because the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 tends to over saturate colors
and it really it really doesn't display
the true images which were captured but
this is a personal thought that all
comes down to two
personal preference I prefer the a moet
screen on the Nokia n9 because it's
really more natural so this was a short
look at the hardware of the Nokia n9
it's a great phone with a great design
and hopefully it will be the same phone
with Windows Phone 7 next week with the
Nokia CRA
