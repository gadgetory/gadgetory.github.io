getting us something new in its 2019
lineup and adding even includes iPhones
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus wood
ceramic back has leaked in its price and
it's kind of crazy and we get the other
leaked images of the LGB 50 think he'll
at 5g that made come at MWC I'm high
memory better and this Monday would be a
lot easier if I didn't have to travel
tomorrow because there's a lot to do in
San Francisco this is far get out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for a loosely
used iPhone currently wood has the
iPhone 6s for 150 bucks and then you can
find the iPhone 7 for 235 which is crazy
obviously you know the conditions but
you can learn more in the description
now let's talk about TCL as the company
has started teasing something very
interesting I mean they've been making
smart phone displays for a bit right now
and well now we see that they're working
on flexible OLED z' and they've got a
couple of concepts some that are
wearable some that are not
they offer a tablet form factor of flip
phone I mean it looks interesting let's
just see if we get something in a movie
you see now let's talk about the LG be
50 think you we were expecting to see
this phone until later this year but
according seven blasts we might be able
to see something at MWC s already got
leaked images of the d50 which looks a
lot like the v40 to some minor changes
in design the 5g logo on Sprint and
hopefully this is true 5g after the
lawsuit from Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T we'll see
what we get now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 obviously we're just
a couple of days away from unpacked we
got some leaks from China now claiming
the price tag it seems that the ceramic
variant which is the one terabyte and
the crazy amounts of RAM twelve gigs is
what I heard $1500 for the price tag and
then we've got other cases like six gigs
of ram and 8 gigs of ram and it's just
rather confusing not exactly sure what
model they're talking about but yeah it
seems that there will be more than one
tier in every variant and finally the
hottest news that I have to do with
Michiko and predictions for what to
expect for Apple and apparently not for
the March event it seems that we're
gonna have to wait until later but we
hear that Apple is working on a ton of
things like 32 gigs of RAM
on the MacBook Pro 13 inch that there
will no longer be a 15 inch MacBook Pro
that it'll now be 16 inches which I
assume it's just gonna make the bezels
smaller on the display and give you the
same size chassis which would be great
it seems that iPhones will see an
overhaul in design from the matrix
camera to some changes in software to
the fact that the back is now going to
need matte glass like the one + 6 + 1 +
60 finally Apple welcome and in addition
we also hear that iPads are not going to
grow in size that instead we will be
getting the less respect iPads with a
same dasari same footprint but larger
display whatever the case may be let us
know in the comments down below I mean
what do you think do you think that
Apple should actually wait so long to
show us something like this or do you
think that it should happen soon because
in my case I think the March event would
be in order for this but that's just me
leave us a comment down below with a
familiar opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on pocketnow.com it's scratched up on
our channels english and spanish more
videos like this one can follow me on
twitter handers quarterly that aren't
instagram at high memory data please
