be getting a Galaxy Note 1000 lei tur
this year
iPhone 11 rumors claimed that the triple
cameras in the frosted back might be
deployed on evenly and Foxconn is
officially moving their iPhone
production to India because that's a big
deal right now I'm highly metairie then
I end up forget of a little bit of an
early recording but I'm about to go see
a product and it's gonna be really hot
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the Apple watch series 4
which is the one that I highly recommend
it is currently on sale for $50 off both
on B&amp;amp;H and Amazon I'm not gonna bore you
with the details this is definitely the
Apple watch they get you can learn more
in the description now let's talk about
honor as well we just have press
invitations or an event to happen in
London on May 21st and the company is
not skimping out on details this is
pretty much the honor 20 there was a
math equation and then photography of
the Tower Bridge I love how they say
that it's London Bridge but that's
actually the Tower Bridge in London and
yeah it seems that photography is going
to be a big deal and we are going to be
there covering it live now let's talk
about Foxconn and the future of iPhones
obviously you know everything that's
been going on between the US
administration and China and tariffs and
everything so the smartest thing to do
is to just move production out of China
which is what Foxconn is doing for Apple
right now apparently production is going
to be moving as soon as July meaning the
next generation iPhones could be pretty
much built in India fully which is good
news
let's just see which devices these are
because we still don't have details and
speaking of iPhones we've got some
trusted sources claiming a couple of
things the first one is that yes we
should expect three models of the iPhone
11 this year 11 11 Macs and 11 are I
guess and it seems that the differences
won't be that significant this time it
seems that Samsung just taught Apple
something right now as apparently the
triple cameras are coming to all three
phones we just don't know if there's a
difference in resolution between them
but triple cameras on all three phones
this time what is going to differentiate
the higher-end between and the lower end
we assume as the materials obviously and
then the second is that frosted glass
back apparently will only be
coming to the higher-end models the 11
and the 11 max let's see what we get
that too
and finally the hottest new today I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 1000
because according to one of the sources
these are the final names the larger
variant is going to be the pro and
literally it's just going to be the
larger variant we even here that the 5g
and the regular variant there will be a
pro of each and then a regular variant
of each the biggest question is exactly
why is samsung going to dub this device
the pro over the regular because we
noticed for example when it comes to
Apple that the pro and regular are
significant differences when it comes to
the spec sheet and everything in today's
common let us know I mean what do you
think that Samsung is going to add to
this note Pro or do you think that Pro
would be well used for just a larger
devices in my case I believe not I think
that there has to be an added value
something that this device would be able
to do that the other one won't for me to
consider it a pro but that's just me
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
