another solid year for smartphones
surveying the editorial staff at pocket
now we're continuing our lists of
favorite phones of the year top features
best performance we're doing something a
little different in our camera Awards
this year instead of ranking we're
highlighting the manufacturers that best
achieved a particular style or usage a
number score free of other context and
doesn't make a whole lot of sense when
two manufacturers might be courting very
different experiences here are our top
five favorite photography performers of
the year kicking things off with LG we
expect the V Series to bring something
special to content creators the sharpest
lens we've reviewed the most flexible
version of a dual camera shooter but
this phone really shines when firing up
the manual video mode exacting control
cinah log for color grading and the best
audio controls for recording and
monitoring designed more for the person
behind the viewfinder and less for the
person taking the selfie it's the most
complete package users can find out of
the box to take their video production
up to the next level Apple earned some
kudos this year not for the look of
photos and videos performance closely
resembling last year's iPhones but the
underlying tech on Apple cameras helped
move the industry forward better
compression high quality output in
significantly smaller file sizes now
iPhone 4k video is about the same size
as most other phones 1080p even the
world's third largest manufacturer
couldn't move Google to support HEV C
this processing also enabling 240 frames
per second Full HD slow motion video
terrific quality of life improvements
without sacrificing the familiarity iOS
users expect with the world's most
popular camera another company
delivering techie solutions for
smartphone cameras Google reinforced
their reputation as a top-tier software
solution firm the pixel to manages with
one camera what most other companies
require to to achieve computational
solutions to
prove image stabilization HDR and their
software background blur this is all
wrapped up in the top option for folks
who want simplicity the most
point-and-shoot friendly option on our
list perfect for people who might not
even want to tap the screen to focus
they can count on the pixel doing all
the heavy lifting for them just hit the
shutter and you'll probably get a juicy
colorful photo you'll want to show off
on social media huawei of course stands
in contrast to Google's simple approach
with the most camera like shooter on our
list this partnership with like it
continues to bear fruit for folks who
want to capture the most photographic
images they can from a phone the auto
mode takes a nice turn towards AI for
recognizing subjects adjusting exposure
settings based on that recognition and
then altering post-processing settings
based on a locally stored library of
pleasing images of course turning to the
manual modes you get as granular as you
want in controlling your output stills
have a life and a texture not often
found from a phone add to that one of
the more flexible and least compromised
portrait modes and you've got the phone
most likely to do battle against
standalone cameras wrapping up our list
some phones excel in auto modes but
disappoint for manual controls other
phones are the opposite but no phone
manages to combine both as well as the
Galaxy Note 8 top-tier autofocus
crowd-pleasing color processing and
great low-light performance the note 8
also brought Samsung into the dual
sensor world in a big way we can
probably point to better performers ferb
individual features but no manufacturer
was able to package as complete and
well-rounded a camera system as Samsung
this year that balance is no small feat
there's a little something here for
everyone and that's our list of top
phone cameras for 2017 did your phone
