content revolution where inexpensive
action camera hardware can produce high
quality content and we're entering the
second wave of proper 360 degree photo
and video solutions I'm Juan Carlos bag
now for pocket now and here's a brief
look at Samsung's gear 360 camera
brought to you by D brand now Samsung
reps have been aggressively quick to
point out that everything we're playing
with is pre-release and the gear 360 is
still in a pretty raw state we've seen a
bunch of different solutions for
producing 360 degree content at the most
basic we have panorama photos then
Google introduced photo spheres in the
stock Android camera app though I've
always found this photo stitching to be
a bit cumbersome other manufacturers
have played with fisheye lenses to
produce panorama pics that can be
stretched or adjusted to create single
click panorama photos and videos but
single lens cameras can only create a
strip of footage or a Half Dome a video
to get a full sphere you need at least
two lenses and two sensors stapled
together and that's what we get with the
gear 360 this ball of the camera is
bigger in person than what the hardware
looks like in press photos each lens has
around a 195 degree field of view so
even though this is a thicker body than
other solutions there's still plenty of
overlap to stitch the two pieces
together the camera will ship with a
little grip that flowers out to give the
gear 360 some feet and that handled
attaches to provide a standard tripod
mount while 360 degree content is the
main purpose of this action cam it can
be used in single lens mode to produce
an extreme wide-angle shot for those
times you want to stay behind the camera
and focus on a specific subject when
using both lenses the gear 360 will
deliver 30 megapixel stills and 3840 by
1920 resolution videos slightly lower
than UHD resolution
this is good to see as resolution gets
stretched thin when it's wrapped all
around your head we're content with
1080p when all of those pixels are
displayed in one rectangle in front of
us having used 360 degree cameras which
produce HD footage quality degrades
quickly when that two megapixel
resolution has to capture everything in
every direction not just where we're
looking images are saved to a local SD
card and Samsung reps are estimating
that each gigabyte of storage should
provide around four minutes of video
that's somewhere around a 30 to 40
megabit per second bit
like many action cameras the gear 360
can be used on its own blind or it can
be paired wirelessly to the galaxy s7
and s7 edge to use the phone as a
viewfinder at launch those two phones
will be the main focus as Samsung
evaluates which older phones are
powerful enough to process the images
from this camera efficiently and that's
where this demo got tricky as I couldn't
get the pre-release 360 to consistently
pair and preview an image through the
app on the s7 after a battery pull and a
reset a rep was able to preview an
extremely unflattering image of the two
of us from a low angle one would hope
that after the image is processed for VR
viewer we won't be quite so oompa-loompa
distorted from the wide-angle lens
having used Samsung's mirrorless cameras
like the nx30 which has a terrific
Android app for live view and file
transfer the gear 360s app should be
sorted by the time this hardware
launches next quarter though we're still
waiting to get final confirmation and
pricing and availability there's a lot
more to cover though once we get a gear
360 in house 2016 could be the year
consumers get real VR viewers and the
tools to produce their own immersive
content so stay tuned for more coverage
