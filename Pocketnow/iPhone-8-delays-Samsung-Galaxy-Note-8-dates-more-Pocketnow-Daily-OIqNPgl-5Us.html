way before the iPhone 8 Samsung is
reportedly confirming that we should
expect a Galaxy Note 8 very soon
it seems that Lenovo is teaming up with
Disney on some sort of Star Wars AR I'm
hi Marietta and if I had a dollar for
every time that I paid it on Mondays
yeah I could pretty much make a trip
with that this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're interested in the galaxy s 8 this
is probably the time at the Samsung
store there's a buy one get one free
deal but there are actually a few
catches number one you have to pay $100
for the other phone number two you
actually have to trade in another phone
which could be some galaxies and
actually some iPhones you can learn more
on the list on the description now let's
talk about HTC as the company continues
to do something that it shouldn't do I
mean dear HTC you're charging flagship
money for your you 11 so it doesn't
really make any sense for all the ads
that you serve on your phone without
some sort of subsidy for the customer it
turns out that apparently touch Pal
which is the company's the fault
keyboard is also serving ads on the U 11
as well bear in mind the reason why I
switch to swifty just immediately so
this is rather interesting Lenovo is
teaming up with Disney for this new game
called Star Wars Jedi challenges
apparently there's a lightsaber there is
some sort of a are goggles that are
horrible they don't look like anything
I've ever seen before but anyways
apparently this game should be very
awesome the teaser is rather short can't
wait to learn more about it now as well
to spotlight over to the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 for those of you wondering
exactly when it's going to be announced
the company's CEO has pretty much just
confirmed that in late August we should
expect an unpacked event where well it
most likely will be a Tifa because
that's what happens late August the
pre-show is pretty much late August and
then the event starts in early September
so I don't think they're going to make
another event in New York City just to
match whatever is happening in Berlin
because we've always gotten something
from Samsung in Berlin anyway so stay
tuned we'll be airing it live and
finally the very interesting news that
they have to do with the iPhone 7s and
7s plus actually not the iPhone 8 mainly
because we've got two
trusted sources claiming two things
number one that we should expect the new
iPhone 7s 7 s plus late August which
kind of doesn't make sense we usually
get them September late September and
apparently the iPhone 8 is not going to
enter mass production until sometime in
November meaning we could probably not
get this phone until early December if
ever and that kind of doesn't make sense
it wouldn't be the first time that we
see massive leaks of a new iPhone coming
like in the case of the iPhone 5 iPhone
4s period where there were rumors of the
iPhone 5 it just could not make it up to
the point where Apple's stuck to the 4s
so anyways that leads me to the question
today do you think that you would be
willing to wait you would be willing to
wait for the next generation iPhone 8
until December or we just get the Galaxy
Note 8 for example in my case I would
totally go for the node 8 I would not
wait for the next iPhone I mean that
thing must be amazing for me to be
willing to wait and there is really no
way to know leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get to this earlier before the
videos filmed all of us don't find out
