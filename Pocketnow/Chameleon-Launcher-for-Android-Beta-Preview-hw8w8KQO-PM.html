pocketnow.com not too long ago a new
project showed up on Kickstarter for a
new Android home screen or launcher
called chameleon chameleon was mainly
designed for tablets allowing you to
have a more beautiful display in a
different home screen for different
scenarios so you would have a work home
screen and an evening home screen and
the home screen would changed based on
your location or the time of day
chameleons had a lot of promise well
chameleon is out in beta right now to
those that have backed the Kickstarter
project I've got a copy of a beta here
and while it's not really done or even
close to done we can begin to see the
underpinnings of what just might be one
of the coolest launchers to come out for
Android tablets and actually Android
phones too let's check out chameleon
beta for Android let's get to it oh and
here it is chameleon launcher and again
it's in beta and it operates a little
bit different than other launchers out
there or a lot lot bit different and the
real promise is in the future potential
of these widgets so right now I've got a
handful of widgets i've got a twitter
search for HTC up there which will
update on a regular basis got a pocket
now newsfeed XD developers new news feed
and the weather up here and all of these
are kind of scrollable within their own
frames now let's say I want to add a
widget so you tap and hold on one of the
homescreen box and you go to widgets now
the real promise here is with the
addition of widgets chameleon UI when
they first came out showed a Netflix
origin a Spotify widget Facebook widget
and right now you're limited to only 5
which aren't incredibly useful but some
of them are pretty cool so you can go to
this Twitter widget click the Settings
button and where did it go I must have
hit the X button actually so we go back
to Twitter and hit the Settings button
and from here we can either add a
Twitter feed account if you've got an
account that you want to watch or we can
do a search which is cool because if you
want to see trending topics like what's
going on with Mars right now we can type
in Mars click done and it will stream in
all the tweets that are occurring as a
result of the Curiosity rover thing
landing on
Mars now we can go to other home screens
too we can do the same tap and hold we
can change there's some tooltips there
we can change the wallpaper limited
selection right now but they're all
actually kind of nice and we press the
checkmark and we've got three blank home
screens there and you can add more home
screens as you wish down here we press
the home screen chooser this is where
you would go to add a new home screen or
edit the content of a particular home
screen now you also get a doc down here
with chameleon and so you can tap and
hold these and throw them away and then
here's the app tray we can go into the
app tray and add whatever you want down
to the dock and the dock is actually
side scrollable so if we add more than
can fit what you'll see is that if I do
this right it doesn't like duplicates
okay if I do this right it will kind of
push over some other ones to the side so
when we go back it Scrolls to the side
and you have a different set of dock
icons on every home screen so again the
idea is that you have a different home
screen for a different time of day
apparently there will be advanced
functionality that lets the tablet
automatically switch to a home screen
based on location time and that kind of
thing so so far so good you can't really
get this right now unless you back to
the project and if you back the project
you download this from google play then
your send an email to allow it to
authenticate to your device but this
looks promising we'd love to see new
launchers we'd love to see people try to
change the Android UI because that's
what's Android is all about customizing
and customizing and customizing so
anyway if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and let us know what
you think about chameleons that's it for
now and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
