mobile technology news has passed and
we're going to talk about all of it so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode 200 of the pocket now week this
weekly podcast is where we dissect and
discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smart phones tablets and
wearables it's all this stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and had
comic book characters printed on your
underpants i'm juan carlos back now
senior editor pocketnow.com blasting
this signal from sunny Southern
California and rounding out this techy
trio we're joined by contributing editor
for pocket now mr. Adam Dowd good
afternoon sir thank you i still have
cartoon characters printed on my
underpants so know what you're talking
about we're all over grown men children
i love it and podcast producer Jules
Wong is going to be keeping this show
running smooth out on the east coast how
you doing the old you need to graduate
to Jimmy's jammies I I you know what I
was thinking about this the other day I
really do need a good pair of footed
pajamas for when I go out and visit
family in colder climates I think I'll
go say for those blistering cold winters
that you get over on the west coast
there well it's it's like I come from
Mountain climate and then move to
California now my blood super thin so I
definitely need to immerse them more
cold gear 11 so folks the time on the on
the west coast excuse me the time of the
west coast is 11am so let's talk some
tech first up you know mr. mr. Dowd you
know joining up at cast is the first
time we've gotten to produce this live
together um I would imagine that you've
got a lot of really cool gear in your
home I have awesome gear in my home and
it's mostly filled with kids stuff but I
do have some good stuff myself but you
know like you know so even your kids
would would ascribe to this sort of
collect
Shin of toys that we like to talk about
here on the pocket at weekly and it
would be a shame if something were to
happen to that collection of gear
wouldn't it they would never stop crying
and either one I never stopped so this
week sponsor actually has a solution
which might help you and us and our
viewers out and that's frontpoint

protect your gear protect your home
protect your family members and you'll
also be showing this weekly podcast a
little love now I don't have any outside
confirmation on this but I've heard that
FrontPoint security is great against
ninjas oh really yes it also gets the
item doubt seal of approval for anti
ninja absolutely as you know what I'm
going to sleep at night I always worry
about those ninjas well I mean cuz you
can't see him you can't be here right
it's crazy you know is one of those
things you like I think home security
systems have been focused on the pirate
thread for so long they're just when I
want to leave you now hold ama graphic
leaving out the ninjas so I'm glad to
hear that a company is starting to work
towards better ninja security that's
absolutely absolute xu against the purge
oh no i think for that you need like a
wall system with like sentry guns and I
don't know that FrontPoint is really
geared for that unfortunately yeah but
it does feel like every day of this
political cycle like we're just moving
it's hey it might be their new vertical
come on point protect yourself from the
zombie apocalypse with FrontPoint
security it is funny like how much I
really enjoy those purge movies there
there is something really compact about
just overly ridiculous depictions of
graphic violence hmm so uh before we get
into any more hilarity and high jinks Mr
Wong would you be so kind as to explain
to people how they might be able to get
in touch with us for the show well sure
you don't have to beat our mailboxes out
of the ground and you know set fire to
them or whatever they do in the purge
you can just contact us at a podcast at
pocketnow.com you want to email us your
questions that you haven't been able to
get onto our live show and by the way
you can do that by just going into the
hangouts the hangouts on air tab of the
YouTube page and you can just get in ask
few questions and just send them our way
we don't have any questions just yet but
if you do happen to be be browsing
around taking a look and like some of
the questions that you read thumb them
up and hey send them some love some of
these questions some love and we already
have a first comment in the QA from mr.
Caldwell's a pal of mine he's saying
lovin the hats I had to go with the pork
pie this week and was kind enough to
join me with a bowler and and that's a
that's a really chic little bowler there
I dig that I you know I really wish that
I dressed better from the hair down so
that I could wear this more often but
unfortunately this head is nearing
retirement for the season so I can only
wear it when I have the trench coat on
and then you know that I don't wear that
until November and if I wear a trench
coat around Southern California everyone
instantly assumes that i'm up to
nefarious deeds so important my short
brim doesn't get as much love out yer as
I'd like it to either but I do love it
so we might have to adopt you into the
hat trick club so I I would I would be
very interested in joining said
organization as I am a fan of hats I'm
just a scream so Jules is just a pocket
now logo we should we should have made a
hat for the pocket out logo so Jules
could have participated there you go
this get on that Jules this broadcast
yeah you're our Photoshop master you
should have done that you should have
known and you should have participated
I'm very disappointed Jules I'm glad
that I didn't put it actually on my
resume I didn't have to put a resume
into bucket now too good I was like
we're not that we're not that discerning
so um what we get to before we get to
the news topics I have a little
housekeeping to do this is actually kind
of a surprise I didn't put this on the
rundown guys sorry about that um we uh
last week during the podcast we talked
about a viewer poll that we had set up
on YouTube where we wanted to get your
opinions the audience's opinions on
which smartphone had the best speakers
and so we recorded samples from the HTC
10 the HTC One m9 and then we used the
Galaxy s7 as something of a palate
cleanser so that you could sort of
better hear some of the differences
between front-facing speakers a split
high frequency and low frequency speaker
and then a traditional bottom firing
speaker and the results of that listener
survey that listener poll are in and
taking the top prize with sixty-eight
percent of the viewer vote is the HTC 10
this the HTC 10 walked away with the
victory so you know there were a number
of people really upset or really
concerned i should say about HTC's split
speaker strategy for the newest version
of boom sound but when listening to all
of these samples it would seem that our
audience was is enjoying this new
experiment from HTC the HTC One m9 took
twenty eight percent of the vote and
then funnily enough I four percent of
our viewers actually preferred the sound
of the galaxy s7 so even Samsung managed
to eke out a little love even though we
kind of put them up there is you know
not necessarily a an actual command or
competitor but more like I said as a
palate cleanser but people still seem to
dig it so I want to thank all the people
who participated in that survey I think
we racked up something like 40,000
listens on those various speaker tests
and people were really getting into the
comments trying to determine which phone
they liked the best was it was pretty
fun territory I think we're going to try
and do a few more of these types of
samples maybe even try to do some blind
like maybe for camera stuff
blind comparisons between a couple
different cameras and see what people
actually like we used to do name that
camera feature where we go out and take
a bunch of a bunch of pictures with you
know a smartphone camera and then you
know post the the raw images online and
we added out all the exif data so that
you couldn't just like go in there and
say oh yeah well to iPhone um so we used
to do that so we can we can breathe some
life into that concept I just like I
just like anything that gets people like
picking fights with each other in a
civil way well sure who doesn't in the
comments and so even some of the
comments on on this this boom sound test
were pretty funny so so yeah but that
that we said we'd announce the results
and the HTC 10 is the victor if you want
the best fabulous food on a mobile
device it's the HTC 10 or nothing maybe
like a sound effect well i'm glad i got
mine today yeah oh yeah are you rocking
the 10 now Jules oh yeah and then got it
today this morning and that's why I'm in
all of a tizzy so oh I can hang it
you're the tremendous excitement in your
voice as for the tremendous excitement
of having to go downtown and get on the
green line and then find out hey it's uh
it's all ski that market today as much
as we want to definitely continue this
podcast with Jules is a shopping list
and daily chores routines we should
probably move on to the news topics of
the weeks of the top stories little
pimples get in well if we must on
pocketnow.com of jewels you want to
queue us in so starting us off I want to
talk about accessories and especially
Adam because you you're the editor who's
most responsible for some of our like
our weekend shootouts for collaboration
posts tran de there was a story that we
posted on pocketnow.com about a new LG
friend accessory which is going to be a
new little action camera there they're
developing to compete with GoPros and
this is this one just struck me
interesting because the whole point of
this camera is that it can it can work
like an accessory
or it can work completely separate from
a phone in every way thanks to its own
dedicated LTE connection and I was
wondering if your brain do you think
that this is something we'll see as a
trend moving forward where this notion
of mobility accessories doesn't really
necessarily mean they have to be tied to
your phone right well it's right
actually it's actually really cool
because on the one hand a lot of the
situations where you're going to be
taking one of these cameras is not a
situation that you necessarily want to
have a seven hundred dollar phone in
your pocket so like when you're rafting
or when you're biking or motor cycling
or whatever you adventure people do I
don't know but you don't necessarily
want to have you know something tethered
so that you can broadcast but at the
same time accessories like this just
still raise that same question of the
data use and where is that data going to
come from are you going to get a
separate package for the data re our
carrier is going to have to start
bundling in your phone's data to go
along with it and even when you do that
streaming video that's a lot of data and
just about every you know mobile data
plan has some type of cap or limit so
what's going to happen when you start
streaming all these videos and I mean
now maybe if you have like a job where
you know if you're like in x games or
something like that and this would you
know this is a justified expense but for
the average consumer I'm not so sure so
I just that's a question that hasn't yet
satisfactorily been answered yet men
right I think it's going to be in the
carrier's realm to figure it out I can
definitely say that this is definitely
bringing the broadcast side out of me
because we've seen television crews big
and small a by up little backpack
cameras backpack again but it's with 3g
4g LTE connectivity and they the
progress has been a kinda slow on them
and yeah that's it well in in marcus
cast is is it is a really interesting
area i mean because i don't think LG has
any illusions that this this action
camera that they're coming up with is
really not going to be able to that
grade well but but I I don't think they
have any illusions like I think they're
starting to
some of these devices into more
professional territories but they're not
going to unseat go pro with the first
generation device and I think they're
there they're being a little
conservative with how they're presenting
this this is going to be more about you
know you being able to do streaming for
you know your family and friends and
then you can kind of push it into some
professional realms but broadcast is a
really interesting solution where I
because I I have a background in
voiceover Jules has a background in
journalism you know when you look at
news agencies they're still utilizing
some really you know older technologies
to make those live broadcasts happen in
a lot of in a lot of situations and it's
uh you know in in mentioning what you
were talking about Adam we still haven't
really seen that technology push where
we can count on these services we can
count on the data we can count on
internet connections to provide the same
level of of streaming of fluidity of
video and audio we still have a ways to
go yo packet loss becomes a huge problem
where when i'm recording voiceover and i
want to work with a talent across the
country i'm using is key yet i'm using
phone lines talked about that in
previous podcasts yeah it's it's kind of
funny like we still haven't found the
tech version of that just yet but I i
wonder if we start seeing these types of
products take off like for example is
there a market for a pair of wireless
headphones that have an LTE connection
so that you can connect directly to
Spotify or google music or Apple music
you don't even have to worry about that
being a part of your phone situation
like you you want to go out you want to
do a workout you've got a SmartWatch so
that you can send emergency texts or you
know make an emergency phone call and
then you've got headphones that have
their own data connection and we have
our own little personal area network and
you don't even need to leave the house
with the phone anymore is that a
possible future where these devices
might diversify the landscape and is
that something that consumers are even
interested in you're just I don't know
but you're scaring the crap out of our
band manufacturers right now and I'm
happy to do it I do want to circle back
to your point about getting families
into this because the way that I see it
they're using smartphones however
unwieldy it is they're not I don't see
them to getting a proprietary device
and then using it take it out of the
drawer every you know so often to be
able to just stream a little something
to Grandpa I mean come on skype just do
that yeah we want those things were if
you're going to buy into it you're going
to buy into the whole ecosystem you're
going to have the camera that can stream
itself you're going to have the
headphones that connect to Spotify
you're going to have all this stuff that
you know can just go completely wireless
and it's going to be one of those things
where if you're not going to buy just
one thing I get the sense that you know
you're we're going to be attacking an
entire market that just wants to have
everything you know I won't even buy a
hamburger if I can't get netflix on it
that type of thing everything on
different devices on 30 devices you know
what that's like so interesting about
this potential future because you know
in talking about you know a family goes
out and buys cameras or stuff like that
you know I've got a couple friends who
have gone and invested in things like
GoPros and you see them like the first
week they have that GoPro that GoPro is
with them everywhere then the second
week you know other life is not nearly
as interesting as I thought yeah exactly
by the time you get to about a month
it's it's like maybe they pull it out
when they go like to a water park or
when they go to the ocean or something
like that but it's it's very rarely
rarely used after that point and so do
we think that consumers are gonna be
interested in splitting these services
and products up again remember when
smartphones came out how many
conversations did we geeks have with
less tech tech savvy individuals like oh
yeah my phone can do this and it can
check its email and it can play music
and it can take and it can take pretty
decent pictures and can do all these
things and then you would get the reply
was like oh yeah but you know I've got a
flip phone and I've got a laptop and
I've got a nice camera so why would I
want to put all those things in one
device if I lose that device then I lose
my email and my camera and my music so I
have an ipod and a flip phone and that's
that works better for me they calculate
all about you and now we're breaking
back out back it's a circle of life
Simba is this the pendulum swing Marty
Cooper rep 20 so all things come full
circle so I'll be really curious to see
how these things take off in and in it
kind of speaks to later on we're going
to be talking
Motorola and modular phones and
accessories and things like that again
so I it I think there's an uphill battle
I think consumers are pretty well
trained to look at their smartphone as a
catch-all the idea of walking around
multiple gadgets i think is something
that we need to explore again but
speaking of smartphones and multiple
gadgets and cameras and all this cool
stuff um we've been spending some time
with the huawei p9 and most of that time
has been spent on the dual camera
sensors these leica inspired dual camera
sensors on the back of the phone but we
we wanted to actually see you know is
this a pretty well-rounded device is it
a decent flagship or is this just
another smartphone built around one
gimmick and so our full review of the
huawei p9 is up on pocketnow.com you can
check that out it's a it's a it's a
reasonably concise video it's about
seven minutes long and you can get your
p9 fix so Adam what just just out of
curiousity what smartphone are you
rocking right now what's what's your
sort of go to daily driver uh I actually
is a s6 edge right now but I'm having a
nexus 6p delivered today so no yay so
hooray for a year old technology um but
you're going to be joining the huawei
cam i am and i'm also going to be
joining the tight the type-c revolution
so oh so which which is great because
I've got a desk full of these and I have
nothing for type C so you have to go out
and do some shoppin the cable migration
is is definitely a kick up the up the
rear but it's funny like how nerdy
cranky i get about not having a type-c
connector on a phone well just get about
all right ones I'm just uh yeah I
personally I'm looking forward to being
able to plug in my phone blindfolded so
right I know it's it's so silly and
really I mean it's not that big a deal I
don't know that phones are really taking
advantage of all of the type see
specifications yet so I think you're
really missing out on anything
really super cool techie but there is
just something nice about knowing that
you're also investing in a future
standard user so we've got plenty of
support if you're a fan of this podcast
you probably have a drawer of micro USB
cables like we all do um but you know
you you get that new USB type-c you get
a couple nice cables maybe you know
you're looking at chargers things like
that I I jumped over with the Lumia 950
so I've got this continuum doc that's
just sitting here doing nothing oh so
sad spoiler alerts are my paying USB
type-c weekend debate coming up Shh Oh
crazy pants love it so you know in
looking at some of the features on the
p9 you know you were talking about USB
type-c it's just kind of nice it's nice
knowing like moving forward I'm gonna be
covered right um but I'm stoked to hear
that you're going Nexus 6p the 6p is the
phone that I haven't spent a lot of time
with but I think it was the introduction
to Western audiences that Huawei exists
and that they make some killer handsets
right absolutely why we're alert for the
full review I think the p 9 carries on
that tradition really well it seemed
like a cute baby by the way so how the
picture in the I try I tried to not put
her on camera as often as I can but
every now and then proud papa has to
show her off of course so but yeah what
really intrigued me was that was the
dual the the photo samples that you had
in the video we're just pristine I mean
there is beautiful so especially the the
real extreme close-up of the whatever
flower that is my wife could tell you
what Florida's but I don't the lily yeah
I mean you can actually see the pollen
on it was beautiful it was beautiful
that was like that was a 50-percent crop
clue so it's it's a WoW we we did spend
a lot of time we have the most in depth
camera review of the p9 anywhere online
it's a 12-minute so the full review for
the phone six minutes long the camera
review 12 minutes wait we might have
obsessed a little bit just say we
totally obsessed a lot of it and if you
want to see every nuance of what this
camera can do it was really frustrating
because there was that whole
backlash but there was that whole sort
of gripe fest about these cameras not
really being built by leica but just
being sort of certified by like and it
was a situation that I think really felt
really took or needed a lot of nuanced
discussion in that leica is a company
they don't really make camera sensors
like canon or shown you everything was
Sony yeah yeah so I mean even the
sensors on the the p9 they're from Sony
I so it was sort of a difficult
conversation to sort of help illustrate
or help educate because leica is a
company they're known for their lenses
and then they do a lot of collaboration
with companies like Panasonic so for
their own camera bodies they use micro
four thirds panasonic sensors and then
tune the sensors and lenses to like a
standards and that's kind of what they
did with Huawei and so you know there
was that initial burst of like wow this
is gonna be really exciting it's a leica
phone and then there was that backlash
oh it's not really a like a phone like
it didn't really make this thing and
then you actually look at the photo
output if you spend some time with this
camera the results you can get from it
are stunning so um are especially for
the stills not so much for the video but
for other other performance I was really
surprised to see that the p9 handled
gaining really well this is using a cure
in 955 chipset which I've never heard of
before and I've never encountered before
and after make right there kieran that's
their own wet the high silicon and I
think the Huawei has is either a sub
City a like the high school science of
sitting on your own something yeah so I
that that 955 we were doing a gaming
tests on it and I mean for normal sort
of navigating the user interface it's
pretty much the same as any other
flagship but we were firing up some
pretty intense games and it was hanging
in there really well against phones like
the Galaxy s7 and the LG g5 with
Qualcomm 8 20 s so uh I think maybe
you've happiest of all outside of
Google's purview you know that this
isn't just a google designed or a
reference design and then Huawei
executed that reference design
if this really does seem to be a pretty
well-rounded flagship it should be
interesting to see if this is another
step towards getting a little more
market share in the United States yeah
attacking the titans of Samsung and
Apple well in sort of acknowledging that
for the rest of the world Huawei is it
tighten number three not bad oh yeah
it's hard to complain uh so you know
madam especially with you going to the
Nexus 6p do you think that this is the
type of stuff that we want to see here
in North America for a little more
competition or do we think that this is
still going to be you know a samsung and
everyone else kind of a kind of year or
two for android devices it's it's a good
first step it's gonna take more than
just this it's going to take a lot of
what Samsung hands right now is brand
recognition all right so I was just you
see Samsung's all I mean I take the
train to and from work every day and I
see Samsung Samsung Samsung Apple
Samsung say I mean it's just the they've
got they've got so much brand
recognition they're buying airports
although I need to come up with a new
reference because that's actually like
two years old now we're Samsung
plastered Heathrow Airport with like all
these ads but anyway but it's just that
the marketing machine behind Samsung is
so incredible that you know competitors
like LG or Huawei are going to need to
they just need to provide a better
experience for a long time before
they're going to start making headway
it's going to be it's a marathon it's
not a sprint actually a great point to
in that you know even even with
companies that are pretty well
established in the United States when
we're looking at say an LG and HTC
Motorola um we see this huge disparity
between the amount of advertising that
accompanied like Samsung will deliver
and the amount of advertising that LG or
HTC or any other company like you know
ask a general consumer out on the street
if they've even seen a huawei ad and I
be very surprised if any of them exist
for Western audiences maybe something on
YouTube like something that
you'd ever see on TV or hear on the
radio or something like that and I think
that's maybe the biggest hurdle facing a
lot of these companies is they're making
great products but no one knows that
they even exist and i don't thing is is
that you don't have carrier partners
they don't have any prepaid partners
really to sell their a big knee aim
devices and if you don't have that if
you directing people today by unlock to
go to our site and be a little confused
well I don't think that would be the
best that's maybe the best friends
looking ever go to our site and beacon
yes we're bringing the confusion to you
free of charge confusion totally free
the smartphone it will cost you 700
bucks a confusion still free but yeah
you get my point small brand needs be
your carrier brand to latch on to and to
market to be able to market that
connection so yeah well I'll be really
interesting to see if any of these
companies really do start ticking that
over I know um you know LG's been trying
to step it up they got Jason Statham for
their main ad campaign on the LG g5 HTC
was rocking Gary Oldman in their spots
we we don't talk about Gary Oldman I
just you know I'm saying is is someone
who was recognizable and was put into a
commercial um but moving on moving right
along and so you can't catch the full
Huawei p9 review and the full Huawei p9
real camera review on pocket now calm
and our youtube channel youtube.com
slash pocket now definitely check them
out because this is a unique experience
for folks who are really into
photography but moving right along to
another a chinese manufacturer who owns
a formerly american brand we're looking
at some interesting news on two fronts
from lenovo and motorola so lenovo of
course showing off an 18.4 inch tablet
and i have to wonder what do you do
within 18 inch tablet you know there's
no
on your fridge yeah what I have TVs that
are smaller than that but am I am I
crazy or is the leader image on this new
story a samsung yeah that's because as a
samsung galaxy view they have their own
thing back last fall and they I was just
I was blatant like wait a minute no
you're always out and not embarrassing
at all that's right well I'm youth are
benchmarks and there's no like we don't
really cover 18 inch tablets on a
regular basis I don't maybe we should
sure well it's a really tough call
though because what we're looking at
here is an 18.4 inch android tablet
powered by some variant of a Snapdragon
processor with a quad HD screen I again
I have to ask if you've got android on
an 18.4 inch diagonal what exactly are
we trying to do with that I mean that's
that's entry-level imac territory I'm
still saying not gonna put yeah and it's
it's also i mean it's android so there's
not even although maybe there will be
and we'll talk we'll get to that in a
second but there's not even like any
type of split-screen capability or
anything like that it's just you're
gonna have one gigantic 18.4 inch
diagonal app so imagine imagine if you
will for a second the Twitter app
running on that particular tablet I was
just gonna say Instagram which doesn't
even support landscape deeply oh yes
well and already makes a great point
about the galaxy view which debuted in
the fall that was only a 1080p screen
and really were only talking about media
consumption on this thing you put in
your kitchen or you put it as something
next to I don't know something that
replaces your TV if you have a Roku or I
don't know how TV works anymore because
I cut the cake cool though roku's and
your cable cutting yeah you know net
netflix i mean that's that's pretty much
it doesn't have a remote though does it
okay I wouldn't imagine a would but
so maybe you don't and that's how it
goes but you know again I I'm just III
don't know what to make of devices like
that and I do couple other larger
Android tablets like there's a lenovo
multimode tablet that I'm now forgetting
the name of and I think it was like a 13
inch screen and even that felt
unnecessary or it was a tough fit for me
to find problems for you know like I
look at tablets or all gadgets really
every gadget is an answer to a problem
for tablets you kind of have to find the
problem that the tablet is an answer for
and I was really struggling with that 13
inch tablet to really come up with who
does this tablet work for who's who
would benefit from the singer who has
problems this thing would solve so
expanding the screen size just seems to
me to complicate what deficiencies we
see in mobile gear without necessarily
bringing any of the problem solving that
more dedicated computers might bring to
the table but it's bigger they're taking
it to 11 man come on no they're taking
it to 18.4 I think that's that's enough
on the lenovo tablet i'm sure we'll get
more information on that hopefully maybe
we'll even get one to review even though
that sort of betrays what we stand for
here at Pocket all we should talk about
this for the whole hours that don't in
our pocket um but moving on to a company
that Lenovo own who's got some exciting
stuff coming up is a motorola and
motorola is looking at dropping some
bombs with a pair of new phones coming
up Jules would you mind walking us
through some of the developments for
what what Motorola is set to deliver oh
sure so yeah Evan blast just blasted us
with a whole bunch of details to a bunch
of uh renders that got leaked out from
hello moto HK and if my computer can be
nice to me and actually let me show you
these render so we're talking about
these things that originally the hello
moto HK renders also included a droid
turbo known we just Detroit um phone
that was similarly built as these two
that you see on your screen and
apparently the ones on your screen have
different names have different specs and
are different so we're talking about the
vertex and the vector thin vector thin
being the upper end of this whole spiel
and you can think of it as like last
year's motive X play or the Moto X style
Muto XP or edition so in terms of the
vertex or the this year's play we have a
full HD screen and the Snapdragon 625
it's overclocked to 2.4 gigahertz as its
top clock speed and that's interesting I
guess because it then has a quad HD
screen and an underclocked Snapdragon
820 so I yeah I don't know what kind of
games a lenovo motorola lenovo rolleyes
i'm looking at you know looking at the
specs if we're if we're looking at the
vector thin which has the underclocked
higher-end processor it also has the
smaller battery and I've never
understood why companies like to
piecemeal out specs like this you know I
think it was one of the major advantages
that Samsung had with the note was that
it was big enough they could just put
everything that was good into the note
you know wasn't like the galaxy has a 12
megapixel camera the galaxy s has a 12
megapixel camera and the note has an
8-megapixel camera but the note has a
faster processor the galaxy has a bigger
battery you know like I don't understand
games like that and i think motorola was
less afraid of that before lenova came
in and decided this is more fashionable
he should be using metal and also you
should have very thin phones because
premiun phones are great in big and this
is America hello good well and and I
will say you know they're there is a if
we're talking about thinness there is an
almost 2 millimeter difference in
thickness between these two motorola
devices
and the the bigger the vertex is a seven
millimeter thin device that's already
crazy thin the vector thin is going to
be a five point two millimeter thick
device and at that point I really have
to question because I've been playing
around with this Huawei p9 the p9 is a
seven millimeter thick phone with a 3000
milliamp hour battery that that's a fine
compromise for me it's one of the
thinnest phones you can get and it still
has a standard size battery right do we
really benefit Adam from having a five
millimeter thin phone if it comes at the
reduction in battery size it depends on
who you ask if you ask pretty much
anybody who works at or reads pocket now
the answer is no more thickness more
battery is perfect but I mean I can't
imagine that we're representative of the
general populace because they keep
making these stupid thin phones with
stupid tiny batteries and it's just it's
so it's irritating because they have to
have data that backs this up they
wouldn't do it if they didn't have data
that backs it up there on those numbers
for that I'm sure so and their sales
numbers and survey numbers and focus
groups and people just I don't know what
they're thinking I think that these
survey numbers and focus groups are
based on having an hour with the phone
not actually having to use it for an
entire day because the second you have
to take out your phone and plug it into
a tether you know just well and I'm sure
when we were in those types of
situations if a focus group member
participant gets a phone for an hour and
then they ask a question like on what's
the battery life they're gonna get those
really marketing speak answers all day
battery life that as long as you never
touch it as long as you're on Wi-Fi for
the entire day I could use my phone all
day that's pretty great so yeah I'll go
with the thinner phone the thinner
phones better right but then in real
world situations I mean how many people
in our circles of friends and family are
constantly complaining about all my
phones dead by dinnertime or oh I just
ran the latest update now my phone
battery dies faster no not really fully
understanding all the implications for
what this this number means when we talk
about battery capacity this
this three thousand maws what's up with
the mom well and the end the
manufacturers answer to that is quick
charge you know you plug it in for 15
minutes in you get ahead and you get you
know for extra hours of life which is
fine as long as you're in a place where
you can plug in your phone for 15
minutes with a quick charger and you
know it's just it's not a good answer is
never good answer good answer and other
manufacturers are saying hey add on some
bulk to your phone with our Juice Pack
and you can throw away all the stuff
that you got I really surprised to see
Apple deliver their own battery case cuz
that their their marketing has always
been about the efficiency of the iphone
and how that's the best compromise
between size and and runtime right but I
don't want us to get stuck on this
because there's a lot more to this story
oh no that's not just a transition oh
yeah that was gonna be my segue well and
actually it's interesting because one
this is a modular phone or it's supposed
to be a modular phone and one of the
modules that you can get with this is a
battery pack so maybe that's what
they're thinking I don't know let's talk
about that more so if we go back to
those renders you see a little 16-pin
kind of thing that's not talking about
Apple smart connector type of thing
going on but it's a little tramp stamp
of a storage that can and then warm
here's the crap out of me just so you
know we're here first folks the motorola
tramp stamp but so what we've got is a
series of pogo pins and actually we have
a comment here from kyle he's really
excited about those pogo pins this is a
great way to do modules you can slap on
cases boom different functionality it
depends on the data throughput that's
actually a good point we don't know how
how quickly you can transfer information
through pogo pins but this this seems to
be maybe a better way to do a modular
device than LG solution yeah they're
called amps and we should be seeing more
of this stuff uh it's part of project
tango and Lenovo is about
head on over to I think they're going to
throw a vent jun 9th that will show off
this tango project tango fruits word
suspecting that the Moto X for this year
is also the project handle phone and
with that I don't know stereo speakers
camera grip pico projector we've heard
of a lot of the stuff before in terms of
mmm mommy weeks I need you see these
accessories in different incarnations I
think what's interesting is the fact
that this will become a a quick slap
magnetic solution to deliver additional
features for your phone and and so wait
like Adam one of the big questions that
we had with the LG g5 was what does a
modular device bring to the table that
we couldn't do with USB connectivity now
this seems to be a more streamlined
implementation of a modular phone but I
still have to ask the same question is
does motorola really have a solution
here that we can't achieve through USB
type-c right well i mean first i should
point out that i've changed my stance on
modular phones a little bit when the LG
g5 first came out I call it a fail
because you had to restart the phone in
order to add the modules to it so when
you pulled out the you know when you
when you go to put in a deck you have to
pull out the battery which necessarily
turns off the phone you have to put it
back in you have to reboot the phone now
I've softened my stance on that because
a modular phone is not designed to
necessarily change out parts all the
time I think it's designed to be a be a
way to customize your own phone and it's
going to be the type of thing that
someone's going to be like oh I really
like the camera on the LG g5 or the Moto
vector or whatever but I really wish I
had a camera grip you know i really wish
i could hold it like a camera and so
that's what those friends are for you
know you're going to go get that camera
grip you're going to pop it on there
you're not going to mind the extra bulk
because didn't give you extra battery
and you it's going to give you that
camera grip that you want and then that
is your phone and what this enables LG
to do is to go mass produce a whole
bunch of templates basically and let
people build their own phone after that
so which is cool
but at the same time you know something
like a battery pack stereo speakers I
get that you're gonna slap that on
you're gonna leave it on there that's
going to be your phone that's going to
be your customized fault but something
like a pico projector I'm not seeing
that so that's just a little a little
bit on the weird side not to mention if
this is some type of magnetic connection
or a case connection Allah the Lumia
1020 camera grip I don't see that as
being as attractive as the true modular
design which LG is bringing to the table
so I guess that'll be something to see
and also a lot of people argue that when
you have a modular design like LG's
where you're actually taking out the the
pack and you're sliding it back in your
restarting the phone you're restarting
the phone so that i can use software
designed to work with that booting for
the drivers basic yeah basically uh and
so I don't know if Motorola is going to
work off that same type of philosophy or
if it's just going to have to have all
this stuff built into the OS going in so
that whatever you decide to slap on
there it's going to start to work and
what that will do to the bulk of the OS
as well you know that's true I hadn't
really thought about that is that it is
it going to have to start a bunch of
processes every single time you run the
phone even for things that you might not
necessarily need to use that's actually
a good point right so I mean it'll be
something worth finding out especially
since you know a lot of OEMs have been
cutting back on the bulk of their of
their OS ever since the was at the
Samsung gs5 used up half the avail
available storage space it was it was
pretty ridiculous that it was one of the
something like just under nine gigabytes
of storage on a 16 gig phone right and
so you know a lot of only have been
cutting back on that and so it'll be
interesting to see if Motorola's gone
moto is its moto now right or is it
motor it's not motorola it's moto it
looks will easily interesting to see if
they go that direction or not well and
and I guess really one of the the last
major questions I would have about the
idea of a modular phone is it is this
the type of solution that will actually
encourage third-party manufacturers to
develop their own add-ons their own amps
or their own friend
their own modular pieces or are we all
just sort of waiting until apple or
Samsung does something akin to this
before people start jumping on the
bandwagon well this is either that's
going to have to happen or LG / moto are
going to have to prove the concept first
so they're gonna have to put their money
where their mouth is first make sure and
show sales numbers of people buying
these modular parts and then third-party
manufacturers gonna be like oh well
maybe there's some money to be made here
so it's definitely LG and Motorola and
anybody else who's going to build a
modular phone has to lead that charge
once they do that then other folks will
come on board and in the meantime
project ara remains silent well and
that's actually another comment that we
got in the QA from Christopher miles who
asks do you think project ara will ever
come out in any capacity will there be a
demand by then or has the hype run out I
don't know about you but I was looking
forward to buying the phone out of a
food truck Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico I
mean I'll go to Puerto Rico for any
reason I think pocketnow should fly me
to Puerto Rico just so i can buy a phone
out of a book butcher I love it no
seriously I mean like we've talked about
this in previous episodes of the podcast
where we have difficulties even getting
consumers to update apps or use micro SD
cards you know as opposed to what just
came built into their phones do we think
that there's a there's a market or
there's a way that we can educate
consumers to check out what the benefits
of a modular phone might be um and does
project ara scratch that itch or does it
actually intimidate consumers more by
being way more modular than the
solutions that we see from LG or from
from Motorola there's a there's a book
in a corresponding TED talk called the
the paradox of choice yeah that's
exactly what I'm getting at um please
continue and where and basically what
the what the what the argument behind it
is is the more choice you give consumers
the worse they feel about the choices
that they end up actually making because
there's always going to be something
else that they could have done whereas
if you if you give consumers
rumours something in a package this is
kind of the theory that Steve Jobs
ascribed subscribe to was i'm going to
give you this phone that you want and
and and so people are going to go out
and they're going to get the iphone and
they're going to be happy with that
because that was the only choice that
they could make was I was going to buy
an iphone you didn't have to worry about
am I gonna get an iphone SE or an iphone
6 or an iphone 6 i'm sorry sickness or
6s you want to get and the more walker
you want to get right and so it's one of
those things where the more choices you
give people the more that they're going
to agonize over the choices that they
eventually make because there was always
something else that they could have done
so um it says now now when we add
different screen resolutions different
camera modules different batteries
different layouts different any other
accessories that you could maybe punch
into the back of a phone doesn't that
just really complicate or and then a
whiff if you do if say you have project
ara and then you have a bunch of
companies that are manufacturing like
third-party processors for it you know
so does a consumer have to pick between
a Qualcomm 820 in 823 is 650 650 to is
625 maybe they get a Karen maybe they
get an x and o's maybe they get i'm
forgetting every other type yulia ho you
are early making me cry for me I look at
that and I go ah I don't know I don't
you don't find might be okay yeah yeah
the money go with an 808 I don't know I
don't know I want to get the 810 but I
don't need to set fire to my phone it's
like well if I lived in a colder climate
I would totally rock the a-10 is the
perfect hand warmer oh yeah but I I said
a long time ago i'm really the second
moto 360 so i can use them as hand
warmers in the winter yeah i'm still
waiting for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 799
there you go save that penny but yeah
it's just it's one of those i mean i
think for consumers like us who are
going to be educated about damn near
every part of the phone I think we're
going to be able to make intelligent
choices as to what
accessories we should put on door phone
that accessories but what components we
should put on to our phones because
we're going to be we're going to know
enough to say well I really want this
great camera but I can compromise on
this you know particular screen or
screen resolution and I know I want you
know this processor which is gonna be
just good enough but you know if I were
to have my wife choose that it would be
awful the result would be awful even for
even for us techies out there you know I
I recently was shopping a new laptop and
I wanted a touchscreen I wanted a
dedicated GPU and I want a decent
battery life and the process I went
through to finally select what i
selected was agonizing I didn't enjoy it
I really didn't have fun shopping
something that was going to be a major
part of my workflow something that I
wanted to be able to occasionally play
some games on edit video I mean these
are really big parts of my work and play
day and the process of shopping a laptop
was not fun so i can already assume you
know like i think one of the things that
may be modular phones are missing out on
is the commentary for consumers that if
something goes wrong you can replace a
piece as opposed to you can design the
perfect custom phone for you i think if
we start the conversation talking to
consumers about picking pieces they're
not going to go with us on this journey
but everyone knows at least a person or
has had this happen to themselves where
they've shattered a smartphone screen so
now what if you could just replace that
screen now and it could even be an
upgrade like maybe you started out with
like a 720p screen because you know
that's just where you started and no now
you can go to a quad HD screen when you
break this one and you have to worry
about you know sending it to some
sketchy Repair place you're trying to
schedule an appointment with a genius or
something like you just do it yourself
um that's what a fair phones been doing
in terms of sorry that was a fail for
fair phones as startup from a Finland I
believe yeah and they had their own a
little modular phone where you just take
apart the pieces in order new one if you
needed it too so there you go safe
environments that's their message love
it love it love it so I we definitely
want to hear from you on this one folks
we've gotten some fun comments
the QA but who really has the better
take on modular devices drops comment
below because of cures to see what your
thoughts are excuse me moving over to
another way that this conversation was
about to delve into how capitalism is
the economy of regrets of purchases if
you want to get deeply philosophical
different buzzer differ by gas but you
can leave the comment you probably just
won't get a reply no moving right along
to to another situation facing our
capitalist society Apple music Apple
music might be deleting um music from
your downloaded collection and there's a
blogger who's been very publicly sort of
detailing his trials and tribulations in
trying to figure out what went wrong
between his Apple music account and his
itunes account in howell his music seems
to of a seems to have evaporated and
it's been happening to multiple users
too so it's just more commentary in the
apple support forums yeah and so I've
good good some one person good person I
more as a serenity called well she's
great actually um she went in and dug
into it and found out that may have to
do with a bug in itunes and
unfortunately on desktops that is a that
contains apple music within it as well
as everything else I attunes and local
music control as well and I say here in
this piece that well that's a big
problem if we're going to see small bugs
tilt the dominoes in a big way it was
well and I'm sure a number of us you
know into gadgets and technologies and
services and stuff like that yeah itunes
is sort of a love-hate relationship for
a lot of people out there even general
consumers people who aren't necessarily
super into text that's its hate hate but
anyway well I mean like there's there's
the sort of the love aspect of I think
it's an easy way to manage a mobile
device for people who don't want to have
to just like drag and drop and organize
fold
on their own so there is I still think
there is some love benefit to itunes but
over the years it's become such a a
major large bloated software experience
that now it seems like it's out of
apple's control like there there are
unintended consequences to linking up
Apple music and iTunes if you're not
fully prepared for what those two
services how those two services relate
to each other that can actually do a
little damage to someone's stored
content it's been my experience that
itunes has pretty much been the
universally hated piece of software like
the the worst project that Apple has
ever made at least that's been my
experience and the you know the
experience of my circle but so I'm not
sure I agree with the with the first
part of your premise but that being said
effectively I respectfully I appreciate
it right right um so but that being said
um this is a real the hell of a bug
that's enough isn't this is just this
isn't a whoopsie this is uh this is a
pretty catastrophic especially for you
know this one block blogger who you know
he wrote a lot of his own music and you
know necessarily save that on his
computer and you know itunes kind of
came through just blew all that on the
water I mean that's product that you
created which is probably going to be
slightly irretrievable um there are more
the remedies didn't help i mean you back
it up into iCloud or out of music finds
a way to those are all versions at ya
and drm that's that's fun you match up a
song from i'm not i can't even pull up a
an example but you have this version of
a song and it replaces it with another
version and it's crappier like you know
Ryan and Adam you bring up a great point
because this is something that I've
really struggled with as we've moved
into a more mobile technology landscape
for how brilliant OS X is OS 10 on max
is for content creation we haven't seen
we've seen Apple try and push hardware
into iPad pros we're getting rumors
about an iphone pro at some point but
iOS really doesn't seem
to be the friendliest environment for
content creation though they're trying
to try and open it up a little bit more
and now they're online services also
seem to be not the friendliest solutions
for people who make their own stuff so I
mean imagine if you were doing your own
pot a cast or if you were a voiceover
professional you had a ton of recordings
if you were writing your own music or
shooting your own video and those files
got in the way of a conflict between
Apple music and iTunes what does that
speak to this is the future of apple
products being professional platforms I
think it's just where I think we're
still trying to figure that out I think
there's just man it's just the the whole
digital content revolution the the
content creation revela that the time
was you know back back when I when I was
doing this you know and back in nineteen
ninety no no one was alive yeah I know
what you know the time was that you
needed to have you know all this you
know super professional gear in order to
even you know scratch you know be able
to scratch at the door of you know one
of these media moguls the record
companies the TV you know the movie
studios and whatnot you know you had to
have this you know alt uber professional
rig in a special dedicated room in your
house but now people are making their
own content on iPhones and on macbooks
and on you know even surface tablets you
know they're they're developing all
their own stuff with this
professional-grade software which is now
so much more accessible to everybody
it's led to things like you know YouTube
and you know YouTube artists and you
know the the amazing race on cloud is
entirely youtubers I mean it's
incredible yeah and it's just like but
anyway oh what what I'm going is I think
that like a lot of things technological
especially recently the creators have
gone a lot faster than the managers then
you know the the the people there that
are making the content or way outpacing
you know the the company's a
traditionally performs yeah yeah who
have traditionally in the gateways and I
think they're becoming obsolete and I
think they hate it um you know what they
hate me screaming they hate stream well
I mean weird al is not making any more
albums yes Weird Al Yankovic is not
making albums because he's realized
YouTube is where the money is going to
be well and actually that that's a great
segue into the sort of the secondary
point to this it was funny because these
two stories landed within hours of each
other on pocketnow.com so Apple music is
deleting your clothes no one's
downloading music anymore anyway we saw
right there plenty of people i mean
we're talking about 3.6 billion dollars
worth of revenues and demo from the
itunes store back in 2012 however that's
expected to go down to 600 million and
what 2019 that's three years from now
yes yeah that's really nice it's been a
sinking ship and people of at Apple
according to digital music news have
been well fretting about this how should
we handle this how should we handle the
record labels how should we deal with
international markets that don't have
the infrastructure for proper streaming
and all that there's a whole bunch of uh
weights to this scale and it's been like
in reading some of the interviews and
some of the comments delivered from from
people around the industry just how many
people have said things like well Steve
Jobs were still around he would have
already cut iTunes and just be using
Apple music from here on he would have
just taken an ax to it so and you know
what that might have worked under jobs
and jobs it definitely is not a Tim Cook
move though I find it really curious you
know we still haven't very well sorted
the issues facing like paying artists
and we have a system set up like Spotify
and streaming services and I that hasn't
always been but but well there have
always been issues with record labels
but you know the the monetary structure
for artists was a lot different before
streaming solutions came into play
even the transition to downloads wasn't
quite as devastating to an artist's
bottom line as a as downloads were but
you know kind of going back to your
point Adam you know when this economy
changes when these tools are being
utilized when consumers say I want to
use Spotify I don't want to download
individual files anymore how best should
these manufacturers try and keep pace
because they've fallen behind apple's
solution is now starting to generate
revenue and it's starting to resonate
with consumers and content doesn't move
the way it used to yeah it was it's just
one of those they're not gonna like the
answer to it which is to say I mean all
right let's just take dvds for now i can
buy on amazon i can buy a DVD package
which comes with a blu-ray a DVD and a
digital download of the same movie for
roughly the same price as i can buy just
the streamed movie so there's there's a
problem there and i think what if what
it boils down to is I think the
monetization of content has to come from
the content itself not necessarily the
media on which you're delivering it so
um so companies like Spotify and and
Apple music are going to have to buy the
rights to stream this particular content
from this artist or whatever and how
they're going to make money from that
how the artists are going to make money
from that I don't know so I don't work
at a at a record studio that's not
really my problem but what I when I'm
looking for in this comes from pretty
much any type of broadcast content
whether it's music whether it's TV
whether it's sports is if I own the
rights to watch captain america civil
war i want to be able to watch that
whether i'm on my phone on my computer
on my TV on my friends TV i want i want
to basically buy the rights to watch the
movie regardless of where i am or what
i'm doing and that goes for broadcast TV
that goes for debt flicks that goes for
you know sporting events don't even get
me started
blackouts when it comes to sports
because man i will take along a joggers
territory and it's supremely frustrating
that there are only a select cable
packages that we can watch it's not even
like we can watch Dodgers games right
anymore so anyway the point is is that
what what what distributors need to
figure out is how we're going to build a
model around which somebody washing
their hands so how people are going to
build a model around which artists are
going to get compensated for their
content and how they're going to be able
to distribute that content on whatever
platform that people have happened to be
and I think there's right now there's
just so many options for buying content
whether you're on a radio whether you're
on a phone whether you're on right
applet i just i think that the enormity
of the task is just so daunting that
they there that a lot of distributors
are so going back into their dark halls
and saying no no this is my territory
there's definitely a situation of these
of these these outlets you know anyone
in charge of distribution sort of
burying their head in the sand and we
still haven't learned the lessons from
other industries so like music has been
in a state of flux since Napster came
out feature films have been trying to
figure out how to not replicate those
mistakes by replicating those mistakes
and then the book industry so even
circling back to your point about the
content it's the content it's not the
delivery mechanism we still have people
that feel like well a book is actually
printed paper so that should cost more
than an e-book right really the costs
associated with both of those devices
are not really any different I mean what
goes into producing a book the costs
that go into producing the book are
about the same for an e-book as they are
for mashed wood pulp right oh you know
it doesn't it shouldn't matter if you
get a blu-ray a DVD and Digital Download
that's really just like you can watch
the movie anywhere you want to watch it
you're paying for the movie you don't
care where it is you can view it so if
you if it's the same price as the
digital download as long as you can
watch the digital download on any screen
you want right hey for the movie it
should it should kind of still be the
same right and then we get into dirtier
areas
proprietary streaming where you know
yeah you can watch this digital movie
but you have to watch it on our platform
um you know where you don't have fully
that's that's kind of going away it's
now just you know play platform or the
iTunes movie platform yeah and that's
not so much but I mean there's just and
the problem is that everybody wants
their platform to be the ubiquitous one
so you know there's an X Katie XKCD
comic where they're talking about more
Terence there are 14 different standards
we need to build a standard and then
like a day later there are now 15
different standards that comic at least
once a week I love it I mean like in
terms of progress you know what Disney
comes out and comes out and says you
know if you buy a movie through the
Disney portal you also can download it
through itunes you can download it
through google play I mean working
progress we're seeing oh yeah that's not
like definitely forward motion is just
not as fast as the content creators are
moving forward so um in speaking of
movies and content consumption and
different devices coming up we're
getting some news from google what they
might have up their sleeves for virtual
reality when it looks like we're gonna
have we're gonna be stepping away from
google cardboard or in that stepping
away I mean Google cardboards always
going to exist right but we're we're
gonna be looking at a standalone google
android vr player and it looks like we
might actually get some hardware
associated with that yeah yeah and it's
it's interesting because it's kind of
like one of those what kept you typing
okay because you know Samsung has been
kind of leading the charge in this type
of VR yeah I don't want to say that
because that's not what I mean I think
they were one of the the first like
major nice consumer experiences was gear
VR yeah I think they were the ones that
were trying to make it accessible
earliest i mean aside from google google
cardboard which is an interesting but
not all that great experience to be ours
but i like it if it's really cool
because it's just it's another it's
another notch in the belt of the VR were
world once google gets on board you know
really the only major hold out at that
point is going to be Apple you know
because I mean you know Google is
obviously one big kind of hold out from
that they have google cardboard which is
okay but if they can start you know
really making a solid push into VR I
think that's going to be another
legitimizing and we've seen some some
some little hints and some rumors that
Apple might be cooking up something vr-2
I guess I'm just curious you know Google
Google's in one of those interesting
situations where they don't want to piss
off partners right so you have an extra
phone but they still try and make sure
that manufacturers that work with
Android devices are really the ones that
are showcasing the the highest-end found
well all their partners are moving onto
different Road creating their own
platforms and Google's just dragging on
with its own platform and it shouldn't
have to worry about its partners because
they're already on their own trains well
but that's that's kind of the point that
work because is Google bringing hardware
to the table we're seeing sort of a
renewed interest in VR in general HTC
definitely blown up some some news feeds
but survived the oculus and then we also
have some some outliers like Microsoft
working with augmented reality on on
hollow lens while we also know that
Google is is pushing forward on project
tango which should actually help benefit
things like augmented reality too um do
we think that we're going to see some
confluence or some some joining of
different hardware platforms do we think
this is still going to be walled gardens
of different hardware subsets or do we
think that Google is going to have a
solution that blows us all away and
maybe we won't be talking about the HTC
vive and six months I think one of the
worst things that could happen to VR
would be to have this type of
compartmentalized you can go the vibrato
or the oculus route or the other or the
samsung route or the if we have you know
again if we have 14 and 15 different
standards of anything please see all
over again yeah it's gay well I think
it's gonna be worse though because
you're gonna have all these different
experiences I mean a PC you know back in
the day at the end of the day it was
relatively similar experience but I mean
you know with things like the vibe where
you have to UM you know set up in a
dedicated entire room and by the way I'd
like to send kudos to Jaime for coming
up with the tripod a method of setting
up those boxes that was genius because
at CES we saw you know they were
literally bolted to the walls and I'm
just like oh hell no uh but but you know
tripod well Don Jaime I wouldn't I
wouldn't have thought of that when
little embarrassed by that but anyway
you know you've got that method and
you've got you know the hololens
methodology where it's just augmented
reality rather than just rather than you
know true virtual reality I just I I
don't want to see this thing fragment
out into so many different things that
nobody cares about any of them well and
again I think we we run into some of
those same issues a a problem of choices
and when do consumers actually spend
their money on because we're having to
weigh these against also future consoles
you know PlayStation is going to be
introducing a sort of updated
Playstations and xbox and microsoft xbox
is so that we can have 4k gaming and
better virtual reality capabilities for
consoles and all these things start to
weigh heavily on the decision-making
parts of consumers brains in a way that
I don't think is going to be necessarily
beneficial to the market but um aside
from VR we're also going to be covering
google i/o 2016 soon and I was curious I
but that's that's part of it that's a
the VR is part of it and so again yeah I
mean to be honest I'm actually a lot
more excited about google i/o in general
than I am about Google vdr well I was
going to throw it to you so that we
could hear what specifically you most
excited about well I just a google i/o
actually over the last few years has
introduced some really cool things into
the into Android um you know whether you
know Google now on tap was one and you
know this year we're hopefully going to
get split screen support you know
so it's just it's one of those things
that I'm actually looking more forward
to what is going to come to Android
rather than necessarily what's going to
come to VR because at this point I'm not
completely sold on VR I I get why people
like it but I'm actually just a lot more
interested in my day-to-day phone
experience rather than you know
something that i might do on the
weekends if I can manage to get the kids
out of the house so I'm actually looking
a lot a lot more forward to to Android
updates than I am to to VR and they've
got these google play awards which are
coming up which well i guess i'm curious
to see how those are delivered we're
talking about the best apps in in a
certain category and developer awards
and things like that it's hard to rank
that content on the best of days and
who's gonna do who's gonna do the red
carpet show that's really all I one
asking developers what they're wearing
who are you wearing um um nike sketches
of you does it's a trick um but no i
mean so like definitely when we're
looking at android stuff i think a lot
of us are looking forward to native
split screaming of apps especially if
you've got android tablets lying around
hopefully they get updated to Android n
it's definitely been one area especially
after using the iPad pro it's nice it's
nice being able to put two things on one
screen at the same time not to mention
if you have that big of a screen like oh
I don't know 18.4 inches and you should
be able to really utilize to utilize
that now is interesting and that not to
circle all the way back to VR again
though um but a lot of gaming news that
we might be seeing in terms of
developers ap is the the Vulcan API is
that are supported on future build of
android and then also a game streaming
was it is looks like it's going to be a
popular topic and youtube is going to be
presenting at Google i/o for some of
their streaming solutions to so this is
all kind of coming back around consumers
seem to want to be able to share
information share experiences we've got
you know LT
enabled cameras will have Android with
better support for youtube streaming and
then on top of that we've got better
support for gaming or trying to get
developers on for better gaming
solutions on Android devices do we think
that this might all kind of come around
like does this mean the death of
consoles when a family can invest in an
Android tablet use that with a VR
solution put that up to a TV for gaming
and stream and share with wireless
accessories well two syllables yeah and
that didn't really work out for them and
it was a Kickstarter kind of you know
that this is I oh we're talking about
what do you think Adam I I think android
tables are gonna have to get a lot more
powerful before we can do that but I
just I'm sorry I'm still a little bit
bitter about my Nexus 9 which has run
like absolute crap since Android M but
that's true I am I gave up on little
mini tablets after the 2012 Nexus 7 well
yeah you know I that was a that was a
solid tablet and there's there's one of
those lost in my house somewhere which
is a really stupid problem to have but
anyway I i I'm not much of a gamer so
it's kind of hard for me to comment on
this intelligently and but I've never
let that stop me before so I you know I
just you know it goes back you know
circling even further back to the whole
content versus delivery method uh you
know of the streaming talk are people
still going to be buying games on discs
or are we just going to be downloading
them from the cloud or are we going to
be streaming them from the cloud are we
going to want necessarily going to want
to buy game a you know and just play
that or are we going to want to have a
choice of you know a thousand different
games that we can play for thirty bucks
a month I I don't know I definitely
think that that's if from what I
understand that's that's a way that the
industry is trending towards the you
know the streaming model because you
know people want you know the netflix of
games basically they don't want to
necessarily they don't want to buy
season one of CSI they want to be able
to stream all the seasons of CSI
so it makes sense of that that's a
direction that they would be going so it
makes sense that Android wouldn't want
to get on board that train preferably
early um so let's see what they have to
say yeah i will definitely be covering
google i/o 2016 on pocket now calm so be
on the lookout for our coverage there I
think I i think the gaming conversation
is going to be a very important one to
watch we stopped a lot of questions on
things like you know so say you've got a
killer Steam library what happens if you
die can you pass that on to somebody
does that memory or what happens if you
know heaven for bids were to close its
doors one day you know what happens to
all of that content that you had linked
up with your steam account we have some
questions that need answering when it
comes to how we handle content on our
mobile devices as well maybe Apple will
just delete it all for you so you don't
even ever worry about it it's featured
yeah it'll be great just I have a
standalone version of spelunky I'm fine
I love it so um we have I just want to
blitz through some of the q and A's
because we have to talk about a phone
contest which is I'm sure what people
are still hanging around Shah for
talking about modular phones eric l in
the QA brings up an interesting point
the more you can customize the worse the
resale value I think of a custom Moto X
people leave their phone cases on for a
higher resale value do you think that
that might affect uh you know phone
sales or is the idea of a modular phone
being that you probably wouldn't ever
sell it because you can just wipe out
parts I think the you have a good point
um except for if you're going to be
selling your phone you're going to be
selling the base unit you're not going
to be selling necessarily the modular
pieces to it or at least that's where
most of the interest is going to be I
think so if you get a moto shoot those
are the Moto vertex with uh with you
know three of God I can talk really I
can I promise you oh if you get if you
get a moat over a vertex with the you
know the stereo speakers you're probably
going to be selling the vertex more than
the speakers and let me know how the
speakers will be interested you would
hope that those speakers work with the
future device we have a couple comments
in here in questions
relating to motorola just Christopher
miles will motorola ever be able to
regain the goodwill it had under google
map poke Matt poke a fan do you think
motorola will start competing near the
top OEMs there was another one in here
about someone asking about something
similar for motorola um what because
we've talked it we talked about that a
little earlier isn't Motorola's issue
now sort of just advertising that they
still exist in sell products droids are
still crazy popular on verizon um we
didn't personally presence at brand as
far as i know well and it just isn't it
really just a situation where we need to
see consumers exposed to more motorola
products across the landscape not just
the carrier partner deals yeah
absolutely and you know i wanted a droid
turbo to the indestructible phone that
they came out with i wanted one of those
but it's on verizon it was that the
turbo too i think it wasn't sure about
to anyway I wanted one of those but it
was you know motorola still has a
tendency to get locked into character
carrier exclusivity from time to time
which is unfortunate because i'm an
eighteen t customer so i would like to
have that phone but at last I couldn't
because I dropped my phone all the time
and I have two small children that drop
my phone all the time so I would love to
have an indestructible phone but uh I
don't know it's just what yeah is this
allowed just like our conversations
about motorola ten do this is one of the
moto x force what's that dude go get a
moto x force get that gsm capabilities
yes I me we didn't even know that
existed Jules that's all we need to
spend more on it was so lastly we've got
a comment from Panzers II do you think
that once all of these disparate VR and
AR technologies are combined will get
the final form of google glasses like
Frieza this is their final form of go go
textual and augmented reality do we do
we think that people are going to come
back to face computers or face heads-up
displays at some point I was really sad
that google glass fizzled the way that
it did it did fizzle i should say pretty
fantastically and actually there's a
couple of different
there's a couple of different I saw a
couple of accessories at CES that were
google glass-like but we're a little bit
more focused one of them was focused
towards cycling where you could wear
Google glass while you're cycling and
the other one was you know something
that would be built into normal glasses
I think we're we're definitely going to
get heads-up displays but we need a way
to make them less pardon my french
douchey than Google glass so because
Google glass was basically than the next
you know wearing the bluetooth headset
all the time you know because I still
actually see people doing that I can't
believe it um but Google glass was kind
of like the next iteration of that so if
we can get past that and we can do
something smart like build it into
normal eyeglasses I think there will
definitely be a I think there's
definitely gonna be a market for them
that's not going to work you need smart
contact lenses well I think that would
be further step but I would totally rock
a regular pair of glasses maybe just
like thicker frames around the back or
something like that yeah just to have my
glasses display like I would want to
move everything that I do on my smart
watch too I level oh yeah that would
that would do me just fine right now I'm
not even having like fancy like
Terminator vision or anything like that
it's just like having you know like
notification alerts well now you done it
now I want Terminator vision well I mean
eventually i do want terminator well
sure i'm not saying i don't want
terminator region i'm just saying this
the next step oh happy with just basic
SmartWatch vision right SmartWatch
vision I like it so many yeah
trademarked one bagnall 2017 now you opt
pay me money's money is grabby hands for
the moneys for smartwatch uh for
smartwatch vision which no one will ever
use that phrase so uh speaking of smart
watches we don't have anything to do
with more life as I have no segue for
that worthy effort we here at pocket now
we want to thank all of the people that
have been
and subscribed to our various channels
to our blog to our YouTube our YouTube
channel have been supporting this
podcast clicking on add links and and
supporting our sponsors and so uh
episode 200 is a pretty big deal that's
200 episodes of this podcast I am
eternally grateful to have been brought
on to this team at such an exciting time
and we we definitely wanted to celebrate
this milestone we've got two really big
milestones coming up actually we've got
this episode which is 200 which is a
nice round number and then episode 208
will represent four years of
broadcasting of broadcasting this
podcast so two really important
milestones this week we are celebrating
episode 200 with a giveaway and we are
going to be giving away oh and this is
an international giveaway um we have two
phones to give away first up is the next
bit Robin courtesy of the folks at next
bit um they are hooking us up with a
Robin to give away to lucky winner and
the the other phone is going to be a
viewer pic from clove co uk you will be
able to choose between a galaxy s7 an
HTC 10 or an LG g5 and so we're going to
be giving away these two devices we've
got this contest running over the next
week we will announce winners on episode
20 one of the pocket now weekly podcast
next week and if you want to enter into
this contest head on over to the blog
post for this episode on pocketnow.com
it's the pocket net weekly podcast on
pocketnow.com and there's a little
widget at the bottom of that of that of
that blog post and there are a number of
ways that you can get entered to win a
smartphone of your choice again
international contest because we have
international viewership we've got
worldwide readers and listeners and
subscribers and we want to thank all of
you for participating with this show so
head on over to pocketnow.com hit that
widget participate in the contest and
hopefully win yourself a really stinking
cool smartphone so out of curiosity of
those three which one would you pick
that's tough
um I mean Jules got the HTC 10 so that's
probably a safe bet that that's what he
would tengo in his way I probably uh you
know I i I'm really torn because there's
something just so stinking cool about
the idea of the Robin okay especially
after having watched Michaels review on
it like I really want to play with that
and see how it works but being the
camera and audio snob that I am I would
probably side with the HTC 10 all right
nice i'm actually can kind of leaning
for the first time in years i'm actually
leaning towards the HTC 10 myself so
it's just something really interesting
and also i think there's just something
really exciting about this being sort of
a back-to-basics year for HTC you know
like bailing on all of the things that
we know they can do well having a
competitive processors to the phone runs
fluidly without being a space heater and
finally delivering on a respectable
camera which is something that they've
been hurting for the last couple years
just something really fun about bringing
all those those points together for a
device that also is a little unique you
know it's not like the same the same
thing that everyone else is going to be
rocking so on that note I think we
should wrap this show up what do you
guys think I think so too realized i was
playing the theme over my life channel
oh well you're just that you were just
ahead of the curve q us on out Jules
let's wrap this all right whatever like
jewels and it gets all surly so folks
