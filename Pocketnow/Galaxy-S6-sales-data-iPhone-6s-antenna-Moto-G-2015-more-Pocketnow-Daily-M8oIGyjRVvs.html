so far but not record breakers a new pen
could do away with the horrible iphone 6
antenna lines and we get leaked details
on the future Moto G I'm hi melody vetta
wishing you all a happy Monday even if
just for the sake of sarcasm this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with Windows 10 we thought
that all windows 10 insiders would get a
free copy and activation as was stated
in the blog post originally but ever
since then it seems the things have
changed that quote of activation is no
longer available on the blog apparently
you'll only get a free copy we're not
sure if it'll get activated and things
have just gotten so confused that gay
Bowl has been commenting on Twitter over
what things to expect it cetera et
cetera link to the description probably
good the cipher better than we can now
since there is a platform war when it
comes to which company takes over your
set-top box we saw Apple drop the price
tag significantly of the apple TV 2 69
bucks and if you thought that Google was
going to stay behind with the Nexus
player well it was dropped to eighty
dollars and now he'd get it at amazon
for 68 bucks and given the fact that it
is such a good deal we highly recommend
you click the links in the description
and probably get one of your own and
we've been covering the Moto X 2015
leaks for a while now we've seen the new
dimple design the probability of a
fingerprint scanner etc etc we hadn't
seen anything about the Moto G until
today we get some links today some
images that show us a very similar
design and apparently the specifications
will be very similar to the current
generation Moto G 720p 5-inch display
Snapdragon 410 in addition to a couple
of things here and there the device
looks again a lot like the future Moto X
which is not necessarily bad we just
wonder if there's going to be a change
in price tag given the fact that the
technology is a very similar now it is a
general consensus that even though the
iphone 6 does look good it could be
great if it didn't have those horrible
antenna lines and there is this new
patent right now being filed by Apple
that allows the company to use a new
composite material
that apparently will help it do away
with the antenna lines and bring us an
all-metal iphone 6 design now we're not
really sure this is going to be part of
the iphone 6s designed given how close
we are to its launch but hey we saw the
first generation iphone and the patents
came until later so it could be that
apple will surprises with this new
design stay tuned for that and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
if you thought that Samsung's Galaxy s6
was an iphone 6 killer think again apple
sold 74 million iphone 6 units in just
one quarter and it seems it so far
samsung has sold 45 million and yeah 45
million is a lot of phones but given Sam
Zhang's track record it is far better
than what it's sold for the galaxy s5
yes but it is only similar to what it's
sold of the galaxy s4 that's actually
the same record or almost close to it
which means that yes the galaxy s6 is a
success for samsung so far but not one
that will help it break any records so
it does lead me to the question of the
day do you think that the galaxy s6 is a
success have you feel enticed to buy one
in my case I like the design of the
phone I just hate the fact that it's not
expandable and I hate the battery life
but hey leave us a comment down below
what do you think couldn't prove with
this device Brens you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is filmed the tree follow was
I'm talking out out comment subscribe to
our YouTube channel as well you'd follow
me on Twitter hi manders water iveta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am high never
be better thank you very much for
watching we'll see it small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
