such a bad thing going forward leaked
announcements tell us our trip to
Germany won't be in vain and will we
ever see another windows phone from HTC
all that and much more in the hour ahead
on episode 05 seven of the pocket not
weekly the once-a-week podcasts from
pocket now where we discuss smartphones
tablets and the state of mobile
technology in 2013 I'm your host Michael
Fisher editorial director at pocket now
and today I'm joined by freshly
vacationed managing editor and Tandy
nausea in oradea romania good morning to
you sir good morning good afternoon good
evening everybody and by the baritone
the bold the brassy Joe Levi from Utah
here in the States good morning to you
android guy I am so much a base not a
baritone but I'll forgive you this one
time you know what I will take that
correction I've always made I've like
wittingly made that mistake over and
over because I like the way the word
baritone sounds better than base it does
sounds better and it's not often
misspelled with a fish I was just gonna
say it's not a hominid I'm tomogram
hologram anyway we've got a lot of news
to jump into and a finite time schedule
not sure if we'll get to listener mail I
guess it depends on my my co-hosts and
how quickly the show goes but Before we
jump into the rundown Tony kicked off
the pre-show IM thread with them with
the phrase hold this cat which is not
quite as quite as stirring as what is it
high tech catamaran or is no humongous
tinfoil be okay right right right but in
surely there are many other variations
to come of course we're referring to the
Robert Downey jr. HTC commercials the
campaign which I will admit guys I don't
know Joe I don't know what your status
is but I haven't watched the whole thing
I'd have just seen the 15 second teaser
I know the commercials are out there and
I hear they're really bizarre is that
true I'm Gary interim bone concert
Wednesday money for that I'm so would I
is that one of yours Tony or general i
think it's it's it was there or in the
comments Wow and Tony then I feel like I
know Anton's feeling on this because he
followed up that initial one with them
what is it hopeless television
commercial isn't that right yeah and I
have an even better one which suits the
one it's horrid telephone camera oh no
it doesn't i like the the one so let's
so there seems to be some kind of
divided opinion and maybe i'm being a
little generous i don't think a lot of
people are really digging is these
commercials i'm wrong on that this is a
new campaign from HTC by the way
listeners if you don't know what we're
talking about this is their new push
that they've apparently spent what a
billion dollars on did I sing like that
I I think Robert Downey jr. guts you and
a half million for for the campaign
which will run through two years it's a
it's a two-year campaign Mike they've
they've got him for two years whether or
not they keep doing this guy not I'm
still holding out hope that they change
to something a little more professional
else can I say it so like you see you
see the where they were going with this
right you've got like Robert Downey jr.
he's got the whole Tony Stark thing
going on he's associated with technology
is one of the most popular performers in
the world right now and he is also
happens to be a good guy these days so
like you know you're like all right
perfect target so you see why HTC would
have would have chosen him but I think
what people are kind of weird about is
or what's not landing with people as the
concept right which is basically the
Robert Downey jr. showing up in random
places and coming up with weird
permutations on the acronym HTC like hot
tea catapult hipster troll carwash and
that's that rocks that's true I gotta
come on that now according to add age
which I'm reading right now or how do
you pronounce I mean it's it's a it's a
play on things right a deja dodge and
anyways this spot prompt promotes the
idea that HTC can be anything you want
it to be and ends with the
forward-looking tag here's to change
which is not you know I get it I you
know that HTC has done conceptual level
stuff like this before we all loved the
the you campaign best ever best ever
agreed but this is not the you campaign
is it no no this is like that you
campaign taken to some strange weird
carnival sideshow and it's gonna get
attention that's for sure no question no
question but is it is it going to be the
right kind of attention to what do you
think about the prospects for this
lasting for this succeeding Anton first
well ask you guys something you are in
the business and you know stuff about
HTC but if you are your own sister or
your mother or somebody who is not that
well educated in technology what does
this commercial tell you does it tell
you something about the mobile phone a
mobile phone company does it invite you
to buy something does it sell you a
product no I mean not from what I've
seen and Joe have you have you seen the
full one yeah I've seen the fall and it
was just a an off to the side rip on the
nice i originally not the full HD one
which I'm sure will have a link to in
the show but yeah it's it's there to
grab attention it's there to make you go
what was that and it's there to help
customers remember or potential
customers remember what they saw and
kind of get that acronym stuck in your
head it's not advertising a phone it's
not even really advertising the company
it's just it's a huge brand recognition
campaign to make people smile and laugh
so and I think if we keep in mind that
this is going to be a long-term push but
presumably then this makes a bit more
sense than we can say okay this is the
absurd part where they actually grab
attention with it and then over the next
few weeks months and years maybe they
build on this and advertise specific
products with it with this thing that's
already gotten our attention that's the
only way this makes sense to me yeah
they're going to loop everything
together and have the same the same
faces similar situations i'd love to see
as we're going forward and actually
starting to see products and and
features more than products features of
sense and whatnot advertised if off in
the back
found we see some of these things that
we saw in the initial really weird out
there what on earth are they talking
about commercial I just run through here
sense and it's across all this stuff and
woohoo and it's great and we love it and
just right at the end of the commercial
pull this cat just ditch everything yet
yeah hey is that the new whole diskette
one I love that it's the HTC cat I love
that the the a th article also says that
reminds us that HTC's actual acronym is
is a high-tech computer corporation wait
let's not forget about that it's just
hilarious i I hope that at some future
add you know from this campaign we we
see the company kind of um bring that
out to bring that to light and and
tongue-in-cheek fi it I would really
like to see our DJ just so you know pull
that out of it's like a high-tech
computer and and everyone everyone look
at him like he's an idiot before I was
gonna say for about an hour or so until
it got deleted the best comment and the
most uploaded comment on the video on
youtube on the original video on HTC's
channel was help this company oh yeah I
remember that yeah I saw that one now so
God I this can go one of two ways this
could go the way that we just described
in an ideal scenario where the campaign
matures and actually does its job or it
could go the way of the the palm girl
and I think only time will tell but I
think it's fair to say at this point
that we're all just either intrigued or
confused and things could be worse am i
right let's hope they will sister most
of us are a little intrigued and a lot
so we're a little bit of both right not
mutually exclusive this way yeah true
well then let's move on from from HTC I
like the I I woke up I've woken up this
entire week to Jaime Rivera on the
pocket now daily because I've this is
not a plug by the way this is actually
true because I realized I wasn't
watching the show at all I hadn't
watched it in weeks and I was like well
that's a bad bad idea why don't you
watch I'm is show again at precedence I
know right so i've been i've been waking
up to the pocket not daily every day
this week and its really helped me avoid
things falling too
cracks on last week's listener mail
episode of the weekly I I Stephen shank
brought up the what is it what's your
move on to phone the edge is that what
the vid yes yes yeah and I was like yeah
I mean who's gonna buy this thing and
Stevens like well I'm gonna buy one I'm
like we're really and he's like yeah I
wrote an editorial about how i
pre-ordered my god I got a bit more
attention I'm sorry no so but the point
is a high my pocket a daily have been
keeping me in the know and one of my
favorite things was this this whole
stretch of this week the episode as I
think Tony tell me if I'm wrong here but
it's confirmed for me that our trip to
Aoife is going to be a really great time
because there's gonna say yeah and I
have a feeling that once again this year
will be done with Aoife by the time
Aoife starts yeah yeah yeah I completely
agree whose windows phone a sec that was
mine oh you have to ask you've got Tony
and you've got Joe the android guy whose
windows phone was that seriously I know
but I didn't expect her to have his like
active I thought he'd pull the sim out
of the thing and leave it alone now it
son Wi-Fi only jerk I so I'm right now
so uh I didn't really frame that Aoife
bit correctly Aoife is coming up next
month early next month it is the annual
trade show in berlin germany where
companies show off their radio telephone
where's if you will and we went last
year was my first trade show ever in my
life and it was wonderful but then I I
did CES and mwc as well and what last
year's trade show circuit taught me your
last season's was that if all of the
important stuff now happens at
independent announcements outside of
food shows it's not the way it used to
be but so I was worried about Aoife this
year I'm like Tony we're gonna have to
beat role on the show floor out in the
fringes doing reports on like you know
pokemon cases and refrigerators that
tweet goodbye Cuba nurse yeah but no I
mean it looks like we're gonna have some
cool stuff here we keep getting specs
leaked on the galaxy note 3 which and
that that's kind of been an ephah thing
like that is that's the the halo product
of Aviva you know for a point at a point
I was afraid that since the yellow
cs3 was the first galaxy s to move away
from mwc maybe maybe Samsung will move
away with the note 3 from Eva but
hopefully I was wrong hopefully so yeah
all signs still point to an ephah
announcement for this thing and we'll
get into the to the specifics of that a
little bit but I just want to outline it
and say that we are also expecting what
else is in the other thing here the Sony
this don't yeah there's a sony event
that that we own ami is it right and
then there's the we may see the HTC one
max we don't have any evidence to that
right not yet yeah but hopefully the HTC
uses that opportunity if that is the
case it will be the logical move it
would be because you'd be putting it up
right up against what Samsung is
dropping but then there's also the thing
that I'm most excited about can you
guess what it is yeah I'll let you guys
talk I'll be back Thank You Jojo called
it the SmartWatch the galaxy gear
smartwatch launched at Samsung Aoife
event confirmed according to Stephen
shanks news story from yesterday it
looks like there's a trademark has been
filed for the name galaxy gear on behalf
of Samsung and it might be on Jennifer
Lee is the ephah event and this is
coming to us from Sam mobile so this is
a smart watch it looks any kind of big
company that's bringing a smart watches
exciting to me are you guys as surprised
as I am that um or excuse me as
unsurprised as I am that Samsung has
beat Apple to the punch on this or or
you know if this is true because I'm
already had a SmartWatch before this
well I mean like a real smart wait which
one are you talking about them I think
I'll look it up but I don't know why I
have this idea that they already had a
SmartWatch before us you're not thinking
of the Sony live viewer no no hmm oh
that's not a SmartWatch oh so you know
we've given the the increased awareness
of wearable tech and smart watches in
particular thanks to pebble and some of
its competitors that are still kind of
trying to get their feet under them I
think this is going to be definitely a
well-attended launch event if it happens
I think this is going to be a very
interesting products
say and I really really hope the rumors
are true because if we see this eve I'm
just gonna be so so thrilled even if
it's bad i'm going to be excited because
I just love smart yeah that's Michael
yeah do you remember the only SmartWatch
I was excited about oh yeah totally that
was at mwc said tony was like it's super
excited for the the M watch the big one
is uh oh I'm watch yes that's right I
can never remember the brand name
because it's the weirdest brand name
I've ever heard yeah yeah I should hire
Robert Downey jr. yeah it's already
weird enough so I'm pretty excited about
it you didn't happen to find the the
other samsung Smart Watch teacher Tony
and I wasn't even looking I'll start
looking don't have to and it's okay we
can we can move on I just I'm just
excited you know I'm encapsulating all
of this broadly to say that I think it's
gonna be really cool in Berlin in a
couple weeks and I'm excited to see all
the stuff with my own eyeballs and to
bring it to y'all yeah plus let's not
forget about the rumored LG G pad LG's
gumba yeah so I was going to put that
into a rundown and then I just failed to
get at all excited about it so I didn't
is that going to be an E is that rumor
to me and Aoife releases well yes yes
and it's rumored to be the comeback of
LG in the tablet world and it looks to
be from the rumors a solid competitor
for the Xperia tablet Z yeah so let's
talk about LG for a second so that that
is an 8-inch tablet that we may or may
not see and the reason I couldn't
necessarily get excited about it was
because you know I was at the g2 event
and the event itself was wonderful and
the product itself is very powerful but
it it didn't stir my emotions now you we
have Joe the android guy on the show and
I want to ask him cuz Tony you and I
have talked about it a bit but i'll ask
for your opinion on in a second Joe what
was your feeling on the LG g2 uh yeah
that about sums it up as a great sound
brother do you like that you think you
need a moment it's just a rush of mixed
emotions looking at the device it's it's
a logical evolution it's what kind of
we'd expect to be it doesn't include
all the specs that I thought it would
have you know it was not guy having a
fingerprint scanner him no I was
expecting it to have a Snapdragon 800
and right now it looks like it's just
going to be a 600 which still that's
good and the g2's got the 800 we're
talking about the g2 not the Nexus 5
hello oh yeah yeah sorry sorry yeah I'm
difficult then I gotta start all over
you're right yeah that is ultimately
where I'm going with this but because we
haven't talked about the g2 itself I
wanted to know your yes I was getting
ahead of myself in seg laying over so it
looks like a good device the videos that
i have seen the depictions that i have
seen it looks really nice i'm not a fan
of custom skins i don't really like the
whole overlay that that LG has but it's
got a nice you know the knock-knock
features really cool i love that yeah if
they feature where you can double tap on
the screen to unlock and do not panic
and to relock it yeah the turn the
screen off i think that's great and it
takes away from the the oddity of having
that power button on the back which
honestly i think that and the volume
keys are a really great idea i loved
that when we had the power button on the
back of the motorola xoom if you
remember way back in the day that was
just a convenient leave a place button
and i think this is a good place to do
it and it kind of goes without saying
but I'm gonna say it anyway we've been
begging to have bezel lyst designs
forever and we just kind of never asked
the question you know what are we going
to do with the buttons that are on the
bezel where where they going to go how
are we going to handle that then well
here's here's LG's answer is it the
answer that's going to stick around i
don't know but unless we're putting them
on the top or the bottom i think we're
going to have to you know and that's a
good point and according to LG according
to their marketing materials the button
on the back makes everything possible
you gotta remember that it makes
everything possible tony was your
feeling on that on the g2 I'm gonna have
a say that I my feeling towards the g2
is exactly the same as my feeling was
towards the s4
hmm so this isn't exactly the same it's
a good phone it's a great phone I love
the bezel is designed but it somehow
fails to excite me and believe me I'm
one of the few LG fans on the team we'll
see here's the thing that that was my
frustration and I wrote a piece to this
effect last week that I won't recount my
room my entire opinion but um you know I
wasn't an LG fan I came on the team last
year you know in the in the spring and
at that time LG hadn't made anything
really compelling to my eye in a while
and they'd been fooling around with 3d
displays and claiming that they first
those were fun yes I was like okay
whatever LG I mean like I don't know
what you're doing but it's not exciting
to me and then somehow I got I was the
one to review the optimus G and as we
know if you've listened to the pocket I
weekly for as for the over the year that
it's been on the air you know that the
optimus G like blew us all away from
hardware to software it's just an
outstanding experience and so I became a
very you know I didn't become a fan boy
but I became you know I was impressed by
LG for a bit and I was excited to see
what the g two became and to see that
they've abandoned that that that
identity that Hardware identity that
they had of glass and kind of faux metal
and this unique look for essentially a
galaxy s4 clone on the hardware side is
really frustrating to me and I mean the
build site I mean of course the hardware
is impressive with the snapdragon 800
down to the hood and and all that stuff
and i love some of the new software
features but even the software is
visually speaking for a shallow
individual like myself needs of stuff to
look good this is not the most exciting
phone i've ever seen but um you know I
think it's also important to keep in
mind the Samsung is blowing everyone
else out of the water with the galaxy s4
which is a lightweight shiny plastic
phone with cartoony software so
hopefully LG does very well with this
we'll see we're gonna get a run review
unit at some point but you anyway so
that's that's it but the whole reason I
brought up the g2 is not to talk with a
g2 but to talk about the fact that the
LG Nexus 5 is rumored to be a
watered-down g2 now Joe you had some
thoughts on this jump right to those
attract yes you did oh wow what's the
deal i want to remind everybody I'm two
hours earlier than Michael so if he
sounds tired subtract two hours for that
well I am I am tired i'm also
scatterbrained if you couldn't tell
because i woke up and i had to do
something that I can't talk about it's
under embargo until tomorrow but you'll
find out tomorrow I did something too
but it's not under immoral and I'm not
gonna talk about so the Nexus 5 we don't
know if that's what it's going to be
called we kind of think it is and my
suspicions I've got a piece that I was
supposed to get up this morning but I
deliberately didn't because I wanted to
talk about it on air and and get you
guys to to weigh in so I don't sound
like an idiot anymore than I already do
at this point in the podcast the g2 I'm
sorry the the Nexus 5's many numbers on
the screen why can't they call it
something like galaxy s5 I think it's
going to be based on the g2 just like
our Nexus 4 was based on the optimus G
and I'm happy with that I'm entirely
good with that if the rumors hold true
and it has a step down in the process or
down to the Snapdragon 600 from the 800
that'll be a little bit frustrating to
me a little bit disappointing I think we
can still do a flagship phone at plus or
minus twenty dollars thirty dollars
higher than what the nexus 4 was sold
for instil still have a really good
phone and have the flagship SOC built
into it and it's also got a different
camera it looks like again jack
speculation here from 13 to 10
megapixels it looks like and no word on
optical stabilization right and then
coming from a nexus 4 hey a 10 megapixel
camera I'm good with that right right
and that also puts it at parity with the
Moto X Google's other high-profile
device right I'm not too happy with
cutting the storage down you know if
you've got an eight gig or 16 gig phone
okay give me an SD card slot so I can
throw a 64 gig card in there in store my
music my movies might whatever
because despite how people say well
everything's in the cloud it that's
great when you're in range of the cloud
when the cloud doesn't have hiccups when
just a lot of its study outside and
there's no blood oh snap there have been
a couple days last two days in a row out
here where my t-mobile has just been
miserable I've way well normally I know
I'm great where I am I'm just trolling
them sorry yeah you control and that's
cool but what I tell people is look at
who is using the devices look at who's
using the carriers in your area no it's
because your carriers are very much area
specific and out where I am t-mobile is
generally great especially with LTE but
you've been having a hard time recently
I've been having and connected to the
network but no data over the network for
the last couple days so it's been hard
and that means I can't read my my ebooks
because I've only got a few pages you
know the next chapter on / unless you've
downloaded the playlists you yeah no
netflix no YouTube no films so you would
still prefer more internal storage I
think we I would like to have that well
I wouldn't have there's hope for that
because the g2 is rumored to be or not
rumored no I'm sorry an LG xpression
confirmed or executive confirmed that
the g two would be modified for
different carrier so they're going to be
carrier variants with different specs
yeah that's great yeah Nexus 5 nope it's
not gonna have a slot Wow I mean but
that's not confirmed we don't know that
I mean it's it's a nexus right I I know
that it's what the president's you know
that I know you know it's not gonna have
a slot yeah but anyway um we will see
what this is again this is not really
compelling to me Tony what is your
feeling on this I can't remember a
single Nexus phone which was a flagship
device so stepping down the processor to
a Snapdragon 600 is still a fast device
I mean just look at the HTC One look at
the the Snapdragon 600 versions of the
s4 that's a fast SOC so i will really
mind that much
the 10 megapixel camera come on 600
Snapdragon with 10 megapixel shooter
better than the HTC one so in terms of
specs respects on paper I don't mind the
the reduction of specifications what I
do mind is the a gig version show that
that even for me is a little bit just
too too little yeah but that is has its
data set I can live with these pecs and
again it's going to be a very cheap
device if these rumors don't turn out to
be true and the other Nexus it got
another one exercise will never never
buy it it's okay i'll i'll pick that for
you it's great yeah you know it's funny
because i think the Galaxy Nexus was the
closest one that I saw achieve like semi
flagship status and it's coincidentally
the only one I bought and and really
enjoyed um for a bit you know with the
exception of the horrible camera and bad
screen and bad battery life and that you
know that kind of stuff get the extended
battery and everything's happy had
extended battery that's the problem I've
got my I'm galaxy nixie in my house ex I
well it's gonna be it's gonna be fun to
see this I can only imagine that we will
be paying very close attention to this
and then in the weeks ahead so stay
tuned for more on that lets move on and
talk a little bit about just touch very
briefly under device we mentioned before
from another company a large device the
HTC One max Hymie described this in his
pocket now daily as this this leaks
press render as well it looks like an
HTC One and the one mini yeah it's just
I am looking at this press render right
now and Tony this was your new story
from August 12 mm-hmm but I have an
update yeah you know good well it's just
the leaked press render if it is still
legit is it looks identical to the one I
think the the larger HTC logo on the
back sort of gives it away but and the
new placement of the LED flash on the
back Oh what it's under instead of a
long time yeah but I've I think if my
sclerosis is letting me think clearly
that HTC according to some reports at
one point debunked these renders and
said that there is nothing true about
them now I don't know if it's true or
not if the report is true or not or if
HTC's debunking is you're not real
that's the update yeah yeah i mean this
others i'm looking for for floods on
this while you look at news it would
make all the sense in the world for the
HTC one max to look like this because
the HTC one is the standard design which
HTC was reusing for the one mini which
we reviewed and it would just make sense
all the sense in the world for the one
max to look similar I mean same design
same aluminum materials and you know
what I wouldn't mind yeah now I the only
thing that's been in the past 24 hours
we've only seen reposts of the original
leak so we have no no information on
either way either way on this right now
it does it make sense for HTC to to kind
of try and penetrate into the phablet
space I mean it's growing certainly but
is it growing as explosively outside of
the territory of say the Galaxy Note
right now yo well the way I look at it
is if they don't do something to get
into the the phablet tablet space
somebody else will and they're going to
miss the opportunity this design has
been proven to work well it stands out
it's not like just a generic slab that
nobody can recognize and nobody knows
the difference it stands out primarily
because it's got those front firing
speakers so HTC is sitting on the edge
of an opportunity to get into that space
than to make their name known not just
on phones but on phablets tablets and
move on from there whether or not
they're going to take advantage of that
opportunity or even if they're able to
take advantage of that opportunity
remains to be seen but if they're gonna
do it the the design of the one is the
time to do it and maybe that's the whole
point behind it is they've got this one
design that they're going to lead the
company with and you know then in six or
eight months will be bored with it and
no say oh it's just a just another one
there's nothing new to the design yeah i
can i can already envision my art tone
of voice as we say you know eight months
ago this was awesome guys but do say
different aren't we fickle we sure are
let's remember we yeah we don't have to
be huge analysts to see that HTC is
bombing or targeting hopefully these
words won't trigger some NSA reactions
samsung with their latest products i
mean the HTC One and the s4 side-by-side
s4 mini one mini side by side right no
three max side-by-side so whatever
Samsung is doing on whatever screen size
level HTC is doing the same you know and
I think that it's it's a great policy
now I I think tactically this is true
now Tony sent a link to to join me would
to a tech radar article which is the the
one that is calling this possible load
of massive baloney because none other
than well first of all this leak came
from from heavily and then it was
debunked on the engadget post by none
other than Jeff Gordon if she sees PR
you know when a PR for you immune
occations manager yeah senior global
online communications manager cheese boy
that's a I didn't know that's that's a
Bible just an awesome title I can't i
have a title like that no so it you know
who said it was fake ewa lakes is way
off his game and then of course the
engadget commenter community called him
a troll and they you know do all
devolved into whatever but you know
whether whether or not this particular
render is official i think it makes a
lot of sense i think we all three of us
something i think it makes a lot of
sense for HTC to be you know playing in
this in this market although it i have
to be honest with you guys I would be
very concerned about how they would
leverage the added screen size because
they don't have I hate to sound like a
broken record on this but they don't
have the digitizer they don't have the
the compelling stylist solution which
makes the Galaxy Note line compelling
you know and this is what I say whenever
another company comes into the fabulous
patient like sugar
this huge screen I'm like sweet what can
I do with it nothing you know because
there's not added hardware to take
advantage of all the real estate and so
I don't know I know you're a huge fan of
the stylus or another additional input
method but now i will disagree again
like we usually disagree since since i
have the one the one oh my god since i
have the male 2 it's in 702 i can't
remember maybe two or three times
pulling out the stylus out of which the
first couple of times were when we were
in barcelona when i brought me the note
when you serve got it yeah yeah I don't
use this stylist at all so I'm just
using my phablet whenever using the fell
but I think Joe dropped off oh all right
we're gonna Mack um yeah I'm using it
like a big fella yeah and what is that
and I mean is that more compelling to I
mean just these just the sheer added
size not necessarily the the added size
but the advantages which come with it
and I'm specifically thinking about the
larger screen which allows me to see
more information at one time and and the
larger battery and we all know we love
the note 2 because it had a great
battery life and larger the phone the
larger the battery well it's true but
then there is a threshold to that
welcome back Joe okay thank you could it
be back there is a there is a threshold
to tube to what will accept from next as
we just saw from Taylor Martin's review
of the Xperia Z ultra yeah there's a
lion yeah there's a line there although
I understood that is the prettiest
review i've seen visually in a while
like taylor really did a nice job on the
layout on that one just to Michael geeky
about layout for a second you realize
that he said he said the sentence to the
guy who was using guess whose phone bed
I was just gonna say yeah Tony you're
like the biggest fan of oversized phones
and many tablets so yeah wait maybe we
should get tailored to oh no we have to
send that back to negri don't we I was
gonna think we already did sad face cuz
I would have brought it over to your
4eva anyway so let's let's let's jump
ahead we don't know we don't even know
if this thing is real and it's been fun
to speculate but there's other real news
to deal with in particular a bit of
a question asking from our friend Joe
Levi is the new Moto X 8 chip the future
of Android asks Joe I can't wait to hear
the answer because when we talked about
this with joe i said i was curious to
hear about this topic specifically but i
haven't managed to read the post so i'm
gonna mute and just listen yeah you know
that's great I you know because I would
like to hear it from Joe's mouth as well
I've read T editorial just this morning
in fact and I tend to agree with your
conclusions Joe but I think it's going
to be an uphill battle convincing
ordinary people or ordinary geeks that
this is at all worthwhile what is your
you're given tell us what the x8 system
is if you want alright so first to to
address your point is it at all
worthwhile yes absolutely yes is the new
motorola x8 chip the future of android
yes and no and this will will caveat
that it's nice but and then remind us of
what what it what it's halo product it
is yes so so so everybody knows the
motorola x8 is more than just an SOC it
is the the chipset essentially to use an
old term that we don't see much anymore
that motorola is using in their current
devices it's in the moto x it's in some
of the newer droids and in short they
are doing something unusual they are
taking instead of consolidating
everything that they can on to a chip
that's what an SOC is it's at a
system-on-a-chip instead of doing that
consolidating costs reducing materials
they're pulling out very specific
features and functionalities and putting
them on their own discreet little bits
of of silicon they're putting them in
their own chips so x 8 is essentially an
SOC and in this case it's a Snapdragon
and who cares about what it is but it's
got these two other very distinct chips
that do very specific things and they do
so at very very low power it's got a
digital signal processor and it's got
kind of like a
ambient awareness processor that knows
contextually where it is what
environment it's in is it in your pocket
is it in your purse is it face down on
the desk and then can apply logic to
that say well I should have my screen
off or I should have the screen on or I
should have the volume louder or I
should not be listening to hear things
because I'm going to be muffled in a bag
right and just to inject to inject a
little bit there it is having the Moto X
around the house is always interesting
because I can move jostle the table that
all my phones are on and only one of
them lights up because only one of them
knows it's moving and is applying logic
to that and saying oh well you have
notifications and you haven't moved me
in a while so here I am and it'll you
know the active display will breathe and
then it'll go away and it's really nice
sorry go ahead just interrupt a little
bit I want to interrupt you both first
of all me you Michael because you were
the most recent to talk if you remember
the s4 had such a feature that whenever
you picked up ps4 it's slightly vibrated
if you miss something well the s4 was
sleeping on the table yeah that's true
that's one and a question to Joe if for
for the layman out there would it be ok
or fair to make an analogy between these
x8 extra SOC s or extra pieces of
silicon and the GPU the GPU is doing
specific graphic tasks and these pieces
of silicon in the x8 are doing also
specific pieces of that so is it ok if I
as a layman think about this extra chip
like GPU but for other activities sure
so to speak to that your GPU your
graphics processing unit and there's
usually at least a couple cores handling
processing visual data and turning it
into pixels on your screen that's only
on when the device is on when the cpu is
getting instructions and doing things
and they work together the cpu ram and
GPU all work together it kind of in in
conjunction with one another so you
really can't have GPU without CPU
however you can have these other chips
and that's really what sets them apart
from everything else that not everyone
is
doing but it changes the paradigm to
have these chips that are always awake
they're just sipping at the power
because they're designed not to use much
power at all but they're operating
completely separately from the cpu from
the GPU from all of the other stuff and
sometimes that means they're waking them
up to do things sometimes that means
they're putting them into a deeper
hibernation or deeper sleep there
they're doing all kinds of stuff more
intelligently which helps with
responsiveness it makes it so your
device is ready for whatever you're
going to use you don't have to wait for
it to warm up into wake up it's there
it's it's already there because it knows
what you're doing or it's helping save
battery by putting into that deeper
better backpack and you're not going to
use it until you know you open the bag
go digging for it and pull it out and by
that time those several seconds it takes
you to get your phone out it has
realized what you're doing and it's
waking everything up and it's all ready
for you when you get to that point but
in the meantime it just saved you a ton
of battery because your CPU wasn't in
standby it was it was in a deep sleep
and that all plays to to motorola's
intention of designing a phone that's
not more powerful in this case but it
uses its existing power more
intelligently much more intelligently
now before we get too deep into this uh
which we may already be past that event
horizon that the title of the article is
is the new motorola x8 chip the future
of android then we've got quite a bit of
discussion going on there a lot of
people are saying you know Samsung has a
lot of this stuff that they're already
doing they have discrete DSPs and
whatnot digital signal process those
points yes readers you are absolutely
right this article was specifically
about the motorola x8 but in the bigger
scheme of things we're going to start
seeing it Joe predicting the future here
we're going to start seeing more of
these things pulled out of the
traditional SOC and put into discrete
chips for the battery savings for the
ambient information for all of that but
that also means now you've got those
chips that
and evolve on their own separately from
your traditional SOC so now if we want
to switch over to an atom or if we want
to switch over to a Tegra you've got
these separate chips that you can put in
there you don't have to build this
technology into the Snapdragon into the
tech right into the atom motor a little
bit more specific about that they said
you know we've completely isolated the
we've optimized the s4 that we're using
but it's not an integral component you
can swap out any chip any AP in there
that you want exactly so whether we're
going to see the x8 chips powering every
Android in the future not I think that's
what a lot of people thought the article
was about and and that's what we're
talking about specifically but we're
gonna see other manufacturers come up
with similar solutions that do the same
thing as the x8 chips do and that's
really a misnomer they're not an X 8
chip but x8 the philosophy the family
yeah yeah and and we're going to see
that come to all other different
platforms underneath the Android
umbrella and really motorola just took a
huge leap ahead of everybody else by
doing this they've positioned themselves
so that when new esos they don't have to
worry about building their stuff into it
they just plop it and go they've put
themselves ahead of the rest of the
field in that regard and in the regard
of what their devices do and now
everybody else has to play catch-up Jill
is making a solid efforts not to turn
into an Android yeah charger poor joe i
think i think your inner Andruw Jones
somebody in Joe's houses i think
sneaking some youtube videos on the side
or something cuz we keep losing it at
points Joe that's sorry I'm even
hardwired into the network at this point
so that's cool man oh it's cool we're
still getting your thing listen I I
think you're right this I love this this
philosophy this thing that it's like
okay we're breaking it out of the mold
of like all right well what's on this
next one well this is new or so it's
said okay so it's nap track at eight
hundred the previous one is Snapdragon
600 whatever no this is a designed
system built specifically and you know
designed so that you are not using the
processing power you don't need
to be at specific points and I think
whether you call it X 8 whether it's
from Motorola what it doesn't matter
this is a much smarter approach and it's
going to be used by every company
eventually going forward because the
concept will yes that's what yeah the
chips in particular probably not
although Motorola maybe licensing these
two other people until they get their
own up and running again see Samsung
buying their chips who knows you know
who knows but everybody mark this day
down this is a fundamental shift not
just in Android but in the way that we
use our mobile devices and we'll be
looking back on this in one or two or
three years this is when it all happened
this is when it started everybody else
is going to get to this point and it it
fundamentally changes the way that we
interact with our devices much for the
better I like it that's a solid button
there tell me to have anything to add
absolutely not I have taken every word
from Joe's mouth and is I buried it deep
in my brains excellent excellent good
we're all intelligent more intelligent
than we were before and hopefully
listeners that applies to you as well
with regard chip design which I think
Joey did a wonderful job of making that
not as dry as it could have been I'll
try to be drier yeah we've so it just to
move on to something that I don't think
is going to be a game changer and this
will close out Android before before I
say the positive thing about this let me
just say the negative thing I don't know
guys I don't know what to do with this
sony has sony sony has taken a different
approach to smartphone camera
photography two cameras are a big deal
right cameras are huge we've been
talking about the 1020 forever the Moto
X tries to have a good camera but it
doesn't but they gave it their old
college try the LG g2 now has optical
image stabilization you know we're
seeing cameras become very very
important actually that happened a while
ago but all of the Samsung cameras that
are out there yeah the dedicated camera
dicated Android
is yet like the you know photography has
become huge in the mobile space so Sony
rather than play the game with everybody
else of making like kind of either
clunkier phones or phones with a lot of
features pac-10 has apparently according
to some leaks published in a story from
three days ago from Stephen shank sony
has apparently opted to design some
accessories that latch on to your
smartphone and provide better
photographs that way and I don't mean
like a little dime sized magnetic this
if this leak is correct and if the scale
is right in this photo which comes to us
from Sony Alpha rumors yeah I this is it
looks like kind of almost full DSLR
sighs yeah it's like taking an Xperia Z
and slapping a can of lentil soup on the
back of it right it's huge it's called
in this photo is called the Sony lens G
and it has an optical zoom capability
because its massive it is massive I'm
its massive and I apparently what what
is it what it was the info here it
connects to the phone via NFC and
Bluetooth is that right and it it will
attach to your phone with magnets the
claim goes so I have no idea how that
happens because as Steven rightfully
points out the Xperia Z is mainly glass
on the back there that's not a problem
you troll it's got a battery right in
sawed oh it's got a battery of itself to
you of course a yeah I would have to do
another the first leak on the first
vendor there is also a holder which
seems to hold it in place yeah there's a
clip that good which is great because
you don't want to have the thing tumble
off the off your phone when you're you
know bouncing around is there any
optical image stabilization that we're
seeing don't think that's the issue here
Lily also has a little Wi-Fi logo on it
too so there's a Wi-Fi local on on the
on little heed image am so maybe would
you carry this in your pocket I mean
just the lens because the film you have
the phone that's the real question right
first of all this this is not one of
those little stick-on lenses that
simply goes over the the camera that you
have on your device and adds optical
zoom to it right this is completely
self-contained second is today the first
of April hmm because that was the
impression I got when I first saw this
is an epic april fools joke same time so
this is this looks ridiculous let's get
this out of the way this looks hilarious
in the press render it looks like
something that would be very
uncomfortable to carry in a pocket it
looks like something I would have a very
hard time using on a day-to-day basis it
just it's it's hilarious and by the same
token this is cool in the way that the
phone pad is cool or no padfone she's I
hate how they did that yeah the PadFone
with the plug-in smarter the a serious
thing with a plugin smartphone to the
tablet like this is one of those
throwback concepts of the future that I
that feels like it comes out of like
2003 as a matter of fact hold up it does
remember before smartphone before phones
had integrated cameras we had those
camera attachments from what Sony
Ericsson yeah they clipped into the data
port on the bottom and so had one mm-hmm
this is exactly that except obviously
much more capable but you still end up
having to carry two things so I think
for the average consumer this is not
going to be going to be great but Sony
is a company that also makes really
great cameras they make the camera that
hi May and I use for our all our pocket
now videos they're a wonderful camera
company yeah so this might produce some
really excellent results but my question
I guess is still if you're carrying
around two separate things if you care
about camera quality that much why will
not just carry a phone in a camera and I
never advocate that but in this case
well yeah but this is smaller than the
camera than a dedicated camera and if my
logic is right this being standard NFC
compatible if you have an HTC with mfc
you could probably attach it to the HTC
or samsung galaxy s4 now Joe what do you
think okay so NFC you're not going to be
transferring pictures over NFC the NFC
if it really has NFC in it is only going
to be used to pouring guys yeah pair the
device to it and of course not every
device has NFC which is silly these days
so there's going to be a way to do it
manually and whether it talks via a
Wi-Fi direct or whether it talks through
bluetooth i would say probably Wi-Fi
direct because there's it's faster yeah
bluetooth for uses Wi-Fi direct as its
transfer protocol anyway so however it's
doing that looking at the press renders
this guy is seeing on his screen as the
viewfinder what he's seeing through the
lens so it's going to be some kind of a
real-time connection it I don't know it
just looks really goofy to me this would
be something like I would carry in this
particular case my in my xperia z2 by a
note to the club in the evening and
carry it naked and then I'd go to Berlin
with Michael and I bring my sony lens G
with me because I would like to ah so
this this is the only scenario in which
I can imagine this in my life and like I
get it see that's the thing I my I want
to justify that I want to make this work
because a it's a cool idea be it
increases the versatility of your device
and I'll say Dan see it's a really cool
idea it's a cool like retro futuristic
concept and it could result in some
added convenience if you're carrying a
man purse around or a bag or you know
you're ready for a trade show like you
just said Tony yea though to answer your
question with some you know speculation
of my own will this lens be compatible
with other phones I would say not if
Sony can help it because sony has always
on in the company that's like we're
going to make our own standard we're not
going to play nice with all y'all and
you know as they have wonderful products
in their history as well as a result
because I loved my mini disc player for
a long time but you know they're not
around anymore so we will have to see I
guess the rumors are pointing to a
possible Aoife release for this and if
this does get dirty if I Tony I'm gonna
be so Jessie this you know it's funny
because I really want to make it clear
that though I'm sort of crapping all
over this idea it's I'm not because it
does seem very intriguing to me in a
very geeky way I Justin pessimistic
about its concepts for widespread
adoption because looks ridiculous so
let's let's take this one out of the way
and let's go
back to those deinem sized fish fish
lines stick ons yeah those second why
why can't someone do something like this
maybe some some knock off and make that
concept work with this kind of concept
so instead of having this Wi-Fi
Bluetooth NFC yadda yadda yadda just a
big honking telephoto lens that you slap
on the back of your phone and it sticks
there with magnets and suction cups I
don't know I don't know I just I mean I
give her you're saying it's it's simpler
but yeah I i can see knockoffs of that
happening i'm sure losing it and i'm
sure people are already at work on it
and we'll see it in like the fringes of
the show floor at Aoife so anyway we'll
we'll have to circle back on that and
hopefully we get some more info on that
but let's move on to windows phone if
it's all right with everyone windows
while we're talking about cameras we
have a comparison up and I won't dwell
too long on this but I figured I would
put it in the right now because I
figured Tony would want to say something
Michael take take good care of it Tony's
going through withdrawals yes I'm sad
I'm a little sad about this piece
because I worked pretty hard on a matter
of fact I pushed back a review the texts
piece because I it took me like two days
to put this thing together which is a
comparison in video comparison and a
text comparison comparing the nokia
lumia 1020 and the original nokia 808
PureView it is posted at pocket now you
can check it out it went up yesterday
and I'm sad about it because it's you
know it's very late and and I think this
is not something that people are really
discussing as much as they have been in
the past few weeks but we were kind of
overwhelmed with a lot of device
launches and whatever plus Tony's 808
the only ate away at the pocket no team
has it was with Tony in Aradia so way
over the pond yeah so Tony we had it we
eat the cost to send that to Boston by
way of New York by way of france by way
all these places but anyway finally
arrived at arrive like three days late
because of the stupid signature
requirement and blah blah blah blah blah
i got the thing and then i had to take a
bunch of pictures side by side I take a
lot of video side by side and by the
time
I'm we were done it's up and now I don't
think anybody really cares because we're
late but I'm very proud of the the
amount of samples i was able to get and
i am also and this is I think we're Tony
and I will disagree I think we already
disagree on it and I am also very happy
that I own the 1020 because I much
prefer the output from the 10 20 even
though I think from a pro photographer
standpoint it is inferior far inferior
actually it Tony have you had a chance
to look at the sample yes I have and
I've analyzed almost pixel by pixel so
there there are two things i'm not
talking about windows phone because
windows phone is doing its best with
microsoft to keep me away from using it
with i have a couple of problems with
Windows Phone and i will use Windows
Phone again when these will be fixed but
OS aside and strictly talking about the
camera I have two problems with the
camera on the Lumia 1020 first of all
for me personally the colors are very
important so when I go out and I snap a
picture of something I want that picture
to be those colors to be recreated on my
monitor on my laptop on my paper if I
print it exactly the way my eyes saw
that so I don't want a super super super
blue sky if in that particular scenario
this guy wasn't super blue that's number
one and number two and I've read some
reports and I've even read Stephen Elop
opinion and explanation on this the 1020
does additional sharpening on the image
which is of course optional it can be
fixed and tweaked by a software update
but I don't necessarily like the outcome
because it it sharpens everything
meaning it sharpens the noise too and
the overall images are more noisy
noisier than the images on the 808 which
in comparison look softer more dull but
in reality they are not so these are
about the only two things I want to
mention and of course you like the
output because you like super amyloids
divided Instagram and you are the kind
of guy who loves these kinds of image
images and image reproductions
I on the other hand I'm a more classic
dinosaur and I talk about windows on my
windows will just are usually lighting
too low it up over there Tony yeah yeah
no you know until you're right you're
right and this is it's a great
illustration of of subjectivity and and
just you know taste because I I admit it
yeah I'm kind of I kind of have some
tacky tastes when it comes to this kind
of stuff if you're gonna give me the
choice between authenticity and over
saturated colors I'll take the over
saturated colors every day I was trying
to find the comment while you were
speaking but i can't find there's a
comment in the post from a hilarious
reader who says like yeah I i get the
arguments in favor of authenticity but
you know i don't really want
authenticity all the time because life
sucks i wanted to look better than it
did and I you know I I am more in that
boat and and I really do like the the
sharpening because I like to take a
photo that I've taken from my 1020 and I
like to zoom in on like far away text
and be able to read it and yeah as a
result there's a lot more noise in the
shot but you know with the 808 it's more
accurate but that text is is fuzzy it's
you know so so it's a question of what
you yeah of what you're looking for go
ahead Joe no I'm just smiling no no I
thought you were trying to jump in there
yeah so you know and this is also as
luck would have it the first time I've
ever included actual 100% crops in a
post so being able to look at the
grommets on my sperry topsiders that
ridiculous ridiculous zoom levels by
default is really cool both of these
cameras are pretty amazing i have really
enjoyed having the 808 next to the 1024
this period even though it meant a
pretty in depth bit of bit of work here
but you know ultimately i come away from
it feeling like the things nokia decided
to emphasize besides the contentious
stuff that Tony you and I already talked
about besides this color saturation
sharpening okay we put that aside for a
second and the things they've added to
the experience to me make it on the
whole a much more enjoyable one and i'm
not talking about windows phone or
anything like that i'm talking about the
the optical image stabilization which
really does have a nice effect and the
the related issue of better low-light
performance because i did my best to try
and get the ada way to to perform as
well in that shot of the enterprise
you get a through you get a scan yeah so
that that's a huge problem of the 808 if
you want low light images it can
definitely beat the Lumia 1020 if you
are using a tripod with a 2.8 second
exposure time but right if you if you're
going to hold it by hand there's no way
you can get decent images yeah I you
both of the low light shots that I
specifically called out in the
comparison I just I look at the results
from the 1020 and ok they're not perfect
but man I have never taken a better
low-light shot than those two anything
and the 808 just you know it can't get
close like you say without a tripod you
know there's all kinds of other Phil you
know other stuff that I encourage
everyone to read the description we
can't talk about it but I it was just
fascinating learning about how different
these cameras worried you know everyone
assumes that they just took the camera
from the 808 bolted it to the back of a
928 called it a day no the 1020 is a
completely different design everything
about it is different on the inside and
the results bear that out so let's check
so the person who wants to just pick up
their phone and take a really good
looking picture of anything regardless
of the situation regardless of the
lighting indoor/outdoor bright light low
light which of these two should they get
hey I think that's no it's no question
he'll people get the 808 it's Indian oh
I know but but if you have if you have
those opportunities you know if you had
an 808 and a 1020 side by side at the
cell phone store which we're never gonna
have but if you did which one should
they get just for that camera
functionality I think because the
public's tastes tend to Hugh more
closely to mine in my pedestrian you
know more more color more sharp equals
more better I think then the 1020 is the
proper answer that there but I think if
you're asking about people who value
good photography I think the 808 is is
the is the right answer unless you're
talking about yeah I think I think to
put it differently Michael you've broke
we buy it the Lumia 1020 Adam Lane would
buy dat wait there you go that's not
yeah well if he wasn't if we're if we
were not talking about the platform
again yeah as long as we leave the
opposite of it yeah yeah that's a nice
yeah
so and speaking of Adam Lane I didn't
linked to it here but there is a he
wrote a wonderful guide on how to take
amazing pictures with the 1020 that
taught me a lot of stuff too so check
that out usually those are videos but
here it's a written piece and it works
really well written piece so check that
out shall we move on from from these
devices tell me I'll bring you your 808
when when I come to Germany I'll keep it
safe easily I'm leaving my camera at
home so I'm relying on that boy okay no
pressure there and to everyone asking if
I'm going to be shooting any review
videos with the 1020 yes I think I will
I think I will shoot a forthcoming video
with the 1020 if I can fit it in the
windows speaking of videos the windows
official YouTube app is back on the
Windows Store that was pulled a fence is
not working it works for me what's the
matter with you is it a region that
doesn't work and no have you tried it
recently I tried it that fire it up
yesterday I don't have a no I don't know
fire it up today oh yeah alright well
i'm anna sits in the other room i don't
know what it what to do with it what
woody international of reports yeah like
six hours after yep like you tell Joe
about it I mean I'm gonna go get my okay
six hours after releasing the
application I I used it it worked but
now it gives me an error and it says
something hold on let me relaunch it
relaunching it launching and something
happened and we're not sure what and
there was an interesting post done w be
central trying to explain why the error
is happening and the bottom line is that
we are still not sure whether Google
again did something or whether this time
Microsoft overlooks some of the things
regarding api's licenses and stuff like
that too too tacky for me but the bottom
line is the app is there downloaded it
won't work at the moment and it's filled
with one star reports on the Windows
Phone store of people were frustrated
rightfully that the application is not
working and you talk about a high
profile I'm download again now because I
didn't have it on my 1020 I downloaded
it on something else the HTC 8x check
the reviews while you're at it I just
saw them like it's it sounded like less
three stars with a thousand reviews or
something like that so that is
disappointing you would think that with
such a high profile remember when Google
pulled it like that was huge news when
Microsoft pulled heard at Google's
request it was massive news and everyone
was complaining you know rightfully so
that this awesome YouTube app was being
yanked and then they're really it's okay
guys we're gonna work together on it
he'll be awesome you would think that
they would have gotten the launch right
right the real I yeah I mean well unless
they didn't really work together and
Microsoft just found a way to to hack
and slash it together while you're
waiting for that we know the first thing
that happened when I open the app with
an error message that said something
happened and we're not sure what that's
it alright and we're not sure I think
that this was probably the shortest
topic on the broadcast yeah can we be
done with this yeah I just have one
little piece of nostalgia and then we
can be done yeah do you remember a
microsoft messenger way back in the day
before it became live messenger and did
all whatever do you remember what they
did and the reason everybody used it
because importa it worked with
everything they you know it worked with
yahoo messenger it worked with AOL
Instant Messenger it just worked it was
it was great it was what your one
universal thing but Microsoft didn't get
permission to do that and they were just
putting the stuff in there and as the
other companies were figuring out what
they were doing they were locking it
down so that you couldn't use it for AOL
instant messenger anymore and then
Microsoft would fix something and it
would work again and then AOL would do
something and it wouldn't work again so
is this just that all over again is
Microsoft just making it work by finding
holes and exploiting them and then
Google catching them and it breaking it
I'm tending to agree with you and
because i'm going to have just a short
explanation around here facebook
Messenger is the go-to source for people
communicating in text in writing and
instant messages on Windows Phone suck I
in the past couple of three or four days
I'm going to keep on saying it instant
messages should be delivered instantly
and not after six or seven hours or not
being lost summer so in the lack of a
proper facebook Messenger application
for Windows Phone Microsoft did the same
thing which you are referencing with the
windows live messenger they integrated
Facebook and the Facebook with the
People Hub and the Facebook messaging
part with the messages hub and I think
that that's not an official Facebook
thing but it's a microsoft thing my
person trying to somehow circumvent or
offer a solution which is I'm sorry to
say this not working half-assed
half-baked you name it we'll see I I
have no idea i'm sure this won't take
long to fix and you know when they
released their their earlier version of
this app it was an awesome one so
hopefully this will you know come back
and and and have its day in the sun
after this kind of calamity let's talk
briefly about that sure let's just touch
on it the Nokia Lumia 820 five is has
been tipped as not just a variation on
the 820 but as a budget windows phone
phablet anyone else leave it's the
weirdest thing ever yeah no not that
messy shortly but the two words which
you omitted probably on purpose from the
headline well were yeah i was gonna get
to that this thing yeah well okay sorry
sorry you're right no that's part of the
weird to write it so it's suggested to
me there's a Snapdragon 400 but a quad
core version of this not dragon 400 hmm
i don't have no knowledge of that yeah
the time i was talking about how that's
weird in the daily and I'm like yeah no
and entirely weird but then again the
there's that weirdo variant of the s4
pro in the Moto X that we just talked
about which is a dual-core device even
though it's falls under the umbrella of
s4 pro branding so who knows about chip
manufacturers right I mean Joe does but
but so this is just a bundle of weird to
me we know that Nokia is not afraid to
make large screen windows devices we
sell that and what was it
625 yeah which is a big what 5-inch on
that one or is does that one have a 5.2
inch as well because life is something
so they okay so this one is rumored to
be 5.2 inch 720p on the 825 here and
because of those specs that are being
battered around it would have to be a
windows phone handset running the gdr3
update right with it with quad core
support that blessed hopefully support
for larger resolutions and on such a
huge canvas I'd like to see three rows
of tiles if possible Oh 3 column wait
yeah columns so but you can do that with
the smaller ones do do you mean three
rows of like do you want another tile
size yes no not necessarily another that
size I want to be able to have three
rows of a simultaneously yes oh I want
the entire canvas to be wider because
the at five point two inches and at 720p
or 1080p resolution it can be done I
would agree it should be not even with
the smaller tiles now I can't get
everything I want in the glanceable zone
I always have to scroll down for
something because live tiles are very
useful but I you know I hate having to
scroll down the page to see more and
even without you know you know what I
tried doing recently was I tried running
a windows phone with all small tiles and
it looks ridiculous along with much yeah
we're right but except it's all there
all square and they're all the same size
and they're all multicolored so it looks
like you're carrying around like a car
national invert well no no no because
they have found it no it because it's so
minimalistic with the metro thing it
looks like you're carrying around this
like cartoon idea from the 70s about
what a futuristic device looks like it's
very fun but also it's completely
untenable and I don't recommend it
anyway Tony I agree i think with a
larger canvas if it was used
intelligently that could be awesome i
have no hope for that until when is
Windows Phone due for its next refresh
anyway ah good question sometimes it's
full yeah yeah I'm looking forward to
that because it's it's it's time I don't
want the design language to change
because I like it but it's time to get a
little please fresh bring lends its
board landscape support would be really
nice yeah
that yeah so let me go way out here and
just be bizarre for a minute because I
know you guys don't get enough of that
for me no definitely not windows phone
phablet that's halfway between a Windows
Phone and Windows tablet right yeah
there's really weird thing with the
windows tablet space right now you've
got windows RT which we know all how
successful that is so and right and then
we've got windows 8 tablets and yeah so
this would have to be something similar
to but not quite windows RT on a phablet
I think they can keep it Phone Windows
Phones same OS just pad on something in
addition to take advantage of the huge
canvas and leave it in the film
Department right but that gets to my
point we're adding one more version of
Windows essentially I mean it's the same
version of Windows but it's it's one
more perceived version of Windows that's
different from everything else and I
don't want to have to use the f-word
here but oh no that's that's fragmenting
all over the plate right well it is true
from a yeah from a user experience I'm
gonna half the standpoint you know
you've got if you're an app developer
what are you going to write apps for
you're gonna write it in traditional
windows so it works on windows 7 windows
8 tablets and in below or are you going
to use the new architecture so that you
can run it on Windows RT and maybe on
windows phone and then where is this
windows phablet space in the middle what
apps are going to run there they're
going to have to be phone app with their
phone apps but they're going to have to
be written differently so they can take
advantage of the screen real estate so
I'm reminded of what Apple did where
they took their phone OS and scaled it
up for their tat yeah and well with
Microsoft didn't that's true and we have
some problems as a result lots of
problems as a result that that sums up
my concern right there lots of problems
as a result it is this one problem it's
a valid concern I
I am put in mind of something a friend
of mine said the other day and she was
asking how I liked my lumia 1020 and I
was like blah blah blah blah she's like
what platforms I run I'm like out
windows fun and she's like oh no no no
it was that you know it went like this
she was like oh wow you know that's good
and I'm like yeah I'm like really and
she's a guy I've heard good things about
Windows Phone and then we went on to
have a discussion about how she had
heard nothing good about Windows but the
salient point is that Windows Phones
reputation you know as struggling as
that platform is to gain market share
like it has a good reputation for being
reliable and you know smooth and and
buttery and and fun and at least in my
circles and I don't have the geekiest
circles around so I think that's a good
sign and I if this 8 25 carries a
slightly tweaked version of Windows
Phone I think it'll do as well as
anything else the question that we want
to use to close out that this category
is will another manufacturer be making
any more windows phones and that's HTC
we've been I don't know if I buy this
rumor guys I have they even addressed it
this comes to us from digit times and
you know everyone's kind of hit and miss
with with with leeks and especially
digit times yeah and like it wasn't I
read the original source on I was like
really this is just this is one of those
sources familiar with the matter things
but it's even it's it the story almost
reads like someone familiar with the
matter said that HTC might at some point
decide that windows phone is not right
for them it's like okay I am I decide to
stop liking macaroni and cheese at some
point of future but I'm not doing it now
oh I can comment I can go either way I
can I can agree with this and I can
disagree with this I could I could agree
with this because I recently seen I
recently seen some numbers according to
which of course nakia is is on top of
the Windows Phone OEM list and Samsung
is a solid number two and of course HTC
and the others are following plus HTC is
in a little bit of struggle right now
financially and as a brand with brand
recognition so I would understand if
they wouldn't invest time and money in
and working with Microsoft or been
having windows phones out there for a
while and now I can I can forget
everything I just said and I can
militate for the other idea that they
will never ditch windows phone so it can
go either way ooh I've got another one
have the cash nice nicely done so there
is a compelling argument to be made when
your company is not doing terribly well
that you should ditch extraneous stuff
and focus on one thing that has
certainly been my argument for nokia all
this time when in the face of everyone
calling for a nokia android phone like
know why don't they just focus on the
thing they know how to do and they know
how to do well and you know it HTC is
doing very well with the one it's not
doing very well with anything else right
so it makes sense that maybe they yeah
Michael but can I be mean yeah please
please if you're having phones like the
8xt out there how on earth are you
expecting to be performing well on the
market so that is exactly the point I
was going to make and you thank you for
for doing it for me because we the
review I had to push back the written
review it was for the a texty and we've
been sitting on this thing for like two
weeks and part of it is because we were
overwhelmed with ECMO 2 x and g 2 news
but also a part of it is that i was kind
of holding out hope that i was wrong
because the video review has been up for
the same amount of time it's been up for
a while and the 8xt performs rather
horribly for a windows phone for a
mid-range android phone this would not
be unremarkable you get the occasional
lag and stuttered and it's not terribly
reliable and apps kind of crash for no
reason a defective demo unit well no
Android are you used to like a
mid-ranger mid-ranger low end android
foot come on you know is a phone that's
that doesn't have the specs to back up
the the platform but or for a defective
review unit that would not be out of the
question and even when HTC was first of
all really awesome they were quick and
they sent me a new 8xt in like a day
when I told him I was having some
serious problems and man this new one is
just as bad and it's not because of
Spotify as I initially thought because I
completely did a factory wipe on it and
did not install Spotify because I
thought that was the trouble point this
thing still I'll hit the button it takes
sometimes it takes like a second
two seconds to wake up out of out of
standby it still got stutter so not only
was this phone unceremoniously released
with very little fanfare on America's
third largest network this first windows
phone with boom sound but it also it's
not very well made I hesitate to say it
because I don't want to say it but it's
true you know the score reflects that
the review which will be up very shortly
you know is not a complimentary one and
it's a shame because HTC can do a lot of
stuff well but they really didn't do a
good job on this phone so is that an
indicator that may be there their focus
has already shifted and we're just
waiting for the official announcement I
don't know well we'll have to see how it
plays out I really hope they continue
making windows phone because I have
always found the 8x a rather compelling
device okay so I've got a question to
take us back to an earlier topic in the
show ah yeah let's go backwards we
talked about the LG g2 and then we
talked about the possible Nexus 5 and
how it's it's essentially a cheap and
down version you know it's running less
specs you know Tony said it it's not
necessarily a flagship phone and it
really doesn't have to be mm-hmm you can
take out components and make something
for the market that you're selling it to
and HTC has been really good at doing
that not just today's HTC but HTC all
back through time even when they were
way making a windows mobile devices you
know that I pack and one not this might
not be a bad HTC this might be an HTC
that was built to spec and it was
supposed to be a lower end of ice and it
was built that way deliver yeah you want
to say like here you go sprint have a
windows phone and just leave me alone
yeah I feel like if that's the case you
know it's a crappy strategy and if it I
don't yeah I don't agree with the
strategy either but we have to remember
that a lot of many are a lot of carriers
out there will say we want this device
and we want it to be this price point
with these specs and in sure sure sure
sure but you know this is also
oh I agree Joe but this is the first
time in Windows Phone well in my
experience with Windows Phone that I've
seen a device performed poorly to be
maybe because of its low respects like
Windows Phone is famous for performing
really well on almost any hardware there
is I think Tony the only other time I've
heard about it being bad as Tony you
reviewed that Lumia I have something
yeah it was like before the 520 it was
the 510 yeah I don't know what it was
yeah yeah and it didn't really perform
very well right mmhmm yeah so you know
that that happens I we and bless when
when your HTC and you are let's face it
struggling a bit this is hurting you
exactly yeah you don't want any bad
press out there for you know and I I
think we're dwelling on the negative
here and if you buy in a text here if
you already own one you probably like
whatever its utter sometimes but you
know it does its job it's fine it's
because Windows Phone has established a
precedent for being smooth in almost all
conditions and EXT doesn't live up to
that yeah that's the problem and that's
why we're a worse than it sometime of
this so we'll see Tony's got a jet we've
got a let's just power through this iOS
news I'm sorry we're gonna have to skip
listener mail today the iphone 5s
components keep hinting at a fingerprint
scanner hi guys i thought this the
fingerprint scanner went the way of like
the QR code even though the QR codes are
still around like i thought these things
were not cool anymore deal they're all
good way to do it better uh i was about
to say unless they revolutionized i
don't know how aside from unlocking your
phone and really making it secure yeah
oh hey wouldn't it be cool if they were
able to do something with biometrically
encrypting your phone and all of your
emails and you could send secure
communications to not only your email
contacts but secure FaceTime and secure
all that stuff is very possible Joe
because laptops are already using
fingerprint scanners to unlock their the
the computer itself and once you have
that scanner which recognizes your own
fingerprints then is just one one step
away to have an encryption key and only
you to be able to use it well and some
phones of a door to write the first day
tricks had a fingerprint scanner and
some toshiba once and stuff so I guess
we'll see i think i'm excited for this
just
because if another company we're doing
it I wouldn't be as excited but Apple
for all the bunk they get really does
know how to make existing stuff work
better sometimes so it would be really
cool to see the fingerprint scanner
actually done right for once I know you
know maybe I'm being too hard on the old
atrix but I heard seem to recall it
because it wasn't terribly popular but
and to be to be my own devil's advocate
I don't think anyone will do that whole
whole communication encryption and
security through whether that's through
traditional technologies you know x.509
certificates or whatever or through
biometric and don't think that will
happen cuz you know hi NSA how are you
doing just want to see what's up but if
if they were to do it or if anyone were
to do it now would be the time because
of all of them the distrust that we have
with all of our governments around the
world well that's true yeah right people
in other countries who are monitoring
and watching everything we're doing
wouldn't it be great if someone whether
that's Apple or somebody else would come
out with and all encrypted if they if
they do it they could beat a blackbery
of the 2014's haha yeah well and they
would immediately be able to sell that
device to every single government agency
and employee in the world and they might
even be mandated to do so that's a solid
point I mean that would be a hell of a
play and it would be in direct
opposition to what appears to be
happening on the flip side with the 5c
which will close out the show with the
iphone 5c has been leaked apparently
leaked in not only a fun yellow shade
that looks almost exactly like a lot of
Nokia's but also in a very
strange-looking green which looks like
it glows in the dark human though
probably doesn't and I am excited for
that you have you've this fingerprint
scanner idea which may be plays to the
enterprise the high-end segment then you
have this iphone 5c which i think a lot
of people think Apple needs to do this
lower end device to you know shore up
their their their low end offering and
it comes in a lot of colors I think
that's my biggest excitement
ever I wouldn't want a 5c but I would
want the extra colors oh no no no no if
you want to be able to come on customize
your phone you get an android if you
want to be able to customize your iphone
you get a case and your case can be a
laser shot cases are worse things that
was a low blow jo yeah so you know it's
a check out the links we've got it's
just it's wonderful eye candy if nothing
else I think we're going through we've
set it on the podcast many times Apple's
iPhones should come in more colors than
black and white particularly with the
Moto X on the horizon which lets you
pretty much do any color combination you
can think of and we will have a lot more
to say on that tomorrow by the way folks
you should tune in if you want some Moto
X news tomorrow and some of that and but
for now I think we do have to wrap it up
and Joe I I would like it if you if you
made your internet connection as smart
as you are is it it just it has been
treating you poorly today I'm a shy I'm
mortified to say i am a backer of the
