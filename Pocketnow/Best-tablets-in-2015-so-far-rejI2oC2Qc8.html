smartphone options for early 2015
what about tablets I'm high outside
Houston in the pocket now and these are
the best tablets you can buy for the
first half of the year this was
originally gonna be a list of the best
of what's come out this year
but frankly we just haven't seen any new
tablets yet so we've adapted our list to
include older devices that we still
think are a smart buy with that in mind
first up on our list is the 2013 a soos
Nexus 7 that's right a two year old
tablet is making your list and with good
reason the Nexus 7 is still one of the
most comfortable tablets to handle it's
small enough to fit into a back pocket
and the grippy texture makes it easy to
hold in one hand without fear of
dropping it since it's a nexus you can
count on having up-to-date Android
software and it's been out for long
enough that you can even pick up an LTE
model for dirt cheap next up is the
Galaxy Tab pro again this one isn't from
2015 but it's still one of Samsung's
very best tablet offerings actually it's
several of them you can currently buy
the Galaxy Tab pro in three different
size configurations ranging from 8.4 to
12.2 inches but no matter which one you
get you're buying an extremely powerful
tablet with a high-resolution display
and strong multitasking
there's no stylus here like what you'd
find on the Galaxy Note series but in
most aspects the tap pro just feels more
modern and you can pick up the 8.4 inch
model right now for just $200 moving to
something a bit more recent the Nexus 9
may not have seen the most favorable
reviews at first but recent software
updates have clean up performance issues
and turn it into one of the best Android
tablets around it's one of the first
Android tablets to adopt the 4 by 3
aspect ratio and the front firing
speakers beat out most of the
competition
it's pricier than the others featured so
far starting at 399 for the Wi-Fi only
model and $5.99 with double the storage
and LTE but if you value stock Android
above all else this is the tablet you
want the iPad air 2 comes in at number 2
on our list keeping true to its name the
air 2 is extremely thin and boasts a
powerful 64-bit chipset
it's Apple's most powerful
tablet yet and it's only gonna become
more useful with the public release of
iOS 9 later this year finally bringing
split pane multitasking support to iOS
from a great fingerprint scanner to a
beautiful display to a huge selection of
aftermarket accessories
this tablet seems to have everything
well maybe not everything for the power
user that truly wants to make the most
out of their hardware and take advantage
of an ecosystem that's been around for
decades there's only one logical answer
topping off our list is the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 powered by the full
version of Windows 8 the surface pro 3
acts more like a laptop than just a slab
of glass and even offers a keyboard and
stylus to give users full rein for
productivity its kickstand is also handy
for propping the surface onto a lap or
table and full size USB means that there
are hundreds upon thousands of
accessories to choose from it's the
priciest option in our list by far but
there's no denying that the surface pro
3 is a killer tablet with just as much
practical use as it has geek cred that's
it for our list but now it's your turn
what do you think are some of the best
tablets to buy right now leave your
thoughts in the comments down below and
