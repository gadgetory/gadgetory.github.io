now the first official day of FO we have
checked out the Sony Xperia z1 but now
we're going to put it side-by-side with
another leading flagship smartphone the
Galaxy S 4 from Samsung see how they
compare very quickly let's check it out
so what the displays turned off we can
kind of pull it more fully appreciate
how these devices are built differently
aesthetically speaking Samsung's rounded
corners contrast with Sony's tight
radius corners up here I think the
lights went down so we're about to get
some background noise hope you'll bear
with us through that Sony's build is
sandwich glass as we're familiar with
Samsung's hyper glazed polycarbonate
very different there Sony's device
significantly heavier don't have exact
specs on that right in front of us but
you definitely feel the weight
difference in the hand doesn't make this
owner device feel worse actually makes
it feel a little bit more premium Sony's
product is also rated for immersion and
dust resistance galaxy s4 is not
although we have to admit we'd feel a
lot safer dropping the galaxy s4 because
this duel glass panel construction you
know might be a somewhat quote-unquote
ruggedized device but it's still
probably not going to hold up to drops
quite as well since they're staring us
right in the face we might as well talk
about them the cameras on these devices
is a sony RS 20.7 megapixel camera up
against Samsung 13 megapixel shooter
we've taken a shot with that but until
we get it out of the field we won't
comment too much on the quality here you
can flip the devices on the side we can
see similar controls Sony's still doing
their power standby button on the side
there just like Samsung but much more
pronounced on this device this is a
micro-sim slot but we do have microsd as
well expandable to 64 gigs their
variants 16 32 and 64 on the galaxy s4
Sony currently only displaying the 16
gig version but once again microsd
expandable notification LED on the Sony
device just like the hidden one on the
galaxy s4 and under the hood here see if
we can get you just a little bit more
angle on this sorry about the smudging
we did wipe them off under the hood a
Snapdragon 600 on some variants of the
galaxy s4
but this one is the octa-core and a
Snapdragon 800 onto the hood over here
both of them running with two gigs of
ram let's check out how they perform in
terms of software all right guys we're
going to try and get through the
software here as quickly as possible
because we are just getting ridden over
with a very loud event in the booth here
which obviously we have two different
software skins riding on top of Android
poured up to two and they are very
similar responsiveness this is county's
galaxy s4 he's only got two home screens
going on but there are of course of
course provision for much more we're
very familiar with TouchWiz Sony's UI
layer also familiar if you've seen our
review of the galaxy excuse me up the
Sony Xperia tablet Z looks nice from the
launcher you can swipe owner over a
little panel here decide how you want
your app launcher displayed which is
quite nice camera is a big focus on
these devices probably familiar with
Samsung shooting mode with the various
selections you can you can make Sony
taking a slightly different approach but
the same controls just positioned a
little bit differently you can hop in
here for your special settings which we
showed you in the hands-on not much
going on there and then I believe this
is a special shooting mode here this is
very very cool where you can come on in
here you can do
this is your birth shop a bunch of
effects you can get your pan around the
stuff there and here's you can see your
effects rendered in real time and it's
nice you're not just forced to do one at
a time so you can do all of them I'm
sorry there's no subject in the shop
there there we go i like that sketch
that would be kind of funny it's a lot
of fun tools to play with here on this
camera module certainly you know a lot
of fun tools on the Samsung device as
well but Sony looks like it's taking it
to another level there we're going to
take a closer look at that in the in the
future but software differences abound
throughout but in terms of
responsiveness in terms of this is a
general you know feel of an Android skin
we're looking at some very very very
similar stuff here but once again that's
just a very very quick look at the eot
s4 vs the new sony xperia z1 station for
a lot more from pocket now from Eva this
is just the first official day so we've
got a lot more coming Tony behind the
camera we'll see you next time soon in
another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
