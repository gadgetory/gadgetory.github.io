pocket now calm and this is a preview
video of fennec web browser which is
Mozilla's upcoming mobile browser now
this is the alpha version so it's very
unstable I don't recommend that you
install it it's not even close to ready
but we can get a really good feel for
the features that benek will bring in
the browsing experience that we can
expect and I want to make a video about
that because I think it's pretty
impressive so far so you may see me cut
in and out of the video several times
because I'm gonna have to edit it a lot
because it's going to crash a few times
and lots of other stuff so let's get
into it here's one problem it installs
into the game's folder after you install
it but I'm going to launch it and it's
going to take a long time to launch so I
will come back into the video once it's
open okay here we are right now and we
see an address bar at the top we see a
Go button and a bookmark button there's
also more over to the right that i'm
going to show you but here's something
cool if you drag your finger right here
on the screen and you got to do it just
right you will get a little a little tab
come up that will show you your open
tabs which is really cool so you can get
little thumbnails of all the websites
that you're on and of course you can add
a new window by pressing the plus button
it's really neat way to do tab
management if you're browsing multiple
sites if we go to the right side of the
screen and obviously this will probably
be on one screen once it's finished we
have the favorite button and if you tap
on it it will turn from a outline of a
star to a star kind of like the fire the
new version of Firefox does we can press
the button down here which will go into
settings and once in settings we get the
kind of get add-ons extensions the same
kind of look that we have on the desktop
version of Mozilla Firefox so presumably
will be able to get add-ons and
extensions for fennec which will be
pretty cool other windows mobile
browsers do not have this and there are
other settings here to this looks like a
download manager though it's probably
not going to come up very well let's see
yeah not going to come up and then go to
this one which is kind of some settings
about JavaScript and cookies and that
sort of thing here's something that's
pretty neat as you start typing the
address fennec will suggest web
addresses for you and it's already
pulling up Google on typing WWE google
com up there and also it gives you quick
links to Wikipedia answers.com yahoo and
google so I'm just going to tap right
where it says Google and it'll go to the
page and when a page is loading in the
upper left corner you get a little swirl
in a circle to let you know that the
page is loading which is not there right
now and once the page is loaded I'm kind
of like the desk desktop version of
Firefox you can tap up here next to the
URL to get identity information so it'll
tell you if it as a valid security
certificate things like that it's a
really a feature that we haven't seen
yet on a mobile browser that's
implemented this way and it's it's quite
a handy way to check out if a website's
legitimate and that sort of thing okay
here we are in the bookmark menu and
it's very simple right now of course
this isn't the final thing and if we
click on edit see what will happen well
quite simply we can add the name put
some tags in there and that sort of
thing so that's pretty much it for the
tour of fennec like I said it's very
unstable right now but it's very
promising in the way that it brings kind
of the firefox 3 like experience to
mobile devices so we have easy tab
management security settings and
features and of course the extensions
and add-ins and I'm really curious to
see what comes out of that that should
be interesting so that's it for now on
fennec</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
