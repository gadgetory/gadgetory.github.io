shame with its new pixel - and pixel -
Excel we get a glimpse of the new pixel
book and learn the future of Chrome OS
and more renders emerge on what to
expect for the Huawei may 10 Pro I'm hi
my Ravenna and I think it's safe to call
today at the made by Google day the
company did not disappoint this is
PocketNow daily and now don't worry
today is not going to be all about
Google pixel let's discuss some
interesting deals Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
currently for 287 dollars on Sprint but
motion porn you'd get $425 of a Sam's
Clubs card meaning you're pretty much
not paying for the phone and you're not
paying for more after that that's insane
I highly recommend it
now start about the huawei mate 10 Pro a
couple of days ago we covered some
League renders where we saw the
beautiful colored backs with this phone
with black bezels at the front but today
we get other renders that show us that
the bezels actually match the color of
the back which not necessarily matches
what I like I prefer black bezels just
because I feel content consumption is
more immersive but let us know in the
comments what you think about these
color bezels do you like this approach
now let's move the spotlight over to
Google the companies made by Google
event happened today there is just too
much for the pocket house daily one is
assisting with a separate video that
covers everything in detail out of the
highlights I definitely consider those
new Google homes to be interesting
definitely the Google home Mini for $49
and this Google home max which is crazy
priced at 399
you tube read in addition to that this
pretty much completes with Sonos or the
Apple home bought so you're getting high
quality audio can't wait to hear that
one and how about if we also talked
about the pixel book I mean the device
is gorgeous beautiful design blasts and
metal back just like in the case of the
pixel smartphones
we've got Chrome OS running on steroids
here with great specifications in 2k
display in addition we've got a Wacom
digitizer which allows for pen input and
there is a Google pixel book pen and for
those of you who don't know the Galaxy
Note 8 is powered by this Wacom
digitizer technology so that should be
great on its own the only problem is
that
even though you've got so many modes to
use this laptop it's still a Chromebook
so obviously there are limitations
surely you do get the Google assistant
in addition to the Google Play Store the
problem is that it costs a thousand
dollars that's a lot of money but hey we
can't wait to give it a try
and finally the hottest news today yes
let's leave the best for last the Google
pixel to Google pixel to excel these two
phones are gorgeous from the back there
are also gorgeous from the front in the
case of the Google pixel to excel you've
got curved display curved borders on the
corners it's not necessarily the case
for the Google pixel - but then again
you've got stereo speakers in addition
you've got top-of-the-line
specifications yes there's no headphone
jack sadly but let's focus on the
positive the cameras there is support
for Google's new augmented reality
platform which is great as Apple has
been touting this with a our kit but
even more interesting these cameras were
rated 98 by DX Oh mark according to them
the sort of the best cameras in the
industry why because you don't need dual
cameras to be able to achieve what an
iPhone 8 plus iPhone 10 or Galaxy Note 8
can achieve you can achieve the portrait
mode in addition you can also get
portrait mode from the front camera all
this being done through software this is
great I mean the Google pixel on its own
was one of my favorite cameras last year
so that's all fine and dandy but it
leads me to the question today which
most important is what you think number
one what do you think about these new
ghoul pixels number two are you ordering
them as they're available for pre-order
today number three which one did you
pick in my case I went for the black
Google pixel to excel it looks gorgeous
I cannot wait to give it a try leave us
