v-series is to serve the largest growing
trend in the market today video
consumption phablets make up 34 percent
of the market with nearly a hundred
percent of the users spending most of
their time browsing the web or watching
video
LG's response as a new V that's far
bolder than its predecessor and far
better looking I'm home it'll be better
with pocket now as part of our coverage
of Aoife 2017 let's go hands-on the new
LG v 30
okay so if you think that the LG b 30 is
just a larger g6 that's actually just
from a distance trust me when I say that
the V 30 is significantly better the
curved borders of the aluminum trim
match with a ratio 2d curves of the
glass front and back make this phone
seem slimmer than it really is and the
feel is just surreal far lighter than
you'd expect even when compared to the
g6 it brings a dramatic improvement in
specs now with a snapdragon 835 four
gigs of ram and 64 gigs of expandable
storage with a mention of an 128
gigabyte variant for certain markets the
new 6 inch full vision OLED display
brings a taller 18 by 9 aspect ratio
almost making the bezels insignificant
at a crazy 82 percent screen to body
ratio this phone continues the legacy of
military-grade 810g durability and ip68
water and dust resistance finally reach
the V Series at the expense of a
removable battery other things gone are
the IR blaster and the secondary display
is now replaced with a blend of features
from its new always-on display
in addition to the optional floating bar
in the user interface that UI continues
to be LG's proprietary approach I'll
focused on taking advantage of the
taller display and now the iconography
actually got a little more cohesive
Android 7.1.2 is powering the show and
you finally get options to scale a
screen from quad HD II to 1080p plus to
save battery consumption
now what makes this phone special is
that it's a content consumption beast
thanks to the hi-fi quad tech support
for audio even if the lack of stereo
speakers might disappoint more on that
on one specific audio quality hands-on
as this requires a separate video the
other party trick
this phone is also a content creation
dreamboat with continuously praised the
LG fridge dual camera approach now the
primary camera gets the widest camera
aperture on a phone @f 1.6 and the
secondary also gets a boost 2f 1.9 both
lenses also benefit from a new crystal
clear glass lens which brings in more
light and reduces Distortion the camera
user interface now supports selective
zoom features to give your close-ups of
more cinematic feel where we didn't find
improvements whereas in the selfie
department something LG should really
improve but wide-angle photos and video
are still here software improvements
also make this phone the first to be
able to record log video an LG bundle
services to help you color grade your
video after you're done filming the
company even included support for a new
service called graph II which lets you
import manual settings from video
professionals in a way to color grade
your content to mimic eras or even film
styles like seriously the LG b 30 is
pretty much a phone on a class of its
own so much so that we had to record
separate videos going through all the
features in more detail and you can
expect that same level of coverage
during our review process as we spend
our time with a couple of prototypes
over the next few weeks
