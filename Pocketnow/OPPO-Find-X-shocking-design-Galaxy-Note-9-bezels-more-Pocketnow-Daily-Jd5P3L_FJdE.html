it looks really interesting we get leaks
of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 screen and
there are little to no bezels on the
phone and if you were waiting for that
iPhone as EU might have to stick to the
Sears LCD iPhone I'm highly metal Iveta
and I don't think there were many people
after that iPhone S II anyways but you
never know this is PocketNow daily the
official news today oddly don't begin
with deals but yeah let's just say that
Samsung just announced their new
Chromebook plus version 2 specifications
are ok 4 gigs of RAM 32 gigs of storage
you know the Chromebooks aren't really
that much when it comes to
specifications still 500 bucks on the
price tag but there's no in the comments
what you think about it and let's talk
about Samsung again as we've got some
trusted sources claiming that we are
getting a couple of products in the
company's unpacked event whenever the
Galaxy Note gets announced apparently
we're getting a Galaxy Tab s 4 in
addition to the gears for apparently we
won't have to wait until Aoife for that
and we're also getting the note 9
obviously now the most interesting part
is that apparently we're still not sure
if we're getting that where oh s variant
of the years four but the source claims
that that's very unlikely August 9th is
a problem date and how about if we
discuss the iPhone 10 2018 particularly
the LCD variant as some sources are
claiming two things number one that the
iPhone as a 2 is not happening that
apparently the affordable variant will
be this LCD iPhone and it's not gonna
look as good as the rest of the iPhones
apparently it'll have thicker bezels to
be able to accommodate this LCD and
that's it apparently we're also getting
different color options like the iPhone
5c that flopped whatever the case may be
we'll see what ends up happening and
since we're talking bezels apparently
that Galaxy Note 9 will bring some
changes it won't just mimic what we
currently see with the samsung galaxy s
9 plus apparently the bezels are gonna
be shrunk on this phone dramatically
according to the source we're not
exactly sure what dramatically means
because we heard that was going to be
the rumor for the S 10
but yeah it seems that at the impact we
will see that change that makes a lot of
sense in the note I just wonder how they
plan to also fit that battery and
absolutely everything else and finally
the hottest news today are the shocking
news of the Oppo find X fine 10 I don't
know exactly how they plan to call it I
believe it's gonna be the find X thing
about it is a lot of us were expecting
that this was just gonna follow on the
design language of the 1 + 6 no not at
all
oh my god this is a sliding full body
sliding module I believe I could call it
that will provide you both your selfie
camera and the back cameras and the back
cameras are huge we're talking 16 and 20
megapixels for the dual cameras at the
back 25 megapixels on that selfie
shooter
there is no fingerprint scanner
apparently this phone will rely
exclusively on facial recognition to
unlock I'm not sure how secure that will
be but then all the specifications are
crazy qualcomm snapdragon 845 in
addition to all the bells and whistles
that we expect from a flagship yes I
cannot wait to get that phone in the
pocket now Labs for review but let us
know in the comments what do you think
about the Oppo find 10 do you think that
this is how the future of smartphones
should be considering that we're going
with less bezels this display is 92%
screen to body ratio in my case I'm just
curious how long that mechanism is gonna
last I will tell you this much I've used
a ton of Oppo phones their quality is
superb but we'll see let us know in the
comments what you think friends again if
