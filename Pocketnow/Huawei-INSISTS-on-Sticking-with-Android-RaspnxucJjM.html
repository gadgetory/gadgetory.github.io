not happen at all or at least not soon
as the company is apparently only using
it as a backup sony is working on a very
different type of foldable that we hope
to see soon
since the sarcasm and new CAD renders of
the Google pixel for show that the front
of the phone is not necessarily gonna be
nice I'm Jaime Rivera and back in studio
number two wishing that there were such
a thing as I don't know jet lag pills
for Monday
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you are
in the market for iPads currently Amazon
continues offering the best deals in the
case of the nine point seven inch iPad
right now 128 gig variant for $100 off
meaning you're only paying 329 again
iPads are getting even better with iPad
OS and we're still not exactly sure what
the restrictions are going to be with
the lesser quality models but yeah this
is a good way to buy an entry into an
iPad now let's talk about Apple since we
already began and let's discuss that
whole topic ago we're covering last week
about the company's prom with Samsung
right now obviously we know that well
they made a commitment to sell this
amount of iPhones they didn't meet that
goal for reasons we know the iPhone 10s
hasn't necessarily sold as much as the
company was projecting and therefore
we've got reports claiming that there's
a payment already made of six hundred
eighty million dollars that Apple has
pretty much paid Samsung though we heard
that instead the just Apple was gonna
give them more business to Samsung which
I thought was a better you know business
ideal than having the company COFF of
money and stuff but yeah it seems that
that's where things stand let's see what
is going to happen in the future we know
that Apple is already working on micro
LED technology for the future so we're
not even sure if both companies are
gonna collaborate for that long and
since we're already talking Samsung
let's discuss the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
don't worry we didn't leave this for the
hottest news because well there isn't
really much news aside from one major
thing but let's discuss the preamble we
see the back and the front protectors
for the phone in the back it looks
identical to a p30 pro in the front wow
it looks really nice that cutout at the
front looks good the bezels look
insignificant but according to ice
universe
play is going to be the best for late
2019 so yeah Samsung is apparently going
to up the ante even more with their
dynamic olan I assume not sure we'll see
and since we're talking this place let's
discuss the new CAD renders at just the
merge of the Google pixel for I'm not
excel before and well from the back it
looks as ugly as we expected with the
stove in the corner and everything that
we've already seen but we've been
wondering what's gonna happen with the
front and we heard that we might get a
cut out in the display for the XL
variant but we didn't really know what
to expect for the smaller one now we see
that this is pretty much going to follow
on the sony xperia 1 display design
where we've got a minor bezel at the top
and at the bottom we've got
insignificant chin we should call it
asymmetrical design on the display which
is not necessarily a bad idea I think
that it's a good way to go
obviously we'll see what the screen size
is going to be and everything that
should be posted and since we're talking
Sony let's discuss some of the recent
rumors of the company working on a
foldable but this foldable is going to
be a different thing because if you
remember Sam sing a couple of I'd say
probably a year ago a little more than a
year ago the company showcased their new
rollable display design and we've seen
LG already come up with a TV that can do
that but apparently Sony is working on
giving you a phone that's like that
meaning I guess you're gonna have like a
sharpie marker and then it unfolds into
a phone or I think it's going to
probably be a regular size you know like
the old phones and then you I don't know
exactly what we're getting here when it
comes to spec we here at 3200 million
power battery and LG display 10x zoom
camera and I don't know that I hear
something about a Nautilus design caucus
that dragon 855 apparently with the next
50 modem meaning there are 5g
capabilities I don't know what to make
of this we'll keep you posted as more
rumors emerged sony is not as early the
most important company when it comes to
phones and finally the hottest news that
I have to do with Huawei and the future
of Hong mangle s as well we have rumors
that it was already being tested that it
was already out of the blue
that even developers were being
contacted about it and stuff like that
but now we've got the company's vice
chairman coming on record with two
things the first one being that he
confirms that the company is committed
to Android that there hongmen OS which
could probably even faster than Android
is being left as a last resort in case
they need to because obviously they need
developers and this will platform and
stuff like that and so they confirmed
they're committed to Android which comes
to the second part of the news where
they announced a new Glory line of
phones that already they're going to
launch with Android q so the funny part
is obviously when we've got other
information in the United States where
while we should continue being treated
as a blacklisted company so today's
question let us know I mean what do you
think do you think that it's a mistake
for Huawei to hold back their Hong mango
master do you think that it's a good
idea in my case I think that neither you
know I think that it's a good idea for
them to still launch their operating
system create the platform anyways but
obviously I'm glad they're sticking to
Android just know don't know if they can
obviously they know more than we do let
us know in the comments down below we
love snow what you think

news earlier follow us on packing out
