long for this world
manufacturers are dropping them like
flies and a proper cabled replacement
has yet to emerge as any kind of true
standard still one manufacturer this
year has not only retained this port
they're celebrating audiophile grade
playback juan carlos bag nel here for
pocket now and here's our LG v 30 real
audio review let's get the negative out
of the way first the speaker on the v 30
is just okay it's scratching the bare
minimum loudness for what we'd want to
hear on alerts music and video playback
is thin and a bit brittle compared to
other mono solutions
it's when we plug in some headphones
that the v30 launches to the top of the
class this is the winner
Bar None an incredible force for
powering any audio hardware you might
want to plug in a hallmark of the
v-series the funnel jack can detect the
resistance of the device connected and
tune the amp to appropriately power the
headphone or speakers that makes you
less likely to overdrive consumer fare
less likely to distort car and speaker
playback while reserving some huge punch
for higher impedance Pro hardware thanks
to Qualcomm chipset improvements most
Android flagships this year have been
able to properly output 32-bit audio so
in terms of data processing numbers it's
been an even playing field yet the DAC
on the v30 still manages to best all
other competitors for audio quality
better frequency response lower noise
floor better signal-to-noise ratios when
feeding this phone high quality audio
files this is the best representation of
what that file should sound like on any
mobile device produced in 2017 and for
most people listening to compressed
audio files the signal processing
combined with the louder amp will still
deliver a noticeably improved experience
over the competition
using our Pheo x5 is a high watermark
the V 30 is able to hang with a high
quality dedicated music player in nearly
all measurements with its only
significant loss in amp output
this isn't marketing this is not a
gimmick the V 30 really is a phenomenal
audiophile grade performer we would like
to see LG deliver some of the ear scan
profiling we've enjoyed on HTC and
Samsung phones but the V 30 does include
a new set of filter profiles to tune
impulse characteristics altering how the
phone responds to attack and decay this
is in addition to a general set of EQ
profiles producing subtle shifts in
reproduction I personally prefer the
slow filter especially when there's a
healthy mix of jazz or classical in my
playlist but we're confident that you
should be able to find a good fit for
your ears and for all the noise that
Google has received for including 25
volume steps on the pixel too when using
the high-quality DAC mode the V 30 now
include
seventy-five 75 steps of volume again
not a gimmick considering the raw power
on tap finer gradation means the user
can find exactly the right volume for
the most comfortable listening
experience so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us with the audio on the LGV
30 well the speaker is a bit of a bummer
I can't lie there but my audio listening
has never been more diverse and my combo
of wired and wireless use still
maintains that any phone I personally
buy has to have good support for both
what I'm sound tracking an activity like
working out or listening to podcasts in
the car bluetooth is definitely more
convenient when I want to power my nicer
headphones and I want the highest
fidelity free of the signal dropouts
from Bluetooth cables are the only way
to go we all know the 3.5 milimeter
phono jack will eventually be discarded
on all devices my guess within the next
two years I started the real audio
review here knowing it would not be a
permanent fixture on this channel the
frustration though we don't have a true
standard universally accessible to
replace it
I can't plug ear pods into a MacBook and
Google might make USB see even more
fragmented with their own audio air
quotes standard on the pixel the cynic
in me feels like all of these
certification labels and Bluetooth
peripherals are more a way to drive up
value add on accessory purchases when
the phone is bought then a way to really
improve audio for consumers see audio
doesn't change much over time so how do
companies get consumers to rebuy
products they're already happy with
especially when those products likely
don't have batteries that will
eventually burn out if you're watching
this video chances are already better
than average you've probably invested
money in some nice cans or earbuds some
phones will power nicer audio gear well
but only one phone this year can be the
best the v30 is that phone by a
respectable margin as always thanks so
