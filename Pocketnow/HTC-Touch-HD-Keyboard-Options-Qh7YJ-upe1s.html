pocket now calm and this is a run
through of the on-screen keyboard
options for the HTC touch HD we get a
lot of emails from people asking how the
input is on the touch HD because
obviously it doesn't have the keyboard
so it's really important that the
on-screen keyboard is really good or
actually there are three of them and as
you'll see in a minute there's actually
more than three of them of course
because you have the windows mobile
default keyboards that are built in now
the keyboards that are built into the
touch HD are the same that you'll find
on the HTC touch pro and touch diamond
but because the screen is quite a bit
larger on the touch HD it's even easier
to type with the on-screen keyboards so
let's walk through those now I'm going
to turn on the device and I'm going to
go into word mobile alright so let's
make a new document and I'm going to
start with the t9 style pad because I
think this is actually the easiest to
use its it's the most suited towards
one-handed usability and let me kind of
get it so there's not a glare on the
screen and i'm going to type the quick
brown fox jumped over the dog
and as you can see it's using t9 to
guess what I'm saying is doing a really
good job of course if you practice with
this keyboard if you use it a lot you're
going to become much faster than you
just saw there but this keyboard is the
best for one-handed usability it works
very very well so let's take a look at
the other keyboards here we have this
fade up menu and the next thing we're
going to go to is the compact qwerty
keyboard which is just like a shirt type
keyboard on a blackberry or a tmobile
shadow so this is actually a full qwerty
keyboard although there are two letters
on each key and it's going to guess what
I'm trying to type so let's do this now
and again here it is the accuracy is
dead-on I wish the space bar was bigger
in fact the backspace key is actually
bigger than the space bar which really
doesn't make any sense to me on all of
the keyboards so that is the shirt type
keyboard and let's take a look at the
other HTC keyboard which is the full
QWERTY keyboard kind of looks like an
iphone keyboard in fact it operates
similarly to if you if you drag your
finger along the keyboard it doesn't
register a screen press until you let go
over the key so let's try using this and
as you're going to see this is actually
the most cumbersome keyboard to use of
the three that come from HTC
as you can see it's kind of hard to be
accurate with this although it does do a
pretty good job of trying to guess what
you're trying to say you're kind of
slowed down because you're unsure at
whether you're hitting the right key but
once you become used to this you'll be
able to type a lot faster now let's take
a look at the other windows mobile
keyboards built into this device if we
go to keyboard we have the stylist
keyword that's what people are calling
it because its keys are very small and
you can use your stylist the kids are
spaced close together which means that
you don't have to move your stylist
around too much and then we have the
other input method so we go into block
recognizer transcriber letter recognizer
so transcriber is pretty cool and i did
a video about this a little while ago
and it has an on-screen help and what
you can do is you can write anywhere on
the screen and it will convert your
handwriting to text so hello world and
the conversion is fantastic with
transcriber so there you have it all the
input methods for the for the HTC touch
HD pretty good on-screen keyboards and I
think that if you're getting this device
you're going to get used to the
keyboards very well you're going to even
actually like them a lot maybe even more
than a hardware keyboard because with
the touch HD you have the compact qwerty
and the phone keypad and these things
are excellent for one-handed usability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
