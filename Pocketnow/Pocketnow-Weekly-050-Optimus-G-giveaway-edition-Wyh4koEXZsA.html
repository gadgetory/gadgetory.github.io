referred to as the golden anniversary or
at least that's what my married friends
tell me well we're not quite at fifty
years yet but we think 50 straight
episodes of any podcasts is worth
celebrating and we hope you do too
welcome to episode 050 of the pocket now
weekly the once-a-week podcast from
pocket now where we discuss smartphones
tablets and the state of mobile
technology in 2013 I'm your host Michael
Fisher editorial director at pocket now
and today I'm joined by the two guys who
helped me kick off the pocket now
podcast and who run the show
editor-in-chief branded minimun Brandon
about to be a daddy minimun welcome to
the show good morning yes I had you
forgot to refer to me as the editor and
beef every excuse me yes I'm sorry I
apologize there's going to be a mini
minimum and that the third voice you
heard was managing editor Anton honorary
Englishman Nadia good morning to you
cheers ain't nobody got time for that he
you've been spending some time in London
recently Tony oh yeah are you tired of
the place you're looking forward to
going back I'm always looking forward to
going back to London it's it's an
interesting place I always wonder how I
get back to Romania without being dead
because look left look right look both
ways then you know what screw this i'm
not looking anywhere and then screw it
i'm just not crossing any streets true
plus the jaywalking kills me yeah i was
just gonna say you don't you don't have
me there to walk you through the
american art of jaywalking so people
actually laughed at me when i was
waiting for the light to turn green so
you can spot me from a mile away I'm the
guy that stays here and waits for the
lights turn green yeah Brandon are you
going to are you going to teach your
child how to jaywalk um that's not the
first thing I'm going to teach they in
the American tradition in New York yeah
it's just uh oh it's a thing do you got
it yeah you have to do it and what
usually happens is every time I go to
New York I'm amazed at and curious as to
why people are walking
so fast everyone's walking fast and then
the light turns red and that they they
walk through the light and I'm thinking
well you know if this guy's going first
he gets hit first and I just you know I
just yeah you got him as your car sponge
yeah yes car sponges I didn't know
there's term for that oh yeah I was like
bullets punch except you don't different
we've got one announcement to get
through before we hit the thought thread
and that is that something we alluded to
in the intro this is episode 50 and so
we're doing a giveaway yeah there's a
link in the post at pocket now if you're
listening to this via a stream on
youtube on youtube or itunes or any of
those other brands like they have a
choice I know Oh visit the the podcast
posted pocket now and you will find out
that we are giving away an lg optimus G
a what does it Brendon and gently used
Optimus cheese all right barely used
fairly used yeah this is the if you go
back and listen episode 28 this is the
after mystery brendan thought he was
gonna use as his daily driver yeah yeah
cuz really see how about we make it a
special edition is there a permanent
marker to sign Brendan minimun on it on
the back I wondering about that should
we audit yeah get him a silver pen right
away I don't know no I just ratchet in
with something yeah just get a paper
clip and just I'll put a dollop of blood
on it you know if we're going yeah
pierce your pinky but anyway that it is
a like new phone ran and used it for I
think about what about 45 minutes before
you got bored of it and we really like
it it's been used in a number of pocket
now pieces so with that and improves the
value or not is up to you but the
details on how to enter on the post
basically all you have to do is leave us
a review on iTunes for this podcast yes
it has to be iTunes it can't be anywhere
else just because that's the push we're
doing now and yes haha itunes giveaway
equals android phone we know weird but
all these hills are either at the link
and we are as usual on something of a
time crunch because we all have things
to do but brandon minimun has not one
but two thought threads on this special
day brandon take it away
take it away well the first the first
thing is just a thought iOS 7 beta 2
came out and there's something that I
realized about it in Android and Windows
Phone you get the permanent back button
at the bottom of the phone which is
super convenient especially with big
screen phones because that's a gesture
that's not gesture that's a an action
you use all the time and it's really
convenient to have it right under your
thumb in iOS previous to iOS 7 the back
button takes place in the upper left
corner of most screens third-party apps
first party apps they all have the back
button all the way up there and it's
never been that big of a problem until
the iphone 5 came out where the screens
a little bit taller and then if you
consider Apple maybe one day doing a
bigger screen to iphone which i think is
is a matter of when not if that reach
gets even worse but in iOS 7 Apple built
in a gesture that allows you to swipe
from the left edge of the screen to go
back and it's interesting because it's
in all the first party apps but it's not
in any of the third-party apps obviously
because they haven't been updated but
it's part of the new API for iOS 7 and
I'm just I'm just trying to extrapolate
this out a little bit if you had a
bigger screen died phone you have your
all of your apps updated to take
advantage of this back gesture it really
solves this problem and makes it so
enjoyable to use to go back um and so my
thought here is that this back gesture
was introduced because we are going to
get a larger screen died phone you know
that's a solid possibility I don't I'm
interested to hear what Tony feels about
this but I have always loathed the
placement of the back button in iOS I've
never thought that the upper left hand
the extreme upper left hand corner is
the place for anything aside from a
signal meter I think I think to put a
back button up there was stupid to begin
with yeah it's it's like putting the
browser navigation controls on the top
of the screen on a tablet I'm forcing
you to gorilla arm your way up there
like it's stupid so I then I love
gestures so I think I would very much
enjoy using that Tony what do you think
and I had no idea I stopped
dang apples movements the moment I said
there won't be an ipad mini so no dots
here smart choice but would you would
you like it though would you use a back
Chester I mean more often than a button
or do you prefer you I prefer a back
gesture or or something similar on the
note too even though I know that the no
2 has the back button but it's slicker
you know just swipe you don't have to
move your thumb to the lower part than
then up again yeah well but it's so easy
Turner just pop out the s pen press the
button and draw an arrow I mean isn't
that just so much from so much more
simple if you have a second hand you can
use yeah yeah no I agree i'm sure we'll
have lots of those moments again at
Aoife yeah I'm sure we will and you know
we can't talk about the back gesture
without talking about blackberry 10 and
it's sort of inconsistent use of back
buttons and back gestures speaking of
which I should mention before you get to
your second thoughts or Brennan i'm
gonna be talking to some of the guys at
blackberry today i have an interview
with some of the ux some of the folks
responsible for blackberry tens ux we're
going to talk about the astonishing
tribes so if we're going to talk about a
lot of stuff so it's gonna be fun so
watch for a piece on that tomorrow sorry
to step on you Brandon I did some good
speculation and I think it's a foregone
conclusion will see a larger iphone i am
gonna recklessly speculate unlike my
colleague on that exact the Brandon's
prediction is definitely valid but what
if this is a feature which is introduced
by apple just for the ipad and of course
the iphone inherited
what do you mean so like they targeted
it for the ipad but the IV yeah just
just like the ipad has that the
detection of the eighth in iran the
screen when you hold it towards the
edges and the iphone inherited that
feature then again this feature might be
a ipad related feature so that you don't
have to go up you can swipe and then of
course in this is it's the same version
ID iphone inherited you know I don't
that's a good question I kind of feel
like it started on the iPhone first
because it's just that there is a bit of
a problem with the iphone 5 and it's all
our screen and and on the iPad when you
use a tablet your hands are kind of
usually neutrally positioned on the
sides of the tablet and and I know
Michael thinks it's a gorilla jump or
whatever the heck you said to go to the
address bar at the top which it is yeah
yeah but the girl but that's that's only
if you're in a state of like read only
on your tablet your kind of sitting back
and you know you don't want to lift your
hand too far well yeah it's not just
about lifting it's also about like
obscuring your view of what's on the
screen because you can't you have to do
you have to obscure your your vision to
do anything at the top of the screen I
just don't think any control elements
should be located at the top of a tablet
screen at all you guys before the second
thread just a quick question because I
was in a cave for the past couple of
days did you guys notice that iOS 7 has
had gestures just like Samsung for for
navigating certain aspects of the OS I
think I sell a video this morning about
that like what like yeah what like like
you turn your head to the right to go
back to the home screen or to the left I
don't know which one it is and then in
the opposite direction to select
something what what yeah yeah yeah yeah
look at that look it up on youtube
there's a video I'm not sure who boasted
it but I just realized it's under the
accessibility options are you serious
head gestures to control your iPhone
head gestures this is from VentureBeat
enable users to control their iPhones by
moving their heads left or right married
in the accessibility settings currently
only intended for people who can't
access iPhones on-screen controls sure
sure sure uh fascinating yeah but
they're not calling it out just like
Samsung they're just leaving good that
buried there for for those people who
need that option for accessing their
phones right right right right well I'm
that's that's pretty amazing for whoa
that's ability standpoint whoa cool
assistive touch this might have been an
older engines create new gesture costs
custom gestures Liam allow you to record
gestures that can be activated from
favorites in the menu what okay i'm
gonna make a new gesture it's an up
swipe i'm gonna save it i'm gonna call
it swipe this is weird I've never seen
this before okay now what it can be
activated from favorites in the menu
what menu what favorites what big news
stop the pressure throughout the run
down we're gonna talk about this for the
rest of the thing that's us very well I
got distracted by it that's a Jim Cramer
says that apple's next product is a
clear loser but i'm gonna stream Kramer
says that yeah I'm not gonna quote any
more of that article because it's making
me laugh too much what what is favorites
in the menu to get can anyone help me
understand where favorites are in the
menu what menu I'm not gonna be rocking
an iphone for another few months so i do
not know i have an iphone but i'm
running stock how you guys are lame yeah
and then week anyway what's uh the cash
we shall we shall we jump into the to
the second thought thread ok you ready
ok yes i want to talk about something
personal uh it's potentially out of the
realm of what we talked about here on a
on a weekly basis it's it's it's a
ritual a thing that we all do and we
probably do it at least once a week I
don't like the sound of the if not it's
not if that less often maybe once a
month in some cases if you know the
situation doesn't present itself I am
talking about what we do as geeky people
technology enthusiasts which is take a
trip to the local technology store
whether it's a Best Buy or other
and I want to know when you guys just
for fun you're passing it you're you're
you're you gotta pick something up but
you're you peruse anyway I want to know
what your experience is like like do you
go to the phones first you go to the
tablets first do you go and check on if
the new 4k TV is and how do you
experience a technology store when
there's new stuff i'll pick Tony first
for me it's an interesting thing I don't
do that here and in my city but I always
do that but I'm a brother Michael can
testify to this when we were in Berlin
and Barcelona last year we spent like
hours in a superstore and start it
regardless we start with TVs or CD
players or anything we always end up at
phones and we are comparing prices and
look they got this no we don't have it
that we do so yeah it's always an
experience to see what other markets
head yeah that is always fun right
because it's the same shelves it's the
same kind of decor in the store like all
these stores that saying whether it's a
Saturn in Berlin or a best buy and you
know Boston like it's really really easy
to tell when you're in a big box
electronics retailer but the phones on
the shelves are different it's like oh
wow the achieve s is here this is cool
I've never seen this you know whatever
so yeah I don't know but but Tony you
don't have any in in Terraria yeah we do
but I know them by heart now you just
never go yeah so that's what I was gonna
say you know it used to be so exciting
for me back in 2002 2003 when I was
first getting into mobile technology as
just a hobby to go into a radio shack
and see what new stuff they have a what
do you got it that's new and you know
just check out the first camera phones
hit in the market or whatever but now
that we know everything and not just
working for pocket I like I've ever
since I started reading forums 10 years
ago now that you know what's coming down
the pipe it's so it's it's such a
anti-climactic experience to walk into a
radio shack instantly know that you know
more than the guy behind the counter no
offense to anybody who's working radio
shack now and you know anything you ever
get inexperienced and this is this is
part of it we get a Salesman come up to
you and they and they start to talk to
you about the merits of like a certain
platform in your in your and you're like
you're like actually and sometimes like
what they're saying doesn't make any
sense and and you just want to be like
I'm a professional phone reviewer and
what you're saying is incorrect and you
should be fired yeah it's just so funny
when that happens isn't it and it is and
it happens frequently too i had a yeah
go ahead turn no i was about to say to
you guys because throughout all all
europa right where i went either on
business trips or vacations and where i
visited such such stores nobody just
gives a damn about you and even you have
to wait like 10 or 15 minutes to find
somebody to talk to I said so funny did
they just don't care well it's like the
waiter thing when Tony and I are at and
are all right eating and I'm like you
know loath to to raise my hand or even
your like eye contact is the most I'll
do to get a waiter over cuz you know in
America like snapping for a waiter or
something is really rude but Tony's like
no you really got to flag them down they
don't care about you unless you shoot a
flare off my god they don't want to
bother you right that's that's it yeah
it's so interesting in how that's
different like in the US it's it's
offensive if they don't come over every
five seconds and ask you guys be
offended if he came over and come on man
i'm still chewing yeah it's so funny and
when i was in barcelona i I remember
like meet me and my wife we went to this
tapas restaurant and like we thought the
service was so terrible cuz this guy
just like left us and wouldn't come back
and we were like our sangria pitcher
it's empty what the Ferguson it and like
they're not automatically refilled
what's going on yeah and eventually we
realized you have to like you have to
like poke them or clap or do something
that's would seem derogatory around here
but right yeah no it's amazing and
actually it went bring it back to
electronics retail when I was at next
tell you know I think what there was
some kind of rule it was like if in my
particular store if somebody didn't come
in the door if somebody came in the door
and they weren't created within I don't
know 15 seconds it was a real it was a
real big problem like people needed to
be greeted right away and he needed to
make sure that they knew that you knew
they were there would you know you're
correct you are correct because a small
correction to whatever I said it's valid
unless you go to an apple store and the
apple store regardless if it's in Europe
or in the u.s. it's the same people come
up to
you want to help you give you
information but Apple aside nobody gives
a damn yeah so I it's it's wild stuff I
love going into an apple apple stores
for that reason because is when you go
into a best buy in my case I've never
really been in and and Taylor I wish
Taylor was on the show to discuss his
experience as a best buy employee but
I've almost never been in a situation
where I've had a good time at best buy i
remember I've dealt with really informed
people at least in mobile but that
throws off your perception of the rest
of the store to write because if you're
talking to the guy in the cell phone
section he's trying to tell you that you
know I don't know that that a blackberry
q10 runs Windows Phone like it's okay
well thanks for your help and then you
go to another part of the store and
you're talking to another guy about tvs
and i don't know anything about tvs he
could be telling me anything and it just
shatters my trust in the place and that
doesn't happen in an apple store
generally speaking and generally when
i'm talking to an apple employee they're
like yeah I know my foot I know my stuff
and here's here's some information and
then I'll go and verify that and I'm
like wow no you are correct you are well
trained and your friendly and well what
a great retail experience so yeah thanks
for reminding me about the apple store
tonin cuz radioshack best buy and all
the other ones that are now dead like
Circuit City and staples which I guess
is not doing very well come to us a
compusa come today was awesome because
him cuz that's the only place you could
go and see you like every video card
that has ever been created back in the
day when you know when um there were a
lot of differences between them and they
weren't so cheap now there's still a
micro center is still around but I've no
yen one so maybe maybe I just
surrendered some nerd cred but that's a
really good question we should have it
we should have a day you wish to have
like a video series where we just each
one of us in each of our respective
cities goes into an electronics retailer
and tallies up all of the missteps or
awesome points I mean it's it's so funny
because what's changed is that these
stores used to be for these you know the
the geeks and it's become like a
consumer center right where where there
are middle aged people and older people
coming to get their new phones and
they're they're looking at all of the
different tablets in the
confused and it's just been consumed
Erised and and there's misinformation
and it's just such a it's become such a
funny experience bombs to go back to
what I was saying so I went to my local
best buy recently and I went I went to
the phone section first of course
because you know some of the phones i
haven't played with yet and there
weren't any there at the time so then i
noticed the samsung experience store
which is a new thing the best buy is
doing where it's essentially a copy of
the apple store within best by literally
on the with five feet away from it and
so Samson does not copy yeah it was
what's the word when it's like ironic um
it was ironic because you because here's
a company that basically profited from
copying Apple in the beginning and now
they're doing it again by putting this
this store and they're kind of making
apple look bad because Samsung's got the
cameras they've got tablets and
smartphones and all these these cool
things and it's white it's lots of white
just like the apple store and then
there's a dedicated like guy behind the
counter who inevitably comes up to you
and says hey have you checked out the
new Galaxy Note 8 point out and I you
know I say oh no just looking you know
you got to try to sound disinterested as
possible to get them to go the hell away
from you um yeah it's true no just
looking around thank you and time just
for just just browsing and then and then
yeah so they had the galaxy note 8.0 but
what happens is that most of these
devices aren't connected to Wi-Fi so
it's like you can't even experienced
them over the Internet um yeah oh yeah
that that whole part of that all side of
the experience is broken because like
you pick up a product to use and it's
like oh wow they have it live demos it's
not a cardboard screen it's not a dummy
and then you try and use it in either
the stores Wi-Fi is broken or some
customer has messed up you can go
through the menus man right I know but
right but that's us right I mean I just
think of the plight of the regular
consumer coming in here and being like
how do I work there's somebody you know
and I think the retail experience is
broken in electronics in a lot of ways
and the misinformation that you cite
Brandon goes all the way back to like
training I remember going to the
carrier was sponsoring some training for
third-party salespeople in 2004 or
something like that and I went and I'm
not going to say the carrier because it
was hilarious but it was gsm carrier and
the somebody asked a question because
back then the debate was not so much
like samsung vs apple or you know
whatever but on the carrier side it was
gsm vs cdma and somebody was like why
why should i sell you guys over a cdma
carrier like what's the technical
advantage and this the trainer the
corporate person from from this carrier
from this gsm carrier who was hired to
do this job spend about three minutes
explaining how because cdma uses uses a
staggered frequency hopping approach
bits can fall out what ones and zeros
can fall out of the stream as though it
were some kind of river in the air and
ones and zeros were plumping from it and
a gingy ascend that didn't happen and
then i watched the reaction on this
guy's face who is like oh ok then double
rainbow oh that makes sense oh they just
made another misinformation carrier no
you know what's you know it's also crazy
is the lag at which information is is is
disseminated in a technology store or
even in society in general like what
happens is um a new version of Android
comes out new version of iOS comes out
and we find out about it as it's
happening and it's and our readers find
out about it as it's happening because
they're obsessed with this stuff but
everyone out there in the world are
still talking about the version before
the last version that came out and it's
like it's it's like maddening like um uh
well you know my brother has an iphone 5
and I'm like he tried the iOS 7 what did
he think about it and he and he doesn't
it doesn't like I'm expecting his eyes
to pop out of his head like oh my
goodness a new user experience but he
just he likes looks at me like okay yeah
yeah no it is true there's a there's a
significant disconnect there and it's
the goddess fine i I feel like we could
there's so much there
mine there's so much there in that
experience in that disconnect between
the world that we inhabit every day in
the world that the rest of the planet
enjoys and it's something that we are I
think we r do a pretty good job of
keeping in mind when we're talking to
regular consumers when we're addressing
an audience but man we could have a
whole show about this this was a good
thought thread man good thinking i would
like to have a premium retail store that
I walk into and not just Apple products
but everything and like oh you're going
to take care of me because you only
staff this with knowledgeable people and
you don't try and do everything and
you're not out of it yeah but I die I
yeah it would be nice I don't I don't
know if if this thought thread went as
well as I thought I was I was just in
the best buy the other day and I'm like
gosh I really feel like a kid in a candy
store right now this is this is like a
ritual for me I I go and I see exactly
the same things I um you know I i found
the sony they had a sony 4k TV and like
it was like a 16 year old driving for
the first time i just stood in front of
it like one foot away with my mouth on
the floor just staring at this
incredible because it's so rare to walk
into a technology store and see
something that is so very rare that you
haven't really seen before and you know
we were at CES and we saw the 4k TVs but
to have it like in front of you well you
can actually like stand in front of it
without a crowd behind you it's totally
different and gosh I just I don't I just
want to talk about it anyway let's move
on Hugh talk about no I there's that
element to of that kid in the candy
scores the store thing like when I go
home I can't talk today because this
coffee is so cold it's numbing my mouth
I'm sorry but whenever I go home to you
know rural Long Island New York I'm like
I make an excuse to drag whatever family
member I'm with to the best buy not
because I like best buy but because I
got to get that that technology fix in
some way that I can't get when I'm away
from the office and away from my 14
million loaner phones do you ever try to
take your your girlfriend of the best
buy and she or the technology store and
she's like this is the lamest ever
not my current girlfriend I've
definitely a girl friends were
like all right you you're gonna go
somewhere else and I know you don't care
about this but just leave me alone in my
bath of glowing blue screens and it'll
be great I I wonder what's the yeah
that's and thats the thought thread for
another week what's what's the next
futuristic LED color cuz you know blues
had a good run we've had 10 years of
blue being a futuristic keyboard
backlight let's change let's change it
up so we talk about Android talk about
Android boom google play edition galaxy
s4 and HTC One are up for pre-order how
about that how was out was that a man
Tony yeah I inexplicably feel the same
way I get weight and we've talked about
this enough so we don't have to kind of
like dwell on this I just wanted to note
that they were out and yes we will get
our hands on him at some point but yeah
I agree like the skin is a part of the
experience on either of those devices on
each of those devices and I mean I I
would be much more likely to buy the
galaxy s4 stock edition I wouldn't be I
wouldn't buy either because I would buy
the carrier subsidized version and word
it and now that the source code is out
you can get the exact same rom on your
phone without paying the premium but I
don't like TouchWiz but i do like sense
i think sense adds to the experience
TouchWiz detracts from it at this point
is I have the camera yeah well I wrote a
piece I'm not sure when or which piece
but I think I said the exact same
following thing the HTC one is an HTC
one because of sense and the same way
the s4 is an s4 because of TouchWiz else
they're just they're just felt right and
you know what's interesting about and I
didn't put the link in here is that
they're running what what it's even
supposed to say about this they're
they're not actually running Nexus roms
like the the colonel is coming for the
manufacturer know what's coming to the
manufacturer somebody save me from my
from my wave out there there are a
couple of tweaks because of course HTC
One has Beats Audio and all the camera
tweaks or at least some of them are
included but you know what the
interesting thing is that I just read a
report that the samsung galaxy s4 Google
edition will not get its updates from
google yeah it is it's the it's the
colonel issue here yeah
they run mostly stock Android but
they're doing linux kernel's provided by
the OEMs true that is right Tony that is
why there HTC can fit beats and they're
still without you know that's not a skin
level thing it's a kernel level thing
all this kernel talks and making me want
to bag of popcorn out of it yeah ah
bring it a little jiffy pop sound effect
there yeah but but so so I guess the
question is if you guys were just buying
a phone for you know you need a new
phone um would you pay this premium to
get these versions well before you guys
answer let me just say this it's not a
premium it's a premium for those guys
who are girls who buy their phones on a
contract like most of the u.s. people
here in Europe or in my region or people
like me who always buy phones unlocked
it's not a premium at all so it's
basically buying a 650 dollar galaxy s4
vs a 1 99 99 s4 from AT&amp;amp;T right that's
where you see the premium but else if
you buy them unlock their approximate
let the same ok give or take a couple of
bucks yeah I guess you could look at it
that way and and and the fact that
they're unlocked means that the resale
value is going to be higher yeah well
that's true too and you know that
there's a certain degree of I don't know
there's there's a cachet that these
devices have by being Google Play
devices not quite nexuses but they are
funds that not too long ago we didn't
think we're it existed or we thought
that they were you know they were just
vaporware and now they exist so yeah
that might up the resale value some I
don't know they're out there they're
available for pre-order they're shipping
soon you should get them we have
relationships with the with the
manufacturers closer relationships with
the manufacturers than we do with Google
itself so once the manufacturers get
around to sending out demos we will snag
those I think although what did we think
that although the most of those hands on
scan from google Brendan yeah looks that
way yeah so another thing another
another small thing to consider before
we move on is that these devices are
going to be slightly faster and have
slightly better battery
I send this stuff in the version from
the OEMs but I'm not sure about that
yeah because according to some comments
and according some comments I think
Anand tech found the opposite why that
the galaxy s4 Google Play edition it has
inferior performance that's according to
a comment though that is not you
shouldn't take that as fact that it's
just what I read yeah so we're not sure
about that will check it out what I want
to ask you guys you remember that rumor
that HTC might at one point make the
google edition rom available for stock
HTC One users they're not that I mean
that I mean how would they possibly do
that like have a settings that says
restored a factor like on HTC dev heavy
rom with lots of disclaimers popping up
and making it available for your phone
and then in another section you can
revert I mean they're pretty much there
right you can unlock your phone on HTC
dev and then the source the actual rom
is out there now so I mean I guess
they've indirectly they've indirectly
done it and maybe though the launch a
new page on HTC dev for for instructions
to make it like an official thing i will
definitely flash that for a week and
then probably move back to sense but
from what i'm hearing the new stock
version of HTC sends on the new upcoming
HTC one rom theft and since 5.1 i'm not
sure if it's 5.1 or 5.1 steroids but i'm
hearing that it should be awesome mmm
what is it comes out what do you know
I'll let you know whatever i'll get back
alright alright look there are degrees
of awesome and I just curious if this is
a high degree yeah what do after my
hands on it the awesome after the hands
on let's talk about a brand we haven't
talked much about because we HTC and
Samsung certainly see their their share
of exposure on the Pocket Dow weekly and
I want to talk about motorola for a
second because we've seen a brand tweak
and you get idly yeah you guys know how
amped i get about branding and like it i
it hadn't occurred to me that for over
10 years motor oil has been working with
the same italicized all caps you know
boldface branding which is like we're
gonna hit you in the face with awesome
motorola and hello moto and you know red
and black and just you know nasty mean
cool co
first and now we have this the first
indication that they are going to
acknowledge their their kind of Google
ownership their playfulness yeah it's
weird how do we feel about this what we
have the obviously the link is in the is
in the post as always listeners but this
is a much more modern take on stuff we
have a much more approachable all
lowercase motorola word it's lower case
its sans serifs what yeah and it's got
it and it's underneath it says a google
company but how about that logo so there
are there are several there's one with
the rainbow colors and there's one with
the purple right so the purple one is
the simpler one they've just replaced
the red with purple and it's the usual
motorola batwing thing in the middle but
the other one is is interesting because
it's a grey batwing logo surrounded by a
ring of broken up rainbow colors which
evokes google doesn't this is an
interesting blend of the old and the new
because they kept the the bat wings
which is I think Moe don't you know
motor oil is one of the oldest companies
in the in the tech industry and uh and
and the colors are just it's playful
it's it's like you know this is
different this is more a little bit less
serious I guess yeah we're like I don't
know if less serious is what it is what
it's late certainly less some it is this
bliss bold yeah it oddly it's it's less
corporate even though you know Google's
a massive corporation I'm not sure I'm
sold on the multicolored ring around the
gray batwing thing Tony what do you
think about it mmm do you want me to put
on my European hat or my American pocket
now managing it at your head actually I
would like you to put on your Australian
hat yeah I want your Fez on for this one
mmmhmmm doesn't work that way what is it
would but you keep your European head I
don't want to hear your style opinion I
don't care about Marilla oh sure of
course but no you say you care about
branding for a second what what women on
that what would you mean I don't care
about anything motorola later because
motorola did its best to not be
on the market here in Europe especially
specifically in this region where I am
where I am you guys need to know that
whenever I go to Eva or mwc I can't wait
to get my hands on the last year's model
at the atrix because I don't see that
here so they're not here I haven't seen
them I haven't actually held a model I
thought in my life so I couldn't care
less about motorola now that i put my
other hat on i think that this logo and
this rebranding is is more modest it
means less to me as as as a future
possible owner than the previous one it
does it's because it's not in your face
it's not ballsy it's just it's just a
slight modest logo that we are a
colorful playful company which is owned
by Google now so we don't really have
our own mind yeah you know I I think
that lack of boldness I think you're
right i think that's that's what this
certainly says and obviously that's not
that's the obvious way to go because
right it sounds serif it's not all caps
it's not italicized it's not a big stamp
but I don't know I I appreciate
modernization when it happens and I
think this is certainly a more bold step
than than we've seen with other mergers
before like Michael I think it's not
whether organization I think it's
simplification well I think
simplification is modernization yeah if
you're thinking windows oh yeah so what
about this uh this X phone taking a high
res what is this widescreen high res
shots yeah so bonus edition that yeah
that's the second part of the motorola
news for the day the first phone
presumably the first phone to bear this
new branding is going to be this moto x
and we'll talk about another possibility
for a name in a second but yeah this we
got a leaked sample image from not sure
this came to us from focus on yeah the
source who is picasa and the vias phone
arena oh thank you I thought you said
hey guys not picasa yes so that's where
it came from and it looks like this is a
widescreen raw photo so we've talked
about this a lot on the show I'm dealing
with it right now with the galaxy s4
active
and the galaxy s4 cuz im using them side
by side if you set those phones to full
resolution you are not going to be
cropped to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio you're
going to be at four by three or if
you're on the blackberry q10 I mean your
full resolution you're going to be a one
by one so you're getting square or
nearly square photos which I don't like
as much and I don't know I must be the
only one because I'm the only one who
ever talks about this but I can't stand
that I like my photos to be wide screen
and if you want to take a downsize in
the resolution you can do that you can
crop it but then of course you're losing
some information but the thing is this
leak damage from this motorola from this
moto x presumably from this moto x is a
full 10 megapixel image that is already
in widescreen so that means what the
sensor size is a different shape right
exactly now the sensor size is larger
and this brings me to an article which i
wrote i think last year above the
PureView technology and and the 808
takes either for by free mode pictures
in thirty eight megapixel node or
sixteen by nine pictures in thirty four
megapixel mode so we imagine the sensor
as a circle I'll write a post about it I
can't explain this we need to write
another post whether yeah the main thing
is the key takeaway is that the marula X
the alleged Laura X definitely has at
least a 14 megapixel sensor to be able
to produce 10-megapixel widescreen
images right but the end result will be
a 10 megapixel image right so yes there
will be it probably a point where you
can set four by three aspect ratio in
which case in which case it will
generate larger 13-point something
megapixel images I never want to see
another another four by three photo I'm
just so I don't know what it is do you
guys feel this am I the only one who
feels this way I do you do a branded do
you like widescreen photos or do you
like square photos but it depends what
I'm viewing it on when I'm in Apple mode
I like 4 by 3 because the iPads 4 by 3
and that's where I view the photos I
guess if I'm in a android mode it's it's
okay to have widescreen his most android
tablets are or widescreen you put the
iphone 5 isn't for by three right
it takes pictures in four by three yeah
but then when you're displaying at what
do you do don't yeah bars or something
yeah you do get black bars and it looks
like crap on the iphone but like my
video but taken with a video chat and
portrait just makes my skin crawl yeah
time so so on this but guess there's
there's this guy who tells me that he
cannot stand seeing for my free pictures
the same guy who loves square one by one
pictures are one by one those are on
Instagram it's different no see I put up
with those I've never liked that about
Instagram I put up with it but I don't
know that's an aesthetic thing anyway um
that's the Moto X camera rumor that
wasn't the most confusing conversation
I've ever all right i'll write the
weekend post upwards yeah it sounds good
the name might not be Moto X though this
new motorola phone that we've been
talking about for months and moments or
series of phones might actually be
called the ultra series well true
coultre that's interesting that's the
first time I'm hearing about this of
course I'm out of my cave but the press
release after the the all things D
cumference where where the CEO went on
record and stated it will be available
this summer then it was followed by
press release and the press release
refers to the phone as the Moto X was it
a legit Pratt the press release yeah
coming from Motorola yeah I can find it
too and she's hold on you just yeah suck
well I don't know x.x makes more sense
to me if we're talking about this 10
megapixel camera sample as being legit
because if they're going to use the
camera as a selling point which they
should be x + 10 you know i could see
how that would get along and I'm sure
the marketing people are gonna have a
great time with that ultra ultra seems
like a more generic name to me Ultra is
not a well hold on a second exes is
pretty generic to I don't know maybe
these are tied in there unassuming Ness
you know maybe this will correspond to
the to the new album from DMX hey yeah
maybe it'll be exclusively be available
on the motorola phone like that jay-z
album on samsung devices which is a but
that jay-z thing is brilliant for
samsung by the way
yeah it's a brilliant it's a brilliant
marketing stunt it is it's it's a
marketing stunt is a brilliant I mean it
helps Jeezy and it helps Sam sound I
mean what else could you want and in a
way it kind of benefits the consumer a
little bit although add the consumer of
Samsung products well yeah so if you
download that app can count on any
android phone it doesn't really work it
has to be samsung phone thanks honey GS
3gs 4 and no two i think is out it is
yeah i don't know i don't listen to jay
z so i just i could not care less i
never read any of those pieces and then
when the news went away i was i was
happy jay-z would have a lost teacher
Michael you know I I understand he only
has the nicest things to say about me so
I should probably thank you soo well I
just since you guys do some of the press
release today I can't load the page
actually slowed my post I'd what load my
post instantly you take that back and
you take of you take a more polite
anything they have never heard anyone
minutes out I'm into my wife to load my
head over here and load my post oh
that's one day we'll have a podcast in
either Romanian Hungarian German it's
all in spanish or french and then i'm
gonna laugh my a cottage you guys no no
you didn't actually you phrased it
perfectly it's just I've just never
heard it said so the phones official
name is Moto X as s Purdy the brush
release yes alright so that that might
be the X we might still see a series of
other phones called the ultra series to
replace the somewhat played out droid
brand but we'll have to see what goes on
with that I don't want to spend any more
time on motorola until we have some firm
stuff going on but I was most excited to
see that branding stuff I think it's
nice to see Google finally doing
something with her acquisition other
than 0 uble referring to the droid ultra
yeah why would you think I was referring
to DX I was but then we started talking
about the ultra we did we did we moved
we did that thing where time moved
forward and then we went to the next
topic it was so smooth and I'm still
that still stuck in the past let's move
on my EDD is getting the best of me
galaxynote3 might
arrived with an LCD screen I don't like
it how do you guys feel pause there was
there was your viewer segue you know you
know guys I love else i rephrase i
prefer LCD screens over super Emma let's
at least until Samsung or any Super
AMOLED screen or AMOLED screen
manufacture aside from Nokia makes them
clearly visible in direct sunlight I
don't know man i can't i can't see the
difference when i'm out of the active
and you have very active and I've the s4
yeah and I'm appeared I'll be I'll be
doing it again but I gotta tell you if
the sun's bright enough it's gonna wash
out both of them LCD doesn't matter at
all because it's so glossy on the glass
that it just and and for me the
trade-off isn't worth it i hate firing
up a phone that has an LCD on it and you
know when they have that blacks by the
screen right before the splash screen
when the display just activates and that
back light is shining through those
pixels and it's supposed to be black but
it's that gray I can't stand it I just I
really really like amoled even though
it's not as accurate it'sit's tackier
because of that higher color saturation
I don't mind that unless you have an HTC
One well the slcd the panel on that is
good but even then you power on the one
and you you see it like you just don't
like blacks that aren't really black I
feel like if AMOLED is out there and
we're kind of past the pentile
discussion I think it's the better
technology but you know you like you
like truth Michael know if I like truth
i would like LCDs I like truth in black
I like truth in in black levels on
displays yes you're right then you will
love the screen on the Lumia 925 I think
that that's that's the best AMOLED
screen I have ever seen really no I did
read I didn't read your whole review but
I skimmed it and I watched your video
which I loved but that um the colors are
not to blown out for you no no you can
actually customize the color temperature
the saturation and everything according
to your mates hey that's right yeah
that's awesome but the stock the stock
version works just just well well as
soon as i see it i will i will be
excited about it and speaking of that
display disparity the galaxy s4 active
review will be up
this shortly after this podcast goes up
and you guys listening you got to see
this video um Michael did some really
fun stuff in in the video of the active
um I think he he led his creativity run
wild I think was a very good video you
got oh it's a must see it really is
thank you sir no spoilers yeah just
suffice to say there's a sweet there's a
steamy scene between the s4 active and
myself but yeah we get some slo-mo in
there and we get some a lot of lot of
water action which is to be expected so
check it out the review will go up today
the windows phone category is beckoning
to us gentlemen shall we jump platforms
see let's upgrade cool no that's
actually a Microsoft a quote i wrote it
was this morning about the microsoft
allegedly not allegedly saying that
allegedly twenty-three percent of new
Windows Phone acquisitions were upgrades
from agron yeah so I was going to put
that in in here but I couldn't really
decipher the headline and then something
distracted me as it always does but what
what is the story there Tony there the
sum of they have some metrics claiming
to indicate where people are coming from
we'll be taking surveys a point of sale
or something like I'm not sure exact
lets the that was the opening speech at
the build conference regarding Windows
Phone and according to them forty-two
percent of new windows film device
acquisitions are coming from feature
phones which is understandable and is
normal and there are four billion
feature phones out there so Microsoft
still has a huge market chance here but
the interesting bit was at the end of
the slide saying I quote twenty-three
percent of Windows Phone devices were
bought by users upgrading from android
of course if you upgrade from your side
enough honeycomb bore that's tablet 2.2
to point something that you're not right
yeah exactly but would you upgrade your
s4 for a insert Windows Phone name here
yeah it's not really an upgrade no I
think you can I absolutely I think you
can I mean you know it just depends on
what features are important to you if
you decide if you you can up you can
call anything an upgrade you know if you
upgrade from a
samsung galaxy s4 to like a texas
instruments calculator and a dumb phone
that's tethered to the wall hey if
that's if that's going to make your life
better than that's an upgrade I mean I
you know I think it's a word choice
thing but there's definitely stuff that
Windows Phone can do that that Android
can absolutely yeah and I'm not debating
that I'm just saying that if you have an
Android phone chances are you have all
the Google services installed and using
them and once you switch to Windows
Phone you can say bye-bye yeah well that
that's a big that's something that I of
course can't stand but is that I don't
know is that true can we say that or
just because so many people are buying
android phones android is such a massive
mover in the market that i think that
there are probably swathes of millions
of people who are don't use don't
heavily use google services and probably
a subset of those who don't even know
that Google has anything to do with
Android even now you know I feel like
there's a lot of i'm thinking of people
like my parents friends who buy galaxy s
tues from AT&amp;amp;T at a discounted price and
then put on their msn email on there you
know like that that kind of thing yahoo
mail yeah right exactly or yeah comcast
so I don't know but I think that's
pretty cool i think if that metric is
accurate than twenty three percent of
users jumping from android to Windows
Phone that's that's pretty impressive
twenty-three percent of Windows Phones
bots are not twenty few percent of
Android user base yeah that's what I
meant yeah it's a huge difference yeah
quarter of the Android user base is
going to Windows yeah stop the presses
so that's pretty cool yeah that's not in
the rundown sorry I might try and throw
that and the big news for me was the
will get to device news in a second but
we can't stop talking about the EOS
because as we get closer and closer to
the event more stuff starts to leak out
we might have this I feel like this is
the podcast about name changes so this
is coming to us from from Ewa lakes on
Twitter and it might arrive as a nokia
lumia 950 1020 and that's not even sure
now because is that be the next topic on
the run down my might be the new name
right which is go ahead and say what is
it nokianokia zoom no kids
trademark is under examination now is
that the more recent story Tony that's
you that's the story from from this
morning yes okay so cut so who knows
what they're gonna do now so there was
the EOS then there was the Elvis code
name then there was the 1020 and now we
had the zoom right and I just want the
ring I'm sorry go ahead will zoom makes
a degree of sense to me right because
that's what they're going to be playing
up and they're gonna be talking about
the the optical zoom capabilities and
it's on the invite and oh right right
right right exactly it's the Nokia zoom
event on July eleventh so that makes
more sense to me 10-22 me recalls I
understand the progression from 9 22 10
20 but 10 22 me recalls the days of like
the Nokia 3390 it makes me think of a
nokia dumb phone and i don't think
that's what that's where they want
brains to be going no one's thinking
that except people that know the history
of the company well that's a very good
point I you know I for me 1020 sounds
like a pretty pretty high number and and
it seems like there's something special
there like for me like a 1000 feels like
a really high number like 10-20 to me is
like okay what is that a printer you
know I mean I don't know that the zoom
feels right but there's something fishy
about that nokia is not going to ditch
the lumia brand the Lumia speaks Windows
Phone and and it's not trademarked as
Nokia Lumia zoom with just nakia zoom so
I'm thinking that either they want to
separately blase this product in their
portfolio and address that to a specific
target yeah it runs Windows Phone among
other things but the big thing is zoom
or they will just change the trademark
or change name to nokia lumia zoom yeah
or it's it's it's just a feature you
know it's like the new Lumia 1020 with
Nokia zoom and then there's no key might
be it might be a camera lens racket just
likes the Nokia smart camera nokia zoom
right yeah there's you know when these
questions finally get answered what are
we going to talk about 20 minute podcast
we're going to talk about pop culture
and Paula Deen
yeah and and Kanye's baby north
northwest I like that name I mean III
get it you know when you make a name for
a baby this is a big decision you gotta
think ahead you gotta meet you have a
name yet do you name it uh yes is it is
it public is a public information ah to
see I know it I think I know it too but
I've damn okay then that's enough well
okay I'll tell you it's it's mini so her
name will be many many men that's my
trademark that's perfect that's perfect
well I am looking forward to hearing the
official word so can we talk about this
second device to have boom sound which
is a windows phone this is the last
piece of news on the run down and I am
excited to talk about it please yeah I I
woke up to this and like I did not
expect it to happen and and boom sound
is fascinating to me because it's
something so obvious yet it is huge for
HTC they got to the market first with
this feature that we needed for years
now because of crappy phone audio and
and and the great thing about boom sound
is that now when Samsung mixture comes
out with dual front-facing speakers
everyone's gonna be like at you copied
that from HTC and and so when Samsung
comes out next year with a phone that
has a dual front speakers people will
think HTC was was the originator of that
and and and it's interesting to see how
they're doing boom sound in with
different designs I what's great is that
I feel like this is a taking a page
right out of our fanboy dreams because I
talk I spent a long time when the 8's
was announced talking about how much i
love the 8's design and i wish they
would port that cool dual dual tone
color scheme but this isn't dull tone do
we see other colors usable tone yeah
it's purple with lighter purple neon zoo
is not this is not double tone bro yeah
that's the same cut okay it's
technically don't own yeah i'm talking
about two different colors you know no
that's that's what tennis bull n thing
mmhmm yeah tennis ball well the thanks
boat was pretty cool are they doing only
purple year
during tennis ball while you're looking
at that I'm gonna just first say this
Brandon samsung I think was the first to
come up with the front facing dual
speakers on the other on a tablet and on
their galaxy player so you got a galaxy
player yeah then five dot eight thing
that's a good week on a player all right
get which one galaxy player android
android boring and 5e player whatever
and the main thing i want to say is that
i think i am i the only one who looks at
this render and finds it fishy i'm not
saying that this is not an official
render I mean the HTC One has
symmetrical top and bottom speakers yes
this HTC 8xt has a large speaker on the
top and the smaller one on the bottom of
course the physical dimensions of the
speaker might be the same so that's a
design thing and if you zoom in and look
at the bottom of the phone either the
windows logo or the speaker are not
centered well yeah the windows logos off
to the right a little bit and also also
you might be in a situation where you're
pressing the home button or something or
you're accidentally covering up that
speaker go because it's so close to an
actual button rick is the lower and the
lower speaker is the smaller of the two
you could easily cover that up with the
thumb you know what's interesting is
that on the HTC One the top grill on the
bottom girl for boom sounder are exactly
the same to create this symmetry but the
truth is that the speaker within on the
bottom I don't know about the top only
takes up about half the grill and so the
other half is just for aesthetics and so
so the 8x he kind of looks and feels
weird because it's like why didn't they
just stretch that and make it the same
length as it's awful do I have to
balance it to the right or to the left
is it a stronger on the left right yeah
I agree it creates the mental disconnect
that doesn't it doesn't look very good
certainly isn't as exciting looking as
the one but you know it will see how it
performs we're definitely gonna get a
review unit on this that that looks
exciting it's not the only phone that
sprint is getting they're also going to
be snapping up the the samsung at Eve s
neo also known as matrix also known as
the samsung atif s what
I am a radio so the Neo means so the Neo
means that sprint wanted a more current
name for this phone that's now what the
eight months old or seven months and
that's exactly what the awnings and
different languages it's video means new
right yeah so it the only difference is
that i'm seeing here if I'm getting this
ray because I reviewed the achieve s and
I liked it actually I like to I give it
a higher score than the Lumia 920
because of its expandability and its
utility but the atif s neo really really
looks like an atty vests with nothing
else changed about it except for a
sprint logo and the sprint's LTE bands
and so on we've got two thousand
milliamp hour non removable battery 1
gig of ram microsd and almost 150 bucks
on a contract which i think is too much
no guys when i look at this thing and
you know i like the achieve s and i
played with it and and it took forever
for it to come out to the US I look at
this phone and I think it's one of the
ugliest phones I've ever seen in my life
what do you mean what about you know
come on it's the it's the galaxy s3 man
it I yeah but it did the galaxy s3 has
this nice like roundedness to it but but
this has like these really rounded
square edges and then the the home
button has this like isn't the most
awesome camera battery cover yet that
fake metal is incredible looking and I'd
really forgotten a right knowing it
really is like it sounds like I'm being
facetious but that fake metal is so
incredible to behold with your eyeballs
no no Michael what is the difference
between the word sarcastic and facetious
um one of them has the word base in it
you're a topology lesson you would make
a great English teacher thanks man thank
you I appreciate that maybe that's what
i'll do when i when i get tired of
talking about the etfs neo i I don't
know I feel bad you know what sucks
about this 8xt is that the what are the
coolest parts about boom sound is where
you can use it and I use YouTube all the
time and Windows Phone still doesn't
have an official YouTube app well they
did well it was young they dig in and
got pulled and now they're they're
working on their working on again if you
were crafty
me and you didn't update your YouTube
app which pulled it from the phone you
can still have it so my lumia 920 still
has the awesome YouTube app that
Microsoft made which lets you download
videos and do a bunch of fun stuff so
but you know what really really sucks
about this HTC 8xt what the wvga screen
I mean come on so what we did gloss over
that I'm sorry yeah no oh no did I burst
your bubble Brandon yeah 4.3 inch WVGA
what seats 480 x 800 480 x 800 yeah yeah
I had no idea I want to take back every
good thing I said about this phone so
that so that really sucks because that
means that the from a display
perspective the ax t vas neo is going to
be positioned as the higher-end Windows
Phone it is it's line up right and and
of course it's gonna be more expensive
to buy what 50 bucks or something like
that yeah yeah 50 bucks whereas this the
HTC device with its with boom sound
which is a huge huge value add is going
to be the mid-range player and that's
why oh it makes sense now that's why
this looks like an 8 s because it's
playing the part of the 8's when when
was last time any of us looked at an HTC
8s out of these ports the same on the
front hold on i'm doing a google image
search here right now no no okay so the
8's does not have the lower the lower
port the 8's has just the windows phone
button and there's nothing above it but
that you know the stripe is the same and
the upper grille is the same so they've
basically added a port to lower one and
what's the resolution on the 8's it also
while you search makes a little bit of
sense to me because these are the two
new windows phones on sprint and they
obviously couldn't have had two
flagships so they're having something
for everyone you want a flagship you go
with the samsung phone you want the HD
you want a mid-range okay it's not
really a mid-ranger it's a modestly
spect phone then go with the HTC so they
have a wider poulette of two so yeah
I've confirmed that the 8s does have
wvga display so it's the same panel on
that set C but let's say it's a deal
breaker I mean no wvga it's still but
it's a deal but it's it's a conceptual
problem in 2013 towards the end
we're talking almost standardization of
1080p displays of course when it comes
to Windows Phone at 720p but wvga is so
HTC hd2 nice q has a question and it
shouldn't you can but it shouldn't be
called the 8xt this should be called the
eighth st or something like that anyway
that's what's been throwing me off I'm
sitting here looking at this thing I'm
like wait how am I such an idiot why
didn't I realize this is just an 8 s for
sprint instead of an 8x for sprint
because it's it's not named properly
that's crazy yeah what's your question
Brenner have you guys seen the dell
tablet commercials where they position
it next to an ipad oh that's a dell
tablet you know what I'm talking about
yeah and the Microsoft the other the
total trash talking ones Tony do you not
yeah yeah and you it's great wait till
you hear about it and and there's a
there's a there's a series that's
narrating the whole thing and and it's
saying things like I can't do that so I
cannot do that and and it's it's
maddening because the first feature they
show off that the ipad cannot do but the
dell running windows 8 can do is zoom
out on the home screen and then the Siri
voice says I cannot zoom out on my home
screen and I'm thinking like does anyone
buy a tablet because they can zoom out
on the home screen what does that even
mean yeah like that's it's it's a soft
lead in like Tony they eventually do get
to like more important stuff like
multitasking running two apps Idaho
that's so time for an ant on thanks
article so time for this oh I forgot
about that yeah no I yeah it's it's it's
definitely pretty cool you know add push
whether you agree with it or not I think
you have to give them credit for being
like wow they're just slapping to just
walking right up to them and slap them
in the face using series voice and it's
a perfect reproduction of serious voice
too and that voice exists outside of the
context of Syria forgot who's
responsible for it but yeah actually
download that any mac computer you can
download series voice and you can use
that for dictation and text-to-speech
can you show you can basically narrate
your entire editorial with serious place
and well serious voice has just recently
got an upgrade to to send one natural
in iOS 7 which I like have you used
Syria and I have a7 Brennan I have and I
switched it to the male voice just for
fun I like the male voice better because
I think all voice assistants are female
and so why not switch it up a little and
so it's you know yeah i still find siri
to be limited in its usefulness and it's
so funny because one of the hallmark
features of iOS 7 is that siri now shows
you how your voice fluctuates as you
talk to it because we all wanted that
because that was like we've got a live
wave for him well yeah it's like the the
what to call just like the coolest yeah
it's like they're a google thing the
pulsing heartbeat thing and then Windows
Phone it has that those bars those
dotted bars at the top every time I use
voice can do command and Windows Phone I
want to tear my as I was but I'm looking
forward to that actually because I like
voice voice interface and I'm looking
forward to the inevitable Microsoft
overhaul of Windows Phones voice
interaction because it needs it shall we
move on to listener mail please do great
see oh you know what I'd like to I'd
like to isolate that and use that as a
notification sound that's nice like a
little rattle in my smartphone the noise
Hussein rights in actually almost over a
month ago we went through a bit of a
backlog in our listener mail to kind of
clear it out before the contest
submissions but Moyes says hey pocket
now have been listening for a while and
I've noticed you don't talk very much
about the issues padfone series i've
read tony's review about the phone pad
but i was wondering why it is so that
the pad phones aren't that big of a
topic and why it isn't even mentioned
mmm i talked about the the bad phone
every time I come home from Barcelona
and I'm saying that I'm always leaving
with a wand i'm quoting myself and never
ending up buying it because it's so damn
expensive yeah yeah the price point is a
really big deal but also isn't now Tony
I know you still enjoy the concept of it
and I i I'm about the only one on the
team who loves it no it too loves it yes
I like it though and I was
spected and I think one of my first
editorials ever for pocketnow was
talking about how the concept would have
been great ten years ago but today it's
just with the cloud and all that kind of
stuff it's not really relevant anymore I
don't know I would really like to hear
from people if you want to write in if
you've always wanted to write in to the
podcast and you have Anna Sue's pad that
phone right yeah you having a snooze
padfone and you I want to hear about
your experience with it because really
we see him at trade shows and we turn
did you review one or no no no we didn't
get a review unit and we definitely
didn't buy one yeah another problem with
the path we want to hear from you
listeners iPad phone owners we want to
hear from you Brenda go ahead and
another prophet platform is it's not
it's not released in the US so there's
not many people talking about it here
right that is right to you have price
you have kind of the practicability of
the practicality of the design and then
you have total unavailability in the
country where most of the pocket not
team is located so you know it's not as
dug in the product moises just you know
those factors work together to conspire
to reduce our coverage I'm not hey hey
hey gents yeah I need to drop off any
we've got a couple more listener males
but unfortunately have to go ooh hard
stop minimum six minutes early this is
going to be this is a hard stuff too
hard stuff man yeah man this is like
premature hard stuffs is inception guys
you're getting too personal talking with
all these situations all right man
Brandon great to have you on the show as
always thank you for joining us for
episode 050 all right cheerio good yeah
yeah Tony what do you say you want to

Dowd and who else well Brandon can I
Brendan yeah right they did good there
are windows guys yeah Windows 8 or
Windows 7 or or XP or this kind of the
50 50 yeah in the case of stephen chang
keys do he runs like a linux build or
something right mmhmm yeah yeah but if
he would run windows he would probably
run windows three points 11 for windows
written NT four networks no way what was
that was that for windows or yeah anyway
um so that yeah but this is a sore
subject right Tony because they do you
want to do want to I don't want to bring
