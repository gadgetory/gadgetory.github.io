our initial unboxing video of the sony
ericsson x10 mini give you a very brief
introduction to the custom software and
the custom skin that sony's had to
overlay on the android operating system
on this device in this video we're going
to actually give you a better in-depth
look at that software and kind of show
you what they've done to make it more
manageable for the user to allow you to
kind of navigate through the operating
system and actually use the device
itself so let's go ahead and just jump
right into that one alright and we are
back and I want to take a little time to
kind of give you a tour of the x10 mini
because Sony really has decided to
customize the Android operating system
here by more or less putting their own
skin which is what we see on a lot of
different phones however this skin was
designed with the form factor of this
device in mind now it is android 1.6 as
i have said in the unboxing video
basically what we have here are the four
corners the top corner is going to be
your messaging menu the top right will
be your music the bottom left will be
your phone in your recent call your call
history that sort of thing and the
bottom right are your contacts list now
but however you can do is you can
actually slide this arrow up which will
bring you to your main menu so more or
less from here you can actually go
through and select your different
applications such as your browser your
camera you can as you can see I have
some emails waiting for me right there
we can then also continue to scroll over
to the right or to the left let's say to
also see more of the apps and the icons
themselves now you can install apps on
this device like any other Android phone
as you see there they'll keep going now
if I go into my settings here I will
actually show you the about phone here
so you see here the firmware version is
1.6 and it gives you the build that sort
of thing so once again the x10 mini it
really does have a customized version of
the android OS to really fit this device
if we go back to the home screen i will
show you actually the messaging
application so if we go into here tip up
a new message
typically you pick a recipient we're not
going to do there now we're just going
to actually pick the keyboard slot now
this is where this device is different
from many touchscreen if not all
touchscreen the end of Android devices
that we've seen this far it does not
have a qwerty keyboard as you see here
it uses the old style that we were used
to once upon a time on our flip phones
in fact this phone very much reminds me
of a flip phone it's almost like just
the screen portion of one of the old
style flip phones put into a touchscreen
form but as you see here it does give
you the old style for the texting once
again it is designed with one hand
operation in mind then I have to say to
be very honest the one-handed texting on
this device is very easy you can
actually just use my thumb I won't pick
it up and block the camera I can
actually use my thumb and just pick
letters and it's very simple i mean
granted it's not as fast as a qwerty
keyboard would typically be but it is
very simple to actually you know write
out a quick sentence or a quick text
message here and there when it comes to
writing an email a full-length meanwhile
i would say probably not going to be the
best format because it will take you
quite a while but you know simple
facebook updates twitter updates that
sort of thing i've had no issues
whatsoever now we're going to is going
to go back to our home screen now we
also have the phone dialer icon in the
bottom left which will bring you to your
dial pad so let's go ahead and press
that real quick as you see here we have
the typical dial pad just like any other
phone if i press this other icon here
that will give me my recent call history
but I wouldn't really delve into that
right now but again very simple to use
very clean interface going back to the
home screen the top right we'll have our
music player which honestly is very
impressive it's a very simple music
player but the speaker quality the music
quality is just phenomenal for the size
of this phone I mean it once again I'm
pinching this phone and it's very small
and it really puts out a lot of sound
which I will go over more in depth in my
hardware overview going back to the home
screen we have of course last not least
the contacts list in the bottom right
corner I won't jump into that right now
because that's quite extensive and
shares people's information now as I
previously mentioned you can actually
swipe up here to access the typical grid
menu system however they've also
incorporated widgets which allow you to
actually swipe left and right to access
different screens to see your widgets
real surprise here guys there's this is
actually twenty screens that you can
actually
wipe through now granny you are
typically limited to one widget per
screen but I've actually done 20 pages
before it's told me that I cannot do
anymore as you can see I'm repeating a
lot of them because i do not have 20
different widgets to show you but it
actually will in fact do 20 different
screens here and it's still running
pretty quickly I mean with a few of them
being google latitude and that sort of
thing but i would say it's definitely
not there we go it's not holding the
device back too much at all so i mean in
reality that's going to allow you to
quickly access many of the key apps or
the key widgets you're going to use it
on a daily basis without limitation at
all so in this part one of our software
overview of the sony ericsson xperia x10
mini we've gone ahead and show you the
custom skin that Sony has overlaid on
top of the Android operating system to
allow for easy one-handed operation and
navigation through the small screen as
you can see here in our next video we're
going to go into more depth of the
hardware and then following the hardware
overview we're also going to go into
more depth of some of the applications
on this device itself including a
browser test and looking at some of
these social networking aspects as well
as some of the gaming application so as
always please give us a thumbs up leave
us your comments and stay tuned for more
thanks for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
