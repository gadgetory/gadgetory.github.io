delivering the most feature complete
camera app offered by any smartphone
manufacturer as such there wasn't really
a lot to fix on the v20 new for this
year of course the ultra wide second
camera sensor on the rear of the phone
now walking around the software the
general layout remains the same the
second ticker display at the top of the
phone docks your Auto manual photo and
manual video mode and the left side of
the main viewfinder holds basic options
like your flash and filter settings the
right side has your photo and video
shutter buttons and your shortcut to the
gallery oddly the number of modes in the
ticker display has shrunk from four to
three and now the simple mode is buried
in the settings of the camera an odd
choice is the person who would want to
use a simple mode likely isn't the kind
of person who enjoys digging through
menus the v20 camera hardware continues
to use a 16 megapixel camera sensor but
now the aspect ratio is natively 4 by 3
switching to 16 by 9 drops you down to a
12 megapixel shot and the settings menu
is where we'll find other options like
HDR voice shutter focus tracking and
software stabilization the main photo
mode retains all of the controls we
enjoy on the v10 and g5 the layout is a
bit sharper and more resembles a
standalone camera we won't spend a lot
of time here as it's the manual video
mode which continues to rock our socks
with the standard and wide-angle sensors
you have full control over white balance
shutter speed ISO exposure lock and this
incredible audio control interface mics
can be tuned to focus in front of the
camera behind the camera or balanced and
in figure 8 the user has access to gain
a low-cut filter helps remove bass E or
rumbly sounds in your recordings which
might distract and a limiter will reign
in peaking so sudden increases in volume
won't be painful to listen to also new
for this year is a fantastic focus
peaking option when using manual focus a
tron-like green edge surrounds areas of
your shot which are in focus
it looks pretty sharp like literally
since that's what's in focus when in
manual mode in addition to resolution
you can also adjust the framerate
bitrate and toggle between compressed
audio and loss
less audio capture cinema wide videos at
2560 by 1080 can run at up to 60 frames
per second while UHD is capped at 30
frames per second but that UHD video can
be shot at up to a 64 megabit per second
bitrate which is a crazy high quality
for a phone we're talking large video
files especially when saving high
quality audio
one last nifty thing to note about the V
20 camera systems the front only holds
one camera sensor but is capable of the
same normal view and ultra wide the v10
achieved with two sensors look at all
this room for activities there you have
it folks the best just keeps getting
better the phone is a media monster and
this app absolutely crushes for folks
looking to up their content creation
game will of course be digging deep into
the actual output of this camera in a
future real camera review but these
early impressions are largely positive
the LG v10 was a formidable photo and
video machine and with the V 20 it looks
like we have a proper successor as
