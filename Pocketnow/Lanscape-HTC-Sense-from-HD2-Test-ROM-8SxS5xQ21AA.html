pocket now calm and this is a look at
the Leo test ROM which features HTC
Sense in true landscape this has been
extracted from the t-mobile USA hd2 ROM
it's running Manila version 2.5 build
1922 for those of you keeping track
we're going to go through sort of the
features of this new version of Manila
because it finally offers true landscape
for HTC Sense so one thing of note is
that there's a new program from HTC it's
called voice recorder so if we tap there
we get a nice interface for recording
our voice very simple program so let's
test it hello this is a test get a
little equalizer up there and play it
back very simple and from there you can
share it to email or you can send it
through an mms there goes send via
bluetooth we can go to all recordings
and then we get this sort of HTC Sense
like interface here so just a quick just
a quick look at that let's go back to
the home screen so everything is pretty
much the same and by the way I'm running
this Leo test rum on the touch pro 2
here so I'm going to slide out the
keyboard and you're gonna see sort of
how everything reflows in landscape HTC
sets so all the information goes to the
left side of the screen and let's see if
we can get the weather animation to come
up so let me go into the start menu and
go out of it and it doesn't look like
the weather animation is coming on the
screen again this is a test rom and over
to the right we get the icons that
reflow sort of vertically there so that
everything fits let's go to the right to
the next panel we have favorite people
and again everything reflows nicely for
the landscape screen and there's a look
three by three here and more like to buy
five in the landscape but it looks quite
nice to the right we have text messages
and here is email and everything flows
nicely to the screen you get a wide
screen preview which actually gives you
a better look at your email and you can
flick up and flip down performance of
this is a little bit slow right now but
but you get the feel for it I'm going to
go over to the right and here we have
the the internet tab and again I'm just
swipe
to the right to the left but obviously I
could just move my finger along the
bottom here works the same and the icons
reflow downward like so let's go to the
right and here's the calendar and the
calendar looks quite good in landscape
so we can tap on a day go to agenda view
everything looks nice on the screen we
can go to to the week view which
actually looks kind of strange
especially when you have a lot of
appointments on the screen but it works
quite well in landscape nonetheless
let's go to the right here our stocks so
we can tap on a particular stock and
we've seen this in in landscape anyway
before and swipe to the right then we'll
get pictures and we can flick through
our pictures performance is quite good
to the right we go one more time and
here's the new documents tab which
actually doesn't work too well in in the
landscape view basically what this
documents tab does it creates a sub
interface if you go to all documents and
puts all of the documents under one
place it's very convenient let's open up
the keyboard again to get landscape and
we'll go to the next item which will be
music and we've got a simple way to play
music but what's new about this step we
go into library and I don't have to be
in landscape for this if you go to
artist before if you tapped on a
particular artist and it's loading it
right now if you tapped on 311 it would
go to another panel but in this case
there's a drop down so you stay within
one screen without having to dig deep
into many different screens which i
think is a nice way to clean things up a
bit so let's go back whoops let's see
how weather looks in the reef load
column or the refloat horizontal view so
it looks very nice you get the forecast
here on the right and the the main
conditions over there on the left if we
go to the right this is for Twitter I
haven't logged in yet let me do so ok so
i logged in and it doesn't look like the
twitter peak from HTC has been optimized
for the horizontal display things are
kind of set over to the left there
perhaps that will be will be changed in
future versions of this rom let's go to
the right once more and here we have
footprints which also hasn't really been
optimized for the lands
view over to the right we have settings
and then we are to the end of things but
this this works quite well in the in the
landscape view so that was a look at the
Leo test roms new version of HTC Sense
that's build 1922 it looks like that the
hd2 in that is released on t-mobile USA
may be able to go into landscape when
you're using sense which would make a
lot of sense because most other screens
work in landscape on the hd2 why
shouldn't the main interface of sense so
it works quite well we'll post the link
on pocketnow.com with more information
on how to get this if you want to try it
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
