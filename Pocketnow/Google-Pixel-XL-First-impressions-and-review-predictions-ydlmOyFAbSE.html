have been showing off pixel unboxings
and first impressions but I just got my
pixel XL so while setting it up here are
my early impressions and some
predictions for what we might find in
future reviews but getting the phone out
of the box were well accessorized for
charging cables and I'm happy to see
Google include a USB OTG transfer it
after but the pixel isn't a nexus this
is an expensive consumer focused phone
so it's disappointing when we don't have
headphones in the box and the only time
this phone has felt slow was during the
very first boot this playful animation
is well playful but it lasted long
enough I was worried my unit might have
arrived to do a thankfully I didn't need
to use the adapters I've got plenty of
USB C 2 USB C cables and I can already
say the storage limitations on the pixel
will be an issue for our future coverage
looking at backing up files from the v20
the quantity of footage we need to shoot
for a real camera review exceeded the
built-in storage of the pixel all likely
need to transfer files at least once
while shooting samples here and once we
finish the setup process were dropped
off on a clean and simple home screen so
it's time for a confession I was never a
huge fan of the Nexus I understood why
it was an important line of phones and I
totally got why other people liked them
but the idea of vanilla Android on
vanilla hardware just never did it for
me nothing against the 5x it's a fine
phone but I'm really hoping the pixel
will be a more interesting home for my
project by sim and for no good reason
here's a panning shot which doesn't
really have anything to do with what I'm
talking about now many have already
waxed poetically about the design and we
shouldn't be surprised that HTC made a
nice looking phone which feels nice in
the hand I can't think of a more trite
description for any phone like there's
some company looking to make gadgets
which will slice your hands open when
you hold them but I digress getting back
to the pixel I wasn't particularly
digging the idea of the glass panel and
holding it I'm still not particularly
digging the idea of a glass panel partly
because of this edge on the transition I
know myself well enough to know that
I'll absent-minded
keep rubbing away at this seam until I
get a case for it the satin finish on
this metal is so nice I wish the whole
phone were made out of that an unlike
glass it does a remarkable job of hiding
your fingerprints and I'm usually not
much bothered by forehead and chin
bezels but Google certainly went out of
their way to call attention to them with
a white front face early impressions on
software performance are very
encouraging for the first time in my
tech career
I'm liking stock Android more than some
of my favorite skins swiping up for the
app drawer is a very nice evolutionary
touch we've covered some aspects of
nougat already like improvements to the
notification shade and split screen apps
all very welcomed here and we've seen
some people criticize the Google tab up
here but anytime you add gestures to
software you deal with problems of
conveyance how will people know there's
something to slide over too you don't
need to hit this tab but it tells you in
a zuny kind of way that there's
something over here I'd like to see the
same for long pressing on an app
shortcut as I feel i OS ASSA lacks any
indication for which apps support that
interaction one of the crown jewel
features google assistant gives off a
great first impression this might
actually prompt me to use voice search
and controls more than on any previous
phones we've tested in the past and man
does this software scream I did this
little UI tour while downloading and
updating apps and while the phone was
warm to the touch it never got crazy hot
nor did any of the home screens or
multitasking stutter a single frame even
the iPhone 7 will occasionally hitch on
multitasking this is seriously
impressive for an Android unfortunately
the first listen on headphones
headphones I supplied wasn't
particularly impressive we'll have to
test more but it doesn't seem like
Google opted for any of HTC's audio DNA
here which is definitely a
disappointment and an early prediction
that this camera will be very good
especially at HDR in slow motion video
and I'm happy to see a bit more control
over settings like exposure and white
balance but I'll likely not be declaring
it the best camera of the year it's
pretty easy getting it to show that halo
ring flare and I'll be curious to see
how Google addresses a hardware issue
with a software fix and that's about
where we should leave things off for now
when viewed as the first step in a new
platform for Google there's a lot to
like out-of-the-box you'll go a long way
with us when you champion optimization
performance and support but we are
concerned about the ramifications of
trying to make a soft friendly high-cost
all-rounder in such a competitive phone
market it's not enough to say it'll
outsell any Nexus ever made you don't
need to be a genius to make that
prediction but we're all curious to see
if Google has landed the right
combination of hardware and software to
make serious progress in a saturated
sales environment as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our full pixel
coverage hi may will be going hands-on
with the smaller pixel and we'll have
plenty of comparisons plus real camera
and real audio reviews in the coming
days for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos
Becnel some gadget guy on twitter and
instagram and i will catch you all on
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
