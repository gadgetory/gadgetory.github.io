you feel that particular emotion when
taking it in the branding is confusing
because this selfie centric smartphone
is much better equipped than other
devices bearing the name I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow here in New York
City courtesy of HTC to bring you a
hands-on with the new Desire eye that's
I like eyeball and you don't need to go
far to see where the name comes from a
13 megapixel camera dominates the
phone's front side the same resolution
as the one around back and even sporting
the same dual LED flash
I think someone wrote about this kind of
thing once the specs don't stop at the
selfies though under the hood we're
looking at a Snapdragon 801 with two
gigs of ram and 16 gigs of storage plus
microSD expansion the casing is unibody
polycarbonate poured in HTC's trademark
dual shot molding process which makes
for a very smooth piece of hardware the
phone is ipx7 compliant for water
resistance there's a two-step camera key
here for shutter bugs and if you think
the optics upfront mean the end of boom
sound you can breathe easy the front
firing speakers have been hidden away
but they're still here the software
isn't final on this device so we were
only able to take a short test drive for
this hands-on most of this is typical
HTC Sense with the real additions
confined to the camera HTC has blown up
the concept of dual shot to something
far greater with split capture it really
takes advantage of the full res cameras
on both sides
there's also cropped me in which well
lets you crop your selfie self into the
primary cameras photo which is fun and
ridiculous older features like face
fusion and live makeup have made the cut
as well you can finally use voice
commands to trigger selfies or you can
just stay still for a second and the
camera will automatically snap a shot
finally if you're into video calls the
software can now intelligently keep your
face centered in the frame
there's much more to the HTC Desire eye
but for this quick look we'll just say
that it's a 5.2 inch waterproof
smartphone with dual 13 megapixel
cameras and boom sound and that's a
pretty impressive sounding package to
see whether it lives up to its potential
you'll have to wait for our full review
coming soon don't forget to stop by
pocketnow.com for all the news and
impressions from HTC s double exposure
launch event in New York including a
hands-on with the new HTC read until
next time this has been michael fisher
with pocket now captain two phones on
twitter encouraging you to keep those
selfies classy we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
