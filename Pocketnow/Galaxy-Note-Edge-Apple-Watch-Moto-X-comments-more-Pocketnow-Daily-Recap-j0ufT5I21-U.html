it too sounds so fast forward my dude
WTF and you can always play this video
in slow motion man look how you say your
name and trust me I love it even more
that's right it's that time of the week
I am high metal you betta this is pocket
now and this is our pocket now daily
recap for last week so last Monday I
asked you what would the Apple watch you
need to bring in order for you to feel
okay with paying four hundred dollars
for it as the rumors back then were that
it would cost anything below four
hundred dollars are probably a little
above depending on the variant and we
have 963 comments a lot thank you very
much guys out of which deborah go says
at four hundred dollars it would need to
have sapphire glass at least a 2k
display metal or replacement straps and
at least five day better life and a full
metal body dude you don't have to k on
your TV but then again the rest of the
items here are important and i am just
so sad that even though almost
everything is there there is still
five-day battery life or at least we
doubt it another commoner says four
hunnerd dollars for something that's
supposed to make it easier for you to
manage notifications on your phone LOL
some phones cost less than that the
nexus 5 in the Moto X and you make a
very compelling point here definitely
smart watches have not taken off and it
has a lot to do with the fact that
because of the price tag gets
complicated and then again you would say
yes you would pay that much amount of
money for a timepiece sure but
timepieces looked a lot better than most
of the smart watches in the market right
now good point and I'm Sophie says for
me to buy the I watch it would need to
run Android and yes that's probably one
of the most disappointing things not
that it runs iOS or whatever proprietary
OS has built from Apple the problem is
mainly that it can't run with Android
phones and there are a ton of them that
I'm Tuesday I asked you if the photos of
the lenovo vibe z2 would make you want
to buy a galaxy note 4 and the reason
why is because they were going to
support the same sensor we have 1366
comments out of which busted RC says i
agree with you i love the note 4 but the
camera does leave me frustrated at times
i will be buying the note 4 i am excited
that i will have a much better hardware
and much better camera just hoping they
don't make it look and feel so cheap
agreed with that and I feel that Samsung
did a fabulous job with a note for
obviously we can't wait to review it
then on Reese says TouchWiz make me
swear that
never buy another samsung phone but the
note 4 is really tempting god dude we
agree i hate touch was as well i install
the Google now launcher immediately but
then again you can replace all the
elements and i agree with you touch was
just feels like if it doesn't match with
the note force hardware that medic says
couldn't care less about the camera as
long as it takes these in photos which
all smartphones since the iphone 4 have
it annoys me how most reviewers spend 20
minutes on the subject and the reason
why we spend 20 minutes on the subject
is because it really does matter you're
probably just the not caring about it
and that's fine that's your opinion but
that's really not the case for most
people dude then on Wednesday ask you if
you would prefer the galaxy note for the
galaxy note edge as the company has just
announced these two phones and we were
not expecting the edge we have 634
comments out of which hassan ali says I
like new things Note edge looks new to
me and I agree with that I like it too
and I probably will want to try it and
random gaming says I'm selling
everything I have for the note for even
my soul but I think they'll give you
more money for your kidneys man rahan
says note for no doubt the note edge is
too gimmicky Samsung only released it as
a separate product because they were
scared of taking a leap of faith with
their original note lineup and I agree
with that though uh then again there is
only benefits and having more screen
real estate if you could say it that way
you know those options are actually cool
looking so I do agree with you but it
could be that it wanted to test the
waters with both and not lose on both
and I think I just said the same thing
you did that on Thursday asked you if
you still cared about mobile payments as
back then the rumors were that Apple was
going to invest in that and now we have
Apple pay we have 3 36 comments out of
which says that says if I can't use it
in my country I don't care and that is
my same exact case I can I use it in my
country so honestly I don't care and I
feel that that's really the main reason
why it hasn't taken off back at the time
of credit cards that was the only way
they could take off if more countries
would adopt it and Lawrence says you
won't see me walking around taping my
devices to NFC tags or anything to
purchase things it's kind of
embarrassing true but it is more
embarrassing to look at a person not be
able to find your wallet as most women
do Michael Brown says mobile payments
will boom as soon as Apple and Vincent
I'll bank on that and true apple always
invents things I agree with that but
then again Apple is doing things in a
smarter way than Google did instead of
throwing out a platform out there what
they did was partner with companies and
that's really the best way to start and
finally on Friday I asked you what did
you think about the new Moto X as the
company had just announced it we had our
hands on coverage from Adam dowd at the
Chicago event and we have 516 comments
out of which post says can't decide
between the iphone 6 and the Moto X this
is a very interesting comment as a back
when this comment was posted the iphone
6 was in announced then again it is
really hard the Moto X from the past
from last year was a really compelling
phone and truly the newer one looks even
better so true it could be that a lot of
people will be on the ropes trying to
think between the iphone 6 and the moto
x + 7 says I would have to consider this
but the 32 gigs is not enough especially
for two years the phone looks great but
I'll have to pass on it the first day I
owned it it would have half the storage
off ripped and I agree with that 32 gigs
is probably too little for a lot of
people and the fact that there is no
expandable storage on this phone is just
crazy and finally another commoner says
already have the moto x I don't see
taking a plunge for the new one the
original is awesome a lot of people
still own the Moto X most of the
reviewers at pocket now are crazy about
that phone they love it i've never
actually reviewed it myself or tested
but a lot of people have fallen in love
with its design and the options and the
fluidity of android on it and i'll tell
you this much I really do want to test
the new Moto X especially if the Michael
Fisher can't confirm that that camera is
as good as it should be finally we'll
see about that thats it for our pocket a
