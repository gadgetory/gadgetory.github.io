pocketnow.com if you're like me you
either have just received your Nexus 4
or it's in the mail to you now it's
fabulous it's great it's a wonderful
device so after the first day has passed
and you want to do more fun stuff with
it how do you do that how do you OEM
unlock it and how do you route it let's
go take a look so first and foremost
anything you do from this point forward
you're doing on your own weirdest
claiming any and all liability you're
assuming the risk this could break your
phone it's half the fun next we're gonna
talk about unlocking not carrier
unlocking because phones from Google
come already carrier unlocked or rather
they were never locked at all so you
don't have to unlock something that was
never locked it's just open throw a same
in from t-mobile it works for all of us
I'm in from AT&amp;amp;T it works through Bell
Rogers and Telus orange anybody GSM and
it works the way it should be
so I'll take a hint on this unlocked
phones unlocked phones anyway next we're
gonna talk instead about unlocking the
bootloader just like it sounds it
unlocks the bootloader if you don't know
what the bootloader is luckily we've got
a video for you that talks about that
I'll have a link at the end of this
video to that video so you can get
caught up just in case you don't know
after we've unlocked the bootloader then
we want to load up Super User we want to
root the device so I'll show you how to
do that as well all of this used to be
relatively complicated now it's not
because we've got a really cool toolkit
called the Nexus 4 toolkit you might be
familiar with its cousin the Nexus 7
toolkit same type of thing different
device works great let me show you how
to do it so I fired up the Nexus 4
toolkit it starts up adb sees the Damons
not running so it starts it up yadda
yadda yadda and then it wants to see if
there's an update available
well I've already done that so I'm gonna
type no yes you have to type the word no
we'll hit enter we get a disclaimer some
information written by a mark skipping
way to go home heart this thing's
awesome then it wants me to select my
device version and build now I'm running
the next version up from Jo p40 see I'm
running the D version this will work
just fine so we'll hit won by the way
this is the 4.2 and the next one's 4.2.1
so something like that I might have
gotten those backwards anyway which one
do we have 4.2 we're good
great next now we've got this huge huge
menu first and foremost if you have not
installed drivers you can do that with
step number one it will take care of
that for you but you do want to unplug
your device first you can backup and
restore your device unfortunately you've
got to be rooted to be able to do that
so if you've already got everything
pre-configured kind of out of luck you
can lock or unlock your bootloader so
let's go ahead and hit three now before
you do this this is going to wipe your
device completely totally factory fresh
new no pictures no nothing fresh fresh
fresh okay all you got to do is one
unlock you're good to go
I've already done that to save some time
in this video so there you go I've shown
you how to do it go ahead and do it it's
as easy as that
step two or not step two but option two
is relock so if you are all done and hey
you had your fun you want to go back to
stock you can go back to stock and then
relock the bootloader so it looks just
like it was when it came from the
factory so great
third options what we're gonna do here
because we've already done first option
that takes us back to the main menu from
the main menu what we want to do is come
all the way down here dddd we want to
where is it root and unroot options
number four go into that now you'll
notice number four on the side says
fastboot mode so to get into fastboot
mode we want to hold it down our volume
up/down button together
sometimes that's easier said than done
I'll do it this way so up and down are
held press and hold the power button
wait until it Wiggles and there you go
now we are in fastboot mode we got to
get this in connected up to the computer
so we've got our nice little USB cable
plug that in to the bottom and now we
can continue so we'll put the phone down
come back over here to our menu and in
fastboot mode we can route the device
and install busybox
so number two we want to do that from
here
do we want to install Super User by
chains D D by the way big props to
change D D for an awesome awesome app
unfortunately Super you is better right
now by chain fire so chain fire hey
thanks for picking up where chain Stevie
left off super user or super sue is what
we're gonna go with and it in fact says
this is disabled until it's updated so
select super sue on Android 4.2 so we're
gonna do that super su enter and now it
has a whole bunch of stuff essentially
we have to tell it is our device in
fastboot mode are we ready to go type in
the word yes press ENTER and there we go
it takes a total of like not even a
second but the procedure well restart
here in just a moment it's got this
little timeout now on the phone you
might hear the computer making little BP
sounds the phone has now rebooted out of
fastboot mode and it's booting up into a
normal mode do you look on the computer
back here you can see it's already
detected Nexus 4 storage brought that up
so it's waiting for USB debugging to be
enabled and continuing in 10 seconds so
we'll wait 10 seconds and once that's
done now it's rebooting back into
fastboot mode which of course takes a
few seconds
now we're back in fastboot mode and
we're waiting for the next step to
continue this is actually downloading
the boot dot image that's the insecure
boot image which only took a little bit
of time and then it of course is booting
up from there like in this device the
Nexus 4 boots extremely fast though it
may not feel that way while we're
watching it on video so just know in
real life when you're doing this it's
not gonna seem quite as long as when
you're watching it on the video but
there we are we're back up
it now has a 10-second pause while it
waits to do the next stuff now what it's
doing next it's going to be sending over
some of those fun things so it starts up
a DVD in route which it was already
running enroute pushes the Super User
apk pushes busybox binaries to the
device and stalls them tests it let me
show you down here because the device is
boring right now so it's going through
showing you what you should see yep
that's what it is sending the command to
see what commands are available it's
great and now once that's all done it
has to reboot the device again so if the
device doesn't reboot unplug it and hold
the power button until it does you can
see that mine just did I am unlocked and
it's now booting up so we'll let that
reboot and I'll come back in and show
you that we are in fact rooted so the
best way to check and see if you are in
fact rooted is to go to an Android
terminal emulator anyone will work just
open that guy up wait for it to download
here downloads really super fast on this
device so let's go ahead and I'll launch
this thing if I can remember what it was
called the over here and the t's
terminal emulator from this point we
type in su super user and you notice we
have a dollar sign prompt press ENTER
and it's going to ask for Super User
permissions will grant it and now we
have this hash sign or octothorpe
as our prompt so we are in fact
a superuser we have routed the device go
ahead and exit that and we just exited
Super User by the way and now we're
going to exit the terminal and there we
go
so Nexus 4 all rooted all ready to go
now we can do some fun stuff like come
in here to rum manager which I have
already downloaded and we can flash
clockworkmod recovery with just a tap
which I have already done in stuff so
that's what you need to do before the
next video comes out and we start
talking about some other stuff and fun
custom roms okay for Pocket now showing
off routing unlocking they're having all
kinds of fun with brand new devices like
