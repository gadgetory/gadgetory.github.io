focus technology electronic image
stabilization and bigger pixels google
seems to be ditching the Nexus lineup
for a new Android silver and sams
announces the Galaxy K zoom if there's
anybody interested I'm high memory that
I and with Android silver being rumored
to think about Android gold and platinum
which should we get this is parking out
daily let's begin today with the
official news which actually has more to
do with Samsung the company has just
announced their new Galaxy K zoom and
the leaks were true the design is true
we pretty much get a samsung galaxy s5
mini and specifications that we get the
20 megapixel camera that should provide
some really good quality photos aside
from the typical optical zoom and
everything now it's really interesting
as a it's probably not one of the best
phones out there but the design this
time is not so bulky so let's see what
we get when we review this phone but as
I from that the galaxy s5 is apparently
already rumored as a Google edition
phone to come soon hopefully with a
better camera now it's not about LG s we
got two very interesting rumors first of
all those of you interested in the g
watch apparently it'll retail for 200
euros or two hundred dollars and french
sources say that this thing will
probably be ready for launch in june
which is interesting but those of you
interested in the LG g3 hands up me
included apparently the g3 will be
available for a while to the next two
months which is within this quarter
according to the rumors and apparently
the design is quite compelling stay
tuned for that now let's talk about
apple and more specifically of the i
watch as we had some very interesting
rumors first of all that apparently the
company has started production of the
wearable and it should be ready for
launch in the fall but apparently they
are building it in limited quantities
obviously because they don't know what
to expect from the market but as I from
that it seems that the company is
implementing a new type of technology in
order to be able to fit it into a
smaller i watch as we know that there
are two sizes being rumoured so this
could be very interesting as hey at
least they're innovating with the chip
let's see what else and speaking of
apple let's talk about the iphone 6 is
we got some patents and some rumors
depends include a new technology for
focusing and another
in the case of the rumors include new
technologies like the electronic image
stabilization in order to make this
phone thinner and the camera module
thinner and apparently we are getting
bigger pixels to allow more like the
rumor still point to the fact that we're
getting nake megapixels here so we don't
know what to make of that and finally
for the very interesting and sort of
nostalgic news of the day apparently
google is going to change the whole
Nexus lineup into Android silver and we
don't really know if this means that
google plans to ditch the Nexus line of
all together with Android silver but
rarely the company is going to be
building as many as five different
phones all flagships and different
designs and we still don't know if the
price tag of the Nexus will be retained
as the google edition phones aren't
really affordable but still it seems
that the plan is for Google to change
this obviously there is new leadership
but that is a question of the day what
exactly do you think Google will do with
Android silver because in my particular
case I don't think that the nexus lineup
will die probably this will be the
Affordable lineup and then Android
silver will be the more expensive or the
other way around we never know probably
there will be an Android gold but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is Phil mushy follow us I'm
talking out our comments scripture
youtube channel as well it also follow
me on twitter Jaime underscore Rivera
