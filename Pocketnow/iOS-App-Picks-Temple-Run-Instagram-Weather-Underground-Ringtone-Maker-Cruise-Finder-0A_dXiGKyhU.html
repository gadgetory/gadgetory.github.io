Temple Run is a free game avail on the
App Store's the Optus the game is to run
from these monkeys or what other enemies

other points collecting these other
objects and also to jump over various
things and to turn and we move easily so
longer to collect these and jump over
this crevasse and one charlie'll quickly
and jump over this route okay so here we
go through the game and we continue and
if we're able to get away from the monk

okay so unfortunately I wasn't able to
get through that level but I can always
try again Instagram is a free
application Villa masters allows you to
share your photos to Facebook Twitter
and also through your contact list so
here we can view some of the most
popular photos and if I walk in to share
a photo just by clicking on here and
let's say that I was to take a photo or
something I don't know let's see here we
have a tape measure so I can just also I
can also add some different effects but
like going by down here and let's say I
want to add this effect I can just take
the full of that and save it and now I
can upload it directly to Instagram and
I can share with my friends Weather
Underground is a free application of a
lapse or the ledge to get weather
information from personal weather
stations that people have either in
their schools or in their home so here
it can be the car weather forecast we
can also do an hourly breakdown so if I
give you a map of all the different
weather stations in our area so if I
scroll up ignol City more letter station

information ringtone maker is a light

now that I selected a song I can
position it to any point on the song

the length up to 40 seconds long I can
fade in and out and I can change some of
the advanced features down here so I can
change the speed of the saw to you 1.5
or something like that we can also
change the pitch and we have other
presets we can listen to the song here
and if I like that song I can pause it
and I can save it directly to my iOS
device then in iTunes I can
sign it to either ringtone or text tone
crus binder is a free application ville
master the ledger to find crews is based
upon what kind of travel you'd like to

try a celebrity cruises and we can view
an overview of all the ships we can also
go to calendars and from here we can
select a trip it looks as though there's
