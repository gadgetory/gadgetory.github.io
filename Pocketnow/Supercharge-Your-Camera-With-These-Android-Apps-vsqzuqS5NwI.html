camera I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are a few apps that
will supercharge your Android phones
camera one smartphone feature that is
undergone rapid advancement over the
last two years and continues to greatly
improve with each generation is image
sensing high-end and even mid-range
smartphones are now equipped with much
more efficient and adept sensors optics
and software which directly translates
to better pictures pictures that can and
do rifle many entry-level
point-and-shoot cameras suffice it to
say smartphone cameras are only getting
better but the camera software on our
phones doesn't always complement the
alter capable Hardware may be the
software optimization is poor or some
important features are lacking or
missing altogether
fortunately there are quite a few
third-party apps out there that can
supercharge your phone's camera camera
zoom FX has been around for years and
for the majority of that time it has
been installed on many of the numerous
devices we've used it recently received
a massive huge overhaul and in the
process became much more user-friendly
but the same features that make camera
zoom effects so great are still there
dozens of effects and a host of add-ons
that you can download from the Play
Store
there are various shooting modes such as
burst timer stable shot time-lapse or
collage on the outside can assume FX is
simple to use and quick but for those
who want to break out the filters
effects and other goodies this app is
packed to the brim with different
effects and add-ons camera zoom FX is
$2.99 in the Play Store and the add-ons
are free camera MX is another
application full of various effects when
you open it for the first time it looks
like any other camera application
it has toggles for flash self timer
video recording and zoom it also has an
effects button that reveals dozens of
filters and frames some of the most
notable effects are image order
kaleidoscope little planet and tilt
shift we also took a keen liking to the
vignette retro filter the one thing
worth mentioning about camera MX is that
many of the effects since they are
applied in the viewfinder while you're
still taking the picture caused some
latency and saving images which means
you can't take very rapid or successive
photos you can also apply these effects
after taking the photo and edit various
aspects of the image such as white
balance contrast sharpness saturation
etc all
within the app camera MX is free to
download but only some of the effects
are included an in-app purchase for
$0.99 will unlock all of the features
effects and filters are great from time
to time but sometimes there's a need for
something a little more in-depth maybe a
little more serious especially for those
who miss the feel and control of a DSLR
when they're using their smartphone to
take pictures
that's where camera f v5 comes into play
this application gives the user control
over various settings that are generally
automated on smartphones such as ISO
focus mode and light metering mode it
also incorporates features like
intervalometer in exposure bracketing
which can create some awesome effects if
you know what you're doing camera FB 5
uses the same style interface as found
on many point-and-shoot cameras and
DSLRs and basically it puts a lot of
control at the fingertips of the user
without being too overbearing that said
some of the features like shutter speed
adjustment were pretty disappointing the
maximum output for a long exposure for
our device was 0.7 megapixels and that
number varies from device to device but
the result is still pretty dismal other
than that we really like the extended
control offered by camera Fe 5 it's
available in the Play Store for 395
putting camera is yet another take on
various filters and effects but it
implements the various effects in a fun
and intuitive way
not unlike retro camera when you open
the application tap the camera icon in
the lower left of the display from there
you can choose from different cameras or
effects and different types of film also
known as filters exposure can be
adjusted by tapping on the left edge of
the display which reveals a scroll wheel
for exposure values and there's a
feature for taking self shots that
allows you to tap anywhere on the
display to take a photo there's not much
else to put in camera outside these few
features but it's a fun little app for
taking various photos and best of all
it's entirely free HDR or high dynamic
range in short is a method of making
tricky lighting situations easier to
cope with by taking multiple pictures of
the same shot at different exposure
levels and superimposing those images
the outcome is a more balanced photo
with greater dynamic range between the
darkest and lightest parts of a shot
unfortunately not every camera has HDR
mode built-in but there are a few apps
in the Play Store that offer this
feature one of those is Pro HDR camera
frankly the application interface
far from pretty but it works and it gets
the job done fairly well there are three
modes HDR off auto HDR or manual HDR
there are some other settings such as
output resolution and enabling focus
between each exposure but this apps
primary function is HDR and it delivers
for a fair $1.99 one camera feature that
has become quite popular of late is
burst mode mainly because it allows a
user to take a burst of photos over a
short period of time in hopes of
capturing that perfect shot before the
moment passes and not every camera comes
with burst mode but there are plenty
uplands dedicated to burst mode in the
Play Store fast camera burst by sprite
fish burst mode camera by Wamba tics and
silent burst camera by hand tours all do
pretty much the same thing take
extremely fast pictures simply aim hold
still and press the shutter the result
is a whole heck of a lot of photos in a
very short period one caveat however is
that these photos since they're taken so
quickly are not full resolution all of
these apps output a maximum picture of
1280 by 720 that's the price to pay for
capturing the perfect shot they all come
with free versions though fast burst
camera has a pro version for 399 and
there is an in-app purchase for burst
mode camera for just over a dollar of
course these are only a few of the
hundreds or maybe even thousands of
camera applications for Android so if we
