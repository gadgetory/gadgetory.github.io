multiple verizon devices are getting ice
cream sandwich next week and the HTC One
X smv are closed all the sim more coming
up right now
hello we r 1 i'm jaime with
pocketnow.com and welcome to android
revolution the show we go through what's
hot and what's not inside the world of
google's android project let's talk this
week off what's hot that's right folks
the HTC One X s and B are closer to a
wallet near you and I mean days close
the company has just confirmed that
these devices will be available in the
European market in countries like
Germany Austria and Switzerland as soon
as April second which is Monday now how
about the United States well we've got
tons of leaks of these devices running
on t-mobile we even got sprint calling
it the Evil One and Best Buy recently
leaked the One X being launched
somewhere in mid-may now if we've got
May and June being mentioned you can
most expect these devices to be launched
at ctia now quad-core tablets are
everything we want but what we barely
get by manufacturers except for a sous
and with the recent price range started
by the kindle fire and the drop in price
by the ipad 2 it's only a matter of time
before somebody figures out a way to
compete in the cheap side and an
interesting notice that nvidia see
you'll recently mention that there's
really no reason why OMS can't pack
their Tegra 3 quad-core processors on
tablets that are as cheapest two hundred
dollars and the reason why is because
apparently they're doing their part and
dropping the price in order for them to
be able to provide now let's hope that
doesn't mean that will be getting
plastic screen tablets like what we saw
at mwc or any other terrible hardware
but at least we see that Nvidia is doing
something let's hope that o am picking
up because competition is getting really
fierce and hey recent leaks have verizon
deploying android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
to some of their droids as early as next
week we've been tipped that the HTC
Rezound the droid razr and the droid
razr maxx are all receiving the update
soon now the question is when well this
was part of a best buy leak so it could
be mistaken it could be early next week
could be by the in the next week just
stand by and keep hitting the update
button or just wait for the over-the-air
update to reach you now t-mobile has
also confirmed that there HTC Sensation
4G and they're amaze 4g are all getting
ice cream sandwich the questions went
out of this week's coverage make sure
you catch show Levi's recent video on
how to get the on lap monitor working on
your Android smartphone but pretty much
any other smartphone for that matter
also catches recent video on how to run
android applications on Windows through
a service called BlueStacks App Player
also you can catch his rants and praises
in the android guy weekly show this time
he's talking about bloatware and don't
get me started with that it also catch
Nicky Adams recent video on the HTC
Vivid from AT&amp;amp;T getting Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich and therefore HTC sense
3.6 and what about Samson well Sammy
recently sold 5 million of their
humongous Samsung Galaxy Notes in just
five months they're continuing on with
their galaxy line this time they
recently registered other names to come
up in the future first of all they got
the galaxy grand they've got the galaxy
premier and also the galaxy mechs they
also came up with the idea of putting
their Samsung Galaxy Beam on pre-order
though we suggest you stay away from
that that's happening in the UK and well
Sammy we're just waiting for you to come
up with the Samsung Galaxy free or
something for your next sort of devices
coming up
okay so that does it for what's hot
let's continue on with what's not and
now the news our that Sony is pushing
their updates for android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich on their experian to probably
may they were supposed to bring it out
by the end of March then they came out
with early April now they're talking
about May why don't we just add December
to the list sadly recently the Sony
Xperia S got an update that fixes a lot
of the issues with battery life for all
of you that are out there in the market
to try to get one but aside from that
it's sad to see that Sony hasn't really
figured out how to get updates out of
the table for some reason they come up
with these really good hardware but then
their software doesn't really do the
trick at the same time sadly and that's
it for today's show thank you very much
for watching I'm high metairie better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
