nostalgia and there is one particular
box that i've been highly anticipating
to receive i'm how you met event with
pocket now and this finally is the
blackberry key one so do you remember
that box that I teased on Twitter the
other day yeah this was actually it
BlackBerry has just received the push of
importance but it always deserved that
there's partnership with PCL and ever
since CES at MWC I have been waiting for
the key one like there is no tomorrow
opening the external box were greeted by
some of the weirdest protective paper
that I've ever seen but you can correct
me if I'm wrong in the comments inside
we find the case from to me that
blackberry is sending along with the
phone thank you very much and that
Center we have the box of the BlackBerry
key one cracking it open we have the
goods front and center and we slide that
to the side and below it we have two
usual literature that none of you are
going to read in addition to a sim
ejector tool for the phone below that we
have a few welcome goodies like for
example the pair of earbuds with a
BlackBerry logo that are really hard to
see these days and in addition to a fast
charger and the USBC cable that we are
accustomed to and then the BlackBerry
key one and it's full glory with only
protective plastic at the back which is
kind of weird but which we will
definitely peel off right now
that's what look and feel all I'm going
to say is that this phone is a fancy and
well manufactured tank there is an
insane amount of attention to detail in
its overall design it just feels like
that tool that will help you get work
done it's been a while since I've
handled a full-blown blackberry as the
company's conceived smart phone
communicators should look and feel so
I'm really looking forward to this
breath of fresh air in actually giving
another smartphone design a try for
those of you bored of typical smartphone
form factors or the rest of you that
just became nostalgic at the moment that
we discover that this phone existed
months ago this is probably the best way
to change things up a bit and yes we've
actually had the phone for a couple of
days now so we will be reporting more
over what to expect in our final review
over the next week while that happens
