putting up with large dimensions in a
huge price tag alcatel one touch is here
with a very different approach I'm I'm
gonna leave it up with pocket now here
at MWC 2015 in Barcelona with the
alcatel one touch idol 3 or should I say
with both of them we've known alcatel
one touch for mid-range to entry-level
smartphones over the last few years but
the company is out to make a huge then
to the US smartphone market and they
want to do so with affordable flagship
smartphones the new idol 3 lineup is
actually made of two devices that give
users the option to acquire the same
design and specifications on two
different sizes and price points the
smaller of the two will be priced at
around twenty dollars unlock then sports
a 4.7 inch 720p IPS display a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 410
processor 1 gig of ram 16 gigs of
on-board storage expandable up to 128
gigs via microsd and the option for dual
SIM capabilities with a 2,000 milliamp
hour battery as well the larger of the
two will be priced close to three
hundred dollars unlocked sports a 5.5
inch 1080p IPS display a 1.5 gigahertz
Arctic or Snapdragon 615 processor 2
gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage
expandable to 128 gigs via microsd an
option for 32 gigs of storage and dual
sim capabilities and the 29 10 million
power battery even though the display on
both devices IPS Technicolor help fine
tune the color accuracy of the displays
and blacks are noticeably deeper than
other IPS competitors that we've seen
both devices support a 13 megapixel sony
IMX 214 sensor with two point no
aperture for good low-light performance
0.26 second face image capture and then
in the front facing cameras both devices
support a wide angle 84 degree lens but
the smaller 4.7 inch model has a smaller
5 megapixel sensor compared to the 8
megapixel front-facing camera on the
larger unit now what are the cool
additions to these devices is that even
at their price point both sport dual 1.2
front firing speakers optimized by JBL
with clarified technology and Alcatel
OneTouch bundles some really need
applications to enhance your audio
experience you can even add turntable
scratches to digital music and then
export both devices run Android 5.0
lollipop out of the box with a very
minor skin over it which is great for
the experience but probably one of the
coolest things that we've seen on an
Android smartphone so far is the fact
that since it has dual speakers and dual
microphones you can actually hold the
phone from any side meaning you can flip
the phone completely and take the phone
call from the bottom or take it from the
top on either the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch
models something really really cool
overall alcatel one touch shown is a
bold new approach to flagships with the
idol 3 lineup and trust me we can't wait
to have these devices for our review for
now I'm high a memory that I with pocket
