m9 plus is the flagship phone HDC should
have shipped in the first place but
initially it was only released in China
and that model shipped without Google
Play services sure you can install apps
through other methods like the Amazon
App Store but even apps like snapchat
are broken without support so let's fix
that I'm high on Sur Houston with pocket
now and let's install Google Play
services onto the one m9 plus you'd be
surprised how easy of a fix this is I
sure was anyway in many similar
situations you need a flash a.g apps
package onto your device through the
system recovery which while not too
complicated requires root access luckily
there's a much easier simpler solution
on your m9 plus open up the built-in app
market it may be all in Chinese but it's
still pretty easy to work your way
through it in the search bar up top type
in GMS and then tap the listing with an
icon of an android with google apps at
its stomach hit the green download
button at the bottom of your screen and
then let it do its thing even if you
have a fast internet connection this may
take a little while to download so be
patient about a third of the way through
your download may stop and say something
about an SD card again in Chinese text
that's fine just hit OK and restart your
phone once it boots back up you'll see
the Android is updating window which may
take another minute or two to complete
but once it does well go ahead and take
a look in your app drawer it's time to
pat yourself on the back because Play
Store Gmail and all other various Google
services should now be installed on your
m9 plus there's just one more step to go
if you launch an app that requires
Google Play services it'll more than
likely tell you that it's out of date
easy enough just open up the Play Store
and run a quick update and that's it
your one m9 plus is now fully Google
ready like any other Android phone if
you enjoyed this video give us a thumbs

goodness this one m9 plus came to us
from our wonderful friends at D brand so

again i'm hi out to houston on twitter
and IRL and i'll see you next time
