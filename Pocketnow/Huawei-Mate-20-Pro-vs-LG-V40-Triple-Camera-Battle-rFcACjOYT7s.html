about a couple of triple camera
contenders as one begins to encroach on
territory that the other pioneered this
is baka now and I'm Joshua for Gaara
what's going on everybody welcome to a
comparison between the LGV 40 think you
and the huawei may 20 pro now before we
get started let me reiterate as I always
do with these versus pieces that this is
meant to invite discussion I'm going to
go through my thoughts and experience
with these phones but let us know which
one you might pick between these two and
why in the comment sections down below
also while the full name of the lg
device is indeed LG v 40 think you we're
just gonna go ahead and remove that last
word moving forward in this video both
phones are sleek with Huawei managing to
make it six point four inch screen feel
just a little slimmer by adding curves
to the side the v40 kept a general
convention by having the finger per
meter on the back and it still works as
well as you would expect that is in
contrast to the in display fingerprint
reader found on the May 20 pro which
though suffers from a little bit of
inaccuracy and is arguably slower as a
result it's a cool innovation that we're
sure to see more often but the execution
here keeps it from being a total win of
course an either phone you can just use
facial recognition as a means to unlock
the phone anyway LG keeps their design a
bit more feature heavy by having an
extra button on the side for triggering
Google assistant while Google assistant
is of course available on the mate when
you probe via classic methods what is
nice about the v4 DS button is that by
holding down that button you can speak
to a Google assistant kind of like in a
walkie-talkie fashion Huawei also moved
forward with the smart phone trends by
removing the headphone jack perhaps to
the dismay of some users now I'm getting
used to this with my own truly wireless
earbuds but I will admit that the quad
DAC found on the lg v40 is incredible
for enjoying music also on the sound
front the v40 has the boombox speaker
which makes any surface that it sits on
blast the audio content because of a
bigger resonance chamber
both phones sport notches as a means to
get closer to a full screen experience
LG took it a little bit further in the
branding with the returning second
screen name but for the most part the
notches on both phones operate in
basically the same ways that said
viewing experiences on both phones are
top-notch as the AMOLED display of the
may 20 pro is pretty much matched by the
P OLED LG screen LG is known for making
some pretty great screens after all
media is fun to watch text is nice and
sharp and games benefit from the vivid
colors that both of these screens allow
also both phones have always-on display
is showing off just enough useful
information but LG 1ups Huawei hereby
allowing for further customization both
LG's UI and iam UI look as streamlined
as ever but the sheer amount of things
that you can do and either them might be
a little bit overwhelming to users who
are just looking for simplicity emui is
a bit busier than LG's UI in its
different design elements but there are
also things like knuckle gestures a
magazine lock screen that scrolls
through nice-looking images on a screen
that you might not look at very often
and full screen gestures that completely
do away with the navbar LG's UI has a
similarly large amount of features
including its NOC code gestures that you
can use instead of the passcodes
extensions to the navbar that actually
add buttons context awareness options
and some gaming tools to get the most
out of your playtime not to mention all
of the different applications that both
Huawei and LG baked into their operating
systems that can replace Google or
third-party equivalents your opinions on
the software will differ based upon
which one looks better to you but the
bottom line here is that there's a ton
you can do in either version of Android
it just matters how you want to get it
done the same goes for the different
hardware bits as well both phone support
high-end specifications with the 10
nanometers Snapdragon 845 powering the
LGV 40 and the in-house 7 nanometre
Kirin 980 powering the may 20 pro based
levels of ram start at 6 gigabytes but
the May 20 Perl allows for a higher
capacity at 8 the same goes for onboard
storage as the mates when you Pro can
pack in 256 gigabytes of storage as
compared to the V 40 s 128 throughout
now the smaller 3300 milliamp hour
battery of the LG v 40 just
doesn't match the longevity of the large
forty two hundred million power unit
that Huawei managed to pack in the may
20 pro the v40 does get a full day
without any problems but the Mia 20 pro
can easily get to a day and a half
both have wireless charging as well but
only the May 20 pro has the ability to
do wireless charging output to be fair
this is a neat trick but it's not meant
to charge other phones effectively which
finally gets us to the cameras we wanted
to look at these phones because both
sport three of them on the back and the
LGV 40 actually also puts two on the
front these are a regular and a wide at
8 megapixels and 5 megapixels
respectively the wide angle on the front
is useful for getting more people in the
frame both in photos and videos with
decent enough results compare that to
the more powerful 24 megapixel single
shooter on the front of the meet 20 pro
which thankfully is a bit wide on its
own pictures from the may 20 pearl are a
bit more saturated and are
understandably more detailed when
zooming in because it has a higher
megapixel count where the fun lies of
course is in the back cameras which are
in different orientations the LGV 40
puts all of the lenses in a line a 12
megapixel standard 16 wide-angle and now
12 megapixel optical zoom meanwhile the
mate when you Pro puts them all down in
what I call a stove again with higher
megapixel counts at 40 megapixels for
the standard 24 the wide and 8 for the
optical zoom lens if you're a big user
of zoom lenses in general let us know in
the comments but of course if you know
me you know I am a fan of the wide-angle
lens and both are pretty great in these
phones LG will always be known as a
pioneer of the wide angle but Huawei has
done a great job in bringing their own
spins on it
this particular comparison is an
exercise in trade-offs as there are some
real differences in what features are
offered for example LG continues the V
Series trope of manual video controls
this gives you a lot of freedom over how
you shoot footage you can control focus
manually for example which is great to
do with focus peaking before you hit
record and then for smoothly doing
transitions and focus racks while
recording
unfortunately the wide-angle lens as a
fixed focus in this regard but still you
have all the other options for creative
control when using the wide-angle the
v40 does a decent job in low-light
photography because of its pixel binning
but that's where the Huawei features
start to shine you might not be able to
manually control video with the wide
angle of the main
Perle but you can make a very dramatic
photo from it using the night mode over
all pictures and videos from both of
these phones come out really pleasing
though from a purely spec standpoint the
Leica developed cameras of the may 20
Pro are more powerful pictures from mid
are a bit more saturated while the v40
opts for a softer look with warmer tones
obviously when it comes to which camera
package is better it really depends on
your priorities the v40 allows for
higher bitrate videos through the pro
mode as well as all of that control let
the photo modes of the may 20 pro add a
little more versatility via features
that you can use in any of its lenses
and so there you have it a way for us to
get into a discussion about which of
these phones might be best for you both
of them support a lot of different
cameras and LG is prideful in saying
they have five cameras on their phone
but whether or not that combination is
best for you depends on your needs and
the same goes for the rest of these
phones you won't have any problems
getting a good high-end experience on
the daily with these so we want to know
which one you would pick in the comment
sections down below so I'm gonna call it
on this one thank you so much for
watching and subscribe to pocket now for
further content you can also subscribe
to my channel so you can see what I'm up
to as well as a bonus I did a couple of
vlogs using these phones so you can
really see what the camera quality might
be like on both of these phones via some
content that I made the links are
appearing right now and you can also
find them in the description down below
but until our next videos we're gonna go
in and just call it on this one thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
