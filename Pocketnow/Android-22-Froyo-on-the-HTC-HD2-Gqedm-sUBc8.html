pocketnow.com Froyo for Android isn't
available on most Android devices yet
but that doesn't mean you can't get it
on your HTC hd2 typically a windows
mobile device let's show you how to do
it ok so again just like all of the
other builds of Android on the hd2 you
run this off of your storage card it's
very very easy to do there are no ill
effects and I'll put the link up in the
sidebar on how to download these files
so here the files and in this particular
case we need to run this little utility
in order to get the speaker to work you
just click on it and it runs and then
it's done so I'm going to do Harry XE
and it's gonna enter the Linux
bootloader and within about 30 minutes
we're gonna be looking at Froyo I'll
jump jump ahead in time ok so here we
are an Android 2.2 it knows the carrier
that I am on let me get it to wake up
again so I'm a slide to unlock and here
we are in Froyo which is quite nice we
can jump into settings just to confirm
that we are indeed on Froyo let's go to
a bat phone and there it says Android
2.2 motto is the HTC Desire it's the
desire ROM working off of that and it's
called dark stone HD - Froyo down here
this is the particular build number so
now you know I'll post a link up on
pocketnow.com
and in the description on how to get
this to work but let's bounce around a
little bit and talk about what works so
first of all the phone works you can
actually make calls with this so I'm
gonna make a call out right now and
you're gonna hear that it does work I'm
gonna put on speakerphone so you can
hear it the phone works as you can hear
very nice let's go back we can go into
the application tray which works quite
smoothly so you get that 3d effects
though the camera works so here we go
take a picture of my hand
beautiful and if it works it's pretty
impressive and we can also do pinch to
zoom with the multi-touch support it's
not as smooth as it as a typical Android
device would be but this is pretty
impressive you have to admit for
throw your running on the HTC hd2 so we
can add a variety of widgets we can
change the wallpaper this button here
has again been mapped to the Android
menu system so we can go to wallpaper go
to live wallpaper and you don't really
want to run a live wallpaper on this on
this particular build because it's gonna
slow down the system it's not really
optimized perfectly to take advantage of
all the resources so I'm gonna leave
that there but let's take a look at some
of the widgets that we can add you know
the typical Android stuff we can add
news and weather widget is always cool
to have so little weather and all the
widgets work because it stop tapping
into the Wi-Fi and there we have the
weather widget is working we can tap on
it it goes into the weather application
very very nice ok so let's go back let's
go into the web browser permanent was
using it earlier so there may be a page
already loaded there where it's actually
gonna start from the beginning so it's
loading pocketnow.com ok and here it
comes
loading pocket now calm we can switch
into landscape it does work with the
accelerometer takes a little bit of a
second but there it goes I'm gonna let
it finish loading here we'll jump around
on the page see our performances okay
and it's done and we can you know move
down the page a little bit choppy when
you move down the page but you can do
the pinch-to-zoom ziz to get a little
bit closer to text so very nice pretty
good for web browsing let's go back to
the home screen and by the way you can
actually have landscape home screens
which is cool if you rotate the device
so you don't see that too much on on
android devices but we can use it in
portrait or in landscape ok so let's
jump into some other programs see how
they operate here so of course the
calendar works I mean everything
everything works here it sometimes
becomes a little bit choppy but that's
what you have to expect when using a
port like this so we can jump into the
Twitter application and here's the the
Twitter application for Android so you
can sign in there little birdies
animated down there if you tap and hold
on the home button just like in any
other Froyo device you'll get to eat
recently used programs which is nice so
you can use that to multitask let's
back into the application tray see if
there's anything else that we wanted to
cover here before we jump out of this
video and let's see how YouTube works so
that's a particularly stressful program
to run for device lots of bandwidth
lots of GPU activity so let's see if we
can play any of these videos here so
let's see looks like it's gonna play
we're doing YouTube high quality right
now so yeah it works and it works quite
well looks like the video is pretty
smooth very very good so Froyo working
quite well on the HTC hd2 of course
there are still more improvements to be
made in speed and stability but as it is
now it's quite fast the phone works
Wi-Fi works the internet works all the
programs work you can get into the
market download applications and almost
use it as if you actually had Android
installed on your hd2 and not you're not
just running it through a Linux
bootloader so please give a thumbs up if
you liked the video and be sure to
subscribe to our channel thanks for
watching and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
