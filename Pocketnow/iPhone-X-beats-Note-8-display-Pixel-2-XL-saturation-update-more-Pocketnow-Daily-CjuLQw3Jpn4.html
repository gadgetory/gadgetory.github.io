display than even the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 a software update should be
reaching your Google pixel to excel to
fix the display and get ready to go
active as galaxy's start to expand to
other markets I'm Jaime Rivera and that
sound outside if you can hear it is the
sound of horrible cold rain in New York
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with product expansions
that are extremely affordable in the
case of the amazon firetv the standard
edition
one of the biggest limitations for this
product is literally the fact that it's
not available in all markets but as of
today it has expanded to up to a hundred
countries and it brings us a couple of
advantages if you follow the link in the
description learn more about it
now let's talk about the Google pixel to
excel if you saw our honeymoon phase
video you'll learn that we are not
really fanciful display but my pixel to
excel is currently on a software update
we actually had a video plan for today
and we actually decided to stop it just
to wait for this update and see what it
does for the display because apparently
it'll bring more saturation in addition
to fix the burnin issues so yeah we will
be reporting on that as soon as we learn
more by trying it other official news
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s8
active probably one of my favorite
phones of this year because it looks
like a Galaxy s8 but then with the case
only it's not a case and it's got its
advantages we'll have a review coming
very soon I know that's taken as long
but anyways as of today it's no longer
an exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T you can also get it
in Sprint and t-mobile and the price
tags aren't really that bad you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the exo mark and it's rating
for the iPhone 10 those of you wondering
which is the best camera of the year
when it comes to mobile it continues to
be the Google pixel two second is the
iPhone 10 being rated at 97 and with the
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus way lower and
in between the huawei mate 10 which is
it's understandable I guess we'll have
to prove that in our reviews and
obviously the real camera reviews will
also tell you more about this but yeah
it seems to the Google pixel to excel
continues to be the best and I'm not
going to argue on that one I'll
love that camera and finally the very
hot deuces they have to do with a recent
study conducted on the OLED panels of
both the Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 10
bear in mind both of these panels are
made by Samsung but if you remember the
presentation with the iPhone 10 Phil
Schiller said that this was the first oh
let that was worthy of fitting on an
iPhone because it had true color
accuracy etc etc a couple of other
bullet points well according to this
study the iPhone 10 actually has a
better display and you know I'm just
gonna jump directly to the question of
the day for those of you that have been
able to compare both phones what do you
think do you believe that truly the
iPhone 10 has a better display Wow in my
case that is a tall order
I love the note eights display but hey
our comparison in the next couple of
days will shed more light on that leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
