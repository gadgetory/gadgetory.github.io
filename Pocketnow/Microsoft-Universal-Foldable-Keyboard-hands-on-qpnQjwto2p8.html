pocket now team members a phone or a
tablet maybe maybe even two tablets it
doesn't really matter because the new
Microsoft universal foldable keyboard
has got you covered
I'm Anton denied narrating Michael
Fisher's hands-on at the 2015 MWC in
Barcelona Microsoft already has a
universal keyboard but the universal
foldable keyboard that just got
announced has mobility and portability
in mind it doesn't really matter whether
you're using a Lumia smartphone and a
surface tablet an Android device or an
iOS gadget the Microsoft universal
foldable keyboard works with all three
platforms the design for Windows Android
iPad and iPhone kool outs are there to
testify this product isn't for everybody
if you're a business user that spends
most of his time in the email
application or you're writing long
chunks of text while being mobile like
we do here at pocket now you'll probably
appreciate this at five millimeters
thick the keyboard is lightweight that
Microsoft has envisioned a foldable
design magnets hold a fold of keyboard
in place the keyboard which is broken in
half along the TGB line while you can't
really bucket it unless you have huge
pockets or wearing cargo pants you will
however be able to easily throw it in
your backpack briefcase purse or laptop
bag it features a full sized key set and
while being water repellant not to be
confused with water resistant it's
battery provides up to three months of
usage on a single charge claims
Microsoft that is on standby so we'll
have to test it out and see how long
until it depletes while using it
exclusively but the coolest feature of
the universal foldable keyboard is the
fact that you can pair it simultaneously
via bluetooth with two different devices
switching between them is just a touch
of a button away and there are two
dedicated keys for selecting device
operation if you're the kind of person
that prefers a physical keyboard like
the surface pro 3 type cover the
universal foldable keyboard is something
to look into especially if your usage
implies multiple devices and on
different platforms it will retail for
about ninety nine ninety five u.s.
dollars according to the press release
which is about thirty dollars cheaper
than the type cover for the surface pro
three the price may vary depending on
the region once it becomes generally
