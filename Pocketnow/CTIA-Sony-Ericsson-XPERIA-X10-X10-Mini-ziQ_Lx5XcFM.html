here to talk about the theft but that's
coming up very shortly so what we have
here to start off the x10 so a lot of
talk about this phone you know there's a
first android device using 1.6 right now
and you know everyone has android what
makes it what makes it different other
devices right so what we want hop off
first is the timescape media escapes
I'll take you guys to time to get first
so you know how everybody has everyone
has facebook image that twitter it once
car like you know touch meds come to a
whole time what time skip it allows you
to do is that saves you time by
amalgamating all the all that's
happening in around your life into one
into one nice blind so you guys open it
up you know you can open up and they
take a look so you know if you actually
want to contact person presses and
sweeney button ring here in the corner
but then finding button does that takes
you to the Liao's you to all the
different kind of network that Jeremy it
and so I got my facebook I go up a
Twitter right off everything you've been
doing so I can I didn't you know cool I
guess we can phone call to try to
eliminate it so that's that stuff that's
the that's a quick quick review on the
especially on time scale so you can
actually you know add on at on different
different slates you as well you can
even customize it you know update every
minute you know a couple minutes we can
have it update manually cable so you
definitely can definitely do that so the
next part is is meat escape so how many
times on the photos very cool and come
back to the Infiniti button to you as
well you know how many times you have
photos of whole bunch of people and you
know you want to take up tego like a
couple photos of person you gotta go and
look at what this what this if any
button allows you do is you can actually
press it and what I'll do is I hope
photos but we asked open a photo you can
actually stay here actually wanna see
what a photo of everybody that has his
face so I automatically sums it up gives
you a yuzu a result anything that's on
your phone so face recognition is a big
big thing on the other photographs I'd
so another thing too as well let's say
you guys this is the music right you got
your you got your music going you know I
got people do download videos but I just
take up memory people don't generally I
can do it so so you just leave it this
to track press the FN button again you
have all the phones ipears on remember
car you excited over not on a
neighborhood now well pop all the
youtubers other two as well and if you
wanted to do a quick search just press
web search I will open up a google
browser and I'll actually go through you
know any concerts let's go round
I mean the I think I think that what
which i do is i canno give the user
experience a in elevated experience you
know so that's that's what it is a
little very quick you eyes you see
anything that that is terrible who will
do it really so that is the X as the x10
next one the flop device part of arafat
five family is the x10 mini a lot of
people look those phones like this phone
looks like a you know a you know a
younger version of the x10 you can say
that but so very powerful you lucky
Ashley human curvature just the same as
the same as the x10 you can see how how
how how nicely shaped is your hand this
is focus of one hand advise you have a
yet four corners here there's four
quarters allows you to do is that you
can actually customize it in the way you
want so you can actually you know I got
my corp email id ong bak things are
important to me so I love he's going to
say like in this phone looks very small
but you actually look at look at the the
UI of it very easy to use so I think I
got you guys might my head you guys on
the newsfeed here so very easy very easy
do you can actually adds much too much
as you want over here and
I think a lot of use going to wonder is
like so how am I type in the same right
so give you guys an example why
so everyone here is very similar to nine
great they do
just excuse the seams Snapdragon
processor as you know which might know
it really does it I don't have big
believe it's a 600 megahertz see that I
got double check on that I know it
doesn't have this a step that guy but I
mean for the operation for it does more
than fast enough so you can see how easy
to type right so another nothing cool
about this to you as well I think with
the 5 megapixel camera you having a bath
very very capable taking taking high
quality pitches I'll show you so I'll
give you an example here to pitch in my
boss so I turn off the faucet but you
actually look how easy is actually just
zoom in again you know talking about the
one hand feature so very cool so I mean
I think users right now going to say
like you know that it's a true one
handed by itself so that's the that's
the short for the x10 mini they also x10
mini pro which you're quite a catch it
up but following keyboard for the person
who I should do you want to tax a lot
right and that's what you have the x10
and the x10 mini pro the mini and the
mini pro you do they have the
the widgets like the yeah well that's
that's that's a very good question the
the XM in specific we had only the time
you skip panty boy so used to do
everything just like the FN however
original media scale but it it has a
very capable media player to as well
like you mean if you want to look at how
the video looks
breadcrumbs can actually use it you know
I'm in very beautiful there you go so
that's so that's the that's the next 10
x10 mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
