pocketnow.com Netflix is a finally
available for Android let's take a look
at how it works so now if you go to the
network the Android Market and try to
look for Netflix you're probably not
going to find it because it's only
available on these five devices so we've
got the incredible Nexus One
Nexus S Evo 4G and g2 but hey of course
if you get the apk which is floating out
there we'll put a link in the
description you can download it and get
it working on your favorite phone in
this case we've got it working on the
Galaxy S 2 now the reason that they
don't let every phone have it is
obviously for performance reasons they
want to make sure that your phone is
fast enough to get a good Netflix
Netflix experience but of course if
you've got a phone like the Galaxy S 2
with two cores and a gig of ram you'll
be fine so we're going to go into
Netflix here and we've got a variety of
top picks for the week on the Left panel
the resolution doesn't seem very well
optimized if we move in closely you can
see that these tabs are actually a
little bit fuzzy as if this application
was optimized for VGA screens and not W
VGA which is of course the standard for
most Android devices we have another tab
up here which is genre we can flip
through the different categories we can
of course search for or whatever and
over here on the queue it will load your
queue the movies that you've got lined
up to be received at home in the mail
now the great thing about Netflix these
days is you can pay eight bucks a month
and have unlimited Digital streaming you
don't have to get the physical media
delivered to your house if you don't
like the idea of you know sending DVDs
in the mail so it's a really good option
for those that just want a really good
streaming solution with a good amount of
amount of content and with there are no
settings here so let's search for a TV
show let's search for the office by the
way the interface is definitely a little
bit slow this is totally a first
generation release here even on the
galaxy s2 one of the fastest devices on
the planet right now it's not perfect so
we're hit play and see what the quality
is like what you're going to notice is
that the quality is good to start off it
gets a little bit pixelated and then as
it buffer
through it improves so right now I'm
assuming on the screen you can see that
it's really blocky right we're over
Wi-Fi right now if you count to about
five it will get better and better and
better to the point where cameras having
trouble photos later it's very clear
right so that's very good let's check
out a movie so I'll go to genres over
here we'll just find a comedy real quick
that we can stream test the quality of a
kind of bigger file there and let's go
to something good here Austin Powers who
doesn't like Austin Powers so who will
click play it's loading the movie and
let's see how the quality is of this so
here it comes and let's see we get best
forward actually see how well that does
ok so right now we're starting to watch
Austin Powers remember cameras having
trouble folks I'm sorry about that and
as with the last piece it starts off a
little bit pixelated a little bit choppy
and then clears up really quickly now of
course your results will vary depending
on device and weather over Wi-Fi or 3G
or 4G we were over Wi-Fi and performance
was quite good so it probably is
definitely watchable on a 3G just like
you can expect on the iPhone app and the
Windows Phone 7 app again this is only
available for certain devices we'll give
you a link so you can download it to any
phone all you need is the apk and you
need a login and a password for your
Netflix account and boom you can stream
content if you liked this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
