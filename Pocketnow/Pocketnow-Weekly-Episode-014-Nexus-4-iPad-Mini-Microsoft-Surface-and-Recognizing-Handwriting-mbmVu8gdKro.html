weekly hello and welcome to episode 01
four of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's hot and what's
cool in the world of mobile technology
smartphones tablets phablets everything
in between I'm your host Michael Fisher
senior editor at pocket now I'm joined
as usual by our editor-in-chief Brandon
minimum good morning to you sir hello
and Anton Dena gia is off today we are
joined by once again special guests
recurring guest extraordinaire Jolie by
the android guy good morning to you good
morning I am very excited to get started
here right up front guys we do want to
tell you even though we might lose a
couple of year we're not gonna be able
to listener mail today we're on a tight
schedule this morning because we're all
very very very busy guys but so we're
gonna jump right in a news we are going
to get to listener mail next week I do
apologize for that and before we jump
right into the news want to give Brandon
minimun his customary corner shorter
though it may be Brandon can it be a
rounded corner where does it have to be
like a yeah it can be an arrow niggas
rounded corner you can do whatever you
like sir as long as it's not a skwerkel
we're fine yeah no rhombuses in here wow
that's about my favorite flavor well
last last week we were talking about
bridging analog and digital in terms of
handwriting recognition with the note 2
and Michael I know you want to talk a
little bit about about this in a minute
but maybe maybe this can kick it off we
were talking about two ways to to bridge
analog and digital to have that sort of
handwriting experience in a digital
format one of the ways we talked about
Tony came up with a really cool idea
where the device would learn your
handwriting and thus drastically improve
its ability to convert it to digital
because right now it's it's not that
good and and the other thing that we
came up with was have a screen texture
change so that it felt more like high
friction paper because right
I'll sliding a stylist across the the
screen of a galaxy note 2 is like ice
skating it just doesn't it just doesn't
feel that that good but then there's a
third thing that I thought about and I
I'm curious to what you guys think about
this one of the things that you kind of
can't replicate on a mobile device is
the fact that when you write something
down whether it's on a whiteboard or a
piece of paper it's always there meaning
you don't have to turn a screen on and
it's really frustrating because if
you're using your note 2 for a to-do
list you have to keep turning your
screen on you're not going to leave it
on all the time or else your battery
will be dead in like two hours so we've
talked about this for years these hybrid
screens that have the ability to do LCD
and e ink but I would that that would be
awesome if you could just flip a switch
on the back of the phone or something
and there's your to-do list that you've
written out in an e-ink so that you
don't have to keep turning on and off
your phone that is fascinating it I have
not seen the hybrid I ink and LCD
display I hate that LCD display ATM
machine but I've not seen those hybrid
displays but it brought to mind like
maybe something a Chinese manufacturer
might do like one of the smaller guys
like to kind of rip off this interesting
idea where they can't do one of those
hybrid displays so they do like an LCD
on the front and then you put the phone
over and on the back it's an e ink it's
a touch-sensitive inked panel um gee Joe
doesn't this like connect with what you
wanted to Joe Levi was was incensed
ladies and gentlemen last week when we
discussed hand ready recognition without
him so Joe would what is the what do you
feel about this well let me throw in a
couple couple thoughts on what Brandon
was saying I mean uh first off yeah you
know if I'm if I'm taking notes on on a
device whether it's a tablet whether
it's a smartphone and I've got to hit
the power button and then unlock it and
then navigate to my app and what was I
doing I've forgotten now so that to-do
list doesn't do me any good which might
explain why i've got my to-do list on a
blue sticky pad sitting on my desk um
primitive primitive yeah so i think
we've got a while to go there the whole
e-ink concept with a hybrid I'd like to
see that
I think we have people complaining about
pentile displays and now we're going to
overlay something with an e ink that has
to be completely transparent and not
hurt our our existing display that's the
color saturation that the resolution I
think it's very very ambitious to say
the least not say I wouldn't want
something like that but wow that would
be fabulous but the the thought that
came to my mind is it may not be the the
pure hybrid that Brandon was talking
about but we've got these these awesome
new pens now these stylee why not make
the devices go into a sleep which we
know our device isn't off when it's
sleeping and when the pen gets close to
the screen have it automatically open up
and take you to your preferred ink
recognizing app so it's not always on
but next best acting so you're basically
taking the idea taking what what is true
right now which is you remove the
stylist from the dock and usually the
device knows it and just taking it one
extra step you're making the s pen or
the stylus even more intelligent or the
device rather so right you don't
necessarily have to bring up an app list
like like you do with the stylus well
doc but if the device is off and you
approach it with the pen but you know it
doesn't take a computer scientist to
realize you're probably gonna want to do
something with the pen on your tablet or
on your phablet 40 you can go a few
steps back and put an accelerometer in
the stylist so that as soon as you pick
it up if it's if it's not inserted into
the device oh yeah yeah yeah if they if
those packages become small enough that
would be a they'll be amazingly cool I i
I've got a pen sitting around here we
just I just did a little sea pen video
yesterday and compared it to the s pen
and I also have this this other samsung
bluetooth pen sitting around which is
huge and i think you know it has it has
a phone receiver in it you know you can
easily yeah that that big hole thing it
was a yeah and it got me thinking about
how much you how much how many sensors
we could pack in and how many features
we could pack
into a stylus but this other one that
this one that i'm talking about is just
so well it's thick and it's heavy and
it's not very fun to carry around and
you could never put it in a device so i
think until we get to a point where we
can miniaturize one of the stuff we're
kind of in the midst of a pipe dream
here well when we get to that point how
about using that accelerometer that
proximity sensor to not only unlock the
device without touching the device or
rather turn it on but also unlock it so
you could literally scribble a gesture
in the air or flip the pen in a certain
way to to unlock your device so you can
bypass everything all in one that would
be awesome you could also have you know
your friend have a similar stylus if
you're both carrying the same phone and
you could have virtual lightsaber
battles if you got like you know a
sightless with enough with an
accelerometer energy I row in there that
would be great I I never have a problem
with the lock screen because on Android
I always turn it off thanks to ice cream
sandwich and above you can do that Joe
what unless you're using pin unlock or
some other security measure why do you
have a lock screen I have faced on lock
because I have a day job where people
love to go in and mess with your device
uh yeah and I have kids who love to go
in and mess with your device so
literally every single Android we have
in the entire house has some form of pin
or face unlock to to keep people from
messing with it do you really do face
unlock on a daily basis like I tried to
do that for the first two days I had the
Galaxy Nexus and I was like okay this is
I'm tired of holding my phone up so it
can see my face at the right angle and
you know yeah the the first round of
face unlock was an interesting concept
it was fun it was novel that lasted a
day and then I went back to to my
pattern unlock when they improved it and
I forget what it was it's early in the
morning here so that you could go in and
improve face unlock by taking multiple
screen captures if you will of your face
and they also added the liveliness check
which I still haven't gotten to work a
single time but at that point it became
useful and it became something that I
have on my Nexus 7 I have on my galaxy
nexus
works great for me maybe I'll have to go
back and give them another give that
another go I haven't tried it since I
first snapped up the Galaxy Nexus and is
that faster though than pin unlocker
pattern unlock can't be uh it can be
what it can be nah you just pick it up
and you look at your device and by the
time you're looking at your device it's
already unlocked and you're good to go
if it doesn't recognize you right away
yeah you know pattern unlock is
significantly faster I'm Joe the more
you do the improvements the faster it
gets I know you're you're a fellow guy
who as a who has an ample allotment of
hair and like when you when you when you
wake up in the morning and that's in a
different shape you know when that's all
like goofed up and whatever like did you
ever have any trouble with your phone
recognizing you because I imagined I
have not tried to fool my phone in that
regard but my air gets pretty wild when
I wake up no I've never had the problem
with hair however when I wake up in the
morning my face is not pretty right
those who've seen my video know that my
face isn't pretty to begin with but I
look different when I wake up so it has
a hard time recognizing me until I added
a an extra hey i just woke up face to my
my screen through my face recognition
face recognition right yeah so i added
that announced on a problem i just
thought of a fantastic joke to play on
someone who uses and relies on face
unlock i know there's a secondary way to
unlock your device but let's say you've
a friend was a ton of hair and while
they were sleeping you'd shave their
head and when they wake up they cannot
unlock their phone yes it's okay big
tangent here everybody remembers the
x-files right oh yeah and then you had
the the funky guys that the lone gunman
that Mulder liked visiting every once in
a while hated them yeah well remember
the writers strike and we lost x-files
for forever they came out with a
spin-off series called the lone gunman
and one of the very last episodes of
that series was them defeating a facial
recognition system by painting their
faces blue and putting like little
orange sticky notes on their little
orange stickers the round one's over
their faces looks and capture stickers
yeah yeah because you're just matching
the points so if you blank out the face
with you know all blue like a blue
screen and then put those dots on there
oh no feat the the face recognition I
actually want to do I didn't know where
you were going when you started talking
lone gunman I gotta do it like a really
irritated place not with you Joe just
really don't like the lone gunman but uh
no but that sounds that's that would be
an amazing little video to whip up like
you know trying to fool Google's facial
recognition I'm sure somebody's already
done it but if we get into a slow week
in the next couple weeks I might like to
try that yes look at all the news coming
down the pike and yeah talk about
there's not gonna be a slow week and
four months speak so we want to segue
into it i do want to jump in the news
but before i do just a real quick
announcement re announcement really we
are listeners in week two of our nexus 7
giveaway meaning we still have to nexus
7 devices left to give away with our
friends at amzer helping us out with
that this is a combined give away with
them read the entry reach scuze me read
the the post it is called nexus 7
giveaway week to let it begin and all
the rules are there it's not hard and
don't let anybody tell you it is hard
and we are just having a ball giving
away these things for free so please
please enter and and have fun with that
and speaking of speaking of not that Joe
Joe it before we keep jumping in the
news here what what what did we have
right before we wanted to leap into
Android I know you wanted to talk a
little more about yeah so I was incensed
uh Tony and you guys talked about
handwriting recognition without me
through enough which you can never ever
do again very insensitive so we do
apologize well the thing that got me
into it was Tony brought up something
that I had forgotten about and that's
back in the windows ce e days we had and
probably even a little before that we
had apps we call them programs back then
that you could install and literally
write down your own letters on on your
device's screen and create your own true
type font in the days prior to that
people were perfecting that technology
by four
they would send you a sheet of paper
that you could then do the same thing
with an actual real pen and fill in the
blanks capital a lowercase a capital B
lowercase B all the way through the
alphabet you send that off to them and
in return you get back a disk with a
true but I plot of your handwriting and
I never could quite understand how that
would be useful because my handwriting
is terrible that's why I have a computer
but it was cool you know you could type
on your keyboard and turn it into
handwritten text and make those letters
that you were sending people look
personal because look I actually wrote
it for you didn't work what you didn't
but it looked kind of funky because
you're not you don't just have 1a or 1b
that you write it depends on what comes
before it in after it so it varies quite
a bit but the point and this is what got
me so enraged say i went from incense to
enraged how um careful careful no you
got a hollow points over there Joe did
you notice i misspelled that hol oh it's
android has the hollow anyway so tony
was going at this saying you know we can
train it and have it learn our
handwriting so that when we write it's
writing and recognizing and converting
into our font just right there at least
that was the concept that I thought he
was trying to get across which is
completely the opposite of what we want
to be doing so taking a step back to
Newton and I was a really really big
Newton guy in the day I own three of
them a message Isaac Newton's oh this is
back in the day of gil amelio an apple
when Apple was Apple and then they spun
off Newton to be their own company
Newton had it down they had shaped
recognition in notes you could write a
triangle it would convert it into a
triangle a square align a circle a
street intersection it it would do all
of that for you Samsung is trying to do
that and they have a long way to go
before they catch up with Newton which
is sad because Newton was so long ago
wow I didn't know that the gestures
Newton had real world gestures if you
didn't like something you
it out and poof there was a cloud
animation and a sound and it was gone it
it was very simple it was very intuitive
and it was just like you do it on paper
you just scrub it out and it's deleted
Newton also had training exercises you
had not really games but you could go
through and write sentences and it would
start to learn your handwriting
recognition which was ultimately its
downfall you had to do that with the
early message pads so that it could
recognize your text and convert on the
fly as you were writing the later
versions the message pad 2020 100 it was
fast enough the processor in that was
fast enough that you didn't have to do
that and we're talking what 200
megahertz processors back then but it
was fast enough that you didn't have to
do that we shouldn't have a problem with
it today come on quad-core 1.5 s so
segue over to to Microsoft I also had a
tablet pc that i use all through college
the reason for that is I was taking
mathematics I was taking statistics I
was taking all of these things economics
where I had to write equations and where
I had to I had to graph things and write
charts and and do all the stuff and I
couldn't do that on a laptop because
typing that stuff in on a laptop is just
painful writing it on a screen with a
stylus is a lot nicer and yes I know it
doesn't feel like ink on paper but I had
a digital copy that I could then email
to myself or to my my study partners or
whatever and I had it right there and I
didn't have to carry around a separate
handwritten note book but something that
Microsoft did they released this
phenomenal application called one note
that hardly anybody knows about hardly
anybody uses and it should have
revolutionized computers the way we use
them today and I'm disappointed that it
hasn't yet but in OneNote it's literally
your digital binder you have folders
inside those folders who have subfolders
you have sheets of paper that can go on
forever and ever and ever it sounds on a
laptop this is on straight windows is
that correct yeah any Windows device
windows phone but any Windows Windows
Device right you can do this but the the
strength behind it in addition to its
organization was the way it recognized
your writing you could literally right
just a full-length letter or maybe even
a novel on this screen and it would
leave your handwriting intact and what i
would do is go behind the scenes and
recognize what it thought you wrote and
it might come up with five or ten
different things that it thought you
were talking about and index that behind
your note you wouldn't even see it but
you could search on it and find it so
it's like predictive text like way way
in advance and and in the handwriting
arena I mean yeah and it was useful
predictive text I've heard and it was
behind the scenes so your handwriting
was still on the screen but you could
you could literally do a search on your
computer for the statistics or four keys
Enix economics and find it because it
would recognize I don't know if he wrote
Keynesian it might have been Kenyan it
might have been key bank but it would
recognize what it fought and maybe put
five or ten things behind that word
behind the scenes and have it right
there yeah 11 it's amazing and it's
still used today it's still being
updated its its multi-platform now
except it's not on Android it's only on
Windows and Windows Phone um I knew I'd
heard the brand name somewhere yeah it's
it's really powerful software it's it's
funny because pen writing doesn't really
have a place in Windows II like you know
like it probably did in previous
versions where that was going to be the
future and then they were just like
forget this touch input finger input
there we go right that's what actually
what I was thinking I was like why
haven't any of these advancements
actually come to fruition and come to
change our landscape and it's because I
think we had this big disruption in the
market right of this capacitive touch
sort of revolution which firm for most
of which I'm not I want to be clear I'm
not sad about I'm really glad that
happened but it did you know completely
like rip the rug out from under any kind
of stylist development any kind of
writing development because suddenly
styluses were really really uncool and
unless you're following the phablet
space unless you carry a galaxy note or
a similar product they still are I would
venture to say pretty uncool you know
people don't want them still I think in
a broad sense yeah well if you look at
all of your accessories that everybody
who has a tablet is going to at some
point in time consider getting a
keyboard so they can really do rapid
text input on that device sure when you
get into I mean typing on a screen
that's great for smartphones but tablets
where you want to actually get work done
an on-screen keyboard is still slow
handwriting recognition through whatever
mechanism we want to use has the
potential to fix that the tablet with a
stylist has the potential to fix that
the challenges that we have or what
we've talked about plus how do you fill
out forms with a stylus oh if I'm if I'm
creating a new new person and this is
kind of another thing you mentioned in
the last podcast Michael if I'm getting
someone's contact information I want to
open up my contacts app say I want a new
contact get my stylist out and write the
information into those fields and right
now I can't do that not even on and
super awesome galaxy note 2 I can't do
that yeah it's only in specific apps
that I even have any stylist capability
other than just you know finger
replacement right well let me let me let
me say this i agree with you i think
that would be a fun feature to have for
people like us and in unless so for
somebody like me because I even I I
think we talked last last podcast about
how like when you when you're writing
for for more than a couple minutes now
your hand cramps up because we're not
used to writing anymore I mean can you
imagine how much more true that is going
to be for the four people who you know
younger younger people how much true
have a much truer it already is like I
feel like when you say that that the
stylist based input that writing input
is going to somehow experience this this
with this resurgence because it's
somehow more efficient i don't know i
think that people are being raised on
keyboards now and i think that i think
as i think more about
that's in the middle of my sentence I'm
like oh I think styluses are actually
still going to be a niche thing I don't
think they're going to come back in a
big way the galaxy note 2 obviously is a
an anomaly here because that's a core
differentiator for it but I don't I
don't see the stylus input method coming
back because I see writing by hand as a
whole no matter what you're using dying
out over the next 50 to 75 years maybe
I'm a radical maybe I'm just too too
much of a two in love with the idea of
the future but it's a dreamer yeah but
won't you know they say they say I am a
dreamer I'm still just a rat one this
whole thing up I'm still looking for the
point in time where the devices that
we're carrying around with us are as
functional as the Newton was that I was
carrying around back in what 96 97 yeah
i agree i can't i can't disagree with
you Choko by Newton don't even all right
let's uh let's let's jump into to
Android news either there's a good
there's a good talk show I'm glad you
got to uh you got some you know reads
passage for our mission more I'm glad
you're not you're not incensed enraged
or thinking about those hollow points
anymore oh yeah I got all that out on
the table and all right now I can't say
hollow points without thinking of your
Android misspelling a intentional
misspelling Before we jump into the
actual Android news as as listeners as
you know I've got a we've got a couple
couple instances of the LG optimus G
here at the pocket now offices think to
our friends at LG I am staring at the at
the AT&amp;amp;T version right now which i unbox
the other day Brandon I believe you have
you have you received yours yours yet
should be coming shortly that is
outstanding and can I to kind of talk
about the carrier of that town it's
probably no big secret course that's on
sprint so it's uh I just wanted you know
obviously have to wait for the full
review to hear my impressions on this
but I am just above surprised at that LG
has managed to keep me interested for
this long because it's been a couple
days and even right out the box i was
like wow this actual
feels a little bit more premium than I
thought and then I'm thinking well the
software's got to be a tripping point
here as it is on a lot of LG devices and
our weight it's uh it's not so far so
there's your little very very vague and
non detailed sneak preview this is very
interesting it's a very interesting
device and not in a bad way so I'm looks
old word of trading notes with you
Brennan go ahead room we talked about LG
in a previous episode that I happen to
be a part of and there was one of us who
said something about LG oh who was that
that said LG was really gonna do
something to knock it out of the park
you know I don't know but it sounds like
maybe that's something I got from Utah
might say it might be I don't count him
out yet something like I go back and
listen to the back episodes the bug my
stash something the thing that the
reason that this is relevant is not just
because the optimus G is around but
because the deed the nexus 4 is is kind
of almost basically official that's
point of view if you take like this
massive mountain of leaks as official
evidence of anything but the LG next for
just got some hands-on time we got some
benchmarks out of it i'm looking at a
story that stephen shank posted on
October twelfth so you know i don't know
i'm still not terribly pleased that to
be honest that the next nexus is being
built by by LG I was kind of excited
about something about something that
Motorola was gonna bring to the table
which will talk to talk about in a
second but how do you guys feel about
the nexus 4 in light of these these new
benchmarks which don't look terribly all
that impressive i was i was on LG's
youtube channel trying to get a taste
and understanding for all the features
that the optimist she has and i started
thinking you know this is really nice
hardware it looks like it's pretty nice
hardware and the s4 pro is a beast and
you know it would be cool if this thing
was running stock Android and well that
is pretty much the nexus 4 so i am very
very excited to try the nexus 4 yeah um
I you know what I hope they retain and
it's something that um
is not related to the specs but they the
notification light on this thing is
actually built into the power standby
button on the side so it's it's very
much like if you ever used any of
sprint's old Direct Connect hardware
that when they were transitioning from
nextel and they the big push to talk
button on the side was backlit in this
brilliant blue LED backlight that let
you know the button was there letting
you know somebody was trying to talk to
you reminds me of that and it's just
really really cool too I like when omm
bind buttons and lights because I'm
pretty easy to impress but if the phones
if you're if you're sitting at the table
and the phones facing away from you you
won't see the light whereas unlike the
galaxy s3 if as long as the phone is on
its back you'll always see the
notification on the galaxy s3 if the
phone is in the room you'll see the get
the notification haiyan yeah but i
didn't know that is true and but you
know what it doesn't it ultimately it
doesn't matter Brennan if the LG optimus
G is on a table it will not be on a
table for very long unless the table has
been laser angled so that it is
perfectly even it'll just slide right
off this is the slipperiest phone I have
ever encountered that bad it was it good
how does it feel my head I mean it feels
it feels good in the hand but if if it's
too dry outside of his to dry and cold
it'll it'll slip out of your hands
if it's too hot outside and your hands
are sweaty it'll slip out of your hands
like it's it's holding on to a piece of
glass without the iphones without the
iphone 4 is kind of thick metal band for
for support and it's a little too wide
so yeah it's it is beautiful to look at
I wouldn't want to carry it around
without a case and that's coming from a
guy who hates cases so you see here yeah
but anyway we I don't want to I want to
kind of just very very briefly touch on
this nexus issue cuz we talked about the
nexus 4 and i think it was last it was
just last week's podcast where I was
like if our if Sony if Sony gets a nexus
phone out before motorola does i will
eat my hat and it looks like if it
depends on if you believe this leaked
image of this sunny Nexus device it
looks like that might that might happen
we kind of kind of don't know really i
know i forgot to put this in the rundown
guys I'm sorry the Nexus x
yeah I don't really I really hope that
I'm read that that is a fake I know that
I'm in sensing a lot of Sony fans but I
really really just I don't know I we've
talked in the past about how sony has
not really gotten a hold here but what
kind of have to see about that I do want
to jump right past it I just wanted to
touch on it that yes i will i will have
to extract my foot from my mouth if this
turns out to be real so two points on
that before we jump past it to pond look
at this sweet i look at me getting my
foot in there we have recently seen
google and sony team up to release AOSP
roms for a couple of the Xperia devices
so that essentially brings the Nexus
experience to some of the older devices
so that could be a kind of a hint at
where things are going and second just
looking at that picture I haven't seen
any other devices and if you guys can
think of any that I'm missing here that
have those magic little gold dots those
three or more little gold dots on the
side that aren't a Nexus device alright
that those two things paired together
tell me a lot more that we're gonna have
a sony Nexus device that's for letting
dogs right for what's that I'm sorry
those gold dots their connections for a
landscape doc right they have a special
acronym pogo pins pogo pins that's right
right right right yeah so I've got the
desktop dock and I've got the car dock
and both of them make use of them on my
galaxy nexus and they work very very
nicely and the next best thing to
wireless charging and you know nothing's
as good as well no uh Brandon do you
think it's real yeah this thing looks
totally unique I've never seen hardware
like this I like how it has a bulge on
the bottom and it looks like at a soft
touch on the top and brushed metal on
the bottom and the front it we don't
have a shot of it turned off but it's
just gonna be like this badass looking
very squarish looking slab and i can't
wait for i think to be awesome yeah yeah
I think that's probably gonna be my next
Nexus well let's let's talk about you
know what I maybe this is another
opportunity for me to be surprised by a
manufacturer that has never really
impressed me so I I also shall look
forward to it
but let's talk it while we're talking
about giant phones want to talk about
what we use what we've been calling the
HTC dicks the droid incredible ex is
what it might be called once it lands on
verizon so HTC has taken the wraps off
this thing and called it the a variant
of it and called it the the butterfly
the butterfly J which is just a
hilarious name for a massive phone I
mean it's so strange it is you think
butterfly you think like LG is gonna
drop this 3.2 inch you know low-end
phone that's maybe maybe colored
carnation pink you know but no no it's
not it's this massive thing for Japan
it's a it's we don't know what the the
chip is most probably the s4 pro says
Tony and the story here with two gigs of
ram 16 gauge storage etc etc and a full
HD 1080p display with 440 pixels per
inch this is just unbelievable this is
amin Brendan have you ever you flown to
Japan and got in one of these for
yourself yet uh my ticket is purchased I
don't know where to get one though add
this this is this is this is actually
kind of an easy thing to predict because
HTC needed to do something first and no
one's done a 1080p screen yet and it's
probably crazy to do a 1080p screen
because the pixel density is so high
most people won't know the difference
unless the software is really taking
advantage of it i just wish HTC would
realize the need they need to start over
with sense no one likes sense HTC is
doing a relatively good job with
hardware the One X the one x+ and great
then when you get into the operating
system it's like come on we don't like
this well it you know and they have been
taking notes on that day if they've been
slimming it down i remember you know
since four was a big was a big step in
that direction and this kind of like
stepping back and getting their hands
out of it and you know we get all the 3d
stuff went away and stuff is this
screengrab it's not a screen together
this this press shot from HTC is showing
am I right guys that this is showing a
new version of sense we haven't seen
before with these kind of like side
anchored icons on the left there it's
called fat sense for plus and it kind of
looks like the HTC Rhyme doesn't it the
is what the rhyme looked like there I'm
had these other sliders on the left is
that what their other sliders say I
never used the rhyme on account of not
you know owning a person not wanting an
intense tentacle to come out of my phone
so I don't know a technical yeah
whatever those third thing was called
what did they call that thing about the
charm it's a charm I'm out of the charm
oh wow okay so 1080p it sounds awesome
Wow fabulous until you start looking at
how many pixels are on that screen 720p
is a lot of pixels and you've got to
have a lot of processing power behind it
to paint all of those on the screen
going all the way up to 1080p pixel
density aside that's a whole lot of
pixels that your GPU has to figure out
and has to paint on the screen that
means you're if you get a four times
faster GPU it's not going to behave any
quicker because you got that many more
pixels that you gotta babysit and then
you've also got the battery implications
because that's going to take a lot more
power just to keep up with 720p so I'm
really that as cool as it is I'm really
worried that having that many pixels is
going to either kill battery life or
it's just going to be slower than what
we've come to expect because they're
just so many darn pixels and in exchange
I mean we have to get something were of
value we have to get something out of
this 1080p display in a smartphone that
is going to benefit more than people who
just for some reason use their phones
two inches from their eyes and and will
be able to tell the difference because I
think the vast majority of people won't
be able to tell the difference and so
why are we sacrificing that why are we
you know forcing this device to have
that much processing power and have that
much extra battery life which it doesn't
it has like a two thousand million power
battery or two thousand 20 milliamp hour
battery I mean it's a tough case to make
because you know YouTube streams in 720p
on your android phone the YouTube app
movies that you download from Google
Play is as far as i know are not going
to scale to 1080p games were absolutely
not scale to 1080p for another couple of
years until this higher resolution
becomes a standard right so there's
gonna be very little content to take
advantage of the higher res yes is this
just a stunt is this just H 2 HDC saying
yeah we need to do something first and
here it is is this HTC bug doing the LG
approach like first but who cares you
know this this is the problem between
Android users and Apple users Android
users want specs we look at the specs
what processor isn't how fast does it
run how many courses have how much RAM
how BIG's the screen how BIG's the
battery and then Apple users it's taller
it's faster it's got higher resolution
screen the earpods now direct sound down
the ear canal just very ambiguous saying
this is better but we're not really
telling you how or why it's better
because then you could compare it to
something else and pardon the pun it's
comparing apples to oranges yeah so
Android especially asked our users which
if your pocket now I hope you're
becoming an Android power user we all
want specs we want to see what this
thing is we want to push the envelope an
HTC knows that this is just an extra
line on the box to get people to say
look here's my phone it's 1080p yours
isn't even 720p haha I win and it's
another way the HTC can say we are again
on top where the first to do this and
and try and become relevant again what I
just don't think that ever works it
hasn't worked for LG in any of their
spec do you know any there there d
measuring contests with it with the
specs that was 2x and stuff yeah right
exactly the first to 3d who cares first
to first a quad cornell 2e you know
consider maybe something maybe some of
us care we don't know until the review
comes out i mean this has a better
chance this optimist she has a better
chance of making me care about LG then
most products from LG have in the past
couple years but you know the that's
been a couple years of LG saying hey
here we're first and everyone else going
like oh cool and then a week later being
like what was that yeah i don't remember
what they were loved it wasn't
impressive I don't think I think it's
what I don't think you can compare that
with with this because LG's execution of
dual core quad core in 3d all were
relative
poor and and unless this phone is slow
in his poor battery life as Joe is
suggesting uh it's going to matter
because it's it's got its got the specs
and and it's also don't forget people
might consider this to be a little bit
future proof maybe they want a phone for
for a year and a half and or two years
something that'll be that'll that'll
live up to the standards of a future
higher resolution content so not
absolutely do not in the sense of it
being a phablet because it's not it's
it's a five inch device for whatever
it's not a phablet I don't think it's
not a phablet but but not in the sense
of that but in the sense of power house
future-proofing powerhouse this is this
is HTC's galaxy note 2 it looks like I
mean in like I say not not in the sense
that it's a phablet but it's like hey
check out these ridiculous specs and of
course we haven't got our hands on it we
don't know how it runs but I mean one of
the big reasons i gave the Galaxy Note 2
and a 9 out of 10 or we gave it you know
after much discussion was that like it
just does everything you ask it to and
it does it pretty well on account of its
you know really powerful engine so if
this device this butterfly / dick /
whatever you want to call it can turn
out that kind of performance and you
know offer something as a first then yes
I think that they've got something
really awesome on their hands and I hope
that that's true because I happen to
like HTC so yeah I love HTC this device
I think is really going to show us what
that s4 pro chip can do and I i hope i
hope that i will be very very pleasantly
surprised with battery being fine
performance being great on i really
really want to have another HTC phone he
has my daily driver again hi Justin yeah
hey Michael I know this is a little bit
this will be an easy question no role
playing um oh my god so you've been
messing around with the s4 pro and the
optimus G and it's it's it's interesting
when people don't realize I don't really
think about is that Qualcomm was kind of
late to the quad core game the Tegra 3
was out like a year ago and they waited
and they perfected and the benchmarks it
say that the s4 pro is awesome
I'm in comparison to the exodus quad a
newer of course newer than the Tegra 3
would you be able to say that the s4 so
far feels faster then the the Exynos
quad on the on the note 2 where's to too
early to lap god I man it's so hard I'm
still right in the in the fuzz right I
mean I'm in this point where I'm like
still surprised that I'm holding an LG
device that's responding this well so I
can't judge it you know adequately
against against the Sampson the last
Samsung device I handled which with the
ex no squad which was the galaxy note 2
so um I don't know I would say right now
if you were pressed me for an answer I
would say that they are on par although
the the repeatable lag instances I had
with the galaxy note 2 though they were
very few I have not run into on the
Optimus G hmm I've been pleasantly
surprised at almost every turn with the
software on the Optimus trees so yeah I
it's really very impressive so far so
that's that's the best answer I can give
you let's uh let's let's keep moving on
the list here because we've got a couple
more things to touch on before we jump
into iOS and just very very briefly
while we're talking about kind of skins
and software and things like that
Motorola has actually come out and talk
to reporters I love this headline
motorola likes stock android blames
carriers for customization which is
awesome because we've been you know
motorola has been one of the companies
that kind of the press has loved to rip
on for its skins and those skins have
really become a lot lighter to the point
where you can almost its almost tough to
distinguish motorola's android builds
from stock android builds if you're not
a real efficient auto so I like hearing
from a company though that he says you
know ya know I like stock Android too
it's the carriers that want to buy the
way he declined to name any carrier
specifically but I think we kind of
right that's good I think we all know
who he's talking about here he claims
that Motorola tries to resist such
demands but what we end up with is
ultimately a compromise between the two
positions it's just nice to see that
as as some manufacturers become more
emboldened in their skin design like
Samsung is just never gonna give up the
TouchWiz torch because they bring a lot
of usefulness to the to the product I
think but while while some companies go
that way other companies are like yeah
and it might be because they're owned by
Google but who knows but motor oil is
just like yeah we get where you're
coming from the carriers want us to do
this and it's like okay well I have
believed you I don't know do you guys
have a brief thought on that it's
refreshing to hear that they're thinking
that that Android is good enough to be
unadulterated question for you guys if
if you were running HTC and and knowing
that Android keeps getting better and
better as a stock operating system in
fact 4.1 point2 fixes that annoying
issue where you need to take two fingers
to the notifications and expand them
that way now you do it with one finger
would you would you move your investment
in rd and software out of software and
put it all into hardware and focus
exclusively on hardware and specs and
high quality hardware and just say from
now on we're lot we're just shipping
straight stock android would you do that
if your HTC well then you're then your
Windows Phone you know then you're then
you then you're using that that approach
I think tactically I don't think that's
terribly wise my gut instinct was to
respond yes absolutely but that's
because I like stock Android and I don't
think hardware gets different enough but
then you look at a company like Samsung
who's not doing that at all is doing the
exact opposite who's saying screw you
guys we're gonna keep building this skin
because look at all the cool stuff we
can do when we skin Android and look at
how like you know soundly Samsung is
beating the competition so I I don't
think it's a winning strategy Brandon to
do that no I think if I ran a hardware
company yes I probably would say we're
not doing Sant skins we're doing awesome
hardware but you know my company
probably wouldn't do well I'd take a
different approach to that say instead
of skins instead of sense UI being the
interface let's make sense UI just be
sense and make it a theme and you can if
you want to
you can switch that theme to something
else but will include our widgets will
include some of our apps will include
all of these other things oh and by the
way let's also sell those for like five
bucks a pop in the Play Store so people
who don't have an HTC device we're still
going to make money off of those people
who really really want this was your
that widget or this after that app let's
let's keep doing the software
development but let's monetize it and
let's leverage everything that Android
can do and make it look our own rather
than reinventing the wheel to make it
look around I love that and they could
probably even create a new company for
just software and it could be a new
business for them I don't know if that
is viable from a business perspective it
sounds it sounds awesome to me but i
will tell you just personally if
Motorola like released their circles
widget for five bucks to to anybody I
know it's it's free you can get it you
can get it but if they sold it I would
buy that ish straight up I would buy
upper 20 bucks absolutely cuz it's the
coolest widget there yes it's an awesome
widget anyway well we'll get into why
that widget is awesome on on future to
our installation of it but my 2 bits on
this this whole Motorola topic um way
back when I was reviewing the droid I
think it was the droid bionic I started
seeing in motoblur some really cool
really kind of interesting new ways to
align icons to the screen with you know
that kind of plus grid that's there but
it's not the swype side to side had the
little shadow outlines of where the page
was going to be and then all of a sudden
we got honeycomb and I know that's a
four-letter word on the motorola xoom
and what did we have we had that same
blue plus grid where the icons layout we
had the same page outline so motorola i
think was working really really closely
with google with honeycomb and putting
that on to the zoom and was taking those
ideas and maybe even that code and
putting it into motoblur on their own
devices before we had honeycomb so we
kind of had a hint that what honeycomb
was going to be it
which has evolved into ice cream
sandwich and jellybean now before the OS
was released so Motorola's doing that
they're looking at android and they're
saying what can we do to put tomorrow's
tech in today's operating systems and do
it but they're still going motoblur
which I hate well I mean you know
they're there they're the motoblur is
thinner than it's ever been before so
yes that's something to celebrate Before
we jump into to iOS we want to just
briefly touch on this piece from from
Joe with this hilarious leader image
there are there are there was a
projection made by Eric Schmidt that
that more than 1 billion Android devices
will have been activated by this time
next year billion with Abby with Abby
that's that's crazy so Joe jazz this has
this kind of nice piece where he talks
about well what what is an activation me
night how can we qualify the statement
you know a gay what is the actual core
of this I mean but just just really
briefly guys this is um this a huge
milestone I'm not big on milestones like
app stores get to whatever gets of 5,000
and then it's like I hey we got 25
thousands like okay whatever but a
billion active you know a billion
android activations that some that is
significant that's huge its massive and
it's you know I think it's being
reflected in in certain parts of the
world and certain parts of the country
certainly my part of the country where a
year ago you could still ask for out of
my five friends you know if they'd heard
of an android phone and they'd be like
what and it's not necessarily the case
if I asked him if they knew what a droid
was they knew what that was but now I
ask people with android phone then
there's this was a sea of confusion yes
it's like oh the droid what the new
galaxy the what Detroit know at what the
Nexus names are they okay whatever still
get a lot of work to do android but
people know that it's the competing OS
to the predominantly understood
competing OS to the to the iphone and i
think that's that's huge but this it's
only going to increase as as milestones
like this keep getting passed a billion
phones on the market what do you think
this is this is crazy I'm I'm so blown
away I'm just rambling someone stopped
so let's stop me immediate
so so first of all a big big shout out
to how awesome our readers are in that I
posed the question what is an activation
what does it mean there's some ambiguity
to that well poon yes that's his screen
name quoted Andy Rubin and cited his
source which right there that means
pocket now readers are just tremendously
higher class than anybody else on any
other forum or new site I've ever seen
he cited his source I digress he says
and I quote for those wondering we count
each device only once ie we don't count
resold devices and activations means you
go into a store buy a device and put it
on a network by subscribing to a
wireless service this is a quote from
Annie Rubin and again the source is
cited thank you poon that to me says if
that's really the number that Eric
Schmidt is referring to we have a lot
more androids out there than just that
because that's one device being
activated the first time right that's
not me flashing 27 different versions of
cyanogenmod nightly on my galaxy nexus
every day that that's huge but to put
that hugeness in perspective that means
this time next year if the activations
continue we will literally have one
android device for every seven people in
the world on the planet yeah on the
planet and right now with 480 million
activations that's one in 14 of us now
cut that in half again because everybody
who has an android has a tablet right so
one in 28 but that's still a big number
that's huge yeah no its massive i the
implications are stunning I'll never
forget it was a day in 2007 when this
news came about and I don't remember the
exact headline but it was something like
open handset alliance
uh you know with with partners like
Samsung and HTC and and Google to
release open source platform blah blah
blah and it was such it was such a
strange day for me because pocket now at
that point was only windows mobile we
weren't gonna go to iPhone we weren't
going to be a smartphone and tablet
general mobile site and I remember
discussions with pocket now guys and I
don't think either of you were around
back then definitely not no Michael um
we were just having these discussions
I'm like will this ever do anything will
this ever take off can this exists does
this need to exist and and like reading
about 1 billion activations I mean it's
just it's a it's amazing how this has
come full circle and this thing is just
this is massive it's so big it would be
akin to like sitting here today and and
just kind of bantering about Jala or you
know the or whatever the new the new
webos thing is or whatever the new like
me go thing is and like five years later
all of a sudden waking up to find that
it had taken over the market right yes I
guess it worked yeah yeah it works it's
a crazy crazy thing just to cap the
android stuff we do have some news more
news coming around the corner google has
done that thing that companies do when
other companies have big announcements
they've come along and just kind of peed
all over the the existing announced ease
google has announced an android event
for october 29th in new york city we
will be there is that right Brandon
you'll be there you'll be there we don't
know which I Rivera whipped up a quick
piece on what we can expect from this
event you will have to stay tuned and
find out it's going to be some probably
some Nexus 7 News probably some Nexus 4
News blah blah blah do we think this is
the official nexus event really quickly
did I do the nexus 4 event rather yeah
Joe only the Nexus everything event yeah
I I do I think we're probably going to
have our doubts or our hopes confirmed
or smashed about the multi NEX I for
yeah at this event well we will see I
want to I we will have to to touch on
that next week because we do it moving
to the other platforms if I'm wrong
Michael will eat his hat yeah that's
right I have by the way I have about
four or five baseball hats and on the
dinner table at this point wait so let's
jump into iOS because that is there's
the other huge news from from Apple's
platform no it's Wohlers wow you make a
joke and it's family and then speaking
of which the cover of the invite i
believe says we've got a little more to
show you keyword little obviously this
is coming true we have this new do new
ipad coming out where we're all kind of
devising our takes on the on the subject
if they're not all solidified this is
what does this launch event would take
place October 23rd is that right yes yes
yes I see ya soon so that's that's
coming up in less than a week here are
we expecting to have our socks blown off
because i'm not i'm expecting to see a
miniature ipad that will contain one or
two new features that are not to mind
blowing but i think the presentation
will be very bombastic and it will get a
lot of people excited but for me i'll
just say it and until something new and
exciting happens with ios6 i I just I'm
having difficulty caring from a personal
standpoint of course is going to shake
the market up but go ahead let's try to
figure out something it's a puzzle that
I cannot figure out so the ipad 3 the
new ipad has a resolution of 2048 x 1536
the ipad 2 and the ipad one had a
resolution of half that 1024 x 768 i
think that the ipad mini cannot have
either resolution it can't have that the
bigger resolution cuz you that's just do
them yeah he's just insane you just
you're not it that would be like someone
making a 5-inch 1080p display on a phone
and by the same token it cannot have the
1024 x 768 resolution because there are
7 inch tablets and the ipad mini will be
a seven point eight inch tablet that
have higher resolution than that 1280 by
eight
and the nook the new nook tablet thing
he has 1440 x 900 so they can't go with
either resolution and yet if they
introduce another new resolution like
they did with the iphone 5 they're gonna
really start pissing people off or maybe
they don't care about that so what's the
resolution of the screen on the ipad
mini going to be guys what do you think
Joe it's gonna be good it's going to be
it's gonna be optimized for a perfect
tablet experience yeah you see how I'm
doing that Brandon apple doesn't have to
release how big it is when the
dimensions artist said they just need to
say this is all of the power of the new
iPad all of the beauty of the screen in
a smaller tablet form factor that fits
easily in a purse in a briefcase in a
backpack or they may be and they will be
they will be correct they will be saying
exactly exactly what normal people are
you don't want to hear normal people
here it wasn't until it maybe a year and
a half two years ago where you know we I
was listening to you know reading
articles listening to podcasts people
started throwing around actual
resolution like figures you know when
I'm just used to like talking about
display technology like TFT I thought
that made me a nerd and then all of a
sudden there's like 1024 x 768 I'm like
oh god I'm tuning out and it took me a
long time to actually get to a point
where I actually cared about those
numbers and really I just care about
them because I'm you know I I man i'm a
geek like you throw around those numbers
to anything approaching an average
person and they're like what ever what
does it do for me so Apple we know has
the market cornered on marketing things
right I think the iPad Mini is going to
be a smash hit I think if you think it's
not I I would love to hear your your
argument but it's you know a regardless
of the display resolution it's gonna be
huge you guys can answer my question you
dodged a bullet dodged yeah yeah what's
good we're putting our enemies together
we're gonna apply it I don't care and I
don't think anyone else does well yet
you have to care because in the case of
when the eye at the new iPad launched
most apps weren't up to date with the
high res screen so they were grainy and
crappy piece of the iphone 5 there are
so many apps that do not spam
the full screen so this is a this is an
issue that ipad mini customers are gonna
care about me and sounds like hot though
because look at what the i look at the
iphone 5 selling you know what I mean
it's the iphone 5s it's suffering in
sales because of this some apps have
black bars on the screen no but it's
frustrating bad piggies I want bad thing
used to stand all 11 36 x 640 pixel I
really do and the missed opportunity
there maps as well or you know all the
apps that have not been optimized that
that need to be really quickly I agree
but I mean between the lines it sounds
like you guys think that they will
probably come up with a new screen
resolution they don't care the
developers will have to change their
apps that's just what I am going to take
away from this I'm expecting I'm hoping
that they're going to do something very
similar to the iphone 5 if not the same
resolution that it's going to be the
same proportions and then they will just
scale if you want higher even higher
resolution you can do that but it things
will just work yeah yeah I'm probably
wrong but I can't see Apple making that
gap again because we just came out with
the iphone 5 it just had this new thing
that developers have to adjust for
they've got to have done something to
address that I don't think that's gonna
be an issue I don't know how they're
gonna do it but I don't think it's going
to be an issue well we've got to go on
is this this picture of this powered off
display next to the next to the battery
of the of the device so you know I don't
know I look forward to seeing I know
that this is a significant thing
particularly for developers but you know
I don't know I don't know how much it's
going to take for iOS developers to
become disenfranchised with the platform
but I will tell you it's going to be
more than then these kind of variable
screen resolutions because yeah they can
go to Android wear that is where that
has been true for years and years but
then they can also make about what
eighty percent less money on Android I
don't know what the actual figure is but
you know so I don't think this is
1,000,000,000 masturbation that's a
billion well in a week from now we'll
we'll be talking about more specifics we
will yeah yeah and if I'm wrong Michael
will eat another we eat another hat just
so sad
well let's talk while we're on tablets
and what we have just over 10 minutes
left the microsoft surface price has
leaked the microsoft originated tablet
this is legit right I'm not behind on
this this is not I'm not seeing an
update where this has been debunked or
anything like that this was via
TechCrunch well it's up for pre-order so
well now it's a review oh that's right
I'm sorry that was I got those stories
mixed up in the rundown yes it is up for
pre-order and by the way that pre-order
window opened what was it 22 a day ago
two days ago uh I think GDS go okay
Tuesday page isn't loading for some
reason so based on that alone it sounds
like none of us have pre-ordered a
surface I furniture just gonna say don't
jump the gun there see if Brennan hadn't
I would have given serious thought to it
and then would have looked at my eight
dollars in my bank account been like
well maybe maybe next time I was all
over surface until I loaded windows 8 on
my work computer the one that I do all
of my pocket now articles and videos on
and oh my incensed no explain what's up
what's going on there is no more start
menu and I know that doesn't really
apply to Windows RT as much as it does
to you know windows 8 tablet what are we
calling that now um windows 8 pro there
is no start menu it is that access big
Metro you go down to where the Start
menu was and you get this little block
that says start that shows you a picture
of your Start screen and it takes over
the whole screen and that the stuff that
you want isn't there and as soon as you
get it all loaded up there's too much
stuff there and then you have to go
through and clean it it is the ultimate
cluttered desk top where I can't find
anything and I can't go back to it man I
know the great isn't it where you want
right yes yes you can and after about
two weeks I finally got that done but
it's it's trying to convince it to do
what you want now RT is different art
she is tablet RT doesn't have the
traditional desktop experience are
sometimes well no it does it doesn't it
doesn't everyone has no something
different there's so much misinformation
about Windows it's amazing there really
is Brandon when we were in New York City
I was confused at the at the one of the
asuste lady I think because I was like
so wait this runs RT but but wait oh it
has desktop mode so what does anyone
know yeah she had no idea what we were
talking about so but so I've run you
know RT tablets in desktop mode but what
they can't run certain apps like they
don't have windows media player they
don't have the whole office suite that's
good I've yeah yeah to have a special
app for it a special version of the app
and it's supposed to be you know written
in JavaScript and html5 and so much more
web based in yada yada yada and you know
what that's fine but doing this whole
hybrid thing between here's this brand
new operating system that you have to
have special apps for that you download
from Microsoft's walled garden and here
is your other computer that's running
the same operating system but it's not
our tea and you have that pseudo desktop
experience and you can run all of those
other apps including the ones from the
walled garden there's a huge disconnect
there and you have people now that not
to point any fingers right back at
Microsoft that are making an RT or a
touch type interface a metro or an MX or
whatever we're calling that now that
interface on a desktop application
that's not going to run on the RT
platform because it's an x86 or whatever
it is version it looks like it should
run but it won't there's also like the
the hardware difference consideration
right because company and it is yeah but
and that translates also to the casing
that translates to the thing not just
the chipsets that people won't see until
they get home or we'll never see and
never care about but the actual casing
like design like on the windows pro
tablets by and large the one we've we've
held on to the windows 8 pro the non RT
devices are thicker they have fan ports
they're much more like the you know kind
of old windows slate pc expiry
it's right Harry gotta be and yeah right
so it but i think you know that's going
to be that's going to set expectations
right at the retail counter so i think
it's going to force salespeople if
you're buying these in a retail
environment just say like all right we
need to quickly classify this for
customers because that's what happens in
retail the RT tablets these are for your
consumer stuff if you want to be a pro
or you want to be a baller or whatever
then you get the pro device you know
with it which is heavier and thicker
yeah but you can do more so I I don't
see this as being a giant problem as
long as the expectations are set
properly but i don't know maybe maybe
i'm wrong on that as a problem is
confusion and it comes down to apple
when faced with this same dilemma years
ago instead of saying let's make mac OS
10 right I'm sorry OS X I'm not in the
lingo but instead of saying let's make
that you're on a train eh did i ah crap
you had a right and then you got where
you got rocked I'm sorry that's what I
do I'm an Android guy instead of them
saying let's port this operating system
that runs on our desktops that runs on
our servers that runs on our laptops let
sport that and kind of miniaturize it
and make it run on a tablet instead they
kicked it to the curb and they made a
new OS with new apps and a new
environment and a new everything around
that platform and am I used a person
fixed yeah they did the ugly thing and
and it's funny because they could have
gone really one of two ways I guess they
could have gone to three ways off all
three ways and in a cliff that just
there's there's just blood and after
that Oh way number one is what they did
what they did with Windows 8 is they
kind of made it into a tablet operating
system and I'm there's articles all over
the place about how people in business
are just not going to upgrade to Windows
8 because Joe like you said in your
scenario you go to the start menu and
you get these these colorful tiles and
you're like where the heck is my excel
so so they messed it up there and then
or they could have gone with they could
have gone with a glorified Windows 7
operating system where it's just the
desktop paradigm business work and then
people would have said this is in the
past no one wants this people want touch
interfaces so that doesn't work or they
could have gone this third even more
confusing route which is they could have
created almost like a windows phone 8
tablet operating system in addition to
an enhancement to a 7 desktop operating
system but that would be way too
confusing so any of these roads
Microsoft could have gone down with
windows 8 ends in in the cliff of death
I I think well you know I I don't know I
think that they've probably I you know I
understand why they went with the almost
entirely new fresh start from a UI
perspective and from an architecture
perspective windows seven right I'm
writing both of those things the
underlying architecture was very
different than it was on Windows Mobile
wasn't it the oh yeah absolutely yeah so
I get why they had to do that on mobile
and I get why they're now trying to have
it both ways because they kind of maybe
they kind of have to I don't know i
think the writing is on the wall right
now just the fact that we have we have
windows RT and then we have windows
everything else whether that's windows 8
on a desktop or laptop like i'm doing
now or windows 8 pro whatever on a slate
i type device we now know things are
going towards this whole metro this
whole MX this whole pretty colorful
tiles and separate apps new apps
rewritten apps that are distributed
through the walled garden and i'm going
to start calling it that on every
platform now sure the walled garden so
the days of all of your normal stuff
your your desktop experience that you're
familiar with your photoshop that you're
familiar with the video editing stuff
that we use on a daily basis of pocket
now that is it's limited it's going to
be gone and it's probably not going to
be one maybe two it
patients down the road when we're not
going to have that and it's all going to
be metro and whatever Metro evolves into
but we can see that with our tea instead
of cutting it off saying this is
completely separate they did this hybrid
thing realize they couldn't do this
hybrid thing so they have the mobile
tablet the thin one that can't do all of
this other desktop stuff that we're
familiar with them that we're used to
from years and years and decades of
windows sure and we it doesn't need it's
gone it's gone it doesn't need to do it
you know I mean I it's funny it's I will
say it again I said almost every podcast
it's so awesome that we have such a
diverse team because we have such such
different perspectives because you know
you're talking to Joe but about using
you know pcs in your daily life and
stuff like that and my pc died you know
a year ago and i had been a pc guy for
for 10 years and and i've been in a kind
of an apple only desktop users since
then and you know i see this thing i see
the surface and i think oh wow a
peripheral that runs you know a portable
device that runs an OS that i find you
know fresh from a UI perspective and
that can probably do all the things i
need it to do and i wonder how many
people are looking at it from each
perspective you know I for some reason I
want to say that Microsoft is not
targeting their existing user base with
with surface and with similar new
particularly Windows RT products you
know but it's it's the windows 8
metaphor we're seeing where they're
going with surface they've tipped their
hand we can see their cards this is
where they're going and you're looking
at it from from that perspective I can
take virtually any software that I've
gotten if I can find a floppy drive
anywhere and plug it in I can load up
any software that I've had years and
years and years ago and make it run on
windows 7 and on my current version of
Windows 8 but that the map is now
pointed to that going away if you want
to run software in the future with
Microsoft you're going to have to buy it
through that walled garden or you're
going to have to root it unlock it and
circumvent the process and which we all
know will happen but right you don't
have to
do that now with Microsoft and that is
its strength it will run anything that
you throw at it it's its strength it
that way it's its strength of people
know about it and I I don't think enough
people network or care about it because
people have already Apple already did
this you know like you said before Joe I
think you know like Apple came along was
like here's here's this new walled
garden and this is the way it's going to
be and people you know far from people
being cautious and saying well no I just
don't know about that people ate it up
yes because they float meal they went
all in with that yeah and you still have
your mac you still have OS 10 they did
you get rid of that I see okay so you're
a problem I i see i see which means yeah
yeah they're unifying everything and
windows as we know it is dead this it
doesn't it doesn't know it yet I wanted
like I on another I feel like when
surface actually launches we we need to
revisit this conversation because this
is really really interesting I want to
have a discussion between all of us
platform guys and just kind of talk
about this because I love the idea that
maybe the future is changing and it's
not changing in the bright beautiful way
that Microsoft wants wants us to think
it is um would you blow job at these
prices no no I would buy a Mac you'd buy
a mac noises you know now see the prices
for listeners it's at 499 for a 32 gig
599 for a why the what are the capacity
is uh different here 64 gig is running
at 699 what's the difference between
okay what's the difference between the
two 32 gigs on the pre-order screen that
we've got here is one RT in one pro no
now they haven't haven't published the
pro prices the middle ones out of stock
the other stock one is a hot I can't see
differentiation yeah I don't know
whatever it the price is arranging for
499 to 2 699 so you know they're
basically paralleling the ipad costs do
you think that's a mistake or do you
think that that is exactly where these
devices need to be because i remember a
tablet launching called the HP
touchpad that tried to launch at the
iPads price point and it was a vastly
inferior device so it couldn't command
those prices and then discounts you know
kind of happened very quickly do you
think the softener their their top
feature for this thing if you look on
the surface pre-order page I'm bringing
it up the number one feature is the
vapor magnesium casing and so the
quality the form factor the
craftsmanship mm-hmm to take a page out
of apples book is the main feature and
so they can charge as much as the ipad
on that alone they could have they could
have made it cheaper and then it the
perceived value be lower like kind of
nexus 7 style or they could have pressed
it higher and then people are like why
don't I just get a laptop this is a
tablet like an iPad iPads or less
expense so he had to put the price right
where the ipad is agreed and it seems
that the black touch cover with or
without is making that hundred dollar
difference on the 32 gig version that's
interesting isn't it yeah it is I want
that on my Nexus 7 what I want microsoft
to come out with a Bluetooth cover
that's that's your keyboard and it looks
slick and as smooth as that and it'll
work on any device I think Microsoft
could sell that to Apple people just
don't let the windows logo too big on it
see I don't think I don't think they
could because I you know you're talking
about a unless they made one
specifically for the nexus 7 you're
talking about a really big design
disconnect there from a physical from a
view you know a visual standpoint I
think what you were saying before
Brandon like the did that they're
selling this thing on its craftsmanship
and on its you know high build quality I
I completely agree also they're doing
that they kind of lifted this color
thing from Nokia right where they're
like look at these giant eye catching
bright colors I was at the the Downtown
Crossing t stop in Boston here the other
day and the entire thing is just paper
din surface of ads I hadn't seen it push
that big since the samsung galaxy s3
like launched the entire subway stations
is covered in surface heads and they're
all so brightly colored you cannot help
but look at them this is a very very
good help but I couldn't I mean I
I could say I kept taking photos but by
the way I played with Microsoft Surface
back at the mixx conference years and
years ago it was a table though the
table yeah yeah yeah I had hands-on with
that before I was so close to buying one
I saved up 9999 dollars i'm ready to buy
put in my living room but then they they
stopped up they changed the name
sometimes a name it's got and then they
resurrected the name for something
different now it's a skateboard no its
escape I thought that was a really cool
PRS town microsoft real quick just put
some wheels on the bottom of a surface
and and skated around on who was that
for microsoft do we now that's one thing
one of the guys this is sorry they're
gonna sell that in the store as an
accessory with the skateboard bolt on
yeah or was it just suction Don I don't
know how they did it I didn't I didn't
look at the mechanics of Microsoft
demonstrate service durability with
surface skateboard and you know it's not
like it's anything special it's just
Gorilla Glass too but apparently it it
withstood some abuse talk about
Stephenson ahaha president of the
Windows Phone of Windows and Windows
Live division that's what he that's what
he did wow they think it with your shoes
off so you could operate the device with
your toes with your job yeah you guys
ever just and this will be the last
irrelevant question i asked you guys
ever use that your device with your nose
like if you're if you if you're like
carrying groceries and you've got like a
text that you want to you know reply to
it you don't have a hand free ever you
ever touch your capacitive touchscreen
with your nose i can honestly say that
has never crossed my mind brandon i'm
glad you bring it up because i've got an
extra long meaty nose and it would make
a perfect touch input device okay you
know what I well you're welcome for the
suggestion now you can stop going to buy
those mini sausages to use this
capacitor style I you thought
fingerprints were bad on your screen and
now we got no snow just prints yes good
oh my god well I think that's an
outstanding place to end the podcast
what do you guys think we are we are
over time on our on our hard stop time
and we do have to to wrap it up here so
Brandon anything before we before we
head up I am holding my iphone to my
nose and it's amazing
how precise my nose is because your
eyeballs are right there you can
somebody try to i'm gonna try to type no
that doesn't work oh you give it some
practice man it'll work for you all
right i'll report back uh Joe any
closing remarks it was great to have you
back on the show as always I wish this
could happen happen more often and you
know maybe when we all live in the same
city well well I just want our users
know how much how much behind the scenes
goes into this stuff just in
coordinating schedules we worked on this
for hours to try and get all together
yeah because we all love it we love we
love doing that second thing I want to
mention is pleased in the comments down
below tell us how many of you picked up
your phone or tablet navigated with your
with your nose I want to know that Rick
Fox on that and don't leave a comment on
youtube no no don't go to youtube go to
hockey now calm where things are civil
and people cite their sources well I
don't know about civil Joe now well you
ever comparatively written a piece on
one windows phone anyway and then just

time to be alive it is indeed yes it is
guys that's heartwarming with that with
that heartwarming sentiment no I know I
do love it in in Joe Levi is absolutely
correct that's going to wrap it up for
us for this episode of the pocket now
