pocket now calm and this is the software
tour of the HTC touch HD now there's a
lot
oft we're on this device but we're only
going to cover the major and interesting
things and we're going to cover
everything thoroughly in the upcoming
review on pocketnow.com so watch out for
that so here we have touchflo 3d and
it's been slightly reworked for the
touch HD so it adds a few tabs that you
don't find on the touch diamond and the
touch pro and those sort of devices
what's interesting is that if you tap
one of the buttons along the bottom one
of the icons you get a little bit of
haptic feedback just as you would if you
touch one of the hardware buttons here
on the touch HD which is great because
it lets you know that you've actually
pressed the button so going to the right
we have favorite people you've seen this
before you've seen the text messaging
tab before also the internet tab which
lets you flick through all your
favorites quite easily and access a web
page really fast and then then we have
this new tab the stocks tab and this is
really great because you can put all of
the stocks that you're watching on the
screen though update automatically you
can flick through them to see the next
one and if you want more information you
just tap right on the chart and you get
a more elaborate chart with information
about the stock and it's using yahoo
finance so you can go to six months you
can see the chart how things have been
going so that's a really good addition
going over to the right we have the
photo tab which is a little different
than the other touchflo 3d because you
get more picture because the screen is
longer right so you can actually see
more of the picture going down the
screen and of course you flick your
finger you flick your stylus and you can
look through your pictures that way next
up is the music tab and we've seen this
before you can play songs right from
your today screen or you can flip
through your album art if you have any
songs on your device going over to the
right we have the weather tab which is
slightly reworked now if you remember
the weather tab on the diamond and touch
pro they'll let you see a five-day
forecast but you have to go to another
screen to do so um this way we have the
weather forecast right on the screen
because the screen is longer so that's
great ok go over to the next tab we have
some settings and in this version of
touchflo 3d you can customize the taps
so you can uncheck the ones you don't
want and you can rearrange them by
tapping and dragging like so so that's a
really good addition
and if we finish up in programs we see
that there are a lot of icons on the
screen and of course if you want to add
a program you tap on the plus button you
scroll with your finger like so very
smooth flick scrolling and you just tap
on something in the icona pop up click
scrolling is prevalent throughout the
entire operating system here so it's
really finger friendly okay so let's get
into programs i want to show you some
things that you may not have seen before
or that are interesting performance on
the touch HD is pretty good as you're
going to see in an upcoming video it's
about the same as the touch pro and the
diamond which is already pretty darn
fast so here we are in programs we have
the usual HTC entries we've
Communication Manager we have the camera
which we're going to talk about in the
review it's 5 megapixels so probably
take some great shots we have FM radio
with a with a new icon this device comes
with google maps which of course is free
to everyone let's take a look at opera
and see how web pages render on such a
wide large display okay so here we are
I'm going to go to cnn.com it's a news
where I shall go to cnet's closer and
let's see how long this takes were over
a Wi-Fi connection right now
now unfortunately the prototype version
of the touch HD had flash support and
this device does not it doesn't look
like they included the updated version
of opera that has flash support although
it has a new zooming feature that i'm
going to show you in a second so here we
are we're done loading and now i'm just
going to flip it over to landscape and
we get a really fast screen rotation and
of course you can flick your finger to
go down the page now we have this new
zoom slider of course you can zoom in by
double tapping and it will resize the
column very nice or you can use the zoom
slider now which I don't like that much
it's not very precise so tap on it I can
go in I much prefer the double tap
method and using the internet on this
device it's just amazing you see so much
screen data at one time it's just
remarkable so we're going to get out of
opera mobile all right let's go down the
list we have the usual entries I want to
show you YouTube because it's a slightly
different version of YouTube and i also
want to show you how videos look
streaming videos on this device ok so
what's new about this version of opera
or youtube I should say is that there's
now a program guide at the top previous
versions didn't have this that came on
the touch pro in touch diamond which
which lets you dial down by category in
YouTube so we can go to let's go to
science and technology and we're going
to filter by the top-rated video and I'm
going to play the first one I see or the
second one so let's go to actually this
one looks a little better and we go to
landscape
and videos just look really fantastic on
this device this may not be the best
video to to demonstrate that but take my
word for it you'll see this in an
upcoming video that I'm going to do
comparing the touch pro and the touch HD
that video playback is just very smooth
it looks fantastic on the huge screen
and the wvga resolution really helps to
make things extra crisp and extra clear
ok so let's go into the settings now and
talk about a few things let's start off
by going into buttons and here we can
customize just one button we don't
really have that many choices to begin
with but we can do a tap and hold of the
call start button which is good we don't
have voice command we voice speed dial
which you much must train it's kind of
annoying let's go over to system and see
how much memory we have we have a few
programs open right now but even then we
have over a hundred megabytes of free
program memory this device has about 200
free which is the same around the same
as the touch pro so that's good let's go
down the list we have of course the
calibration wizard for HTC devices with
an accelerometer and something is kind
of unfortunate is that you can't change
the orientation of the screen
permanently so if we go down to screen
we don't have the setting to change the
orientation so if I want to use it in
landscape full time I can't do that the
only times when I can use landscape is
when you're looking at pictures or
you're on YouTube or you're in Opera so
that's that's really unfortunate and
over in connection we have the usual
things now I want to talk about entering
data entering text on the touch HD
because obviously doesn't have a
keyboard so how do you enter data well
it has all the HTC keyboards that come
on other devices and the really good
keyboards so here we have a few choices
of keyboards let me show you them we
have the phone keypad which is what
you're seeing now compact qwerty which
is like a shirt type and then a full
qwerty which is obviously a full
on keyboards so i'm going to show you
this one and this is kind of like a t9
pad that you would have on a numeric
phone so i'm going to just type you know
today is saturday and i have it switched
to ABC which so it's not doing the t9
let me turn that on okay so let's try
that today a Saturday today is Saturday
there it is pretty fast right you can
change that the the word completion
options and that sort of thing let's try
another keyboard let's try the suretype
and I think the shirts at keyboard would
be best suited for long emails where you
can use both thumbs whereas the previous
keyboard is good for if you're using it
one handed so I'm going to type again
today is Saturday just as good and like
i said if i were to pick this up and use
my thumb's it would be even faster and
let me just finish up by showing you the
full qwerty keyboard and here it is it's
kind of like the iphone keyboard where
it doesn't register a press unless you
lift up your finger so overall the
keyboards on the HTC touch HD are pretty
good and I think after a while of
getting used to it after a few days of
usage you'd become really comfortable
and be able to enter text pretty fast so
that's a great thing and with the large
screen it helps to be able to have so
much surface area to work with okay here
we are on the phone application and I'm
covering up a phone number at the top
because is exposed so here's the problem
because this device doesn't have a deep
AB d-pad we can't go down to Ryan press
right to go to home and dial his number
if I tap on Ryan it's going to call Ryan
that's kind of a flaw with the device
but here's something interesting if I go
down to Ryan and swipe right or left I
can toggle between text messages mobile
and home and that way if I want to call
Ryan home now I just tap or if I want to
use his phone to text message him I just
tapped now after i switch it and took me
a really long time to figure that out
actually because it's kind of
unconventional for windows mobile
devices to not let you use the d-pad to
select a number and then press right or
left to choose their mobile number or
their home number or that sort of thing
so that's it for the software
tour of the touch HD and as I was
mentioning we have a video coming up
where we're going to compare the touch
pro with the touch HD and show you kind
of how these screens differ how the
performance differs and what it actually
looks like to have such a large screen
on the touch HD so watch out for that
and follow us on Twitter so that you can
find out right when we post it
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
