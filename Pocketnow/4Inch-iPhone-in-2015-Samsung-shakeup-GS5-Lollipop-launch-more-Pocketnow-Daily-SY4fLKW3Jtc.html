its roots with a small iPhone in 2015
Galaxy s5 smartphones are already
celebrating some lollipop it seems and
Samsung's corporate shake-up happens
today but in a different way I'm hi Mary
vetta and could be that one hand that
usability ended up winning the battle in
the end this is parking out daily now
the official news today only have a
little to do with lollipop but not
everything google has just pushed a ton
of updates for its a current google
services and different applications on
Android and the updates are quite
significant a ton of applications are
getting the update link to this trip
here for the full list but interesting
UI elements are focused on lollipop
that's really what you're getting in
most of these applications though no
lollipop yet for mini now that being
said the official shocker for today is
Samson reports claimed that the company
has already pushed Android 5.0 lollipop
to the galaxy s5 in Europe now by Europe
I mean Poland actually that's the only
country that's received it yet according
to reports no other country has been
mentioned we know the UK is the last one
to get it at some point but yeah
lollipop for the galaxy s5 is already
out finally samsung but those are the
only good news for samsung today as the
wall street journal is already reporting
that the corporate shake-up did happen
today but at a different level JK Shin
continues to be the president and CEO of
mobile but then again a lot of corporate
vice president's executive vice
presidents and a lot of people in the
mid level are losing their jobs today
there are no official number Samsung has
not come clean as to what is happening
how many people are losing their jobs
today but either executives are being
relocated or executives are losing their
job at getting a pink slip now the set
part here is that the samsung needs to
come back and with the less employees we
don't know how easy that's going to be
and the master of patents is at it again
Apple is that company that pens
everything and launches half of it but
there are some very interesting reports
that append filed by the company is for
virtual reality headset an accessory for
the iPhone it seems that Apple is
believing in this technology even though
it
and really taken off from anybody else
Apple is famous for trying to redo
things in a smarter way I think it's
just the brand push in the end but then
again let's see if this ever happens in
the future finally for the very
interesting news of the day other
reports claim that Apple is already
prepping its suppliers for a 4-inch
iphone a new 4-inch iphone to be
launched in 2015 now get this it seems
that one-handed usability that win the
battle at some point because of yes the
difference between the iphone 6 and the
iphone 5s is very very negligible up to
the point that yeah a lot of people
continue buying the iphone 5s because
they don't want the bigger iPhone and
reports claim that Apple might be
replacing the iphone 5s and iphone 5c
with this new for enjoy phone and have
three phones in the lineup which would
make a lot of sense but leads me to the
question of the day big bones or
one-handed usability what is your pick
in my case I have big hands so for me
big bones is the same as a small phone
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case friends you know the drill
if we want to get it was earlier before
this video is finished you follow us on
parking i'll comment subscribe change of
channel as well you don't follow me on
