that we do review rebuttals pieces that
allow team members to dissent from or
agree with a review conclusion well our
own aunt on dinadh has yet to review
Samsung's gear fit so I can't do a
rebuttal quite yet but because I think I
know what Tony's going to say about the
device and honestly because my own
review unit has to go back to Samsung
today I'm here to make up a word and
give you our first-ever review pre
Buttle i'm michael fisher with pocket
now and i've spent about 24 hours with
samsung's new gear fit here are my
impressions after the first day like I
say I already know what some of Anton's
objections are going to be because the
fit isn't perfect I got a handle on some
of its limitations on my recent fitness
adventure with s health which you should
go check out if you want to see how well
the gear fit holds up to a kayaking
expedition among other things the heart
rate sensor doesn't always work properly
the s health features aren't
consistently reliable you can't take
phone calls on it and there's no onboard
storage for playing media like there is
on the gear too so if you're buying the
gear fit because it's called the fit you
might have some qualms but if you're
like me and the appeal of the fit is
mainly that it's a SmartWatch that
stands out you might think differently
with its curved screen and tiny
footprint the gear fit is the coolest
looking piece of technology I've ever
put on my wrist it was a little awkward
when the display was confined to
landscape and I needed to wear it under
my palm though if it's good enough for
Admiral Kirk it's good enough for me of
course that's not always convenient
especially when typing so Samsung
released a portrait mode that looks
surprisingly good and the customization
options in the home screen styler go a
long way toward keeping the experience
fresh as for the main convenience of
using a SmartWatch unobtrusive
notifications the gear fit does well you
still need to go to your phone for
reading entire messages or to read
multiple messages arriving in a quick
succession but for the quick glances
smart watches are built for the fit
holds its own and it does so for a
surprisingly long time given its size
even after that day long exercise
expedition and a night of sleep
monitoring the gear fit was on
track to last three solid days and
that's with heavy use yes that means
you'll have to charge it pretty often
and while some might grouse about the
lack of a standard charger I love the
new charging sled which is tiny compared
to the giant cradle of yesteryear again
we'll have more on the gear fit as part
of a proper review coming soon for now
I'll just say that if I carry a Galaxy
smartphone the fit is the SmartWatch I'd
buy to go along with it and not because
of its fitness capabilities be sure to
