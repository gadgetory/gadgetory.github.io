greatest for 2015 and then the other we
have the smartphone that is trying to
beat I'm hiding that I read of a pocket
now here at MWC 2015 and Barcelona and
this is a quick hands-on comparison of
the galaxy s6 versus the iPhone 6 Samson
just spent the last couple of hours
comparing the galaxy s6 the devices like
the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus and the
reasons why are clear
Apple sold 75 million iPhones matching
all of Samsung smartphones for the first
time ever last quarter so Samsung really
needs to do something about it when you
see them side-by-side there are just as
many similarities as there are
differences between these two looking at
them it's hard to tell them apart from
the side or even from the bottom
something which we know will gather some
mixed publicity for Samsung even their
aluminum construction 64-bit proprietary
processors fingerprint scanners non
removable batteries and lack of
expandable storage could easily tell you
that these both devices are siblings but
their similarities in their the galaxy
s6 has a larger 5.1 inch display
compared to the 4.7 inches on the iPhone
6 almost 200 more pixels per inch in its
quad HD display three times more RAM
twice the megapixel count in its primary
camera optical image stabilization and
better lens aperture compared to the
iPhone 6 and even four times more pixels
in the front facing camera with far
better aperture compared to the iPhone 6
again the galaxy s6 is almost 5
millimeters taller 3 millimeters wider
and nearly 0.1 millimeters thicker than
the iPhone 6 something that makes all
the sense in the world when you have a
phone with wireless charging in a much
larger battery as well even the
construction of the galaxy s6 looks more
premium with its glass on the glass
aluminum back there to the ugly antenna
carvings of the iPhone 6 samsung has
clearly raised the bar when it comes to
the design of the galaxy s6 for the most
part but that doesn't necessarily mean
that everything is positive the galaxy
s6 is the worst fingerprint magnet that
we've ever seen by far a problem which
the iPhone 6 user doesn't really need to
suffer at least in the back that being
said both devices feel premium in the
hand and we'll leave it up to our full
review to determine
well these materials last but overall
you don't seem to have a lesser phone on
either hand here probably the only
disappointing part of the Galaxy s6 is
that TouchWiz couldn't look more similar
to which predecessor surely the company
has invested in making it more intuitive
but it looks like a rush product where
skeuomorphism is more predominant in the
homescreen and then gone in the settings
menu a lot of inconsistencies iOS 8 may
not necessarily be everybody's cup of
tea but apples flattered design is more
consistent and available throughout the
UI even though that's not necessarily
better so far our first impressions of
the Galaxy s6 is that it's is a far
better contender to the iPhone than any
previous galaxy ever was but our full
review should tell you more we have more
coverage of MWC 2015 coming up so make
