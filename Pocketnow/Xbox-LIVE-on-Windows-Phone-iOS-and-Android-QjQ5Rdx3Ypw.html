calm and if you're an Xbox fan you
probably know that there are a number of
little Xbox Live programs available for
different smartphone operating systems
but how do they compare let's check them
out you can probably guess that Windows
Phone would have the best Xbox
integration so let's check that one out
first here we have the game's hub and we
have a lots of xbox live games that
actually do affect your Xbox gamers
score so that's a pretty big deal for
some of the achievement junkies out
there and here's our avatar we have
profile you can see that you can see the
achievements and friends and our online
messages you can read messages that you
get but you can't listen to audio
messages so we see requests there's your
friends and messages again and we have a
spotlight so you can see a few of these
and they link to a webpage normally
and we have an avatar button which goes
to the Xbox Live extras app so it's a
separate app that you download and then
from here you can customize your avatar
let's change my style and we'll get a
suit I'll put that one and you can see
your character spin them around and
change yourself like that there's also
the marketplace where you can get
different avatar items and they're all
there so let's go out and you also have
a separate app called xbox companion
so Xbox companion is kind of like the
precursor to the smart glass feature
that was shown off earlier and from here
we can see featured items we can see
quick play let's launch crackle and it's
gonna start the app on my console over
there and here's the remote or where I
can control it using these buttons press
back and we see there's information
about what's playing on the console
right now you can also do searches from
the air there's no voice search but you
can type it in and we can always get
back to the remote and use this to
control the console so now I can hear
something's playing on the console and
now I can pause it like that there's
your controller right back in there and
we got all the controls there so that's
pretty cool integration with the Xbox
now on iOS we have a different app for
Xbox integration called my xbox live and
this is what we have we have a bunch of
videos about upcoming games and we can
swipe to the side and this is where our
social area is you see my gamer score or
friends messages beacons and a little
icon will let us see the messages again
you can't listen to them there's our
friends
and if we swipe again we see the recent
games and how many achievements we have
for each one and then here is the
companion app kind of integrated with
the iOS Xbox app so here we go we're
trying to connect but it doesn't really
work you know it's sitting on the Xbox
that have tried to connect oh and there
we go now it's working and from here we
now we have controller so I can control
my Xbox from this little device and you
notice we do not have search but we have
quick play for our recent apps on the
Xbox and here's a discover section some
featured items we hit that and we can
choose to play it on the Xbox so now
that's gonna go over to the Xbox and
change my content of course back in
social we still have our ability to
change the avatar clothing and so change
their style but we do not have the
Avatar store so you can't go and buy new
clothing or props or whatnot so that's
the iOS app for Xbox LIVE a kind of a
second place to Windows Phone version so
lastly let's see the Android version of
my xbox live so it starts out with the
spotlight similar to iOS and we can
scroll through and see these videos and
we also have a refresh button at the
bottom and you see the little dots at
the bottom means we can swipe so there's
our social section you can see friends
you can see messages and down here we
can see the avatar editing area so
that's gonna load our style and features
we can change clothing but you do not
have access to these store just like on
iOS next up we have games which just
lists the games you played and which
kind of achievements you've unlocked
there's no Xbox Companion integrated
with this app just yet
so hopefully we'll see that later on
when smart glass becomes more integrated
with the Xbox so they have a quick
little comparison between the Xbox Live
features available on Windows Phone iOS
and Android be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching
