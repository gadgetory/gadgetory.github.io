logo emerges the HTC t6 felt that
apparently will be called the HTC One
max and leaked photo shows the samsung
galaxy s4 zoom I'm hi mera mera and yeah
you know what this jersey means and said
its use to get a beer tonight and this
is pocket now daily let's all stay off
with some interesting news WWDC 2013 is
happening on Monday June tenth and
already apples preparing the event and
we've got some leaked photos of the
banner of iOS 7 m well you don't see iOS
anywhere it's only a number 7 a very
slim number 7 doesn't have the square
around it as it usually happens so it's
very hard to come up with different you
know predictions for what iOS 7 might
look like with this change but a
colourful logo is something different
stay tuned Monday will be today let's
continue on with the Moto X and Google
edition phones a trusted source that
there will only be three google edition
smartphones and we've got the galaxy s4
in the HTC one which is that third phone
could it be the Sony whatever phone or
could it be an LG whatever phone think
about it make your bets and leave us a
comment down below and aside from that
the source also confirms that the Moto X
is only one phone it's not a line of
phones and we can expect that soon but
you know soon could be the rest of the
year now let's move the conversation
over to HCC we know about their t6
codename phablet that looks like the HTC
One apparently and we've got some leaked
photographs of the design of the phone
and yes it looks in every way like an
HTC one only bigger we share the specs a
couple of days ago and as it turns out
well the question is it's going to be
called the HTC one max according to the
code name and we wonder if that is a
good name or not I mean HTC one max HTC
one min what's next now let's cover some
bad news from Samsung according to
jpmorgan well the company has sold a lot
of galaxy s4 phones 10 million units so
far but it's not as much as they were
expecting they are already declining the
number of predictions from 80 million
phones total the just 60 million because
apparently the phone hasn't sold as much
as they were expecting so next to wonder
why hasn't the galaxy s4 sold as much as
these companies have estimated it's even
Hitler
stock market price by six point seven
percent so what are your bets I mean I
believe it's because it looks a lot like
the galaxy s3 but let us know what you
think and finally for the hot news of
the day not everything is bad news for
samsung we've got some League renders of
the galaxy s4 zoom and yeah it looks
like if the galaxy camera in the galaxy
s4 had a baby in the back you've got the
speaker grill and everything to be able
to make phone calls from this camera
phone and then you've got the
functionality of the galaxy camera at
the back which is what we wanted from
the galaxy camera we hid the fact that
you couldn't make phone calls from that
thing but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day you know if you get
if you were giving the choice I mean you
know the galaxy s4 as it is or the
galaxy s4 zoom which one would you
prefer they were priced accordingly in
my particular case I wish that that
galaxy camera functionality was a you
know an attachment a sort of adapter
something that I would use only when I
need it because I don't always want to
be carrying my camera around but leave
us a comment down below what would you
prefer of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
