weekly brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers recorded on Saturday
April 27 2019 okay so this episode is
coming out a little bit later but if you
followed a pocket mouse Twitter and also
saw the post on YouTube then you would
know that Jaime and myself our podcast
team usually for these kinds of shows we
were both traveling we were out in Spain
for Aoife GPC which is their global
press conference and it's a wonderful
show it's different from Aoife proper
run by the same people but we get into
why the global press conference is
pretty important because it gives you a
peek behind the curtain when it comes to
all the products that we talk about some
of the market research and what not a
lot of our tech friends were also here
as well so it was obviously a good time
and one of them joined us for this
episode this is ISA Rodriguez of her
gadget match coming on to the show the
three of us talked about eva GPC I asked
ISA what is in her pocket now and then
we get into the galaxy fold and it's
delays and we also talked a little bit
about why it might have been delayed why
we think that the galaxies fault is an
important device and how smartphones are
becoming fun again in any case that is
what is coming up on the 350 fifth
episode of the pocket now weekly let's
go ahead and get into the episode
alright so I want a bit of an
explanation I'm sitting on the bed but I
figured you know I could just stay in
the center it's all good I want a bit of
an explanation because this is the first
time for both me and ISA what exactly
this event is that we're here the word
Eva yeah
but it's something completely different
so the global press conference has been
there like medium for partners too so
obviously there is Eva but Eva becomes
more a press conference for everybody
else okay it becomes a press conference
for huawei for all the brands that are
gonna show off their products and their
global press conference which is what
we're at here is their show where they
do have partners but it's all about this
is where the market trends are going and
this is why Aoife is now
to this and so they have different
different products I keep on next they
they have an automotive show they have
up home appliances show and so if you go
to Aoife you notice that that you could
see refrigerators washing machines
offices just as much as you see phones
and so i guess that because of their
connection to gfu which is the probably
one of the most prestigious companies in
charge of providing marketing market
insights it's like if you notice they
start with the stats and then they tell
you where they're going and so it's
literally this is where the market set
this is what's grown this is what's not
grown this is what's new and then comes
the press conference which is like we're
launching this to cater to that we're
launching this to cater to that and so
for me it's always useful to be here
because if you notice we go to different
we go to different events but these are
all product oriented we're gonna do
foldables we're gonna do wearables we're
gonna do this we're gonna do that and
this is the only show we participate in
where you understand why okay where
somebody explains to you why work we're
moving into this did you notice how much
smart speakers have grown mm-hmm how
much wireless audio has grown every time
those slides came up I was like yeah
that makes perfect sense because
actually once you start to smart up
products of course the demand will go up
but of course the actual product itself
before he gets a goo Cola system before
it gets Alexa I have to be good to begin
with and so you notice for example how
they're like how are you happy to see
that and you notice how they dissect
things where they're like sixty percent
of the consumer market is smartphones
and then this and then this and this and
then they had a slide where was like one
percent is portable speakers one percent
is wireless audio but then they're like
all right let me dissect that one
percent and show you where it's at this
is where the markets growing the smart
speakers have grown 23 percent and they
and and I like how they go to the point
where they're like and they haven't just
grown 23 percent but they've grown 23
percent in the most expensive sector
meaning people are willing to invest in
a higher quality audio for a smart
speaker and you've noticed how you know
Amazon echo speakers were terrible at
the beginning now they're actually
yeah good regardless have you paid for
the $30 one or the $100 one you've
noticed how I hate I hate to say but I
just have to how air Potts launched and
how wireless audio is now the main it's
a huge she knows I how it's grown and
you notice how much people are paying
for it that's sure we were just joking
about this about how people have air
pods on and it's it's sort of a status
symbol but now people coming home like
someone you see someone with ear pods
and they're all like other guys rich
yeah coming out and saying well I used
it and it was a great experience it's
not necessarily this these are Apple
products but it's a great experience
overall it's a product that gives you
that and what I find really interesting
is that like week we came here she
wasn't sure how much you could actually
cover being from the lifestyle side
right yeah as it turns out even EPC this
is more free and so this is actually the
first show that's actually not
necessarily for us like last year we had
Sennheiser well Sennheiser is a big
partner but they have no products here
we had Sennheiser there was the Porsche
design
lastly laptop yeah no that was in Lisbon
the Porsche design plus Sennheiser and
then last year we had the Huawei P 20
Pro was given even more insight here and
it was like the first time that Huawei
used this platform but Huawei's one of
their major partners okay and then in
the first the first GPC that I
participated wasn't Hong Kong was it it
was in honk okay they go everywhere by
the way and you saw the pictures up
there I was like oh my god I just I
can't wait for them to like use Japan
yes cuz nobody makes a show in Japan but
who makes it well there are some but we
just never get invited to them they're
very insulated in that sense Japan is a
very special market it's very unique so
I feel like that's one main reason but
it's so weird ever flying back this June
but ya know GPC is more there's more of
the show before the show okay and the
show that
explains where the markets going and why
they are evolving into this and think
about it Aoife has been around for
nearly almost a hundred years and there
was this guy he was been coming to the
this show it's been working it for 47
plus he yes as a photographer and so
think about it think about it how is it
that a show like before CES there was
already Eva before MWC there was all
well Mobile World Congress was just the
reason thing like this is literally the
oldest show and now you understand why
they've lasted so long yeah because they
have evolved into so many different
things and I find that honestly
fascinating I for me it's funny because
we were with Michelle Michelle from
xda-developers is also here and he was
also like ya know I've like for me all
these presentations about numbers are
interesting I'm like dude I'm I'm
geeking out over this because it helps
me understand that for example right now
for example as a publication do we cover
smart speakers no no now I feel
compelled to do so yeah do we cover
wireless how do we do but not really
it's not focused not focused now that I
see how much growth there is in the
market it's like this is what we need to
cover you know what's also very
surprising to me like it so they're
talking about wireless speakers and
wireless smart audio and even a robot
vacuum yeah and the thing is no one
really says that okay guys let's start
covering your robot vacuums because it's
a it's a thing because people are
looking at smartwatches or you know all
these other things people are saying
that's the next hot thing yeah this data
is actually saying otherwise
yes and I'll give you and then you have
the other side of the picture where it's
like smart televisions and they're like
right now the average price is 800
something euros and they're like excuse
me smart TV companies you're not selling
your stagnated and nearly on the Klein
you know why because even from a German
consumer which is a you know a high
economic power in the world Germans are
not willing to spend more than 600 and
they showed the market and market
statistics they showed and so unless
companies are willing to compete in this
market you're not your market is not
gonna continue growing and so you know I
just did my hour
first ever TV video for Hisense that's
right so now I'm like yes now I'm happy
because for me um you know when I when
we did the video back at CES I was you
know they they are obviously reached out
and everything they're like we would
like for you to sponsor to come over and
I'm like send me the specs and show me
what's special about your product and
I'll tell you if I'm interested and when
I'm like okay you're gonna give me 4k
with this this this this this and you're
gonna price it at 399 Oh God I'm like
I'm down yeah I'm down because I as a
consumer like that immediately it's like
the minute that that Google launched the
Nexus 7 I remember that they started
going through all the specs and
everything and then it's $1.99 and I'm
like what it became an impulsive buy and
so for me at a 4k TV that this HDR has
promotion and cost 399 it becomes an
impulsive buy for me and it's also
50-inch it's a 50-inch TV market
research people want bigger TV if you
throw one larger TVs but they don't want
to pay 100 euros for them can we can we
talk a little bit about least speaking
of the market research I want to talk a
little bit about the trends that they
had at this the final press conference I
was here yeah because you had a lot of
insight into the question that you asked
yeah about how they were lumping
together too many forms of media and
there's this whole theme of trust it was
in Sumer trust in institutions business
yeah and they brought Edelman and they
brought their Trust Barometer which is a
famous publication that they do where
they provide market insight over what
was so fascinated the whole time I was
fascinating but I was fascinating but at
the same time I was not not infuriated
it's not the word but I'm like okay this
is not well done okay it's well done but
they're okay they haven't evolved with
certain things okay so media as a
definition as a word is simply the
propagation of information yes okay the
problem is obviously we have social
media and traditional media and so for
example there there what was their
premise is that what was it that media
companies are the least trusted but the
most popular it was what was it it was
something like that
something for that effect what I
remember is that the trust in the media
has been on a bit of a decline on a bit
of a decline and the trend that I found
very interesting is that in the
developed world that's where most of the
skepticism is most of the skepticism is
and I'm like okay but then when when she
reached the slide when she's talking
about the fact that wait is but she's
because I think she started noticing
that people weren't too happy with the
assessment talking to the media and
she's she's like dear media people don't
trust you and I'm like that's not true
and to be perfectly honest I mean this
is just me in my head I'm like if people
don't trust us and we are journalists
how is that our fault
poverty Park democracy possible and they
and then the number where the numbers
were high were in the communist
countries and I'm like wait a second now
but then you know what I hated about
that I was totally into it I was like oh
that's kind of crazy because I feel like
in developed countries there's a healthy
skepticism or even on how even another
healthy skepticism from people who have
information and have the ability to get
it that makes perfect sense to me for
China and underdeveloped countries but
then you guys had to bring up the whole
thing if I get with their dictator
because there was also this number where
they go they seventy five percent of
people are wary of fake news and like
dude that number should be a hundred
everyone should be discerning but here's
the thing it's it's not until they reach
the slide where they separated wait a
second traditional media people trust
you in a 65 percent the problem is
social media and I'm like wait a second
you're wrong but then again you're right
you're right because we call it social
media we shouldn't call it that it is a
medium of sure it it it's a way to share
information but it's not it's a it's a
it's a user created for it's a platform
it's it's literally like and so I I was
I was trying to think of an analogy just
to try to explain it to her I'm like
okay if I post about our review on
Instagram this is like me walking into a
mall and putting a billboard there we
don't sell anything yeah we're not
trying to sell anything we're just
telling you we're using a medium where
people hang out at
and we're showing you that we have
something so you could probably come to
our store but it's not that we're trying
to sell you something whereas it's very
different for a comedian who uses social
media as his to show shows and take it
propagate whatever is he's doing yeah so
and so I'm like okay listen so you have
to separate the difference between user
created social media and and media which
is designed to inform and I'm glad that
and I'm glad that she you know when she
responded to the question she's like
you're right yeah you notice she was
like she's operating within the
standards of their statistics exactly
their statistics are not wrong the
problem is that were we're calling the
social media and the word to a certain
degree is well used because to a certain
degree social media is that but there is
a very huge difference between
journalism and social I like wait a
second you can't compare Facebook to The
Wall Street Journal how dare you I think
it was but I'm glad that she was like
you're right we have to to a certain
degree work on separating these things
because then it's not that people don't
trust in journalism they don't trust in
user-generated content that is a good
way to discerning it for sure yeah I
think that's a good way of putting it
user-generated content especially if
it's especially if it incorrectly reek
recollection news yeah you know and I
think that's the that should be the main
thing because there was a whole section
about fake news about news outlets
having too much of a slant like that was
that was that was a worthy data but then
but then she made a very interesting
point she's like you know what but the
younger people are the less they trust
on the social media the more discerning
they are the and she she mentioned the
very clear problem and it's true she was
like the problem with separating these
things is that generations that are
older than you think that if it's on
Facebook it's the law yeah yeah yes
she's right you know pulling in from
personal experience this was actually my
final college paper it was traditional
journalism versus online journal
and it was it was a small paper I won
best paper but the final conclusion that
we had on that paper was that yes
online platforms meaning journalists who
work solely for websites as opposed to
journalists to work for newspapers like
even if there is a rise on online
journalism there is still a big number
who believe and who feel that when it's
on paper it legitimizes the news and I
think it requires more effort so it I
think if you put that into the
perspective it that's how it got muddled
because now she's saying that social
media is media you know I'm like you're
telling me that the turn to the
impression that the that the market has
is social media why are you mixing it
together yeah okay all right well that's
fo GPC and I think I'm very I'm honestly
impressed I didn't know what to expect
coming here and I'm and we're here off
of your recommendation so thank you and
I I'm actually really impressed with the
amount of insight that I've gained yeah
from these meetings because the way that
I would describe it to anybody out there
who has been to a conference like let's
say it's let's say it's comic-con and
you want to go to the panel's where
people are actually kind of speaking on
stage about a thing that you're
interested in yeah
at CES at the actual Aoife or at MWC
these are the kinds of talks that we
don't normally go to this GPC is all of
that it's all bad yesterday was like
they call them power briefings too and I
thought it was really funny because we
actually because you were warning us
like we're gonna get up each time yeah
they're gonna keep you awake it's an
ingenious methodology yeah which I
thought was hilarious
no be honest though from my point of
view I was expecting a long boring day
but are you super into what they talked
about yes super into I know some smart
kitchen appliances and things exactly I
think
listen there was this kid who came up to
me in um and showstoppers and he was
like you know I you know I study at MIT
and I have this YouTube channel it's
really an awesome kid and so it's like
if the conversation was steering over
how YouTube is growing and how it's not
that he was second-guessing his career
or anything but it's how common it is
for people to drop out of college and
not finish their careers over over this
and I'm like no don't do that
yeah the best thing you can do to be
able to give purpose to your channel is
to be educated the more education you
provide to your content the more you're
able to provide useful content to people
and honestly for me I remember the first
GPC that I did honestly at the beginning
just like you I was a little confused
but then when they started with the
stats I'm like alright the problem is
I'm a stats worm no I don't if this is
useful tips
some people are not that's fine for me
it is because this helps me understand
where the market is going where we need
to push where if you notice the
tendencies for smart speakers or smart
or wireless audio are still not even
close being a what a paradigm shifter or
any or anything the sword a disruptor
but at least we know that that's the
market that's growing so it's now it's
not what it's already popular yeah you
have that you adopt that you have to be
part of that growth yeah along with it
yeah it's funny for me because I'm the
opposite you give me Dave I'm like on
numbers no that was my favorite oh I
will not so for example when they did
that that slide over how the price has
grown yeah the 100% slide and then how
it keeps like for me that made perfect
sense but everybody was what's going on
but my point is like despite me having a
really high bar for information being
given to me in terms of like numbers and
charts and stuff like I was actually
super into it like every time they say
something I mean it oh my gosh I need
this I need to take a photo of this
piece it is something that I think I
think he just needed tour
a better analogy should have used the
car and be like if a car costs $20,000
had to be at 30 years ago right now it
costs this by the inflation it's not
gonna really cost that you know and so
that so 100% is that 20,000 and the
47,000 that it cost now that's the
growth but then when you apply inflation
it's nothing yeah it's literally
actually gotten cheaper yeah if you
apply inflation and stuff like that okay
since we're we're not really crunched on
time but we do have an event in a little
bit so we're gonna make sure to be done
within the next half hour
yeah you said what is in your pocket now
you could pick anything anything that
you even use anything like any everyday
product that you might use
Wow okay so a little bit so I have been
carrying around two phones so you know
this I have the p30 and I have the honor
of you 20 mm-hmm what did you get that
of utonium by the way because we've been
doing a lot more with it oh because I
just got this okay
so what's great about honor right now
Wow no it's funny because um I was at
the view 20 launch with you guys but I
finally got my hands on the device
because honor contacted me and they
weren't like we're going full lifestyle
on our lines okay we need a woman to try
to create content I'm fantastic it is
and that's why you see the teasers for
the honor 20 yeah they've been telling
me that it's a full-on lifestyle for
interest so it's it's it's it's
something that I'm excited about because
every time a brand talks to me and says
you know what this is what we need we
don't either the traditional tech like
we are going to you because it's a
different perspective all together and I
love it when they see that and when they
appreciate that the same with the p30 I
just I like this boy I I'm not you know
everything yes true but it's also um I'm
not a mate so people are starting to
make this distinction more P series made
series I've never liked them a series
see that's the thing though you can't
tell the difference it's me meaning okay
wait a second now I can I actually
prefer the mate Series sorry
I fell into notice that a lot of guys
like the made series more because the
p-series sounds or feels a little
smaller more compact at least from me oh
but not the p30 pro yeah 30 Pro is a
tank yeah but that's the thing though
this is a B 30 which is perfect for me I
also got your literal you're literally
carrying a mate 20 pro right there with
a different chassis and a different
screen you know got better colors yeah I
get it but literally what you're
carrying there is a mate's when he pro
yes that's true but the May 20 pro is
wider which is something I hate really
about the same yeah you were using the
mate 20 which is larger the meet ones
that the May 20 Pro oddly was like the
smaller they wanted it to be sleeker
yeah that was what problem a 20 pro is
so sleek it's well these are two good
ones and I haven't seen you use the p30
quite a bit already I show you that you
hide the notch oh no I hate the not do
you have a do you have something in your
pocket now that I have started using the
Apple watch again after like four months
or something yeah you know I so the only
reason I carry an iPhone is two reasons
social media I remember I got this tweet
the other day they're like you're
reviewing Android phones right UK
why are you tweeting from an iPhone I
sadly always have to carry an iPhone for
our Instagram stories and for certain
posts we always have to carry an iPhone
I just don't use it as my primary phone
because it's also my microphone an
amplifier with the Sennheiser microphone
that I use and so I actually try not to
carry it around just because I might
lose it I'm like screwed for the daily
stuff like that I need lightning for it
you have a very expensive microphone
slash adapter and so you know I was like
you know what it's time to revisit the
Apple watch it's about time to do it and
after the buzz and so I was like why not
I'll start using it again and now I keep
getting reminded of why Apple makes the
ugliest were Schmidt
worse from a material standpoint best
SmartWatch in the freaking market this
is the ugliest watch I would never
recommend this watch from a materials
perspective because it's glass and
aluminum but it still is the best
platform yeah the apps the apps we can
get if we could get a Samsung gear s
three with that running watch OS I would
be down so I'm curious actually um and
if so Josh for this cuz I do a lot of
leg watch Smart Watch things and
obviously I have different a different
focus when I do write but one thing that
I've notice is that when you try on
different smartwatches they sorta run on
very very different platforms and that
annoys me because I'm not very patient
like people from my demographic I see a
pretty thing I want to use it but then
setting up and trying to figure out how
to go around it like what is going on
smartwatches are still the worst
yeah like smartwatches are not at the
level of air pods where you could just
pull them out of the case and your phone
immediately detects it like go setting
up a SmartWatch as a nightmare but I
feel I feel that because of iOS is
approach to notifications and their
approach to applications apps on us on
this Smart Watch are actually useful
curious about setting up an Apple watch
I'll give you an example if I use
Spotify ah the moment I I so obviously
I've been using ear pods for a week that
I open my ear pods put them on the
iPhone automatically the text i unlock I
launch Spotify I press whatever app that
I want and I will literally just put the
phone in my pocket and I'll just start
walking because immediately the Spotify
application launches on the Apple watch
control and I have full control from my
watch and so you use the digital crown
to raise the volume you swipe to the
left to see your playlist you swipe to
the right to see this long list and
right there you can put if you want you
know shuffle or write they're all in
three panes missing you're missing okay
so you know what the irony is like the
first-ever platform that called on
integration for Spotify was
you know Samsung Tizen yeah their
application still sucks
it's terrible you know very much you
know where OS did the same thing it's
terrible I think the only SmartWatch
I've actually seen you enjoy enough
lately has been the watch GT but the
reason why it actually looks good it's a
good looking watch but its functionality
is actually cutting out that watch it's
such a beautiful watch but I'm like why
are you creating another operating
system there but the thing is it so
minimal that it doesn't bother
minimalistic that minimalism is fine it
so long as it doesn't exceed itself if
you get an Instagram notification and
then a text message you can't tell the
difference it'll use the same green
bubble for everything so you don't know
what you're getting and so it completely
defeats the purpose of getting a
notification getting notifications on my
wrist to begin with you're using your
Corona B yep I really really really
wanted to love that Crona B you need a
little more no it's not that
oh it's just it's it's too archaic like
for example if you use a one of the
Skagen yarn or whatever if you use one
of those you can actually tailor
notifications more than on the krona B
you either a you either tell it that
you're getting whatsapp notifications
but then if you've got five different
contacts that are contacting you can't
distinguish the difference between one
in the other yeah and so you've got so
many hand combinations but you can't
really take advantage of them well well
they do have the corner B lab thing
where you can set magic words and it
will only go out based upon those words
so I have the word Issa as the magic
word so it doesn't matter what happened
if Issa messages me a messenger or a
text or she calls me or any I need to
start dating somebody with a unique name
absolutely right because there are other
people who have Issa in their name you
imagine can you imagine me being in
Latin America and having people name or
not I'm not very discerning when it
comes to functionalities because unlike
you I like my notifications like I just
enjoy them like if I get one I look at
them whatever I'm still on my
just don't like I don't like spending
the time looking at my wrist that I
would have used looking at my phone
anyway I just unpacked my time
management favorite book of all time
from back in 2003 when I actually got my
life back together I started reading
chapter 1 and I am reminded of why I
despise notifications to be fair I've
been using the Fitbit versalife but only
because they they let you put bitmoji
watch faces so it's literally a mini me
that changes at every single point
there's a version of yourself like Vanna
White Minnie bitmoji me in bed and
pajamas to buy that for my daughter
she's gonna love that series I need to
buy that for my daughter she'd go crazy
it's level of personalization that
someone like her is really into which is
why all the smart appliances and
products that are that they've been
talking about here right up for your
ally oh my gosh so for context they just
announced this app which will allow you
to wash you take a picture of you yeah
you think you literally take a photo of
your dirty laundry and then it washes
it's from candy and when they said that
when they said that Joshua looked at me
and said like you need this yeah so what
I realized is okay before we get into
our main topic what I realized about all
of that is smart appliances or smart
products are more for the people who
don't already know how to do it without
that functionality yeah I blew my mind I
was like holy crap like that's that's
that's the reason why you being there
was so good because I realize you are
the demographic of a house where I can
walk in and it's like okay half of the
time in my life I feel like I'm a
pretend adult and like I am an adult but
like sometimes there are practical
things that I have no idea how to do I'm
like oh you're supposed to do that and
people laugh in my face and I'm like but
no one teaches me that no one says that
like that's not that's not really you
know you remind me of me when I got my
first house oh my god I walk I walk in
the next day there was the storm
was a dead animal in the in the in the
yard because of the story exactly I look
at it and I'm like it's crazy I'm I'm I
feel like okay just get this my Google
search is basically how to put on little
manicure how to cook chicken or well
yogurt keep my house yet I have no idea
and then Google comes like what call
your boyfriend it's also it's also
different I guess with when you're the
how do I explain this
for example smart fridges people are
always saying who needs a fridge that
will talk to you and I'm the first one
do i I oh my gosh I want it the very
first overseas event I covered for
gadget Matt showed me what the Samsung
family hub is and I want it every year
like might I know I made it if I have a
family hub in my kitchen well you can
always like my you know I'm gonna
consider a fridge smart the moment that
I put things into it it knows what they
are and it controls temperature
depending on what it is I thought he was
gonna say when you put your stuff in the
fridge so for me I don't need for my
fridge to talk to here to show me
Twitter I need for it to be smart I need
for it to know that if I'm loading my
beer ah that's where things have to be
the coldest but then it shouldn't over
it shouldn't over freeze my meat and it
shouldn't over freeze that okay and if I
if I in and if I put vegetables that's
what I need products to be smart about
like for example that smart sensor that
they had here oh yeah like there's the
sensor that detects if you're not
cooking it the text that there's no
activity and it detects that the
temperatures just like playing around
there and if there's Bluetooth
connectivity with the stove it'll turn
it off yeah note that that for me
example that really is useful I don't
see here's the thing I don't need
another appliance
in my house to distract me I need
appliances in my house help me focus
that's what I need I need a refrigerator
that helps that helps me not have to
worry about where I put the damn
vegetables
I need a stove that helps me to remember
that I forgot to turn it off
I don't know I'm probably like for
example you have a smoke detector smoke
detectors for the longest of time have
been smart about one thing that I hate
which is the first thing they'll do is
turn on the sprinklers I don't bring
clothes I want you to turn off
whatever's on yeah that's true you know
that okay okay that's smart but I'm also
probably the same person who will sit in
the kitchen and start talking to my
fridge and it talks back and it's it's
just something that I always dreamed all
right well the fridges are not really
things you can fit in your pocket so
let's get back to things that you could
fit in your box that we could fit into
our Vargas before we had to send back
exactly I was really hoping that you
were going to have it with you about the
couch right of course I did try the
thing is are you the only person who
didn't break it a little bag of dust got
in the middle I don't know that I didn't
break it because like it fell off my
hands once actually there's a pocket out
daily episode where it fell off the
couch just hear the funk and I'm like
damn it but sadly yes Samsung they
reached out you know it was a 10-day
loaner we knew that we had so I you know
I fight I find it sad when I started
seeing so many there were certain
publications that were becoming how do
you call the when they're overly
dramatic about things a tional is
sensationalist about o reviewers were
required to send them like yes you
signed the document that said and so
it's hilarious when we're preparing the
the daily script and sam reaches out to
me and he's like we're gonna include
this and this and I'm like no take that
off that's not the facts the facts are
that we were told that we had to send
them back to n days anyways so we knew
that it was just a loner who I was I was
hoping you would have it but I knew that
was not good we knew that it was alone
Samsung knew that I was gonna come here
to Spain and so they they knew that and
I and I told them like listen I have to
travel so I won't be able to send it
back to you on the date where my 10 days
are over I will pack it up and ship it
back to you as soon as I'm back which is
Sunday that was the first call then the
second call is like feedback then the
third call is can we go pick it up and
you know what I don't blame them because
I don't you come here with that fault
you know all of us want you to be with
her exactly I would be the only person
with a galaxy phone so I get it I
understand the liability would have gone
through them exactly no so I totally
understand the reason why I you know I
like that Marquez did another video over
talking about it I think that John was
it John Rhett injure who did it did it
as well no it was Michael Michael Fisher
did another video um listen I know that
just like in the case of antenna gate
and then Ben gate and then so many other
cases and then the exploding batteries I
know that right now the hot topic is
does it Bend did it explode yeah do your
phone calls why is it breaking and I
know that people want me to be
sensationalist about the product and
complain about it but I am one of the
few people that's had it I am one of the
feet I am one of the many people who did
not believe in it I am even surprised
that I got invited because the Sam said
like I'm looking at you say no no no I'm
surprised that I was invited because I
you know I we had conversations with PR
and they were like you really don't like
foldables do because this was like M the
bees yeah no this was CES and they were
like and there and I'm like why well all
your dailies and your news you're always
like it's always a solution in search of
a problem you don't need a foldable the
problem is the moment that I grabbed the
mate X yeah that changed everything that
changed everything for me
I was like crap i I
nobody needs this but it is so cool it
is so damn cool okay he's just bossing
there because that is how I feel about
talking fridges but so it is you know I
have to like in the case of the recall
for the note seven you know what it's
like if you sold millions of a specific
product the year prior for you to be
willing to take the hit
yeah of recalling a product completely
just to be able to one protect your
consumers obviously but second it's like
we would rather lose money then lose
users then to lose consumers and to lose
the trust of the market trust I am happy
I am happy and I you know I you know I
even said it in the conversation with
with uh cuz the Ergo my son he was like
you know I think that the best thing
that Samsung could have ever done was
send you those that fold yeah
I've been seeing a lot of tweets about
that where people are saying Samsung
owes a huge debt to all of us really
yeah that would be able to test this
device and actually put out into the
public that like you know there's
something wrong with this right now and
then Samsung to have the wherewithal to
say even though two weeks ago wasn't it
that they were like yeah we see some
problems we'll investigate but we're
gonna go full steam we're gonna go full
steam it and then not recall them but
but you're absolutely right though
there's some sensationalism involved and
I'm really happy I mean that's part of
the reason why you know we like working
together like there's a certain amount
of like honesty and honor involved so
good on you in that case David Cogan
when I had him on for a segment called
spill the tea that I have on my
Instagram Instagram TV at my IG TV yeah
I had him come on to talk about the
galaxy fold and coffee yeah he literally
the guy is so extra data coconut i
skogen he I was like don't steal my
segment cuz you're doing my segment a
little bit too good right now bro then
anyway I had him come on in normally I
used smartphones for but he used like
his a7 in any case he he said that he
was skeptical of many of the
publication's and many of the people who
had the fault saying that there's broke
too
when in reality probably what the case
was was they were seeing some break and
then they were like let's try to make
them between between the time that Mark
Garmin Marquez and and Todd Hazleton
which is not taught
it's his colleague at CNBC three galaxy
folds broke three now I'll tell you that
no three ah that's all that broke two of
them because of user error yes one of
them because it genuinely broke foo
because of user error one because it
genuinely broke I'm not gonna blame user
error as well because our units did not
have the do not remove the protective
film yeah and one Marquez is like Oh
what the hell like I remove the screen
protector out of everyone plus phone the
one when I get it so I totally
understand Marquez I say user error
because it was user inflicted but not
because it's necessarily an error it's
just what we call it yeah but in in the
particular case of this device I'm like
no like the rest of us didn't have any
problems with it Oh Michael
okay so my unit on the second day had
like had like a weird tilt on the crease
but it happened for like a day and then
it went away yeah like it's like if it
aligned itself over time you know here's
the thing we have a problem and this is
the reason why I like márquez's video if
you haven't watched that it's a 15
minute video and it's so worth it he's
Marcus is such a talented guy and I have
so much admiration for him he's like
listen I there's so much to love about
this product that it starts with the
fact that finally mobile technology is
not boring anymore we've been talking
about flat slabs for so long and this is
the first unique product that we talked
about and how much time yeah
hundred percent now is a new form factor
always oh my god if you asked me if I
would recommend the first Apple watch
the second never if you watch my videos
I do not become
in the third reveal was like if you went
on a fantastic rant once on the weekly
about the Apple watch I remember this
yeah
once they launched generation four I was
caught yeah there you go
I was hooked no first like I even tell
people it's a first generation Apple
product I didn't get the first
generation air pods I got the Apple
watch because I had to review it but
like I didn't get the first generation
iPhone I regret getting the first
generation Jetta no MacBook Pro it was
trash people complain over the keyboard
of the second generation with the change
listen I I know about the curse of the
early adopter would I recommend that you
buy the galaxy fold No
yeah not because it's a bad product but
because you're part of your part of that
demographic that's gonna show the brand
where they have to go from here where
they have to correct and you can be both
like let's put this way the the the
tribalism on let's say Twitter or
YouTube comments that say this thing is
trash it's like it's this thing this
thing is trash why did this ever happen
bla bla bla I mean come on come on wait
a second come on every single phone
before 2007 had a plastic screen yeah
every single one the iPhone well it was
an lg device was the first one with a
capacitive screen but the first one to
actually use mainstream glass was Apple
and they were horribly criticized so
it's like how are you gonna use glass on
a phone when that thing Falls it'll
break the Nintendo switches plastic why
because kids are using it they don't
want to put up with having to replace
good broken screen glass don't bend come
on and that is than the other topic that
I'm like glad you can't bend glass what
do you want to like I was like can we
try any other material that'll also
blend like Plexiglas no flexi glass
doesn't Bend it's a screw and it's
supposed to be brittle so like that's
the thing you could be both I think that
it's gotten to a point now where because
we live in such an opinionated medium so
there's nothing wrong with looking wrong
with that but the thing is the fact that
we as you're let's say thought-leaders
just split that way the fact that we
hey okay was it Kol key opinion leaders
[Laughter]
the fact that we the fact that we can
love or hate a product and that would
influence whether or not you you
purchase it that's fine but not
everything is black or white so if we we
can say don't we yeah we can say don't
buy this product you should never buy
this product not now not right now but
we still love it guys let's talk about
oneplus think about it
oneplus one was okay oneplus two was a
mess yes one plus three was like the
first one where things started getting
and then came to 3t and it's like okay
they've matured yeah one the one plus
five came out now but my first reviews
i'm lucky that the first one plus device
that i reviewed was the three t cuz i
didn't put up with any of the past
no but it's also what did you expect you
know everyone everyone was so you it's
so used to the way phones are you give
them a new form factor no one knows how
to use them or how screen protectors and
folding phones work but it happens and i
and i told them look cuz they asked me
like i we want your honest opinion over
what you feel about the fold and i'm
like okay this is like me at the time
when I moved from using BlackBerry's for
four years and having to move to using a
capacitive screen you have to understand
we came from t9 to the blackberry huh t9
don't know 89 is coming from the texting
capital of the world it's when you get
text in front of a number no one has
ever told me a cookie name yesterday we
came from t9 to blackberry keyboards and
so anything was better than t9 you when
you were efficient with t9 like that was
a point you have to really love that if
she had more than one s in her name I
think this is the reason why catch names
like my lover baby came more pop
calling her Samantha or something like
that but listen so you know moving to
the iPhone for me was a paradigm shift
to even even before I was already using
pocket pcs and we used the stylus and we
typed at the time one letter at the time
and so for me moving to the iPhone
because I'm multilingual the beauty that
I had with the BlackBerry is there was
no text prediction so I literally had to
know where I was typing I was forced to
know which was awesome which was awesome
and therefore it's like trying to
remember phone numbers back in the day
yeah try that now I forget my own phone
number because I never call myself let
me put this out there real quick like
what I heard from a friend of mine back
in college is if you memorize someone's
number that means they're actually
important to you yeah whatever so I'm
gonna put that out there the point that
I'm trying to make is in the case of
foldables for me it was difficult
because the galaxy fold is a very
different approach to the to the main X
the galaxy full destroy is a tablet
that's trying to be a phone the made X
is both okay it can be a phone and only
a phone it can be a tablet and only it's
how I am used to I did Xiao Meis 2 and
so the biggest problem with the fold for
me was getting used to you know having
to consciously make the decision to open
it to interact with it better because
the keyboard on the small screen was
just that was bad that was bad I
actually started using swipe oh I have
never used type before that I was forced
just because my thumb's like and so that
small screen is a SmartWatch is it's
worse than a SmartWatch you know at
least the SmartWatch understands that
it's a SmartWatch and it just won't give
you certain options because they just
don't make sense
the problem is Android doesn't
understand that it's being shown in such
a small screen that it's not usable and
so SwiftKey for example because it
swifty is not up optimized for the
foldable paradigm it would split inside
but then it would also split outside
because it doesn't understand that I
don't want it to split outside yeah and
so there were
I made a video where it's the
interesting things about the Galaxy fold
and it was that it's that transition
period and so if it was one of my best
friends that would come up to me and be
like should I buy the Galaxy fold my
answer would be no yeah
no unless unless you're somebody like
David Cogan you actually paid for it
David Cogan actually put money down and
he's waiting for his final unit well
this is after he used it first yeah no
was it and he and he's like I bought one
and I'm like why well he's like whoa I
knew we had to give it back and I
actually liked it and so you know once
you get used to it
it's very hard to go back to a regular
phone that's what I keep hearing
III I wanna say that ah compared to you
guys I'm pretty new in the tech space
and this is something this is one lesson
that I had to learn because prior to
testing out phones I was a die-hard
Apple fan like I I was that girl who had
an iPhone and an iPad and my MacBook and
I would not switch anything for the
world and when I started reviewing
Android phones it was so different to me
and what was so scary was the learning
curve because I hate that and what I
loved about my iPhones was a fact that
even without being a Becky without any
knowledge at all it was so natural yeah
but you know but you know why that is
what Apple revolutionized is not
necessarily how phones should be it's
the fact that they made it the simplest
form yes they he you know when Steve
Jobs comes into the presentation he's
like let's remove all these buttons and
have just one with a giant screen back
then 3.5 was giant compared to the 2.2
that we were using yep and so the
problem is when you go over simplistic
when it becomes so basic when you bring
the idea to its most simplest form that
anything else is going to feel like a
step back once you get used to it yes so
that that that was the lesson that I
learned that it's like just because
you're not used to something doesn't
necessarily make it less better than
what you know and especially in this
industry where everything is changing
yeah you actually welcome that change
because that changed is the
innovation that everyone's been asking
for so it's it's just so weird to me
because I personally was not as excited
about the folding phone for various
reasons such as if we're gonna fold the
phone I wanted to fold smaller so that
it will fit my pocket why get a bigger
device and make it the normal yeah you
know all these other feelings but at the
same time I don't hate it or I don't
want it to fail because I see where
they're trying to go and it's exciting
yeah like whether or not this phone is
great this specific phone it's like that
watch series one it's like it's like the
first oh my god remember the first
galaxy the the gear the first galaxy
gear the one that wrapped around the
first yeah no no before that
or that the Samsung I forget that the
name of it all the gear live the one
would enter it for that even before that
when Tizen came that first SmartWatch
was terrible but that was the first ever
SmartWatch yes it was even before Pebble
hmm
I forget the name of it yeah I'm afraid
I forget the name of it but you know the
point is it's a necessary foundation it
is the only way products are gonna
converge if you ask me which approach do
I like more I prefer the made X just
because it's less of a paradigm shift
yeah it's less of a paradigm shift that
feels like a note 9 you can use it as a
phone whenever you want open it and you
can use it as a tablet whenever you want
I just would I
I prefer that approach I just can't
imagine the moment somebody drops that
thing so do you think do you think
Samsung is actually going to be able to
add more measures to make sure that
these breaks don't I believe so because
the way the the protective film not just
the protective film but also the bezel
design I feel that that bezel should
have cover the protective film I feel it
should go inside the vessel and not
allow users to access it because
pessimistically I keep thinking that
Samsung is just gonna put more warning
labels on it no I think that the
smartest thing if you if you see the
tear down from I fix it that is actually
like a sort of a sticker it's he pasted
on top they should just make that
you should cover the edges cover the
edges okay then that way nobody can
access obviously it's gonna make it's
gonna make for an even more gigantic
bezel but no because you already have
that notch
pretty much just make everything the
thickness of the notch and that's it
okay like I was saying and spill the tea
you know when that second wave comes in
with the new release date you know you
put us in the mix I'm just saying you
asked me what to use it to if you asked
me what's gonna be more durable you know
I can't say that it's gonna be the
Galaxy fold because the the front and
the back are glass they're gonna break
as well yeah right whereas in the made
ax the outside is plastic I can't
imagine what happens to a plastic
display when it falls on its face into
concrete you get those divots
I'm specific no take that take that out
and bring your your your other phone
just put them both together oh that's a
litter that's literally how it feels
it's it's literally a sandwich of
hardware it is the thickest phone I've
used in years also battery life for days
right wasn't it great oh whoa okay so
because that OLED is is thinner ah I am
like wait a second this battery is
smaller than the this battery is smaller
than what's on the s10 is it or is it
not no it's it's it's a little larger
minor but like the battery life is is
insane
it's great because then they're two
there's two batteries right there are
two batteries but they're there in
milliamps they're pretty much the size
of a Vanessa ten plus and I don't get
that battery life on my stem plus and so
you know again the people the market
doesn't need it the only way for any
market to grow is thanks to early you
stuff yeah thanks to early adopters and
so I you know I I express it I I need to
stop being so pessimistic
well okay to your to to to defend that
we have been in this industry for quite
a while that you're a bit younger in the
terms of this industry but we have been
complaining throughout 2015 16 17
how phones seem to be stagnating there's
not a whole lot of fun phones are fun
again yeah you know we have job security
to think about it is I don't know where
the market is gonna go I do know that
the only way to make tablets popular is
to fit them into phones in any other way
people really don't care about tablets
that much you know I feel that it's a
great idea it just I feel that the
materials are not there there's so much
more to learn but the only way they're
gonna learn is if they do it and so I
was the first person to mark the Galaxy
Note now I can't live without it I was
the first person to mock the iPhone when
it came out no comment on that Harris
III have passionate discussions over how
much I hate the Apple watch and I'm
wearing it yeah I can't believe I went
to pick up a pair of air pods but I've
been using them and I like know what I'm
a was a contrarian before we have been
the number one contrarian of foldable
thundery you get you get a pass now you
get a pass I have been the number one
contrarian to foldables telling you I
can't wait to get my unit back and you
know okay I think that I think that
should pretty much cover that yeah a lot
to say about the galaxy fold the delays
I did they say one they're gonna
actually release them so AT&amp;amp;T said June
11th that's a while it is a while but
think about it yeah they're all they
were already in mass production when
you're gonna do that's true they'll most
likely throw all this bash to the trash
and produce again you can't doctor the
existing you know I don't think they
would I think you know just like his
smartphone companies do with with
batches where they will create a
specific batch and destroy it just to
see how it ah fair yeah that's most
likely what they're gonna do I mean
there weren't many I mean in my briefing
alone we were like nine people and there
were four briefings so how many devices
were out I heard that they were a
hundred a total of a hundred units
that's what I heard that's a that's two
how much is that twenty thousand two
hundred thousand dollars two hundred
thousand dollars pretty much yeah wow
that's a lot of money so no wonder they
were so exclusive yeah yeah the unitary
all right cool well I think I should
pretty much do it we do

go change yeah yeah so uh yeah that's
