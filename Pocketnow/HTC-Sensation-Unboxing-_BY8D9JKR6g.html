pocketnow.com filming from the recording
studio here really just some foam panels
on the wall to help absorb the sound
because we're about to unbox the HTC
Sensation the HTC Sensation is HD C's
top-of-the-line flagship phone for 2011
that means we're gonna see it on a lot
of carriers and a lot of different
versions it's the phone that people want
from HTC it is their first dual-core
phone it is their first qHD display on
an HTC handset finally breaking away
from the single core WVGA specs that we
saw for many generations of devices now
from HTC it's running the latest version
of android version 2.3 and it's going
right up against the galaxy s2 just
released by samsung above the galaxy s2
in some ways is actually better than the
sensation but in other ways not as good
as the sensation we're gonna have a
head-to-head and talk all about that in
an upcoming video but first let's unbox
the sensation let's get to it
all right and let's do it now you know
the drill here this is an unlocked phone
high-end brand new zoom so it's going to
be expensive you can get this right now
from Negri electronics calm and it's
gonna cost you about seven hundred and
fifty dollars of course when it comes on
to t-mobile in the US it'll be around
two hundred two hundred and fifty
dollars and of course around the world
it will be offered at a subsidized price
but if you want to get it right now you
gotta pay so here it is HTC Sensation
the design is very similar to all
previous HTC devices they've settled on
this same form factor sort of a slate
like divide form factor with a curved
display or a curved earpiece
front-facing camera light sensor let's
move around the box this is actually the
vodafone version right now but if we
turn it over to the back let's take a
look at the bands here we got that AWS
band and we'll zoom in and in order to
get this to work on t-mobile's 3g
network you need AWS and 2100 which we
have right there which is very exciting
whether this supports HSPA+ thus being
able to get off the t-mobile 4G network
remains to be seen
we're gonna put in a SIM card in a
minute and test that out here it is 1.2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
768 megabytes of RAM which is
interesting Samsung's going with a full
gigabyte of RAM Motorola is going with a
gigabyte of RAM for their high-end
devices HTC is keeping it at just 768
it's a very thin device this is often
another language 8 megapixel camera with
1080p video capture VGA front-facing
camera alright let's actually open it up
here alright here it goes
HTC Sensation HTC's 2011 flagship device
I already feel that it's very thin in
hand it feels a lot lighter than the
Desire HD which is of course HTC's 2010
flagship we're going to compare the two
devices in a minute let's see if there's
anything interesting in the Box these
days there's usually not ok well that's
enough let's take a look at the HTC
Sensation here so I take off the sticker
wow really cool backing here sort of a
tricolor design so
silver it looks to be sort of a gray and
then some soft touch plastic here really
interesting design we've got a volume
rocker here what's really cool about the
sensation is that it has a slightly
curved glass display and it's very very
tough to tell on camera but it just adds
a nice little visual touch to it so
let's take off the back battery cover
and boot it up while we compare it to
other devices and who knows how you get
this thing off actually pretty easily so
here we go comes off like so and we've
got a battery which is probably fifteen
hundred and sixty million powers if
fifteen hundred and twenty milliamp
hours we're gonna slide a t-mobile SIM
card right into the SIM card slot and
hopefully be able to tell if we can get
HSPA+ connectivity and let's see how big
the storage card is eight gigabytes
class four here it's not bad there's
about a gigabyte of ROM included so
right out of the box you get about nine
gigabytes of storage space not that
impressive but certainly pretty good
with the cover back on here wow really
weird how this fits on totally different
than any other HTC devices kind of gonna
take some practice to get used to okay
there we go and let's boot it up and
while it's booting up let's take a look
at how this device compares to its
predecessor the Desire HD which of
course the Specht very similarly has the
same amount of RAM same size screen
what's really different is the processor
1.2 gigahertz dual core here one
gigahertz single core here and the
amount of or the amount of pixels on the
screen so 960 down by 540 across there's
the photo phone logo and so you get a
different aspect ratio as you can see
here much more wide screen compared to
the 800 down by 480 across well right
off the bat it's really interesting to
see HTC with this higher resolution
display the the notification screen or
bar up here is so much thinner because
the pixels are smaller then we found on
previous HTC devices and of course we
get the newest version of HTC Sense HTC
Sense 3.0 so men
Changez this is the most dramatic
overhaul to HTC sense since the
beginning and here it is next to the
galaxy s2 which we're going to compare
both of these devices in a future video
but has a little bit of a preview we've
got a different CPU here more RAM this
device is thinner but the the mains
downside to the galaxy s2 compared to
the sensation is that the screen
resolution is lower so you get the kind
of old-school now at this point in 2011
WVGA screen here and of course you get
the full q HD resolution in the HTC
Sensation so we ran skip that we finally
we're getting here to the to the home
screen on the HTC Sensation again this
screen really pops it's a Super LCD
display quite high resolution compared
to previous generation HTC devices let's
jump into the web real quick just want
to see what happens in terms of Internet
connectivity looks like a little bit of
setup is required to get it to work
hopefully it'll work seamlessly on
t-mobile's network but we've got a lot
more coming up we'll mess with it and
talk about it
we'll also post some first impressions
on pocket now calm but it's thin it's
light it feels less substantial than the
desire HD which may be a good or bad
thing depending on if you like a heavy
device or not but it's gotten a lot of
fit and finish especially with this
really sweet curved display just a very
smooth looking device HTC's high-end for
2011 is here the sensation we've got a
ton more coming up talking about this
device if you liked the video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching and stay tuned for more that's
it for now
