pocket now calm in this video we're
going to talk about to calling features
that will be included in the new HTC
devices starting with the hd2 with
touchflo 3d 2.5 which we have installed
on this device right here so if you
remember back touchflo 3d to point o had
a feature where when you got to call in
if you turn the device on its face it
with silence the ringer really smart
feature along those lines there are two
other calling features that are included
in touch flo 3d 2.5 that are pretty neat
let's take a look so we're going to go
into sound and display and the first
feature we're going to talk about is
quiet ring on pick up so the idea is
when your phone rings you pick up the
phone and you already know that
someone's calling so you don't need it
to keep ringing so loudly and it quiets
the ringer so let's do a little test of
that to see how it works hopefully you
can tell on the video how well it works
ok so the phone's ringing you can get a
sense for the volume right now and i'll
wait for the third ring and pick it up
and you'll hear how it is now
significantly quieter probably about
fifty percent more quiet and the other
feature is called pocket mode the idea
here is that if you have the phone in
your pocket or in a bag it will ring
louder which makes a lot of sense
because you can't hear it as well when
it's in your pocket or in a bag the wave
does this is probably with the proximity
sensor not exactly sure but that's
probably how it works so let's give it a
test by putting the phone in a bag let's
turn off pocket mode and see how loud
the ringer is ok so we're going to put
the phone in this little netbook bag and
seal up the zipper and then call the
phone pocket mood is off here goes
so of course the ringers muted okay and
let's take it out and turn pocket mode
on here we go and let's try it again
let's zip it up here goes and there's
the ringer a little bit louder it's
really hard to tell in the video
probably but i can tell you standing
behind the camera the ringer is
definitely louder so that was a quick
look at some of the new calling features
coming out on the HTC hd2 for lots of
hd2 content coming up very soon be sure
