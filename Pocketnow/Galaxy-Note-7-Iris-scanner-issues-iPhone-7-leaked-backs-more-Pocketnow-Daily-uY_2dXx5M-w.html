that the iris scanner might not be such
a good idea leaks of the iphone 7 claim
that the color options might not be
pretty different and if you want to go
look for pok√©mon's you might want to
switch to t-mobile I'm hiya Ravenna and
if I'm standing funny it's called a
sprained ankle a result of a bad run
just bear with me oh and this is fogging
out daily the official news today begin
with Pokemon go I try to avoid it I
really did but the deal is actually
quite compelling if you are currently
crazy about that game you might want to
switch to t-mobile or at least give it a
try n t mobile as well there's just this
announcement we're up to August ninth
you'll be able to use Pokemon go without
eating up your bucket of data pretty
much a binge on four games and that
makes a lot of sense now if we move over
to standard deals obviously other US
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T already have their
buy one get one free deal starting today
I T&amp;amp;T you can find the vices from
Samsung like the galaxy s7 galaxy s6
even from last year node 5 etc and find
these devices for buy one get one free
in addition to the LG g5 the LG v10
there are some devices from hcc like the
189 as well the list is actually quite
compelling you can learn more than like
in the description and since we
mentioned LG those of you that were
disappointed by the g5 i'm not on that
list and absolutely everything but i
cannot wait to see what the v 11 is
gonna be and by the way no it's not
going to be v 11 actually rumors claim
that it's going to be called the beat 20
and that we should be expecting it in
September now what exactly is going to
change from the g5 or how LG is going to
approach this is going to be interesting
mainly because the company's executive
team is no longer the same let's see
what we get and speaking of possible non
dramatic changes we were expecting some
sort of like space black and deep blue
coming to the iphone 7 but we've got
some very interesting leaked shells
showing us that these color options are
not coming to the regular iphone 7 at
least it seems that we're just getting
the typical rose gold space grey the
gold and the silver very end
which makes us wonder if even the color
options might be a plus only thing
that's going to be weird from apple and
finally the very let's call it
interesting news today we've got some
leaks of the galaxy note 7 and the
interface for the iris scanner and this
is the problem with this thing it seems
that you have to like get your phone
close like very close to your face for
the iris scanner to work it makes sense
but we wonder exactly how that iris
scanner is going to be any more
practical in the average fingerprint
scanner where you don't have to hold the
phone close to you or anything true it's
cool to have that added security and
maybe it makes all the sense in the
world for you to just use the iris
scanner on certain applications but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that that is going to be a
gimmick or do you think that it would
make sense for you to just switch
between the typical fingerprint scanner
and use the iris scanner in my case I
don't think it's gonna hold a feature
but trust me I can't wait to get my
hands on the no7 to let you know more
