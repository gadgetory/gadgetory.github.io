calm and we are going to unbox the
sprint HTC hero now we're looking at the
box right now and you can see the phone
is right here and usually they try to
show the phone and kind of an actual
size area but if you can't do that you
know you got to show it next to
something to give it some scale and so
here's a woman but um either she's
really small of the phone is like seven
feet tall and the woman doesn't have any
arms she's kind of amputated which is
kind of strange because we really do
need your hands in order to use this
phone anyway let's take a look opening
