future and different galaxy note edge a
significant amount of people switch from
Android for the iphone 6 and as much
innovation as there is inside the apple
watch tear downs reveal room for
improvement I'm hi meri beta and my
monster cold is back sorry guys but this
is parking out daily the official news
today talk about Apple as most of the
media was like yeah right whatever it's
in cook came on record on the previous
conference call to state that a lot of
people had switched from Android to the
iphone in the United States we still
don't have us numbers but we did get
numbers from Europe back than at least
for surveys and that we've got the
official data thirty-three percent of
the people that bought the new iphone
were switchers from Angela for reasons
that were not offered but the yeah it
seems that android oems like Samsung
have a steep hill to climb other
official news have more apple watch tear
downs this time from chip works in ARS
technica we've got a full analysis in
the links of the description but in a
nutshell first of all the Apple watch's
processor has a lot of innovation
because while they were able to pack
everything the motherboard is 30
components and everything in a twenty
six millimeter chip which is crazy
according to them but even more
interesting is the fact that there is a
lot of room for improvement when it
comes to the processor apparently it was
built under samson's 28 nanometer
process at a time when there's already a
40 nanometer process and even a 20
nanometer on the iPhone 6 so yeah we do
know where Apple is going to be headed
with the Apple watch too now the oneplus
CEO was recently on record to talk about
the 1+2 oddly we should expect it later
this year and first of all it seems that
we're gonna get snapdragon 810 processor
we're getting an either 5.5 inch or 6
inch quad HD display three gigs of ram
2.5 feet glass and a lot of really great
things in this phone but its price tag
won't be the same apparently it'll cost
four hundred dollars which is still not
bad this is a great phone we just wish
we didn't watch now a company that
really wants to succeed and has it when
it comes to wearables is Samson even
though they pretty much pioneered most
of the market but yeah we do know that
the come
he's working on it Samsung Orbis you
know it's rotating vessel and all the
new innovations that are coming but if
you were wanting this product to come
out now it seems that Samsung wants to
take its time up to the point where we
should expect it until Eva 2015 along
with the galaxy note5 and which makes
all the sense in the world previous
Samsung only where polls were launched
in that period as well so we'll keep you
posted and finally for the very hot news
of the day or should we save rumors we
get more details from trusted sources
are on the galaxy note 5 and galaxy note
edge next variant we don't know how
that's going to be called but first of
all it seems that we've got this really
interesting new exitos chip on the
galaxy note 5 apparently we're going x
and o's here apparently it'll include
both the RAM chips and the storage
inside the same chip of the processor so
this is new innovation that's coming
which is great and yeah apparently will
either get the quad HD or 4k display
whatever Sam things coming up with
addition to other things so they look to
the description but even though
interesting the Galaxy Note edge that's
coming in the future well apparently
still have the edges but it'll stick to
a Snapdragon 808 for reasons we don't
understand that's not necessarily bad
but apparently it'll also have less
respects than the galaxy note5 for other
reasons we don't know and it leads me to
the question of the day after you seen
the galaxy s6 edge are you looking for
either the Galaxy Note edge in the
future or the galaxy note 5 which is the
one that you're looking forward to in my
case I currently use the Galaxy Note
edge I don't love it to death but yeah
I'll give it a try as long as they
figure something better out but leave us
