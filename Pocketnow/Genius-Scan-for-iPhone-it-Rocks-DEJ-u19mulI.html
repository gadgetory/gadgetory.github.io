pocket now calm even though it's the
21st century there is still a need to
fax and scan things perhaps you're
signing a contract or some sort of form
maybe you're doing something in tax time
but there is the occasional need to
actually send something a lot of people
will receive forms or contracts
electronically but your stuff to get it
into your computer well there's an
awesome app for iPhone called genius
scan which will allow you to take a
picture of a form or a contract or
something like that and actually turn it
into a PDF right on your device let's
take a look
okay so here we go this is a free
application and again it's called genius
scan here's the icon over here and it
works really really well especially with
a great camera on the iPhone 4 so I'm
going to try to take a picture of this
document as best as possible I'm going
to kind of hover above it okay there's
the picture that I got i'm going to
click use and that's going to try to
guess the boundaries of the document and
sometimes it gets it right sometimes it
needs a little bit of help so here we
stretch it and click select it's going
to crop and now it's going to turn it
into a black-and-white document but i
want to actually in color just say get
all the detail there and now i'm going
to save it as a new document and from
here I can actually email it as a PDF
and it would show up in my inbox
literally as a PDF really smart
additionally if there is another page to
this form I can take a picture of it
again and add it to this document so you
have a multiple page PDF really smart
this is also really good if you're in a
college situation or classroom setting
where you want to take a picture of the
whiteboard or the blackboard so you can
take a picture of it with genius can
turn it into a PDF send it to yourself
an email for later reference really cool
application again it's free it's called
genius scan and it is extremely useful
especially if you don't have a fax
machine or scanner which most people
don't these days please thumbs up this
video if you enjoyed it and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
