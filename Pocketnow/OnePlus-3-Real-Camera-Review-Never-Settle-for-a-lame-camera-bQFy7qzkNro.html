dollars shouldn't we expect a few
compromises when compared to more
expensive flagship phones I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket nap and here's
our real camera review of the one plus
three buckle up folks we have a lot of
ground to cover and I'm gonna move
pretty quick first a little housekeeping
the 16 megapixel camera on the one plus
three is utilizing a slightly smaller
one over two point eight inch image
sensor with an F 2.0 aperture and a
hybrid hardware plus software image
stabilization system this Sony sensor
has one point one two micron pixels and
uses phase detect autofocus reproduce
this review at UHD resolution to
preserve video quality though image
crops will be used periodically to show
fine detail starting off with exposure
and saturation this phone largely uses
spot metering so it adjusts the
brightness of your photos based on where
you tap to focus this is my favorite way
of ensuring that your shots come out
exposed for what you thought was
important in direct sun the one plus
three is really good at exposing for
your subject don't like many phones I
still find that photos produced lean
just a touch bright maybe a quarter to a
third stop brighter than they might need
to be blues and greens or vibrant and I
pleasing those skies can sometimes be a
touch blown out starting to veer a
slightly more aqua color especially when
looking at brighter subjects near your
horizon and there is a very fine grain
pattern to uniform colors but it's not
particularly noticeable unless pixel
peeping and pixel peeping is bad so just
don't do that happily this JPEG
rendering rains in Browns and earthy
colors preventing rusts from looking too
orange and delivering just the right
balance of accuracy against the warmer
southern california afternoon light here
yellows fare well thanks to the spot
metering though this is an aggressively
saturated image we at least aren't
clipping these highlights reds are
always difficult for our cameras to
expose for properly and I found a
perfect patch of Bougainville blossoms
to showcase this there are actually two
distinctly different patches of blossoms
here these higher flowers are closer to
pink and then mixed in in the lower
batch of blossoms here there are flowers
that are closer to red
but this camera in trying to create a
juicy final photo has kind of mashed
them all up into a sizzling magenta this
issue is not unique to the 1+3 but I
happen to find a great subject to
demonstrate this problem looking at the
raw file you can see clearer differences
between the two batches of flowers and
white subjects and bright light are
extremely difficult to expose for but
here again spot metering at least takes
the edge off most of the clipped
highlights we might see from lesser
camera systems though we know this isn't
likely a top-of-the-line sensor from
Sony it still displays solid dynamic
range purposely over exposing a shot by
three stops were able to get back almost
three stops worth of information from
the scene though in underexposed areas
especially at night we're only able to
brighten up about a stop maybe a stop
and a half where noise is already an
issue before we even try to brighten the
shot up more about those noise issues
later on in this video quick look at
file sizes JPEGs are between three and
eight megabytes per exposure while RAW
files weigh in at 31 megabytes per shot
every time you hit the shutter you could
be eating up to 40 megabytes of storage
now there's no memory card slot to
offload files but thankfully you'll
start out with 64 gigabytes of storage
built in and just a quick look at
software this camera app is really clean
and simple a big shutter button takes
your shot or starts your video a slide
in from the left will walk you through
your major modes like photos videos
panorama in slow motion the manual mode
is well featured with focus shutter and
ISO controls you can adjust white
balance but I don't like this part of
the layout every other mode this dial
delivers granular adjustments but on
white balance you really only have four
major options and there's no way to set
a specific Kelvin adjustment in between
these major settings also while I
genuinely do like the overall app layout
it is a bummer that the shutter will
always encroach on your sixteen by nine
shots there's this slice of your
viewfinder permanently blocked when
shooting video for example back to some
photos macro shots suffer slightly from
a smaller sensor and a longer minimum
focusing distance you can scooch up to
around three inches away from your lens
which is on the better end of
mid-pack though falls behind phones like
the galaxy s7 and LG g5 the sensor size
means the depth of field blur falls
somewhere in between the busier
backgrounds you might see on an iPhone
and the smoother blur from Samsung this
year oneplus is not the best but it's
far from the worst most noticeable at
those macro distances but we do still
land playful little bouquet balls when
light filters through leaves and looking
at autofocus the phase detection system
here does its job reliably well a smooth
action pulls into your subject though
there is a tendency to overshoot a
little and wobble back but it's accurate
and easy to use again not the fastest
but we rarely encountered any misfires
outside of busy macro situations which
are difficult for many phones looking at
white balance the oneplus 3 on its own
landed to touch on the warm side during
bright summer California Sun but output
feels appropriate given the lighting
conditions occasionally this is an issue
when your subject has warmer colors
yellows and Red's but I was happy to see
that shaded shots avoided the trap of
using too cold of a white balance to
compensate have you been watching these
reviews I've often complained about HDR
high dynamic range on Android phones
basically being a shadow brightening
mode and the oneplus 3 does little to
disavow me of that notion the HDR mode
here does a great job of pulling detail
out of darker areas of your shot but
will also brighten up the bright areas
of your photos great HDR photos will
pull info out of both your highlights
and shadows and the 1+3 just joins all
the other Android phones out there which
only nail half of that equation but for
fun features panorama stitching is
pretty great we're seeing some jagged
edges on these power lines but they at
least have the right overall shape and
the phone does a terrific job of
handling exposure while panning through
the scene no small feat considering how
drastic lighting can change when you
pivot 180 degrees and yeah there is an 8
megapixel selfie camera onboard I can't
say I see any remarkable differences
here between the oneplus and other
flagship selfie cameras so well done
there ok back to the main camera and
let's look at some low-light photos
the combo of smaller sensor and higher
resolution means we're in for some
noisier shots throughout all of these
night photos we're losing out on quite a
bit of detail because of this ISO grain
as long as you can supply some light it
helps take the edge off but the sides of
the buildings here have quite a bit of
noise going on less light means we'll
see even more grain as we check out our
creepy tunnel though I'm glad to see a
minimum of distracting colored lens
flares or chromatic aberrations the 1+3
nails are creepy gate great dark
exposure and the white balance is pretty
close to the actual gross yellow
lighting you would see here in real life
and on our walkway we see great color
accuracy between these two not quite the
same shade of white bulbs though the
hotspots under each light are eating up
a bit more of the wall and that detail
isn't well recovered when looking at the
raw file now looking at a flower lit by
a porch light the camera lands a great
exposure of an orange and red flower lit
by a yellow light though detail all
around is very soft and pushing this
camera to its absolute limits in almost
no light this is a terrible exposure but
the camera was able to find focus
joining Samsung and most phones with
laser assisted autofocus as the few that
will lock onto a subject like this now
there is a setting on the phone which
takes multiple shots and in software
will reduce noise it works well for
stationary subjects but won't be affixed
for all situations and it's a separate
option to toggle opposite HDR it's up to
the user to remember when and where this
mode is appropriate now your photos will
turn out less noisy but again we are
still going to be blurring a little bit
of detail to get that smoother looking
image at some point software just can't
fight the physics of having more pixels
on a smaller sensor looking at the
manual controls we can have a little fun
with some long exposures we get up to a
30 second shutter which even on a light
traffic night was a bit too much but
it's really easy to dial in what you
need to lend a cool streaking tail light
shot okay moving to video the one plus
three delivers mid-pack video quality
with somewhere around 40 megabit per
second file sizes exposure and
saturation performance here is nearly
identical to what we saw though we lack
any
kind of manual mode for video instead
only getting basic exposure compensation
which is at least better than nothing
there is a quirk to the focus and
exposure system here though when
focusing stills the camera will reset
your focus and exposure after a couple
seconds that's frustrating enough when
trying to set up for a still photo but
the same holds true while shooting video
tapping the screen will set focus and
exposure and a couple seconds later it
gets reset the user has to remember to
tap and hold on the screen to lock the
focus and exposure which is actually
kind of a pain and with something even I
would often forget to do after days of
shooting on this camera also though we
save a respectable file size it's very
common to see compression artifact ting
in uniform sections of video this camera
kind of wigged out on the California
hills in the background of the shot and
it's really common to see pixelation in
blue sky and around clouds talking about
video we can get a better look at image
stabilization while shooting UHD video
there's only hardware optical
stabilization in use it does a
reasonable job of smoothing out
footballs though we should all be used
to a bit of jell-o as the lens wobbles
to correct for movement there were a
number of shots though that while trying
to hold as still as I could I still saw
a lot of wiggle in the camera output
there is no 60 frame per second 1080p
mode that I could find but dropping to
HD auto magically added software
stabilization to the mix and this hybrid
stabilization is pretty effective it
won't produce the Steadicam like float
we can create from Apple's camera system
but it also doesn't suffer that shifty
stuttery look that LG's dual
stabilization can create zoom
performance is also better than mid-pack
the 1+3 nicely balances reach against
blowing the image up it's a lower
quality to be sure but having a little
extra resolution to play with helps here
in preserving some image integrity audio
capture is also unimpressive these
microphones are easily overloaded and
the noise reduction filtering is
completely ham-fisted destroying the
sound if there's any constant hum or
background audio
looking at an exposure test moving from
dark to bright and back these
transitions aren't the most pleasant we
don't see that blooming effect we might
on an Apple or Samsung but the
adjustments are quick and efficient
maybe a touch abrupt but this camera
rarely over corrects we do lose focus a
couple times in making the spin and this
camera really does not seem to like
lateral pans but white balance also
stays on point with only subtle
adjustments through the scene again
we're happy to see that the fun features
like slow-motion are handled well here
too this isn't the highest quality image
when looking at individual frames but we
get a nicely smoothed out slow 720p
video the gripe here is for folks who
like to edit as these videos were saved
with the slow-motion effect baked in no
speed ramping or audio info for you so
let's wrap this up this video is long
enough already where does that leave us
with the camera on the oneplus 3 getting
back to our initial question about
marketing slogans and never settling at
a three hundred and ninety nine dollar
price of course we have to settle in a
few areas talking about the camera on
this phone means we kind of need to
split the discussion up into two
factions looking at just the price this
is one of the best performers we've
played with around $400 it's simply
excellent hardware and software at this
tier looking at overall performance
it completely shames phones like the
Xperia X we recently reviewed and it
goes toe-to-toe with the iPhone se
winning as many battles as it loses it's
genuinely a fun and mostly
frustration-free camera to use and we're
really happy with this shooter when
looking at the competition near this
price many folks will try to compare
this against proper flagship phones
though and honestly it just can't quite
unseat more expensive options but to be
sure there are diminishing returns when
coughing up another $200 or more for a
phone but there are still returns to be
had maybe it's better low-light
performance or softer background blur
maybe faster focus speeds better audio
or
more robust video controls but there are
plenty of cameras with options that can
best the shooter on the one plus three
you just have to pay more for that
better performance one plus as a company
has been distancing itself from the old
flagship killer moniker it used to use
and rightfully so is this thing can't
quite kill flagships but we're happy to
report that for many people the oneplus
3 doesn't need to kill flagships since
it's an above average performer at a
mid-pack price as always thanks so much
