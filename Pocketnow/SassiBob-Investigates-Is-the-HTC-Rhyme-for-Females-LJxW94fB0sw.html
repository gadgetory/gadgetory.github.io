I've got the HTC Rhyme and I decided
that I needed to go out into the real
world and see if people liked this film
now some people say that HTC is
stereotyping women by designing a phone
in this way
HTC claims it's for men and women that's
on a lady's phone it's you know well let
me ask you is this car gender neutral
it's I think we should ask some women at
this salon right here and find out like
lightweight
nice feel to it the images are really
vibrant I like to carousel motion you
don't like it - what about how do you
like the color
I really wish so if it was the same
price as a phone you'd normally buy
would you consider purchasing welcome
under wasn't issue I take personally I
will buy nobody asks about the specs for
the phone even the lady that worked for
spread she didn't look like she didn't
even care she's like it's purple I love
it and it's pretty carousel the guy
didn't even ask me there so hey we'll
see it's purple and it's pretty oh my
god we found some boys have you owned a
smartphone before so I was running down
the street and I totally came across a
bunch of cute college girls and here
they are
so the Beats headphones come with the
ball
so what kind of phones do you all have
you all have my phones yeah it's a phone
company we manufacture the phones you
can only get that perfect so what kind
of processes now it's better than the
iPhone do you think you would use the
charm in everyday life I think it would
be a solid be good somewhere maybe at
work every phone has to be out of the
way
the speed of the processor when keeping
fine phone it's more said the color
would and I don't think I could really
have a purple phone what about you do
you think you could have a purple phone
of course I could I think the purple is
fine I think the color is a mommy issues
so you all like the purple you don't
like the purple what's the most
important thing about your phone we just
think of the color sorry yeah I like it
but it's all we care about is you like
it and she doesn't like the color no I
don't care about color this show is a
different color the Android lovers would
you guys consider maybe trading in this
your your phone that you have now for
one of these no probably not because I
guess this is me so used to the ones you
have all right so we need to find some
dudes I think this is a good place let's
go see I would say I would definitely
use it your friends for me this is one
more thing to get in the way I wouldn't
go out and purchase one became free I
might try it personally I would think
it's annoying I like the color would you
buy this phone
this underwear exact same code my black
joyed axe my original intern poem it's
not so bright anymore because my hair
was dyed perfect I let a lot of people
ask me where I got that colorful phone
do you think the plum is a masculine
enough version a purple that we gotta
find a place that seriously has people
that won't like purple that aren't women
what is the deal with this why why
aren't men and women meeting my
stereotype for my brain right now I just
I don't I don't understand this is New
Orleans I guess purple is a color for
New Orleans you know it's the royal
color or whatever but I just don't get
it where's my Houma folks at that's what
I'm saying
you know I just don't get it we are in
the French Quarter on the streets of New
Orleans so we need more male perspective
so we got this gentleman here does so
actually this is 3.5
you know
very similar phone already
that looks like a blackberry but in the
tub boy there's not really like those
and navigation features of this phone
man by the batter left oh and that's why
you had to course yeah you see that
right good cord huh okay so another
thing I'm realizing here on Bourbon
Street is a lot of these people are
drinking a lot they're partying it up
you know and the guy back there just
dropped the phone and I saved it from
ultimate destruction just because I was
holding the charm though hey I mean you
can you can attach it to your pocket or
your purse and it's a good thing for
alcoholics
I guess I'll give the seat you own a
phone at this color C plus a plus a plus
a plus
I would definitely on a phone is color
color no I would not
this is what I have to say not the
greatest poem but for Jordan box that is
an Aegis phone right here
ah
all right so I would also make this
video and I was convinced that I was
gonna be able to look Jeff Gordon right
in the face and be like you're wrong
this phone is for women it's like I was
wrong I proved myself wrong it's not
supposed to happen this is science less
women ended up liking the phone than I
thought would like the phone and way
more men than I thought
this it's just so mind-blowing I just I
don't even know what to say more than
half of the men I interviewed liked the
phone that they didn't even either they
didn't care that it was purple or they
loved the color
I thought HTC with stereotyping so bad
so we started out I thought I needed to
go to you know stereotypical places to
get stereotypical opinions right but
we're we're in New Orleans and New
Orleans is a very different kind of
place people people are color proud here
it's very different so um we decided to
go to Bourbon Street because there's
there's a lot of tourists there right if
you want a national opinion I guess
that's the best place to go to that's
convenient for us to drive to and it
works a little bit more of my favor but
not not nearly enough my personal
opinion I love this phone I would almost
rather flee the country than have to
send it back so what did I learn from
this one New Orleans is a terrible place
for a national survey to men like plumb
way more than I thought they did and
three the charm isn't only for women but
also for drunk people
you win HTC you win yeah what's your
name I'm Bob Bob Bob
sorry guys I'm sorry about that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
