and most of that time has been focused
on this dual camera experiment so how
does it handle other tasks like you know
being a phone I'm Juan Carlos back now
for PocketNow and here's our full review
of the Huawei p9 Huawei is delivering an
impressively thin device here almost a
millimeter thinner than a galaxy s7 this
clean rectangular design feels nice in
the hand it's an attractive affair
improving on the look of budget
offerings like the honor 5x accents like
thin chamfered edges and flush camera
lenses helped this feel a bit more
unique a little less derivative than
some recent iphone or galaxy clones we
might be able to point to now we're
reviewing the base model p9 with three
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gig of storage
which also has NFC that's oddly lacking
on the higher-end 64 gigabyte p9 now
this unit did have support for 18 t
bands in the United States and we were
able to use big blue's LTE with data
performance fairly consistent to what we
found on galaxies and LG's a 5.2 inch
display greets you with an HD resolution
panel of no significant compromise there
is this is a respectable LCD with solid
viewing angles and good if a bit over
saturated color we did find it to be a
touch dimmer than competing LCDs but
still usable outdoors for the most part
folks who want to jump onto the next USB
cable specification will be happy to see
a type-c connector down at the bottom of
this phone and this wouldn't be a Huawei
review if we didn't mention how terrific
this rear mounted fingerprint sensor is
generally more accessible for folks of
all hand sizes easy to train and
genuinely quick at unlocking your phone
even from funky angles it also wouldn't
be a foie way review if we didn't look
at this emui launcher but we've covered
this software in greater depth on
previous Huawei reviews but the long and
short of the skin is if you like iOS
this will get you pretty close to the
look of an iPhone
there is no app drawer so all of your
apps are added to new home screens and
organization happens by grouping and
folders though this can get really
cluttered when you throw widgets into
the mix if you don't like this layout
you can clean up quite a bit of it by
installing another launcher I ran
with Nova for most of my time using the
p9 and looking in performance the kuren
9:55 chipset with something of an
unknown this processor seems letty
powerful for covering the basics
navigating the UI pulling up email and
texting apps or using social media
services and it benchmarks well against
the galaxy s7 looking at some gaming
implosion played as smooth as on any
other flagship which is good
surprisingly Marvel future fight which
stutters on a Galaxy s7 or LG g5 played
more fluidly on the p9 it's not quite i
phone smooth but this is impressive for
an unfamiliar chipset even for the lower
resolution screen the most interesting
aspect of the p9 has to be this dual
camera setup influenced by Leica - 12
megapixel cameras one full RGB color the
other monochrome to maximize light for
every shot we have the most in-depth
review of this camera available online
linked in the description of this video
the recap for that full review the app
is nicely laid out gestures slide modes
and settings into view and pulling this
bar activates the pro mode for full
manual controls it's nicely organized
and happily at no point does the app
ever completely remove you from
composing a shot this dual sensor camera
produces stills unlike any phone we've
used before Huawei is able to deliver
brighter images with more dynamic range
than phones with more traditional sensor
design the photos from the p9 can be
downright stunning while still photos
are terrific the video produced from
this phone looks about two generations
behind current frontrunner this camera
maxes out at a 60 frames per second
1080p but is unable to use any software
stabilization in that mode it's a shaky
output to be sure and not very pleasant
to look at now taking a listen to the p9
this petite frame packs a plenty
loudspeaker for a bottom firing unit and
it competes well against other single
speaker solutions this year
and headphone audio is nicely mid-pack
falling behind Apple and HTC but
stepping above Samsung and the built-in
DAC on the LG g5 there is a DTS mode
which can deliver a bit more oomph when
you need it but it also plays some
tricks with altering the EQ which
purists likely won't enjoy and for such
a thin phone we are happy to see a 3000
milliamp hour battery and run time seems
to fall mid pack for phones with similar
capacities and screen sizes performing
immediate tests streaming 30 minutes of
HD video at 50% brightness over Wi-Fi
the p9 drained 7% of its battery over
several moderate days of use we were
handily able to make it to dinner time
with the little room to spare for our
camera test days needing to top off
earlier in the afternoon I couldn't
actually use the included charger with
its European plug connecting the phone
to an LG quick charger for 30 minutes
only provided a 25% jump we would assume
a slightly faster recharge rate using
the supplied charger so let's wrap this
up where does that leave us with the
huawei p9 in discussing this phone these
Leica cameras have been the topic most
focused on happily it's a largely
successful photography experiment this
Hardware genuinely delivers some of the
best-looking stills we've ever seen from
a phone but folks who shoot a lot of
video will probably be disappointed
overall though Huawei yet again
demonstrates they can deliver a
competitive device the p9 won't outright
win many battles but there really aren't
any deal-breakers we can find lurking in
this hardware this phone is nice and I
really enjoyed my time using it it's a
well-rounded flagship and offers up a
few unique tricks for folks wanting to
shop something a bit different for their
next smartphone purchase as always
