around the corner and we hear more on
its preview the HTC One m9 gets leaked
and you don't need the leaks to know how
it looks and can you believe that it
will um still want a flip phone to
survive I'm high metal Iveta and as the
cold gets colder I hope you don't mind
the body sneeze a little this is
sparking out daily the official news
today has to do with Google the company
has been doing an amazing job at
updating its android applications and
the recent one was YouTube we have some
aesthetic changes in addition to other
features that came with the application
but interesting google didn't mention
that we were getting filters for youtube
uploads and if you dig deep within the
application it seems that the feature
will be enabled at some point so stay
tuned as we learn more from YouTube even
though do we really need Instagram for
YouTube at some point now let us know in
the comments what are the folks that
made a ton of headlines earlier last
year was the sharp aquos because there
is simply no bezel in its design it's
probably the coolest smartphones that we
saw even though it was focused on the
mid-tier market but interesting the
company plans to bring us more our close
love at this time with a flip phone the
flip phone that's kind of three point
four inch display in a diagonal and a
Snapdragon 400 processor the specific
Asians aren't really that bad we'll
probably see it at MWC 2015 now in some
interesting leaks Qualcomm's roadmap
just got spilled and we have the
Snapdragon 820 being mentioned in
addition to the Snapdragon 815 we also
get the snapdragon 616 626 25 and 629
the differences are quite vast lakes of
this root River full details but in a
nutshell the things that we're getting
here is support for ddr4 Ram which means
more speed that's great and apparently
we're gonna get support for more LTE
bands out of the box which is great
again learn more in the description now
one of the smart phones that we're
waiting for on March 1st is the HTC One
m9 aka the HTC Hema and if you've seen a
One m8 well the leaked photos that we
just landed today pretty much show us
that the one m9 looks almost identical
the changes are definitely in
specifications and hopefully color
options and probably the polish since
the gunmetal does
sign of my One m8 doesn't really look
that good anymore but interesting it
seems that first of all the Shatford
edges apparently will go away and the
camera design is going to be a little
more squared than it was before but then
again everything else looks identical we
will keep you posted of MWC and finally
for the very interesting news and
reports of the day Microsoft's Windows
10 mobile variant should be announced
tomorrow now notice we say announcement
back at the desktop announcement that
happened late last year we had a tech
preview and everything we have a full
video on that but apparently the mobile
preview will not be ready for the event
apparently it'll happen sometime in
February according to very trusted
sources you could pretty much put that
in the bank we'll have a full editorial
roundtable discussing everything we see
a tomorrow's event but in addition to
this apparently we will also see the
touch version of Microsoft Office and
the project beam which is a Microsoft
helmet for gaming really interesting but
it really leads me to the question of
the day what is the biggest expectation
that you have tomorrow for Windows 10
what does Microsoft need to launch
tomorrow for you to be completely sold
on a Windows 10 smartphone or tablet or
computer let us know in the comments
down below in my particular case I would
say that Windows Phone 8.1 ddr1 did
enough for me to move into Windows Phone
but let us know what you want in the
comments down below
Fran's es you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming sure you follow us on
target our common stretching Tube
channel as well you can also follow me
on Twitter high mound or squattery meta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am hi nobody
better thank you very much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
