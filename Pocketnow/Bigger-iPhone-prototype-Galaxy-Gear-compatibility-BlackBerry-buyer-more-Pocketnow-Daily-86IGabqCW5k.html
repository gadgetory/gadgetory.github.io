an iphone with a bigger display samson
talks about the compatibility of their
galaxy gear with other phones and
blackberry is already in a desperate
need for a buyer I'm hi mera iveta and
seriously think about it if we saved up
some money and got together we could
probably even by that company this is
pocket now daily let's thursday off with
the interesting news as santa has
already confirmed that their version of
the galaxy s4 with a snapdragon 800
processor and lte-advanced will be
deployed to europe and the reason why is
because there are some carriers that are
already confirming that they will be
bringing lte-advanced to their markets
so it's hard to tell you exactly which
carriers these are just make sure you
call your carrier and find out if
they're bringing LTE advanced and yeah
this is probably a very bad time to buy
a gs4 and if you thought that Microsoft
was going to halt the production of a
next version of the surface just because
of the fiasco of the first one well
think again apparently the company is
already working on newer one and it
probably will retain the same design
just to be able to sell those old
housings and just bring new
specifications and as it turns out the
company is also innovating with the
touch cover as they're now bringing a
battery integrated into it to provide
more power to the surface which kind of
definitely makes sense I wonder what
took them so long now a company that's
really struggling is blackberry so much
so that their market share is pretty
much on the floor and the wall street
journal is already reporting that high
level investors that even sources are
confirming that the company is looking
for quick auction as early as november
of this year it's hard to know the
future buyer of the company is actually
going to keep the platform so if you're
currently rocking a z10 or a cute n you
could probably return the phone this is
probably a good time we're not really
sure what's going to happen to the
platform and especially because we don't
know who the buyer is and if this buyers
HP you know where that's going now
believe it or not new reports have Apple
testing more prototypes of a future
iphone with a bigger display and
apparently the company is testing phones
as big as 6 inches which I do doubt that
will ever reach the market we know that
Apple is one of those companies that
loves prototyping and even if we find
prototypes in the market of a device
being tested that doesn't necessarily
mean that the company is ever going to
bring it to market so it's really hard
to know and
yeah will most probably not see it this
year since their event this on some
tempered 10th most probably next year
let's see what happens and finally for
the hot news of the day those of you
considering the samsung galaxy note 3 or
the galaxy gear can pre-order tomorrow
on verizon wireless yes thank you laura
this is not an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive even
though we don't have any specific dates
as to when you can pick it up now in the
case of the galaxy gear samsung is
already talking about compatibility
apparently their ideas to make it
compatible with as many phones as they
can but wait get this apparently these
phones have to be compatible with
samsung's api's which is kind of tricky
and as it turns out you need android 4.3
and you need bluetooth 4.0 le so that
even rules the galaxy s4 out of the
picture because even though you do have
the version of bluetooth you don't have
Android 4.3 and if you have a carrier
variant of the galaxy s4 that's gonna be
even trickier so that leaves it to the
question of the day after knowing all
the compatibility problems of the galaxy
gear meaning if you don't buy a galaxy
note 3 the watch is pretty much useless
are you still getting it or are you
waiting to see what happens in my
particular case honestly I still don't
even know if I want that watch but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think friends is always for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the swamp phone inside world mushy
