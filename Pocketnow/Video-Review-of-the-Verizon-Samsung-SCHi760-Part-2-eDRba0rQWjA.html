pocketnow.com this is part two of the
video review and the verizon samsung
i760 today we're going to take a look at
some of the features samsung has
implemented on this device the first bud
feature we're going to look at is the
lock and unlock you can lock the phone
by pressing and holding the star key
this is very much like most standard
cell phones to unlock the device you hit
the left softkey button and you can
either use the screen and press the
unlock button there or the star key and
this unlocks the phone for you the
second feature is dialing and you can
actually dial directly from the Today
screen using the numeric keypad so if I
press the number 8 the phone
automatically searches through my
history and my contacts for entries that
have an 8 a t.a you or V which are the
letters associated with the number 8 on
the keypad as you press digits it
narrows the search for you until you
find the selection you want and then you
use the d-pad to make the call let's
take a look at the included voice
command application the application is
initiated with a press and hold of the
large button on the side of the unit
this button also initiates the Start
menu when the application is initiated a
microphone icon appears at the top of
the screen along with a beat to let you
know that it is ready to accept your
prompts there is no need to train voice
command although you should enunciate
and speak slowly it also works with most
Bluetooth headsets I've tried so let's
go ahead and test it
start excel so as you can see it started
Excel Oh didn't press it long enough
press it again start today start today
now we're going to try doing some
dialing call Jane Doe mobile no dial
star 86 stop Thanks correct yes and it
initiates the call to my voicemail on
the system will just go ahead and
terminate the call another nice little
feature that's available is for the unit
to tell you what time it is what time is
it I'm 47 p.m. another nice feature is
the ability to turn off the screen while
you're in a call so your face does not
accidentally press the screen or
activate an application this function is
based on a timer which can be set at 5
10 30 or 60 seconds once you press the
end call button the screen turns back on
this is a very nice feature so I can
show you this by pressing let's go back
to my voicemail and within five seconds
the screen will actually turn off and
here it is off and as soon as I end the
call it comes back on
that about does it for today I'll be
back with part three of the verizon
samsung i760 video review very shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
