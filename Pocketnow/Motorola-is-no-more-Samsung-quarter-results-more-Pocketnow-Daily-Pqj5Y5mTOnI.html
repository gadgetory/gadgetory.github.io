put the company to rest sprint and AT&amp;amp;T
are now playing a different game with
contracts and Samsung will apparently
not celebrate sales this quarter either
I'm hi meri beta wrapping up CES 2016
with a bang as this is starting to look
like a desert this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with both
AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint as for those of you that
thought the t-mobile wasn't so
disruptive well it seems the company has
this was one of the first companies to
start with installment plants at least
from the major carriers and as of
today's sprint and AT&amp;amp;T have joined
forces no longer can you get a 2-year
contract for subsidies for your phone
now your only options are to go with
installment plans which aren't
necessarily a bad deal if you think
about it I'm holding the spotlight over
to HTC we've got both good and bad news
on the good front those of you that are
interested in even more of an iphone
success phone the HTC One 89 is now
available in pink yeah that option is
there but in addition to that it seems
that the company is not having a good
time when it comes to its finances once
again the company is apparently thirty
five percent down year over a year when
you compare its revenue which is not
necessarily good news but the company is
still struggling and fighting which is a
good thing now another company that is
apparently struggling with its forecast
the Samsung but at a different
proportion as a well it's only three
percent down when it comes to revenue
though profits are up six percent even
though banks are not necessarily
optimistic about these profits that's it
doesn't seem to happen in all divisions
yeah it seems that the company is not
selling as much as it would or wanted to
but then again its products are getting
much better I was full this fall out
over to Motorola for some good news as
those of you interested in the Moto 360
sport the device is now available for
retail if you're waiting for our pocket
out fitness video we had a little issue
with our review unit and we now have a
replacement so stay tuned as our video
will go live very soon and finally the
very sad news today is that Motorola is
sadly no more of that company that
pretty much invented the cell phone a
couple of decades ago is a sadly no
longer going to exist lenovo will
continue with the brand to a certain
degree
see the bat wings you'll see a moto x
lenovo but this is just going to be a
brand and surely lenovo is going to move
its offices its mobile office is the
chicago division of motorola so that its
engineers and everything and continue to
contribute but it's no longer going to
exist sadly so it does lead me to the
question of today how do you feel about
what's just happened to motorola and
what's happened to so many really good
companies like nokia palm etc in my case
I feel very sad today I was a very huge
motorola customer I still am but anyways
