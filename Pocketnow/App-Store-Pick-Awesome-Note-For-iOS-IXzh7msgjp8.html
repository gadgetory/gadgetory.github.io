important productivity stick around for
an X app store hello everybody I'm hi
I'm out of event and welcome to the
pocket now app store pick or we'll be
looking at awesome note awesome notre
ain't note for short is a really cool
productivity application that focuses on
doing two things really well what is
doing task and the other one is doing
notes you can actually choose to keep
your notes and folder pains as many as
you like switch different colors and
actually inside each of these folders
you can choose to keep things as daily
notes for example you can actually
remain each of these to fit whatever
your needs are you can all show also
have quick memos and different colors
just like if you have ptosis on your
table one of the really cool things
about the application is you can switch
the way each of the notes look meaning
what are the folders comes up one way
and the other one can look the other way
so for example you choose calendar view
daily notes for you you can also have a
to-do list view if you choose to make
your notes into tasks and also keep the
dire view which is one of my favorites
another cool feature is you can actually
drag and drop each of the notes
depending on which folders of more
importance to you and you can create
notes as you need change colors for the
folders etc
within settings the application actually
allows you to do backups and also sync
with google docs and evernote you can
also password lock any of the folders
that you like and it's a very simple one
touch operation to get sync you can also
lock rotation depending if you want to
keep it in portrait landscape mode and
each of the notes actually gives you a
history of how everything looks
eventually for example if you have 20 or
30 notes you can actually look at them
come all together or just go within each
of the folders awesome note is available
for 299 in the App Store which is a
really good price we can also choose the
lite version if you'd like to give it a
try first that's it for today's app
