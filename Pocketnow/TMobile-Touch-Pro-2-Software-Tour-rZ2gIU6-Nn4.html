calm and wearing look at it software
tour of the t-mobile version of the HTC
touch pro2 now here we are in the home
screen you got a clock it's kind of a
different than the European versions
more of a darker background looks like
we got kind of a blue background here to
just kind of odd with the solid black
top and bottom bars and the whole phone
is you know Brown bronze colored kind of
clashes a lot anyway the same old
calendar items call history clock top
next is the Contacts tab same as usual
here you flip through people and you got
buttons to call them or text message
them on the bottom and move favorites
next is text messages same as original
touchflo here emails flick through like
that calendar tab is new compared to the
old touch pro we can go to a day and you
can naturally see your appointments as
well as the weather which is really cool
so I go to the next day and I can see
that it's going to thunderstorm tomorrow
and you can go all through any of your
days there it's really nice switch back
to month view got your menu here go back
to today create a new appointment let's
see what new appointments like it goes
back to normal windows mobile next is
the internet tab now with the european
version i believe this goes to opera as
the default
but this one goes to Internet Explorer
you also have a link to youtube and
three bookmarks here now I have figured
out a way to add my own bookmarks that
doesn't take them from Internet Explorer
if I click on them it's going to open
Internet Explorer which defaults to the
mobile view but we also have a search
bar up there which is good next is the
stocks tab you can see how the stocks
are doing pretty nice photos and videos
same as usual music
you got that
my volume is off next is the weather tab
I missed it very much like the touch HD
flip through other cities forecast and
next is the Settings tab have some new
things here you can customize tabs
that's good change your wallpaper
communications change your ringtone
volume all that and here's one special
for tmobile my faves I can turn on or
off the display of my faves and last tab
is programs you don't see this up
programs tab on the european version
because they changed the start mating to
go to a more finger friendly grid like
this t-mobile decided to bring back that
tab because they used the old start menu
now there's some good reasons for that
I'll get to in a second but since I just
turned on the my phase tab you see my
home tab in my contacts tab are gone
from the bottom here and now it's just
my favs
so even though I do have my face I kind
of prefer the home home &amp;amp; contacts tabs
to be separate getting back to the start
menu good reason to have it as the old
way is because with the keyboard you can
actually navigate it hello there we go
see I can type the letter that's
underlined and get quickly to those
applications unfortunately there's no
start menu hardware keys so I have to
reach up here with my finger and open it
each time so let's get into our programs
which way should we go through touchflo
yes programs tab we have some up here by
default at the camera quick GPS for
helping to get your GPS location TeleNav
a GPS navigation Program is include as
voice prompts and everything my account
this gives you quick access to your
might your tmobile account up doesn't
want to do it over Wi-Fi and way that
I've show your used minutes text
messages billing summary that kind of
stuff so here we are
and you also get the hand dango in hand
App Store now the windows mobile app
store that has been around for years and
years and years but no we've heard of it
t-mobile includes that and has for a
while next is YouTube that's your HTC
YouTube app Google Maps is included com
manager opera browser is included even
though it's not there as the default
browser go to all programs in a bunch of
instant messaging program starts aim you
got Dobby reader photo album bean i

with it internet sharing comes with it
so you can plug in your laptop and get
internet access an old version of live
