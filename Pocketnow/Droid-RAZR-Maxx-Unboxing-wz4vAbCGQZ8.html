pocket now calm the Motorola Droid Razr
is still the thinnest phone on the
planet at 7.1 millimeters thick
that's super thin but like most other
smartphones the Droid Razr is battery
life isn't that amazing you're gonna
have to charge everyday maybe even a
little bit more if you're using it in a
heavy use case scenario what happens
when you take a huge battery and stick
it inside of the Droid Razr you get the
Droid RAZR MAXX and in this video we're
going to unbox it let's get to it
so the Droid RAZR MAXX
is exactly the same device as the Droid
Razr except it has a battery that is far
far bigger 3300 milliamp hours that is
pretty much the biggest we've seen on
any phone yet which has added to its
thickness by only 2 millimeters which is
quite impressive so we went from 7
millimeters to about 9 still a very very
thin phone indeed
and again the Droid Razr has this max as
the same specs as the original Droid
Razr which has the TI OMAP 1.2 gigahertz
processor a gig of ram it's running on
Gingerbread it's got an 8 megapixel
camera in the back you know the specs of
the Droid Razr it's a it's a pretty
powerful device so let's take a look at
what we have here we have the Droid RAZR
MAXX
which yeah definitely feels a little bit
thicker than the original RAZR but not
by much just 2 millimeters what we have
here is a smoother backing in terms of
the depth in the Droid Razr you get the
camera area and then it goes down sinks
in a bit and then it's very thin here
now it's kind of leveled out a bit so
there's probably nothing that good
inside of the box so we're not even
going to bother going the rest of the
way let's take off the screen protectors
and compare the size next to some other
devices again the screen is 4.3 inches
diagonal and you get that q HD
resolution it's an AMOLED display so you
get killer Black's fantastic contrast
and pretty good color saturation too so
a really high quality screen and you get
the kevlar backing whatever that means
none user replaceable battery back here
that's what you get for having a thinner
device it requires an extra thickness
when the back battery cover is removable
so let's take a look at the thick
compared to the Samsung Galaxy s2 and at
this point the Droid RAZR MAXX becomes
thicker than the galaxy s2 but the
original Droid Razr is thinner than all
other smartphones out there and let's
see it next to the LTE version of the
Galaxy Nexus they seem about the same
thickness again the Galaxy Nexus has
this curve so it's not very not very
telling of exactly how thick it is
unless you were to measure it very
specifically but in terms of thickness
the Droid RAZR MAXX feels a little bit
thinner than the Galaxy Nexus LTE let's
take a look at the thickness next to the
iPhone and it's definitely thinner than
the iPhone the iPhone used to be one of
the thinnest devices and now it's
definitely not still thin phone but
nothing like the galaxy s2 and the
Galaxy Nexus and especially the Droid
Razr here so we're going to spend some
serious time with the Droid RAZR MAXX we
don't see phones come along with
batteries that are this big and the
operative question is does a much larger
battery contribute to a much better
experience a lot of people are ok
charging their phone one time per day or
leaving it on the charger at work does
having a phone that can last two days
with heavy use or even three days make
that big of a difference is it worth the
$100 price increase that Verizon is
charging this is $300 versus the Droid
Razr which is $200 we're going to answer
that question coming up soon if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and if there's something particular you
want us to test on the Droid RAZR MAXX
