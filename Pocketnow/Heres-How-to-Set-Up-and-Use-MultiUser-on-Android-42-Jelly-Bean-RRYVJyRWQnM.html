Android 4.2 brought with it a new
feature and that's multi-user support at
least on tablets anyway so let's go take
a look at how we can set that up switch
between users and even delete users when
we don't need them anymore and I'll talk
about a couple things that you probably
want to keep in mind before you get too
excited about multi-user so here we've
got a nexus 10 it's running Android 4.2
and I've only got one user let's go
ahead and unlock it from here and we're
gonna go into settings and you'll notice
I've got my own avatar up here this is
me this is the current user we open that
up you'll see information about me let's
add a new user go over to settings and
we're gonna come down to users this is
me my name my nickname owner info
whatnot and other users notice there are
none at least not currently so let's add
one some information for us we'll say ok
now it's asking us if we want to set up
the user and we have to make sure that
we have enough available space on the
tablet so that they can have all of
their stuff so that's the first caveat
the first thing you need to know is
every user that you add is going to take
up extra space on the device and it's
not going to be available to you until
you delete that user so keep that in
mind if you've got a limited storage
capacity device an 8 or 16 gig tablet
you'll need to be a little more careful
than if you have a 32 so now you notice
down here I've got me and I've got this
new user and it doesn't take too long to
switch between the two it's not quite as
fast as I'd like it to be but there you
go I can switch right over to it and oh
let's unlock and the first thing you're
met with is well the same thing that you
get when you have a brand-new tablet
it's asking you to step through the
process I'm gonna say no that I don't
have that
I'm not gonna get an account now yada
yada yada and let's put in Joe Rogers
how about that I'll be mr. Rogers for
today
Joe Roger and we are now complete same
thing we've got our basic desktop our
home screens nothing here because I
didn't set up a Google account I can
always go in and add one of those over
here in settings and under accounts so
you have none I can add an account right
in there so you can come back and do
that at a later time once you've done
that hey it's great you've got your own
nice little user space so if you're a
parent and you have a kid here you go
now you can give them your tablet and
they can mess up their own thing and
short of doing physical damage they're
not going to mess up your savegames or
reply to emails that you don't want them
to or all that kind of fun stuff so
switching users come up here it's just
as simple as that again takes a little
bit of time to swap out that user space
and then we can log right in and you'll
notice that this is my desktop right
there okay so now I don't want this user
on my tablet anymore how do I get rid of
it go back in to settings and back down
to users primary user you can't get rid
of without doing a factory reset at
least not as far as I know other users
hit that little delete are you sure yep
let's delete it and gone just as easy as
that one other thing that you want to
keep in mind and that has to do with
custom roms and flashing images if you
are using Android 4.2 and you are using
multi users or arguably even if you're
not it might mess with the SD storage
space and start nesting folders deeper
and deeper and deeper until you run out
of space and it's kind of a bug a lot of
the the recovery makers and and whatnot
are addressing that but keep it in mind
it's a little bit early in the game you
shouldn't be doing multi-user on
smartphones anyway at least not
according to Google but we really don't
know why that is
anyway showing off multiple users on
Android 4.2 jelly bean for Pocket now
I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
