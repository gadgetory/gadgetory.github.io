extras with the purchase of the LG g4
Google pushes a major update to Android
wear with some significant changes and
the finish Nokia may return to
smartphones earlier than you think I'm
I'm any better looking for suggestions
for an automated coffee dispenser but
that seriously coffee this is far get
out daily the official news today are
hot and have to do with Android wear as
Google let's just push the major update
to it you'll get changes like for
example the fact that now all
applications will go into ambient mode
if you need them to you need will go
into black and wine save you some
battery addition to the fact that your
watch can now connect to your phone
through Wi-Fi yes bluetooth is still
available but now you have more range
through Wi-Fi at the upper Peters then
yes you'll have that options so long as
your watch supports it in addition to
that you will also have the option to
check notifications in a different way
you can even access your contacts from
the watch phase in a way that we want to
prove the update should take a couple of
weeks to roll that but stay tuned for
that it'll take some watches first other
watches last but that's the way it works
other official new sedans with LG as the
company wants to sweeten the pot in its
homeland in Korea yeah if you buy an LG
g4 you will get a free 64 gig micro SD
card great addition in addition to that
you'll get a free year of the hey if you
shatter your display you'll get a
replacement which is good that's an
extended warranty and it's really cool
the problem is we don't really know if
it'll extend to other countries or just
in Korea we expect it to be that way as
such was the case with that VR for g3
and now it's available everywhere so ya
never know now let's move the spotlight
over to Apple and it's Apple watch a lot
of people are going into Apple stores
testing the Apple watch out and seeing
what it's all about and what are the
things that one of the users notice this
exactly how long it takes for the Apple
watch to boot just to give you an idea
it'll take an iPhone 25 seconds to boot
to take an iPad similar times it'll take
a macbook air three seconds but the
apple watch will take you 70 seconds a
full minute and 10 seconds to boot
and surely that is just drama and trying
to make apple look bad but once you
start seeing how long it takes for an
application to run it does get really
bad now keep in mind this is a store
demo unit so it could be that the store
demo software while booting will
obviously make the watch take longer
wait for our full reveal will keep you
posted because we don't know what
happens when applications crash will it
reboot itself and if it does oh my god
that's going to be horrible now some
official news that are definitely
disappointing are Sony's launch of the
Xperia z4 stop clapping if you don't
live in Japan there is no reason for you
to celebrate as the company for some
reason as men in a Japanese exclusive
and all the rumors are true stands
during an 810 processor the same screen
at 1080p you know the same store and
just about everything this is pretty
much as III in pretty much the same
design it almost doesn't change in
anything we just wonder what will happen
with the z3 now the z4 its launch but
only in Japan it'll be that Sony wants
to get rid of existing units before
launching the z4 in other countries so
many things could happen and we will
keep you posted as we learn more and
finally for the very hot news of the day
trusted sources claim that Nokia is
returning to the smartphone game next
year and it will also bring other
products as well some of these even
focus to be our headsets or virtual
reality per say we're not sure if it's
gonna focus on a headset but yeah it
seems that nokia has been hard at work
once that whole microsoft feel allows
the company to reuse its brand for
smartphones and 2016 then the company
will launch phones and it's really great
to hear we're not sure if this is are
gonna be Android phones we expect that
to be with the Z launcher and everything
but it leads me to the question of the
day are you happy disappointed what do
you think about nokia coming back after
launching the nokia in one tablet and
bringing a smartphone with similar
design because in my case i'd love to
see it i just don't want it to be a
chinese exclusive like it currently is
