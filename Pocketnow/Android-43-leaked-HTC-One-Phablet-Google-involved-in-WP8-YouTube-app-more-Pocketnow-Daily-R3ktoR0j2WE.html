on video agency seems to be considering
a phablet version of the HTC One in
Google comments on the YouTube
application for Windows Phones now
switch to positive I'm hi meri beta and
after 300,000 subscribers thank you all
very much and thank God it's Friday this
is pocket out daily let's start today
off with some Samsung news those of you
interested in different color variations
for the galaxy s4 the new aurora red
berry and um yeah I know is now
available for pre-order exclusively on
AT&amp;amp;T there's nothing here to see folks
it's pretty much the same phone with a
different color and kind of an ugly
color he asked me but leave us a comment
do you actually like it are you getting
and let's continue talking about Samson
their ties and platform has been rumored
and leaked all over and now we've got
some more leaked photos of the future
redwood codename smartphone coming with
the new operating system links down
below for a full gallery of everything
you can see from the smartphone I mean
looks about like a galaxy s3 actually
but obviously running the new ties it
back 12 specs to wonder when we're
actually getting a smartphone release
but everything seems to be kind of close
we'll keep you posted now let's move
over to Microsoft and Google we know
that both companies love each other and
well Google is just commented publicly
that they're working together with
Microsoft on all the issues and the API
problems that are happening with the
YouTube application on Windows Phone we
don't let Microsoft have to build it but
even though none of us want to see ads
on our videos you know it is kind of
interesting to finally see Google and
Microsoft collaborating together for an
application this could mean a much
better YouTube application even though
it's quite good on Windows Phone I mean
Microsoft did a really good job but you
know think about other services that
don't work from google on Windows Phone
could probably come in the future and
speed of google we've got some leaked
photographs of the nexus 4 running
android 4.3 and everything points it out
to be jelly bean everything looks like
jelly bean as well it's hard to notice
any differences links down below for a
full gallery and we've also got a video
showing everything off and you'll notice
that the only difference is actually in
the camera application you tap to focus
and you get a new menu of different
options
all you tap on the screen but that's
pretty much it will see what the changes
are soon hopefully and finally for the
interesting news of the day we've got
two things from hcc in the first place
we've got more rumors of a google
edition of the HTC one apparently
according to the very reliable sources
just a couple of weeks for that to
happen HTC is very interested in the
project and aside from that we've also
got HTC considering a phablet version of
the HTC One though it's really hard to
know right now of this device will be
you know six inches 5.5 inches it's kind
of hard to get any specs or any
specifics but that leads you to the
question of the day would you like a
phablet version of the HTC One is that
something that you're interested on and
would you hold off on the current HTC
One for a phablet variant in libraries
Aguilar case I'll be honest with you
it's going to be kind of hard i mean the
HTC one on its own is beautiful i would
love a phablet version of the HTC One
just because I do love the galaxy note 2
that I have and not necessarily for the
s-pen functionality I would love to see
a phablet version of the one but not
necessarily leave us a comment down
below what would you prefer bigger phone
or the current phone as we currently
have it I would love that if it would be
better but if nothing's really improve
them it's kind of hard to pick of course
it's always for another scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's awful go make sure you
follow us on parking out on Carmen
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
it also follow me on twitter and i
underscore be better please give this
video thumbs up if you like to just saw
I am hina Rivera thank you very much for
watching we will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
