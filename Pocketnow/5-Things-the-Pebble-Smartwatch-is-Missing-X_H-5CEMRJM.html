says it's time
meet pebble and even has a cutie little
hello in a speech bubble it sounds more
like a friend of the family than a
wristwatch I'm Joe Levi for pocket now
and you might not believe it but the
pebble isn't perfect this is my pebble
smartwatch let's take a look at five
things that the pebble well is either
missing or missing the mark pocket now
is michael fisher back to the
kickstarter project for pebble when it
was just $99 i got in a little bit later
when it was 115 today if you want to
preorder at your own pebble in addition
to waiting quite a while it's gonna cost
you 150 bucks what you're met with first
is this nice packaging which holds
everything in shape the way it's
supposed to and is pretty durable it's
got a USB cord for charging and the
watch and that's it
there's not even any instruction book
just this little image to show you go
online if you want to know how to set it
up and how to use it which of course
most of us won't when you look at it the
watch itself is only this big the strap
however is much larger and what's with
that strap i mean looking at it yeah
it's durable it's flexible it's black
it's rubbery and it doesn't feel all
that bad but it doesn't really conform
to your wrist all that much when you
wear it it feels like a rubber wrist
strap not something that you'd expect to
come on a 150 dollar watch a hundred and
fifty dollar watch demands a certain
level of build quality and workmanship
and the watch itself certainly does the
strap however I'm a little disappointed
that part of the watch that you're going
to be looking at is the display and it
might be a little bit interesting to
know that this display isn't quite as
high definition or even higher
resolution as you might think
it's not surprising it's a watch that's
not bad when you're looking at it down
here when you're looking at it up close
if we can get this to focus for you it's
just not as nice as you might think
email notifications for example look
just fine when
they're down here but to read them you
may have to bring it up a little bit
closer when you do that
focus notwithstanding you see pixels
we're used to not seeing pixels we have
Retina displays we have high PPI stuff
but there are pixels if you can't see
them in the text that's okay look at the
funny little shadow down at the bottom
and up here at the top as I scroll you
can see this faux shadow to let me know
that there's either more stuff to scroll
to or that I'm all done and it's
pixelated and it just doesn't look as
pretty as it should you might not be
able to tell here but this display is
not e-ink I thought it would be a
display like well the Kindle or the Nook
that would be perfectly readable and use
little teeny microscopic drops of ink
that are turned over to display black or
white just like the eBook readers are
but it's not this is a liquid crystal
display now that means that it's going
to use a little bit more power than an
e-ink display would it's probably not
going to be as sharp or as legible in
bright sunlight but as long as you're
looking at it with a lot of black and
not very much white it does pretty well
they do still call it E paper but not e
ink which is a little bit confusing
don't be confused this is LCD not e ink
being able to control your music from
your wrist is well just D key to get to
it you just have to hit your left button
go down to music select it you're told
who the artist is and what the song name
is the album all that fun stuff that you
can play and pause right there and go to
the next track you can go back and all
kinds of stuff that's where things get
weird if you want to control another
media player that's not a problem just
open your pebble app go into settings
and you can come down here to your
preferred music app any app that you
have installed that plugs into your
pebble will work with this so you can
see I've got Pandora and I've got pocket
cast my podcast player in here let's say
I want to control
pocket cast from my wrist so I can play
and pause we'll go ahead and do that and
there I am on the pocket now pocket
Cassie but as you can tell this is not
various artists this is not anyway you
on it from Rock of Ages it doesn't
update this information with well pocket
now and who was on it or even the
episode number or name why I don't know
it doesn't even do that with Pandora so
although you can control it the
information about what's playing isn't
really what's playing which is really
odd and somewhat confusing on pebble
everything is an app to get into it you
tap your left button and you can choose
from all of these watch faces well
that's fine but music isn't a watch face
set alarm not a watch face settings not
a watch face and then all of a sudden we
have more watch faces now everything
above settings is what came
pre-installed on the watch and
everything below it is what you added on
through the pebble app from your
smartphone but it's not organized I
don't necessarily want my set alarm to
be in the same list as my watch faces
and eventually when we do get more apps
like a bike odometer or a jogging
pedometer or whatever app that we have I
don't want that all right in here I want
to have them separated into watch faces
apps settings is that too hard you
wouldn't think so but this isn't even
organized alphabetically and until you
realize that on pebble everything is an
app and it's just thrown here together
kind of chronologically in the order
that you added it to your pebble
smartwatch takes a little bit of getting
used to speaking of apps where are they
the pebble website shows off some cool
features of their watch bicycling app
one for jogging and even a rangefinder
for golf unfortunately they're not on
the watch nor are they available to
download to the watch not yet anyway all
we have now is in all honesty a pretty
limited selection of watch faces and no
other apps let alone third-party apps
of course this is a new product and it's
a classic chicken and egg problem which
comes first but I'd hoped to have at
least the features that they showed off
and are still showing off on their
website available on my watch at least
by the time I got it and if not a little
bit after patience I suppose is a virtue
the pebble is a great product despite
some of its shortcomings that I'm sure
they're going to improve over time
luckily they can do that because that's
the way that it's built if you liked
what you saw here why not give the video
a thumbs up share it with your friends
on Twitter Facebook and Google+ go over
there and say hi to us head back to the
article at pocketnow.com and leave a
comment with your thoughts for pluggin
