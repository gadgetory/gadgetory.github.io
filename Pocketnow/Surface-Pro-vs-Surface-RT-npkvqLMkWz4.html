Adam Lane from packing.com and in this
video we're going to do a quick
comparison between Microsoft's two new
tablet PCs well I've got these here
let's talk about the weight a little bit
this is the surface pro is two pounds
the surface RT is 1.5 pounds these are
not heavy at all holding both of them
together is lighter than my last tablet
which was 4.7 pounds alright let's see
how quickly these turn on boot up time
is pretty important for tablet you
wanted to be ready right away this is
the surface pro and that's the surface
RT and you see the pros already done and
we're in still waiting for the RT which
stands for real-time but we're already
totally running the pro there we go and
we see how slow login happens over there
as well but now we're both going and
let's see a sleep mode see how quickly
that happens instant sleep mode and back
RT much quicker resuming from sleep mode
next let's do a shutdown just see how
quickly that happens
there we go shutting two of the pros
already off okay so here we are with the
Peacekeeper browser test results you see
the pro gets much higher score and
there's the RT with a much lesser score
so let's try a different web page and
let's see if we can get it to go as the
same time they are they're both loading
PocketNow and the pro is done already
and let's load a video pro much faster
and here we go well we're still waiting
come on Artie here we go both browsers
work pretty nicely I think the advantage
goes to the surface pro it's much faster
and loading pages and of course you can
install any kind of other web browser
that you want on the surface burr
because it's Windows 8 let's try and
launching the news app surface pro much
faster and it's not even loading the
today's there we go so that's today's
news and we're still on yesterday's news
over there there we go now they're both
update all right how about some weather
again surface pro much faster of course
on the surface pro I can install all
sorts of real Windows programs so
there's like 4 million regular Windows
programs that I can stall separately
with about 40-something thousand Windows
8 apps in the store those are the ones
that the RT can run as well as the pro
so for desktop style apps we really only
have these four on the RT Word Excel
PowerPoint OneNote and this is how
quickly they launch whereas over here
you get a much much quicker
let's see word there's word much faster
on the pro now both these have games so
I'm going to launch Hydro Thunder and we
see the pro is in the lead a bit
this is a pretty intensive graphic with
the Windows 8 game
now we're going to try to play this at
the same time I don't know how well
we're going to do this
it's very difficult to see both of the
same time
all right you get the idea so in terms
of hardware from the front both of these
look very very similar however the pro
has your stylus on the side there's your
microSD slot on the edge it cut you
gotta use your fingernail that kind of
pit click it in
there's your charging port mini
DisplayPort power button over here is
the volume control USB port and headset
jack whereas the arty there's your power
connector USB port and mini HD all on
this side power and over here is the
volume control in headset jack the micro
SD card slot is hidden under the
kickstand right down there instead of
being this long on the side and you see
this is a bit thinner there's also a
plastic appear with the camera whereas
the pro so when it comes to battery life
the pro usually around 5 hours depending
on what you're doing if you put it to
sleep mode a lot obviously you can get a
much longer lifespan out of it the arty
lasts for much longer but obviously it's
slower less capable and not as many
programs so if battery life is important
to you that's the thing that the arty
has going for it the pro on the other
hand is extremely powerful and obviously
the battery it's going to suffer for
that one more thing to look at is the
charging cables this one is for the pro
you see Pro Windows 8 written there you
see Windows RT R and over here this one
is much smaller and lighter both have
the same connector so you could use
either one but the pro has more power
and faster charging so I can recharge
this in like two and a half hours maybe
pretty quick
so during lunch recharge no problem this
has a longer cable here so you can
easily plug this into a power strip with
you know lots of other stuff plugged in
whereas this is more of a larger brick
might have some trouble with room but it
folds up really nicely the other thing
is that this one includes a USB port so
having that extra USB charging port
built in really you know cuts down on
the amount of chargers that you have to
carry it's really nice so there you have
it
surface pro one of the fastest most
powerful tablets out there largest app
ecosystem and the surface RT good
battery life I guess I'm sure to give
this video a thumbs up and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
