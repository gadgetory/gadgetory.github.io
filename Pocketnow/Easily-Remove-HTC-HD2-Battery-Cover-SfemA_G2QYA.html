you know removing the back battery cover
on the HTC hd2 is not so easy like it is
on other HTC devices like the Touch pro2
or all you have to do is just slide
upward and it comes off in the case of
the hd2 you've got a little fingernail
groove over on this side but it's not
enough to stick your fingernail in there
and try to break it open that way
because you'll probably hurt your finger
now there's a way that I found that's
kind of easy to open it up and you
should note that as you use your HD to
the back battery door will get looser
and looser as you open it up more and
more because the microSD slot is back
there so if you're changing your your
memory card you're probably opening it
up a lot so here is what I found is the
easiest so you put the phone facedown in
your right hand you grab on so with some
leverage on the bottom area here with
your thumb turn to the side and push
with your thumb here and with your thumb
on the little groove and it comes off
pretty easily
again that's quite simply putting the
phone face down in your right hand palm
getting some leverage by pressing right
here and then pressing where the little
groove is but not sticking your your
fingernail in and push down and it comes
off quite easily so hopefully that helps
you if you have an HD too and you're
trying to figure out an easy way to get
the back battery cover off on this
really awesome device that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
