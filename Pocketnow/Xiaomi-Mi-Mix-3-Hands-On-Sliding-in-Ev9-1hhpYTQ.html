ever closer to that original vision a
smartphone that is basically all screen
but what's even cooler is the way they
achieved this almost 94% screen to body
ratio its Joshua for Gaara what's going
on everybody and this is PocketNow
bringing you a look at the Xiaomi me mix
3 so I've been able to use the Chinese
version of this phone over the last
couple of days in Beijing China and that
means I won't be keeping this phone so
our full review will have to wait until
we get a global unit for now though I
did make sure to get a lot of photos and
videos or with the device and I'm going
to put together a couple pieces of
content over on my channel youtube.com
slash Joshua regard so if you are
itching for more about this exciting
phone then you can head over to my
channel as well 93.4% that is the screen
to body ratio that was achieved in the
me mix 3 via a mechanism that is a bit
of a throwback but also is a very
practical way of hiding all the bits and
pieces that were cut into the display
that's right the entire front slides
down and what's great about this is that
the me mix 3 is actually not any thicker
than most other flagships it's just at
the front the display in particular
actually slides down with a very
satisfying click mechanism and I have to
admit I have been doing this way more
than I probably should have but it seems
like it's sturdy enough to be able to
take that many slides the front-facing
camera array includes an LED flash
actually and it can be used for face
unlock on top of the fingerprint sensor
which is more conventional and it's
found on the back which means that
there's a lot that can happen by just
sliding down the display originally
before getting face on lock setup if you
slide it down a nice little animation
shows up you might get a sound effect
that in the future is going to be
customizable and then to go straight
into the selfie portion of the camera
app after getting face unlock set up
bringing the screen down made it start
looking for my face and I was able to
get straight into me UI very quickly and
in a very stylistic manner the screen
itself takes up so much of the front and
it's kind of a sight to behold it is in
AMOLED display at 6.39 inches and
because it's taking up all of the front
it is a nineteen point five by nine
aspect ratio that does mean that some
applications need to be catered to this
taller display even the camera app
itself has a little bit more
the bottom underneath the shutter button
then I think it should have but let's
not forget about the rest of the phone
no you do not get a headphone jack on
here you still get an adapter in the box
and speaking of what is in the box you
also get a wireless charger bundled with
it it is in the box and this is a trend
that I think should be happening more
and more often as wireless charging
becomes more prevalent the wireless
charging happens through a ceramic
backing and ceramic is still the
material that Xiaomi champions and it's
great to see it back again and in three
different colors the Xiaomi me mix three
comes in black green and blue the one
gripe that I have about the green and
blue additions is that they're not more
obvious about what they are you can
really only see the difference between
them in good lighting otherwise they're
a lot more muted than I would have liked
still the phone is artfully designed
especially considering that AMOLED
display that made everything look pretty
awesome in my first two days with it
this is the Chinese edition of the phone
like I said so we didn't have any Google
Play services or YouTube or even the
games from the Play Store to have on
here but with everything that I've
recorded and everything that the me UI
shows inside of this device it still
looks pretty great and of course it's
AMOLED so the colors pop pretty well but
it's all about sliding down that display
and revealing what is underneath you get
the front-facing camera array which is a
dual camera set up 24 megapixels and
then 2 megapixels with AI capabilities
it does come in at F 2.2 aperture which
may not be totally ideal but there are
modes to give you that depth of field
via portrait mode or there are also the
beautify modes there also a couple of
other fun functions on here that only
the Chinese ROM gets including a magic
mirror mode which you mean you can sound
off on it in the comments below of it
basically is just a fun mode where it
just looks at you and tries to assess
how let's say attractive you are you can
move your face and around or even the
phone around and you'll be able to get
some sort of score and the highest that
I was able to get was a solid eight
point three but that's silliness aside
you do get that portrait mode up front
with the beauty modes that from zero to
one already do things like slim your
face and after you take the picture you
can change the depth of field to show
different light trails and you can also
use the cutout in order to add other
lighting effects as well I also used it
as a vlogging camera sorts and one thing
I am happy to report is that the focal
length is actually just
right enough so that you don't feel too
cramped in the frame so this phone will
definitely be good for some social media
and it might be good for some regular
videos if you're using this as a
vlogging tool let's get to the rear
cameras you get two cameras as well and
it's a dual 12 and 12 megapixel array
and the secondary sensor is at F 2.4
aperture and provides a 2 times optical
zoom there are a lot of different modes
in the camera app including slow motion
video at 960 frames per second and it
does it a little bit differently than
other flagships what it does instead is
it gives you a few seconds to get ready
and then at the end of that cycle it
makes the 960 frames per second trigger
so you know exactly when it's going to
trigger and you can plan it out properly
you also get 120 frames and 240 frames
as well so you're not really locked into
this 960 speaking of frame rates I did
record a lot of the video using the
phone at 4k at 60 frames per second as
well
Shami is also bringing in their version
of the night mode you might have seen
this mode in other phones like from
Huawei and in this case the night mode
is actually shorter in length it may be
2 or 3 seconds and it's just enough to
be able to get that super HDR effect
that makes all pictures look a little
bit like a painting now there are going
to be situations where this looks good
other situations where it looks a little
bit hokey for example you might get that
halo effect around objects because the
HDR is really working quite hard to make
sure that everything is evened out now
obviously take this with a grain of salt
but DxO market did rate the me mix 3 at
one point higher than the Huawei P 20
Perot so the photography from this one
is looking to be a big highlights and
we're looking forward to putting it
through full testing once we get our
review units and again this is the
Chinese Edition that you're seeing here
so you get me UI 10 but we weren't able
to have the Play Store or Google Play
services installed but me do I still
brings a lot to the table stuff that you
might have seen in the past like the
second space or the dual apps so on top
of everything in Android P you can
expect that this will be a pretty full
feature software platform and this is
all being powered by a slew of high-end
specifications including the snapdragon
840 5 &amp;amp; 6 8 or 10 gigabytes of ram I
know it's getting kind of ridiculous
that we're really blasting past that
original 4 gigabytes of RAM mark
so if you have been following Xiaomi for
quite a while you know that all of these
specs and all of these offerings are
really nothing new they are able to
provide a fairly affordable price for a
flagship phone that has more than even
some of the competition but in this case
what you're getting here in this really
hectic smartphone season is yet another
phone that you're trying to be
everything for everyone
it's just that Xiaomi has been able to
do it in such a way that is not only
unique but strikes us is really
practical then this might be one of
those sleeper hits and one of those
phones that we really wish was available
in more markets just like we did with
the original me mix the mimics to and
everything in between
just the slider phone lover in me is
already sad to give up this device but
hopefully the global unit will be on its
way as soon as possible and then we will
be able to bring you our full review
keep it tuned to pocket now for that
full review but also head over to my
channel youtube.com slash Joshua vergara
to see how I feel about this phone and
what kind of users I think it might be
for you might have already clued in to a
few of them just by watching this
hands-on video and then I also vlogged
one day in Beijing using the cameras of
the me makes three so look forward to
that I'm still working on it and you can
look forward to it coming very soon all
right I'm gonna call it on this one and
I will probably see you on the pocket
now weekly once I get back stateside and
I can get back to hosting the podcast
thank you so much for watching look
forward to the next one and I'll see you
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
