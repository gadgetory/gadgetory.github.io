thing but if it's for the greater good
sure why not in the spirit of road trip
season and just being played bored it's
time to find out which games will
distract you from the important things
in life just long enough for one more
round
I'm Jules Wong with pocket now and here
are the 5 top games in the Play Store
and under 5 minutes we start with the
simple of things in life and from
ketchup developed by wild road games
it's jelly jump simply put you tap to
jump and keep up with perpetually
generating platforms have some of those
platforms emerge from the sides at
varying speed so timing your jump is
really the key to avoid falling through
the gap or worse yet getting jelly
sandwich and the platform as you keep
above the Black Tide you'll inevitably
catch a slow-mo pick-up it's not as
helpful as it seems though and a little
more jelly for Head Start or a new mold
how about a hippo or a hollow cube or a
spider it could be yours
jelly jumps a pretty good pick-me-up for
a shirt breaks and the $1.99 in-app
purchase is well worth getting to get
rid of that here's something that needs
both hands noon from fallen tree games
again simple right tap near the clock
every time it strikes noon or say less
than 5 minutes off of it well what if
you add another clock and another clock
and another and start hallucinate
it gets crazy in no time add to that the
Android mode where you get as many taps
in over 60 seconds and then the
heartbreak mode Oh No
yeah that's not gonna last you long noon
got me addicted fast so I also recommend
the $0.99 price to remove ads especially
when the ad triggers rust the beans
dunfin occasion running circles is our
next game from boom 'but this one's for
the social butterflies who dream of days
gone by with OMG pop in the lake your
character makes revolutions inside a
circle or outside of them with a tap on
the screen but you've got to be back in
before you crash into the connecting
circle you have to be inside the circle
detangler tap before the transfer over
quick enough before the circle inside
your previous one goes large enough to
crush you and on and on you go through
Forks and avoiding little spoilers while
collecting gems currency for you to
unlock other characters you can't remove
the ads so if you want you need
alternative try mix antics orbit the
jumper but you'd be missing out on
multiplayer competition and the cutesy
wutesy extra characters moving on to
something for the long drives and even
longer plane rides if you're a
thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle are ready
to burst have differents games got a
proposition for you
the latest in the hidden scenes series
is country corner but there are other
themes out there our concept of puzzle
pieces is geometric shapes but moved in
different ways swap is pretty simple
flip introduces a flip mechanic the
rotate complicates things but the most
sexy looking mode happens to be radial
where you shuffle pi pieces go away with
four modes for difficulties in twenty
levels you're looking at 320
permutations here once again you can't
remove the ads and there are even video
commercials too but if you're in for a
long one this might be worth it get to
work
our last game today is number one the
only one based on unity number two the
only one with an upfront charge of $2
and number three the newest around with
only 10 recognized downloads at
recording time but if you want to get in
on the ground floor with tech big on its
a real-time strategy game worth looking
at the main goal is to take over the
opposing team speaking oddly enough but
with your finite though can
you asleep generating army of runners
bashers and shooters and the other
side's army of the same they'll need a
bit more of a thought before you can
start slugging the AI once more it's
easy on the eyes and ears and also the
head too right now at least but if it
gets enough Community Interest think of
the different directions this can go and
that's my top 5 Android games in under 5
minutes how about yours
