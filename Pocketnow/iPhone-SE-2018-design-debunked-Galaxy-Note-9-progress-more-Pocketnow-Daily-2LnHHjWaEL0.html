expected after all
we finally get a launch date for TCL's
blackberry key - and some of us are
celebrating and Amazon reveals the final
colors in price tag of the one plus six
I'm Jaime Oliveira and yes we're gonna
get you all the coverage from that one
plus six very soon I'm heading off to
London like now this is Parkin out daily
the official news today began with deals
obviously we were waiting for a more
affordable MacBook Air which didn't
happen if you're in the market and you
want to get yourself a current MacBook
it is currently three hundred dollars
off at woot obviously it depends on the
variant and what you're looking for but
it's try to get a thousand bucks you can
learn more in the description definitely
worth it so seems that Amazon already
spilled the beans on the oneplus 6 we're
just about to get there so obviously
we'll get you the official details but
according to Amazon rumors are pointing
to a price tag of around five hundred
and twenty something bucks $50 more
depending on the tier that you're
looking for we've got information on the
colour variants and apparently the
launch date is going to be May 22nd
which is really close I'm really looking
forward to this device now let's talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 as we've
gotten more trusted sources now from
Korea that are pretty much confirming
that we are not getting the on display
fingerprint sensor on this phone
apparently the main reason why is
because a company is using this
ultrasonic sensor which we've already
seen in other products and apparently
there are challenges in being able to
mass-produce it makes all the sense in
the world I mean Samsung has been pretty
much following that scheme we're gonna
leave the flagship things for the Galaxy
S and then we're just gonna add a couple
of extra things to the Galaxy Note so
probably this is going to be the
approach and you know what we've got a
fingerprint scanner in a reachable
position now so I'm looking forward to
this now let's move the spotlight over
to the BlackBerry key to apparently that
is the final name for the product it was
codenamed Athena I believe and we hear
that the event is going to happen on
June 7 this is official from blackberry
by the way yes we have our press
invitations yes
we will be covering it live yes I can't
wait because I like the key one but
there were a couple of things that I
really wanted from that's the device and
bear in mind I am a former hardcore
blackberry user from the bold 9900 being
my favorite device so I can't wait to
see what the company pulls off as
apparently they're going to come up with
something awesome here
and finally the most interesting
nuisance they have to do with the iPhone
se 2 as uh okay I'm gonna call these
rumors probably bogus but bear with me
here as we've got some rumors that say
on one end that you know and from case
makers that the design is going to be
this glass on glass but with the iPhone
se design and a notch and everything but
then the source from Japan is saying no
it's not going to happen in q2 don't
expect that at WWDC and the design is
not going to look like the current
iPhone S II and even though there will
be a notch apparently the notch is not
going to guarantee face ID these are
very polarizing rumors and we're getting
really close to WWDC so in today's
question let us know if you had to pick
when you prefer the iPhone se design
with all display and glass or would you
prefer some other design because I'm
even hearing conflicting parts of this
rumor that say that this display is
going to be six inches that doesn't make
sense the iPhone 10 doesn't have six
inches in the display diagonal leave us
a comment down below
I would prefer the iPhone se design to
stick a little longer with an all
display design but that's just me
