2015 and we've seen some great
smartphones to the market so far this
year I'm hi out of Houston with pocket
now and these are some of the best
smartphones of early 2015 the first
phone on our list is the LG g4 LG put
together a pretty amazing phone here
with an industry-leading camera and a
gorgeous qhd display it's one of the
only flagship devices to still include a
removable battery and microSD expansion
making it an easy choice for power users
the software experience wasn't our
favorite but it still offers a
compelling feature list with
multitasking and customization in mine
and the optional leather backing sets it
apart from the competition next on our
list is the iphone 6 plus it's Apple's
first venture into the phablet space
with a 5.5 inch display on an aluminum
casing we chose the 6 plus over the
smaller iPhone 6 mostly because of its
better battery life giving users up to
two days at a time but the 6 plus is
also the only one of the two that has 0
is in the camera this is the phone to
buy if you want a powerful that's simple
experience and a huge ecosystem of apps
and accessories is enough alone to make
it worth looking into 2015 hasn't just
been about top-tier devices though and
in fact one of the biggest pushes this
year has been in improving the budget
selection alcatel onetouch surprised us
with its excellent idol 3 a two hundred
fifty dollar smartphone with a beautiful
screen and outstanding front firing
speakers the camera is far from great
but the battery life sound quality and
performance turn the idol three into one
of my favorite phones of the year
regardless of price stepping more into
the mid-range the asustas M phone to
boasts a killer spec sheet that on paper
beats out even some of the highest and
handsets it's configurable for up to 4
gigabytes of RAM and it's one of the
fastest android phones we've tested the
speaker leaves a lot to be desired and
the display is pretty dim in most
conditions but the camera is better than
almost anything else you'll find at its
price point and the heavily theme abul
interface would keep you from getting
bored of your phone anytime soon finally
our top smartphone pick for early 2015
is the galaxy s6 from Samsung
this phone combines a gorgeous
industrial design with one of the best
smartphone cameras to date and an
updated version of Samsung's TouchWiz
interface that's surprisingly good the
fingerprint sensors are integrated into
the home button is very accurate and
double tapping that button to launch the
camera feels impossibly fast we do wish
the battery life were a little better
but save for that and a few performance
gripes we have no hesitation in calling
the galaxy s6 the smartphone to be for
the first half of 2015 that's just our
list but if you see things differently
than let us know in the comments down
below and subscribe to pocket now on
youtube if you haven't already this has
been hired to houston pocket now until
