how to fix the samsung galaxy as a knife
fingerprint scanner location more
sources claim that the Huawei May 10 pro
will make a solid US launch and project
find deals now extend to evening your
in-flight Wi-Fi I'm Jaime metal Yvette I
and since I always get asked on Twitter
if I could give away a free phone how
about this my birthday's coming up and I
would love a pair of bows qc3 fives to
the same people
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals as a project
fight continues to surprise us with the
things that they provide particularly
when you're roaming traveling and now it
actually includes in-flight Wi-Fi as the
company is just partner with gogo and it
doesn't provide all in-flight Wi-Fi you
will have to play this game it's a ski
game and once you finish that you'll get
a code and that will give you free Wi-Fi
for the duration of that flight and we
also hear the t-mobile is partnering
with services like gogo for in-flight
Wi-Fi so all this is great it works on
specific airlines you can see the list
in the description and speaking of deals
if you're in the market for a SmartWatch
remember one of the ones that I
recommend most is the Huawei watch 2 or
Huawei watch 2 classic the classic being
my favorite and if you're in the market
right now the regular one is 180 and
then the classic is 220 on Best Buy and
this is a great deal I love that classic
Huawei watch
and speaking of Huawei for those of you
that ask yourselves why are the huawei
mate flagships not launched in the
United States we talked about some
rumors recently where it might launch on
AT&amp;amp;T and as of the day we've gotten more
trusted sources that claim just that it
will launch on AT&amp;amp;T in the case of the
May 10 Pro and we are hearing that
Verizon might also join all this is
apparently going to have an early next
year so stay tuned this was a spotlight
over to Apple as the company has just
launched an interesting feature on its
App Store's meaning iOS TV OS and Mac OS
where you can actually pre-order stuff
as of now in the past I think we saw
that with the case of Super Mario run I
might be mistaken though but yeah
pre-orders are now active and developers
actually have a couple of liberties with
the service
I noticed that this morning I found that
kind of cool you can learn more about it
in the description and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy has nine possibly because
we have synaptics apparently claiming
that during CES we will see a tier one
smartphone being announced with a
fingerprint scanner and bit it on the
display this is something that we've
been hearing synaptics working with
Samsung ever since the Galaxy s8
so obviously we should assume that this
would be the galaxy s 9 we're not
exactly sure if Samsung will do the
announcement at CES but it would be
great if this was figured out we even
hear that this is already being
mass-produced let us know in the
comments would you love this feature on
the Galaxy S line or not if not in which
other phone in my case I feel that every
phone should have the fingerprint
scanner on the display that is just my
opinion leave us a comment down below
for yours apparently good at least we -

think love would not be the word but
