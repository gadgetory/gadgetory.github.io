today I'm going to walk you through
another method of watching online video
on your windows mobile phone the first
part of this video will be shown on the
tmobile shadow and then I will show you
on the dash in the wing the same
application okay for the sake of this
video I'm connected to Wi-Fi to help the
download faster okay to begin go to
start internet explorer and we're going
to go to the address bar and we're going
to type in v-tach calm
I'm going to let that load up now the
website automatically Big Tex what kind
of phone you have so this is a
non-touchscreen phone so we're all we're
going to go ahead and click download
okay it's going to ask us where we want
to download the file to I'm just going
to click yes it's just the CAD file
after it installs I can ever installs I
can delete it
okay then it's going to run through this
in sauce you can if you have a storage
card you can install it to your storage
card the shadows got plenty of internal
memory so I just install most of my
programs there one of the great things
about v tap is is a ready-made solution
you just install it there's no real
hacking or registry edits or anything
needed and you just open it up in and go
now the great thing is it supports
streaming or downloading the file okay
it tells us where it is and we're just
gonna go ahead and push yes so to launch
there's a little license usage agreement
terms of use go ahead click accept okay
you'll see across the top you have web
clips and Wikipedia if you go over to
Wikipedia you can you can look up things
in Wikipedia as well and it kind of
formats it for the screen for the device
so you don't have to really start
looking for stuff for internet explorer
now great thing about V tap is as you
type it begins to search we're going to
start typing all shadow com now one
thing about V tap is it changes your
input mode to ABC so if you have like
the W is the second character on this
key so I have to push that key twice it
doesn't use the t9 and after you use V
tap you go somewhere else you have to
change it back to t nine if that's your
default input method alright look we've
got some videos for all shadow calm and
there's our old video how to watch
online video that one uses the core
pocket media player searching the web
you know unboxing how to load opera mini
so if you select something it brings up
a short description of whatever it's on
it also tells you where it's at
so right here is a walkthrough on a
better search experience in click keep
video it'll keep it in your favorites or
download it and add it to your that
video feed the of the all shadow com
user name for metacafe or click info and
it will bring up the whole thing how
many tips there are tags things like
that my head put back you can look up
related let's go to the source one page
or share it with a friend if you want so
let's show you how well this works for
playing we click play brings up the
details shows that it's connecting it's
preparing it starts downloading
immediately what's great about this is
it will work over GPRS the connections a
little bit slower than Wi-Fi but it
works nonetheless and then it starts
playing so that simple so one thing
you'll notice that when you first
install it is the video quality might
not be that great which is fine if you
use GPRS a lot you just want to get to a
video quick but if you use Wi-Fi a lot
then one thing you'll want to do is
improve the quality so we'll push tools
options will go to media then we go to
you can if you want better audio you can
do that put out a media quality and
change it for medium to high and that
will improve the video quality
now on this video you might not be able
to see the improvement in the video
quality but it is a definite improvement
and you can save topics or favorite
users on the beat on video sites
actually save videos that you can share
again later access them quickly so go to
V tap calm on your desktop computer to
create that now if you just want to
listen to the audio of a certain video
you can do that as well you can look at
your history past searches bookmarks
that you've placed in there that's
really a useful tool to have now let's
take a look at what it looks like on the
dash and the wink alright I've already
pre-loaded this on the wing and it
pretty much looks the same so let's open
it up and type in I'll shadow and it
brings up a little list for us I'll
shadow and everything pretty much works
the same on this one to type the little
the screen fix a little bit longer let's
slide on this but that's alright we're
getting our do when we want it right
there you go now for the dash now the
dash is another smartphone just like the
shadow so a lot of its going to work the
same of course we're using different
keyboards or input methods so it's
really pretty seamless when you're
working with it with the dash and in the
wing because you don't have to change
your input method so there we go so you
see the screens a little bit different
there just because of the wide screen
see if the scroll down a little bit more
if you want to read the rest of it but
it loads nonetheless actions you can
load it in the background notify when
when you're ready to to play it and go
look through other things as well now
that works on all three devices so i
hope this improves your day to day video
browsing so you can pass some time while
standing in line or ride the bus subway
however it is you get around I wouldn't
suggest watching video while you're
driving though and enjoy and until next
time I'm Mike Benton for all shadow com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
