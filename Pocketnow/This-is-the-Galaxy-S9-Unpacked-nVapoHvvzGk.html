last year with the Galaxy S flagship and
if you didn't buy the galaxy si the
company is doing what it can to get you
to buy this the Jules Wan camera my
motivator
this is pocket Mouse hands-on coverage
of the samsung galaxy s 9 brought to you
by invisible shield this is what many
would consider to be the talk in
Samsung's Galaxy a cycle the minor
iteration refinement stage the pivot to
software the Galaxy S 9 we might as well
get all the specs out of the way
depending on your region the s9 has the
snapdragon 845 processor from Qualcomm
or Samsung's own Exynos 9810 the top
dogs in the field right now other than
that there's a lot of copy and paste
from the s8 the Super AMOLED display
which is amazing and gorgeous the four
gigabytes of RAM which adequate but
slightly disappointing and the 64
gigabytes of storage that are now
becoming a standard the battery is still
the same old 3000 milliamp hours and
there's also options for fast and also
fast wireless charging oh and yes it's
just this water and dust resistant as
the previous variant now let's take that
and add stereo speakers yes finally no
more mono audio the s9 uses the earpiece
and the bottom firing speaker that's now
redesigned to bring the noise and there
is a decent amount of it facial
recognition and iris recognition can now
be combined to something that's called
to vector biometric authentication aka
intelligent scan as the company is
saying though for those of you that
don't trust the service there's also the
fingerprint scanner and yes it moved
down from the right of the camera to
below it just as it should've been a
year ago speaking of the camera let's
really talk about it with all the
advancements in phase detector autofocus
and dual pixel focusing Samsung's
calling this the SuperSpeed camera it
has dedicated memory to handle an
awesome slo-mo mode that goes
much as 960 frames per second at 720p
and there's also automatically adjusted
mechanical aperture from f2 point for
when scenes are bright 2f 1.5 it for
night snapping this is actually the
brightest aperture on a phone right now
and no this is actually not a software
trick but these are the things that we
will be testing in our review process
then after that we get into things like
bixby vision that can now instantly
translate objects and identify what's
happening through a I pretty much like
Google is currently doing also both the
selfie and the main cameras can perform
a art tasks and programs like for
example do you want to a are emoji
Samsung has a camera mode you can get
into which supposedly brings something
close to Apple's an emoji but this time
it actually mimics you and yes that's
Jules's face on the phone I I know I'm
sorry
