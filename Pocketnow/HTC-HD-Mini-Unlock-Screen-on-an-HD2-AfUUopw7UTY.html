pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the new unlock
screen on the HTC HD Mini now the HD
mini isn't out yet but when it does come
out it'll have a new lock screen which
is a lot more functional than once you
get in standard windows mobile 6.5 case
you forgot the HD Mini is touted as the
HTC hd2 but in a smaller form factor so
the guys at xda-developers have
extracted this lock screen or the unlock
screen and I put it on the hd2 although
it doesn't work perfectly right now you
can get a sense for how it works so it
kind of dude does two things if you have
just one notification you'll actually
get a preview down here sort of like a
webos device so right now I have one
email that's new and you can see the
name and the subject if I have a new
text message it'll show up down there or
if I have a missed call it will tell me
who has called now to unlock the screen
what I do is I just pull down on the
picture and it comes up like that now
let me show you what it looks like when
I have multiple notifications I'm going
to call the phone and leave a missed
call and that sort of thing ok so now I
have two notifications one new email and
one missed call I'm as you can see the
text is a little pixelated this was
actually intended for a device within
each vga screen and this has a wvga
screen so i think we're going to soon
see a better version of this and
actually had to flash an entirely new
rom to get this to work although I i'm
pretty sure that soon you'll be able to
install cab and get this new HD Mini
lock screen which I think offers more
functionality than you get with just the
standard basic lock screen so that was a
quick look at the HD Mini lock screen
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
