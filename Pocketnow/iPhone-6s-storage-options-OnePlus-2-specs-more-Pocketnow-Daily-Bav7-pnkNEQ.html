storage specifications for the iphone
success we also get specked details on
the much-anticipated 1+2 and it seems
that google is finally making some money
on mobile I'm hi Mary vetta and if
you're having a rough Friday do what I
do read youtube comments this is
out daily the official news today start
with Google as the company has just
posted its q2 earnings for this year and
they are very positive particularly in
mobile in the past couple of quarters
the company was actually losing money
because of the Lexus lineup but as a
Terran Saturday's posting eleven percent
growth in the department which is great
now it seems that most of this has to do
with mobile search it not necessarily
the Nexus lineup but then again Hank
growth is growth let's move the
spotlight over to Microsoft as we get
information on the new end-user license
agreement for Windows 10 and a very
interesting update has to do with
software updates as you are now allowing
Microsoft to update your computer
without your consent and this is
obviously not necessarily good because
some computers don't behave well with
updates but it does seem that Microsoft
is polished Windows 10 enough for that
not to be an issue or at least for the
company to want to do something like
this have some very interesting leaks of
the galaxy note 5 have to do with the S
Pen actually we've got some case leaks
and we do not see an opening for you to
be able to pull the S Pen as you
traditionally can buy just you know
looking for the portion and pulling it
out as it turns out it seems that you
will now be able to just push the S Pen
in for it to pop out and that's actually
a good update we actually haven't seen a
stylus work like that ever since the old
compaq I packs so it's a good update the
only problem is what happens when that
mechanism wears off because i used to
have problems with the ipaq because of
that and one of the most anticipated
phones of the year is the one plus two
which we should meet in the next few
weeks we get some spec like Santa we
have a Snapdragon 810 processor 5.7 inch
quad HD display we've got that Sony
sensor for the 16 megapixel shooter in
addition to four gigs of ram and
everything seems extremely positive
let's just see it
lives up to the hype whenever it gets
launched and finally for the very
interesting news of the day it seems
that Apple has just woken up and smelled
the coffee about the Vice storage
because one of the biggest complaints
with the iphone 6 is its 16 gigabytes of
storage starting point for some people
that's enough but for most people it
isn't and we've got trusted sources
claiming that as of the iphone success
everything is going to start at 32 gigs
which is great news you'll also have
options for 64 and 128 gigs respectively
so again we just hope that this happens
but it does lead me to the question of
the day what is the minimum amount of
storage that you can live with on a
device what is the minimum amount
because in my case Oh whew if it's a 32
gigs expandable I can live with that but
that is the minimum leave us a comment
down below what is your case brands you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on
parking i'll comment subscribe my
youtube channel as well yet follow me on
twitter hi my underscored any better
