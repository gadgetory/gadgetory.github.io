and it's so massive that we have no idea
where our data is going at any given
moment and while there might be some
tangible let's say benefits where our
data tries to come back to us in the
form of targeted ads the unfortunate
reality is that there are things out
there that might use our data for more
nefarious purposes
now while better Internet security is
going to be incredibly important moving
forward it's just one further benefit
that I experienced by changing up my
daily browser this is PocketNow and I'm
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
let me take a second here to talk about
the brave browser like many of you out
there I'm a chrome addict you might call
me a Google addict actually because like
many of you my accounts and services are
on an Android phone
and through pure necessity I need to use
the Chrome browser to sync all of my
data across my devices it is also a
matter of convenience when setting up a
new computer logging into my Google
account just means that my bookmarks
history favorites and extensions are all
automatically installed without me
having to do much work but also like
many of you out there I have the same
complaints when it comes to Chrome while
it might be a pretty speedy experience
and so much of the internet has adopted
Chrome as its main browser and supports
this browser it is also an incredible
resource hog there are times when I'm
multitasking perhaps to a degree that is
kind of unnatural for most users where
I'm actually playing a game on one
screen and then I have a YouTube video
playing on the other or I might just pop
back and forth between that and
productivity workflows with all of the
different tabs that I might have open in
Chrome sometimes I might actually
experience a slight stutter here or
there or worse the Chrome browser might
actually just lock up because it has run
out of resources that it can actually
use now while I have tried to change up
my browser in the past I always run into
at least one part of the internet that
demands integration with chrome entered
the brave browser and after using it for
the past week I'm installing it on my
daily drivers and making it my default
everywhere you might notice that it
looks kind of familiar and that is no
accident after all this browser is one
of many based on chromium the open
source browser project based on Chrome
so brave has the skeleton of Chrome but
a new set of armor complete with shields
to protect users from the CD or whims of
the Internet everything that has kept me
originally on the Chrome browser remains
and
the cast button but I can also install
pretty much any extension that I used to
have on Chrome
also when installing brave browser all
of the bookmarks and browser history and
settings from the previous default
browser is also synced but speaking of
those extensions this is where Braves
main feature comes in the shield's in
Chrome installation of ad blockers and
security measures was a separate affair
but brave has it all built in the
shield's not only block unwanted ads and
prevent the annoying autoplay found on
various websites but it also keeps back
all of the trackers trying to sink their
claws into your data and wasn't until I
used the brave browser on the daily for
like the last week that I realized how
many attempts were being made on my data
on the daily I've been able to surf the
web the same as I always have and
according to the browser it still
blocked tens of thousands of ads and
hundreds of trackers apropos of me to
have my little avatar in the corner be a
ninja what's funny is all of that
important as it is turned out to be
secondary to my main reason why I moved
to brave and that would be its minimal
footprint and even after putting in my
most used extensions I was still able to
keep the resource load to a minimum
because ad blocking is already an
integral part of the brave browser it's
not an extra and the result has been a
browsing experience that doesn't bog
down my system the way that Chrome has
in the past for a lot of people and a
lot of you watching this might be one
reason already to give this a try and
the brave browsers actually
cross-platform you can install it on iOS
and Android devices and I'm certainly
going to make it a permanent part of my
new device setup now I gave this one a
little bit of thought because while
browsers are a thing in the Google Play
Store for example it's not as if we use
it as much as we do on desktops however
there are times when you're in one of
the many applications you'll have
installed on your phones that it wants
to open up a browser and it's doing that
little handoff between the app and the
browser that I want to make sure those
shields are definitely up device think
is currently bookmarks only but that
will change as the brave browser grows
out of its beta stages and adds more
features moving forward one of those
features is an expansion of the bat or
v80 token system where a blockchain
currency layer Awards users and web
sites for allowing certified safe ads
now if you want to check it out for
yourself you can go into the Lane
down below and trout a browser for
yourself that treats you less like a
product and lets you surf the internet
faster than the speed of chrome with
less of the resource cost but in any
case let's go ahead and just call it on
this one thank you so much for watching
and you can get into the comment
sections down below let us know what
browser you're currently using and if
you choose to try out the brave browser
let us know what your experience has
been as well don't forget to subscribe
to bogging now if you haven't already
dropped some lights on these videos like
I said get into the comments and look
forward to our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
