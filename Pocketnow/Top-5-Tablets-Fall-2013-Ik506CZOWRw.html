and we know that a lot of you are on the
ropes considering what tablets should
you buy for this holiday season so I'm
high never be better this is pocket now
and these are our top five tablets for
the fall of 2013 number five is the
Galaxy Note 10.1 and trust me this
tablet did not run TouchWiz and if this
tablet would run a Snapdragon 800
processor we'd probably give it a higher
slot really so far this one of the best
tablets when it comes to its multi
window support aside from the fact that
it's got great pixel density and the
display it's got great color accuracy
it's got a great feel in the hand the
price tag is actually not so steep for
what you're getting in this tablet still
obviously you have to like TouchWiz
number four is the ipad mini with retina
display and if this tablet did not cost
you four hundred dollars it would
probably be at the top of the list we've
been waiting for retina display iPad
Mini for the longest time it's great
that we finally get it but at times when
you get a nexus 7 with the same pixel
density as the ipad mini it really does
become hard for you to cough 400 bucks
for this tablet still if you want to be
in the apple ecosystem and still if you
want to get all the applications that
yet so I'm the fact that it's probably
one of the best looking tablets out
there yes the ipad mini with retina
display would be our fourth choice
number three is the microsoft surface
pro and the only reason why this tablet
is not at the top of the list is because
not everybody wants a Productivity
tablets and not everybody wants to pay
the amount of money that it cost but so
far if you want to get the best
productivity tablet out there and I was
just talking about productivity there's
probably one of the fastest Windows
computers out there this is a computer
not really a tablet for consumption you
can do everything you want in this
tablet and again if it weren't so beefy
if it weren't so pricey this would
probably be the perfect tablet for those
of you that want to do more but just
consume content with your tablet still
again these tablets have existed for so
many years and they haven't taken off
and such was the case last year so
obviously that's the reason why it gets
the third spot number two is the google
nexus 7 probably one of the most loved
tablets out there starting because of
its price tag two hundred thirty dollars
for this tablet and you get the best of
google great operating system great
software updates and it's actually a
very good tablet well designed the great
display it's got great pixel density it
could have a better processor it could
have a better
camera for those of you that actually
want to take pictures with the tablet
and still the only reason why it's not
at the top is because obviously the
specifications of the Nexus 7 are not
always the best and finally for the top
number one tablet of the fall of 2013 is
the ipad air there's just no way around
this tablet it is the most popular
tablet out there and it is for a reason
Apple really goes far when it comes to
design aside from the fact that it's the
best ecosystem it's probably one of the
best displays in the market it's got
great battery life great performance
overall and really for those of you that
want a tablet for what most people want
to tablet which is really just content
consumption the ipad air can't be beat
obviously its price tag could be better
but then again when you think about the
fact that it's probably better designed
that every other tablet out there at
just one pound of weight Apple really
nails the reason why you would want to
tablet but still that leads me to the
question of this top five which would be
your top number one tablet which would
be the tablet that you would consider
better obviously these are our opinions
but you have your own leave us a comment
down below what do you think that's it
for our top 5 video thank you very much
for watching remember that the tablets
mentioned in this video are the ones
that were launched after spring 2013 to
the States obviously so there are other
tablets in the market that could be
compelling for you as well make sure you
follow it on social media subscribe to
channel as well you can follow me on
twitter Jaime underscore to be better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw i am home at me then

will see you in the next stop fire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
