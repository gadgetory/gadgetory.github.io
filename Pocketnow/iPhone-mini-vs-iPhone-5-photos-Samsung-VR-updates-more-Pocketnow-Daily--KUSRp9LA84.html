leaked iphone mini was actually the real
deal sony provides some explanations
over why crippled the xperia z5 in the
US and it seems that the NFL is not too
happy with the microsoft surface i'm
high netting that I and could it be that
you two got the day wrong and that song
from the 70s or 80s this is parking out
daily I'm sure you remember that a few
years ago the NFL made a big deal over
the Microsoft Surface replacing the iPad
and certain teams as they kind of didn't
understand the tablet back then but this
is rather interesting the New England
Patriots just lost the game for a few
points recently and they were blaming
everything on a technical issue that
lasted 20 minutes and even though they
aren't directly saying that it's the
fault of the Microsoft Surface
apparently they are claiming something
close to that and Microsoft is already
denying that anything has to do with the
company stay tuned this this a new soap
opera unravels and for those of you
still questioning the possibility of B
are becoming a thing in a very near
future Samsung wants to bet high on this
up to the point where it is reported
that the company is investing in some
movie studios particularly from the
Sundance Film Festival apparently the
company wants to give these but you know
Studios the possibility to record videos
in 3d so you can eventually watch these
movies on the are and I did some VR with
YouTube last night on google cardboard
and I kind of really liked the
experience so I think they're onto
something good and speaking of Samsung
the company is a not having a good time
when it comes to software updates number
one because my galaxy note5 still does
not have marshmallow and that's actually
become a little bit of an issue because
the company just received a little
lawsuit mainly because of how terrible
it is when it comes to software updates
and if you're still waiting for your
current devices to get marshmallow the
company has just let us know that they
are delayed and it could happen until
after februari which rings a lot of
bells particularly for the galaxy s7 to
actually sell for those of you that are
disappointed with Sony over removing the
thicker print scanner from the Xperia z5
and it's lon
the United States we don't really think
that you should be disappointed given
how bad that sensor was and we showed
you on video but then again if you're
wondering exactly why the company has
just come on record to claim that it was
a business decision yeah I know a
business decision no real explanation
here the company is just pretty much
brushing it off and well let's just see
if the phone actually sells particularly
when it's just so late and finally for
the very hot leaks up today if you were
wondering if that iphone mini video was
real well it seems that it kind of is we
now have some photographs of it being
compared against the iphone 5 and they
have the same size and unless this is a
really good photoshop job it's pretty
much a smaller iPhone 6 being compared
to this phone which is a again rather
interesting it's really hard to predict
exactly what Apple plants to do with
this phone because well we've got the
iphone 6 that's still in the market and
it sells for a hundred dollars less so
it leads me to the question of the day
how much would you be willing to pay for
this iphone mini whenever apple launches
it because in my case unless they retain
the same specs of the iphone 6s on this
phone and all the features i would not
pay more than 350 bucks for this thing
but it was a comment down below as I
doubt that Apple little price it that
way friends as always you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video was filmed make sure
you follow us on packing out on comments
a structure to channel as well you
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
that are on Instagram it hang up a data
let's give this video a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi Natalie then
I think you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
