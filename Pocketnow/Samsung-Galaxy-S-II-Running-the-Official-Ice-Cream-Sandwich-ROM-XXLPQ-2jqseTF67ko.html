pocketnow.com and what I have here is an
international unlocked samsung galaxy s2
running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
the official way and if you have a phone
like I do you have every right to be
excited because Samsung has finally
decided to start the rollout process as
of yesterday the update is available in
several regions of Europe and Korea if
you live in the UK you'll be able to
flash this one around March 19th but
until then we're gonna show you in this
quick video what you can expect from the
official ROM so stay tuned
so here we are with Android 4.0 point
three as you can see here it's the
official Ice Cream Sandwich round for
the galaxy s2 and this final version
isn't that much different from the
leaked one which we sell a couple of
weeks ago still there are a couple of
slight changes for instance in the
TouchWiz Department regardless of how
many home screens you have set up in the
late version or regardless of how many
screens in your application drawer
whenever you have reached the first or
the last screen in the application
drawer or on your home screens you had a
slight tilting effect which showed you
that hey this is the first or the last
home screen you cannot scroll past it
but we wanted infinite scrolling back
and the final build brings it back as
you can see regardless of the direction
I'm scrolling in you can go on like this
forever and of course it applies to the
applications r2 which by the way allows
you still to have your applications
viewed in a ListView let's get back home
of course if we go into edit there is
still the opportunity to have 3 4 5 6 &amp;amp;
7 so 7 solo home screens you can flip
through them like you normally would or
if you tap on these small buttons here
you will be able to quickly jump to one
home stream or the other pinch out and
quickly access this is something which I
believe HTC introduced with its sense
another thing many of you have asked for
is how the Samsung Galaxy S 2 running
ICS handles
multitasking long tapping and holding on
the home button brings you the list of
your most recently used applications and
you can easily discard one or flip back
and forth between them so here's my
facebook long tap &amp;amp; hold I can switch
back to settings long tap &amp;amp; hold I can
switch back to the Play Store which by
the way doesn't come included in the new
ICS ROM it's still Android Market but
when you first launch it it will update
itself automat
to Google Play Store now if you want to
close an application or you want to free
up some memory you have the button for
task manager which is really the Samsung
thing as you can see right now we have
four hundred and sixty seven sixty five
actually megabytes used out of the total
of eight thirty-one active applications
we have of course Facebook which is
using a lot of CPU right now so we might
as well kill it and if you want a free
up memory you can always clear memory
and it will jump down to 329 after
closing twenty-something applications of
course long tapping and holding allows
you to swipe either left or either right
to dismiss or basically to remove an
application from the history screen
another thing you wanted to see is how
face unlock works and whether it is
included or not we need to go to
security to screen lock and will have
the option for none slide which is
basically what I'm using right now it's
your normal unlock circle face unlock
which is there and I've tested it out
it's working but it's more like a
gimmick of course you had the pattern
the pin and the password so face unlock
is there jumping into the camera no
unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s2
running ICS doesn't allow for instant
picture snapping and just to give you an
example let's focus on something it's
focused BAM but when you don't focus it
takes you approximately three seconds
let's take the iPhone 4s and snap a
picture of it
they're approximately three seconds so
it's nothing new unfortunately I didn't
inherit all the features of the Galaxy
Nexus running Android Ice Cream Sandwich
the browser is typically your ICS
browser nothing good nothing bad it
works as it should it's buttery smooth
it's not Jaggi it's not laggy it's what
you should expect from ICS running on a
rather capable device now there aren't
many widgets basically there's no
additional widget included by Samsung
and in terms of pre installed
applications
the only applications which are new
compared to what we had on Gingerbread I
think I've put them in a folder
regardless it's here on my home screen
it's Google+ and messenger that's all
which came included in addition to the
Gingerbread ROM okay let's jump in and
take a look at the battery and you have
to take my word for this I've fully
charged this phone yesterday this
morning I didn't fully charge it hence
the counter did not reset I unplugged
this phone at approximately 97% of its
charge at around 7:30 a.m.
now it's 12:15 and I'm still on 77% the
screen is of course on has been taking
39% of the battery usage but I've been
filming this for the past 10 or 15
minutes with maximum brightness and no
screen time out so I should be around 80
maybe 80 plus percent let's get back to
the home screen of course in terms of
performance day to day usage it is very
fluid it's not Jaggi at all I will post
some screenshots of the several
benchmarks so that you can compare it
with your own maybe with a custom ROM
you are using and it will give you a
general idea what to expect from the
official Ice Cream Sandwich run just
running quickly through the applications
here clock calendar music as you can see
nothing new here the gallery is still
the good old gallery it's nothing out of
the ordinary Google Play Store is
something which updated by itself
first launching the Android Market
Spotify and Shazam is something I
install on my own use so is Twitter so
is messenger LinkedIn Skype Google+ and
messenger team pre-installed Facebook
Messenger and are my own installs videos
nothing in here of course we have Google
Maps but let it you we have navigation
we have the task manager nothing out of
the ordinary nothing new and of course
you have your four hubs which I don't
personally use as you can tell they are
on my last home screen now many of you
out there sent me emails you wanted to
see the task manager and I've showed you
that and also there were many emails
that I received
people wanted to see how it's currently
updating something yeah it should update
Shazam so update notifications work
actually what I was telling you about is
that I received lots of emails asking me
to show you the contact and how Samsung
handled it luckily aside from the skin
top part the contacts are the same as in
ICS let me just try to find a contact
which wouldn't mind me showing off his
his personal information okay let's see
this one as you can see we have the
picture right here and if I would be
connected to Google+ I will be able to
swipe left and then I'd see all the
updates and a new pane so this is pretty
much it if you want to see something
else regarding the Ice Cream Sandwich
update leave us a comment below or leave
us a comment in the appropriate post on
pocketnow.com so as a general idea after
using the official run for almost a day
we can tell you that it's buttery smooth
but we couldn't expect something else
from the Samsung Galaxy s2 which is a
phone almost one year old but it's still
one of the top Android phones out there
well there's actually a debate whether
the Galaxy S 2 is better than the Galaxy
Nexus of course if we don't take into
consideration the huge resolution on the
Galaxy Nexus still it's buttery smooth
it looks good
TouchWiz well whether you like it or not
it's included else battery life is good
reception is good we have only good
things to say about this again touch
with the side
it's Android 4.0 this wasn't in the
United from pocketnow.com
taking a look at the Samsung Galaxy S 2
running the official Android Ice Cream
Sandwich run thank you for watching and
