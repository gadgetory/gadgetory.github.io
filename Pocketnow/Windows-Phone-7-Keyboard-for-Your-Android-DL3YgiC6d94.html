pocketnow.com one of the best parts of
Windows Phone 7 is its keyboard the keys
are just the right height and they feel
great
but what if you an Android well there's
a keyboard that you can get for your
Android that actually looks and feels a
lot like this Windows Phone 7 keyboard
and in this video we are going to talk
about it let's get to it
okay so the keywords from XD developers
from user frost incredible it's very
simple very easy to install the only
downside is that it does not yet have
the clicky sounds but the developer says
that coming soon there will be clicky
sounds which of course are always very
important so here we have the keyboard
and I'm gonna do a little backspace as
you can tell the keyboards aren't
identical but you really get that
characteristic of the tall rectangular
keys here a lot of space good if you've
got bigger hands and so if I type kind
of from this weird angle it's a very
accurate it feels very comfortable it's
a lot better than the built in Android
stock keyboard that a lot of devices
have out there like the Nexus S I'll put
a link up in the description so you can
download this all you have to do is
install the APK file and then go into
the keyboard settings and select this
particular keyboard as your default and
you got it going do you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and if you
have any suggestions for keywords that
you like to use an Android please tell
us in the comments thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
