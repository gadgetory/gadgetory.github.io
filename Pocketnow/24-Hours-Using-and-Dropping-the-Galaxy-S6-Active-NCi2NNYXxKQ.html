active and we've spent the last 24 hours
with it in preparation for our full
review and while our detailed
impressions will have to wait for that
review it didn't even take us a day to
draw one important conclusion this might
be the Samsung that finally gets active
right
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
see why as we touched on yesterday this
is the third time samsung's tried its
hand at creating a so-called active
variant of its halo galaxy s smartphone
the first try in 2013 yielded the galaxy
s4 active which made some sense at the
time the standard s4 was made of soft
glossy plastic that was prone to
scratching and very vulnerable to drops
so it made sense to offer a beefed-up
version that brought rubber bumpers to
the corners and a matte finish to the
backside
but while the S 4 active did include
water resistance it didn't back that up
with any milspec rugged ization for
shock or impact attenuation and it
featured a removable battery door with a
now-infamous locking problem that
resulted in a lot of phones getting
waterlogged last year Samsung tried
improving on the formula with the Galaxy
s5 active a smart phone that wouldn't go
on to win any awards for subtlety in its
design now despite the hilarious paint
job there were real improvements namely
mil standard 810g rugged ization
alongside the existing ingress
protection but the s5 active seemed
almost superfluous owing to the fact
that the standard Galaxy s5 was
water-resistant too and it featured a
battery cover that while not pretty was
also not glossy so it didn't show
scratches as readily on top of that the
s5 actives rugged ization turned out to
be somewhat overstated both the SIM tray
and the removable battery door were
vulnerable to jarring loose on impacts
with hard surfaces and we ruined a
review device when it flooded with water
after one such drop
the Galaxy s6 active in our labs today
features an embedded battery and a
sealed back cover that's not removable
at first this seemed like just as big a
step backward as it initially did on the
standard s6 but there are two important
differences that make that not true
first obviously is that this should fix
the finicky gasket problem of previous
active phones you think about it with no
battery door to forget to lock or to jar
loose on an impact there's less danger
of water or dust intrusion and second
the battery inside isn't the same
mediocre 25 50 milliamp power pack of
the standard s6 but a much larger 3500
milliamp hour battery that's already
showing itself to be a better performer
even at this early stage of our review
process wireless charging has been
brought over from the stock s6 as well
and if you want a faster wired charge
you don't have to deal with the flaps of
yesteryear thanks to the new free
flooding USB port which is probably to
thank for the shift from an ip67 rating
to ip68 fYI that's a minor bump to an
already excellent water and dust
resistance level and the dense
rubberized plastic finish on the s6
active is a huge contrast to the
slippery glass and metal of the non
active version making it easier this
year to decide which one is right for
you based on lifestyle how well it holds
up will depend on how much abuse you put
it through and what color you get our
gray model here is more black than
anything else so repeated impacts with
asphalt and concrete from distances of
up to three feet left it with
considerable scuffing don't expect this
to retain any kind of beauty
well what beauty it had if you're a real
phone beater
fortunately our drop testing thus far
seems to suggest it'll keep working well
even after a fall down some pretty tall
stairs and washing it off afterwards is
a cinch here's where I remind you though
that these are by no means final
conclusions because we've only had the
phone for a day and in fact as this
video goes to the server
our SX active review unit seems to think
it's on a dock even though we don't have
a dock for it and don't know that one is
available for it and we also don't know
whether that's because of impact damage
or water damage
we're letting it dry out for a few hours
and we'll report back on this in the
full review finally there's a bit of
software refinement that deserves a
quick mention the dedicated active key
made its debut last year but it wasn't
capable of waking the phone from standby
making it pretty useless for well what
it was built for quick actions
thankfully Samsung has done the key
right this year now allowing you to jump
right from a locked phone to the
outdoorsman friendly activity zone or a
custom app of your choosing if you long
press it and there's no need to assign
it to the camera as we did last year
because the double click home shortcut
is alive and well so what we've got so
far is a ruggedized alternative to a
very slippery and delicate smartphone
but one which incorporates nearly all of
the features of the latter and even
improves on a few we'll know whether
it's worth buying after devoting the
time necessary for a full review but the
Galaxy s6 active is already making more
sense to me than any of Samsung's past
active offerings keep letting us know
what questions you want answered in that
full review folks drop your comments
below and on your way hit that thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video till
next time this is michael fisher with
pocket down captain two phones on
twitter it reminding you that unless
your phone is at least as beefy as this
one don't go trying those drop tests at
home thanks for watching we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
