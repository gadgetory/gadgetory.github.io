might go glass on glass you get the
first batch of rumors of specifications
of the galaxy note 6 and the HTC 10
design already points to a nexus future
and renders I'm high metal iveta
reporting from Aoife GPC in hong kong
with the worst case of jet lag ever this
is parking out daily they're gonna have
to bear with me at the time that I
recorded this video was 12 hours away
from the east coast so a lot of things
can change by the time this video goes
live like for example the case of Amazon
we hear that it's going to branch out
prime services and it's going to now
offer you the option to get prime video
separately for 899 and then shipping
services in music for 1099 it's not
necessarily bad but it still makes it
compelling to pay a hundred dollars a
year we'll keep you posted as we learn
more we've got other trusted sources
claiming that there are some major
changes coming to be are with Android
and that aren't available in Developer
Preview apparently google is gonna
either separate it or offer another
module or just enhance the experience
with virtual reality which makes a lot
of sense as apparently it's not
necessarily the best unnecessarily bad
either but we should learn more at
Google i/o and we also get the first
batch of rumors when it comes to the
specifications of the galaxy note 6 in
the past the we would get major
enhancements between the galaxy note on
the Galaxy S line but now it doesn't
seem that way apparently the Exynos
88-90 is making a comeback 5.8 inch quad
HD display which is okay but then we
hear six gigabytes of RAM which is a
rather interesting change we should
learn more very soon as well and it's
funny we have been covering rumors of
the iphone for 2017 for a while which is
not going to happen anytime soon we've
got one iphone to come by the end of
this year but we hear two different
rumors 10 at this place we've covered
that a while but we also hear from
trusted sources KGI securities
particularly that it might go glass on
glass now this glass is hard to predict
if it will be either sapphire or ceramic
but apparently the case will be that it
will be a glass on glass design which
makes a lot of sense for antenna
reception and the law
so horrible antenna lines we will keep
you posted on that as well and finally
the hottest rumors that they have to do
with the future Nexus made by HTC we've
got some interesting renters what some
user most probably grab the image from
the HTC 10 and just swapped Nexus
branding at the back dual speakers at
the front and asked everybody what they
thought about the design it makes a lot
of sense it makes a lot of sense for HTC
to retain the design more like with
Motorola did with the Nexus 6 with the
difference that the nexus 6 was huge
hopefully these size differences don't
make the cut but it does lead me to the
question of the day would you like the
HTC 10 to reach the future Nexus or
would you like something unique between
HTC and Google because in my case I
really would not mind the same design
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know your opinion was on

this one at the shi no look alright so
you're gonna have to bear with me when i
recorded this video was 12 hours before
because i'm in a very different shin so
instead of having to pay a hundred
dollars for everything you can now pay
999 and got some people video you get it
separately for an 8 99 no 9 10 friends
