pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
video of the Amazon Kindle let's get
started it's a big box for a small
device and this is what we get huh very
interesting I want to move in a little
bit on this like a piece of elastic here
a little metal clasp some paperwork for
me and Wow and this is the kindle
kindle set on fire 2 to inspire stir up
very interesting see what we have in the
left side here looks like a instruction
manual and how do you remove this thing
okay it looks like there's a tab at the
top and you pull on it like so and
there's something on the bottom here
this looks like the cover for the kindle
very soft leather let me give it the
smell test it doesn't smell like real
leather and here is the unit okay pretty
lightweight actually very lightweight
let's see how it looks compared to a
standard paperback book the tipping
point very good book
I like how it feels in hand it's got a
its got a rubbery coating on the back so
that feels nice and compared to a
hardcover book it's much smaller and
certainly much thinner this is the world
is flat another good book so yeah the
kindle is small it feels good in hand
it's sturdy I just I keep accidentally
pressing these buttons I know a lot of
people have been complaining about that
and they do get in the way so that is
the Kindle lots more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
