thought my jokes were bad I swear he
breaks physics with how fast he says his
name photons are just watching this word
fly past them all right
I needed that laughs hey Jaime have you
realized some of us come not only to see
the news about technology but also to
see your t-shirts and what would they
say your show ha ha excellent job as
always I lose I know guys I really got a
handle to rip apparel these guys are
geniuses and again if you're interested
first link in the description and
there's a coupon code to get yourself
ten percent off that's right it's that
time of the week I am hiding it out this
is pocket now and this is the pocket now
daily recap for last week so unday the
topic was the iPhone 8 we had some case
leaks and most of these showed a very
ugly phone but I asked you what you
thought about it we had 567 comments the
vertical camera hump is a monstrosity oh
my god I need to frame your comment
there is no better way to declare that
if they get a flat camera even if it's
vertical bezel is designed for
millimeter all around and a fingerprint
sensor inside the display then I think
this phone would look stunning I also
feel that way too and I'm sure Apple
does too but I doubt they'll pull it off
that camera huh ruins it for me
Samsung has almost eliminated the hump
on the galaxy lineup now
I wish Apple would follow suit you know
I do agree but remember that was a work
in progress the first ever camera hump
on the galaxy s6 was horrible the s7 got
better the s8 is flush so I think it's a
again it's a work in progress on Tuesday
the topic was possibilities of a curved
display on the iPhone we hear that the
company is not able to build enough of
these and they have yielded shoes I
asked you to feel that not having a
curved displays a deal-breaker
we had 769 comments I don't care about
curved displays if it looks good that's
about it you know devices like the LG G
6 has proven that you do not need a
curved display to make a beautiful phone
I have to agree
I wonder why other manufacturers like
Samsung managed to launch 10 plus
different phones a year and yet managed
to pull all the features in their
flagship but Apple
which launches one to two phones a year
can't put any new things on their phones
you have to remember that again as I
mentioned earlier it is a work in
progress it's not like if Samsung
gradually just one day out of the blue
launch the phone with curved displays
and when they did those of you that
remember the Galaxy Note will remember
how terrible it was the Galaxy Note edge
was just terrible on every sense of
usability and then the galaxy s7 edge
for example had terrible palm rejection
whatever until the defunct note 7 that
they figured about so you know the way
Cupertino is they won't want something
until it really works but then they have
the Apple watch for example which proves
me completely wrong so let's just move
on it curves feels good in the hand if
you know what I'm talking about now I
don't know what you're talking about
on Wednesday things went crazy in the
comments as a we talked about the
oneplus 5 we saw some possible leaks but
everybody's claiming to be fake even
though I wish they were and you know
speaking of that what was your wish list
we had 1152 comments my wish for the 1+5
is simply to get them to keep sticking
to their roots of offering a really good
phone at a reasonable price you know
this has been the first time that I've
been exposed to oneplus phones ever
since the oneplus three I didn't feel
that way before but now that I've used
them I totally agree with you know I
really know oneplus is famous at least
for me and the fact that they stick to
the basics and they stick to them right
they provide a good product at a good
price I wish that they continued with
that of course I'd be 68 rating IR
blaster microSD slot minimum bezel
latest processor camera optics one plus
five wish list you know I would actually
stop and say do you want a private jet
to include with that but everything that
you asked is on spot of course I would
love absolutely all of that I be 68
topping the list
the only good smartphone feature that's
slowly fading out stereo speakers oh my
god oneplus please if you're watching
this video that would be awesome if you
figured out stereo speakers like
seriously I mean it's one of those
essential things for content consumption
that I feel was probably also missing
don't get me wrong the speaker on the 1
plus 3t was great the audio performance
from the headphone jack was off
but sometimes you just don't want to
pull over the hassle of pulling out
headphones or anything you just want to
hear something good at the moment you
know on Thursday things got a little
heated mainly because we saw some
possibly schematics of the iPhone aids
these looked very official and I asked
you what you thought about them the
comments were 804 delete that iPhone 8
design Apple or else I will eat you and
delete you in my toilet okay hate the
vertical cameras I was reading that and
all I could think of in my mind was
imagining grumpy Smurf saying I hate
vertical cameras obviously people need
to stop judging the iPhone based on
leaked photos the iPhone always looks
much better when they actually reveal it
oh my god that is so true not that I'm
trying to defend Apple or anything but
you're so right
every single leak of any iPhone in the
past has been terrible I remember when
the iPhone 5 leaks came out all of us
were like oh my god that looks horrible
and then when we saw the final phone it
was beautiful probably the best iPhone
design ever in my opinion so of agreed
with you and finally on Friday the topic
was HTC and their new ads they were
going to squeeze the brilliance out of
their possible you 11 I asked you what
you thought they meant we had 451
comment going to squeeze out the
whatever little life it has left
that was a sick burn but they better
honestly they better squeeze whatever
they can out of this phone squeeze your
pockets and give you a large phone with
poor usage of space oh my god in
technology I think that phrase is going
to be patented I mean Marquez I dude I
gotta hand it to you you really made
this phrase viral for a phone that
wasn't getting much publicity until you
pulled that video off seriously I think
HTC is going to introduce the
pressure-sensitive edges as we had
earlier seen in the Nokia Maclaurin oh
my god we had two comments they were
focused on this obviously I can only
mention one but you are so right that
would be an awesome approach even though
I wonder I mean I rarely use the edge
display features on the galaxy s 8 well
I didn't on the s7 I do now because
there's better palm rejection and it
just reacts better now so so long as
they're able to pull it off and it's not
another gimmick like the HTC Sense
companion
I'm sold that's it for the pocket out
