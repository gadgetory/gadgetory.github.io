hymen apologizing I know dude I'm sorry
I play Hymas videos at 25% speed to here
drunk hymen that's actually a good idea
I'm a believer that's his wife before
going to bed I'm high mentally that a
good night story
how did you get 150 likes for that
that's right it's that time of the week
I'm high mentally that I've this is
PocketNow and this is Mari now daily
recap your comments for last week on
Monday the comments were all about the
huawei mate X its announcement its price
tag our video our thoughts we had 441
comments I asked you what you thought my
wallet folded watching this press f to
pay respects oh my god oh yeah it's I
have a lot of mixed feelings about that
made X I love it I wouldn't pay for it
now galaxy fold seems cheap and Apple
will be able to charge four thousand
dollars next year for their foldable
dude exactly
probably one of the things that I hate
the most is that they're only
vindicating and proving that Apple is
not charging enough money hello Jaime
foldable phone price is way too high two
years from now and foldable stream tech
will be less pricey than most of us
would buy oh the funny part is every
single iPhones is the iPhone 10 has a
folded bullet inside true I mean with
the companies have made changes in order
for a lot of things to be foldable it's
just got 2,300 bucks man no but on
Tuesday the topic was the Huawei V 30
pro we heard rumors that there might
only be three cameras I asked you what
do you think about that in 2019 we had
400 comments 2018 a whopping three
cameras 2019 only three cameras fine
thank you
you've got a point what a ripoff only
three cameras all right fine make fun of
me I deserve it true I think the pro
fourth camera will be time-of-flight
we've seen it from the galaxy s 10 5g up
I it would be great if they included it
true I mean we're going overboard
and speaking of cameras and weird things
we hear that the Galaxy Note 10 will
bring four cameras out of which one of
them
we'll be included in the s-pen I believe
so on Wednesday I asked you like what do
you think about that we have 212
comments it lived with the camera on the
s-pen they could drop the front camera
it would be their integrated front
camera which allows for no cut out in
the front screen could be nice dude
that's actually a genius idea
thank you I hope they do it I hadn't
thought of that spen with camera no
thanks unless proven not to be a gimmick
oh my god comment number one actually
makes a point I mean mark is right that
would be like ideal camera everywhere
the FBI are hella happy y-you seem to
cut out the cut out pictures on reddit
that uses your wallpaper on the galaxy s
tens and one of them is FBI indicators
well on Thursday the topic was the
Galaxy fold again we hear that it will
be sold in limited quantities I asked
Jeremy what do you think do you think
that it should be a limited edition
product or that it should be sold in
masses we had 330 comments it makes
sense that the Galaxy fold will have
limited availability not a lot of them
will be sold but make it appear that
demand is high like Microsoft did with
the early service devices Microsoft did
that with the surfaces but true that's
actually what Apple does could be the
price alone makes it an exclusive
product so might as well do it
themselves true that I it's definitely
not priced for consumers that is true it
makes sense for the Galaxy fold but I
would hope there will be a Gentoo
version and the smart razor device would
pique my interest as well I hope I read
that right yeah I there are rumors
actually that there is a galaxy fold who
we actually covered it this week where
we were talking about the possibility
and I think that it makes a lot of sense
and then finally Friday the topic was
the Huawei Pete 30 Pro we were
discussing the whole concept of how the
cameras would be designed and I asked
you which setup do you like we had 360
comments I believe the wide is more
useful
dude through that I mean I've been using
it on every smartphone that I've liked
like the wall we made 20 Pro LG devices
and now the galaxies have it it's even
better 10x my inner creep says yes true
because the rumors are that one of these
cameras is periscopic it would be great
if they pulled it off I mean I just I
can't wait to see it I think the
wide-angle camera will be on the
standard camera of the people
Pro that could be the case I don't know
man p30 Pro they did a great thing with
the p20 Pro it innovated it brought a
different approach to cameras 40
megapixels which is now pretty much the
standard in a lot of phones so honestly
I can't wait for a while way to pull
that off again but that's just me that's
it for the bar now daily recap thank you
