want to look at the 18 feet fuse and how
compares to the HTC kaiser or ATT tilt
also notice the time to the fuse
replaces the tilt on ATT and so we're
going to look at some comparison we see
the fuse is a little bit shorter
vertically about the same thickness and
a little less wide let's look at some of
the hardware but we have very flat
hardware buttons on the fuse so those
are difficult to touch and feel but on
the tilt we have a nice rigid panel here
you got hardware buttons for the Start
menu I can go easily navigating with the
d-pad I can fuel which ones are where
I've ok menu I have customized
customizable application launchers I
have the phone menu really easy to get
to everything there now with this turned
back on I only have a home key phone and
call and back
that's all I can do here without
touching screen of course we have more
fun things with touch the screen but no
tactile now what about one-handed
usability over here you see confuse only
has volume buttons and a push to talk
button but the tilt has customizable
button up here a wheel with an action
button in the middle and an ok blend so
let's see how we can do that ok bundles
is start me I can hit the phone I can
scroll through phone numbers icann it ok
and come back to the home screen I can
go down to my calendar to my text
messages I can go through this there's
lots of stuff I can do
all one handed with just my thumb right
over here scroll through applications it
clicks each time so you know that's good
stuff
that's great one-handed usability there
now let's look what else this can't
really do much you have to go and you've
got to look at the screen and you gotta
press department and got to move your
thumb all the way over here to do
anything you got it flick that's great
and let's look at the keyboards
see how quickly that happen again
well would you look at that the kaisers
fast trip flipping the screen so here we
are let's look at the keyboards closer
Kaiser has four rows it also has I start
menu ok buttons and soft key menus ok so
those are really easy to get to all of
those buttons but the fuse has five rows
and the Start menu is in a weird place
the function menus up here where the
kind of strange and the keys are smaller
and flattered overall the the tilt feels
better and it seems to be easier to type
now what else do we see keyboard takes
up a lot more area if you look at the
hinge
you see because the fuse is shorter this
lighting has to take up a lot less space
so we're getting more keyboard area here
with less of the sliding hinge where you
see with the Kaiser it takes up a lot of
space here however the ties are tilts up
like this which is great because you can
sit it down like that and watch them
fuse no tilting you can't see very well
screen you gotta tilt it yourself
so there's some of the differences
well sometimes excuse us faster
alright well the fuse also has a much
higher resolution screen it's hard to
tell in this video
but there you have it the differences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
