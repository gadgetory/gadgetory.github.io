Developer Preview is now running on our
Nexus 5x even after the official
unveiling during Google i/o preview 3
still doesn't have a dessert name since
the Android team is shirking their
responsibilities in naming their own
products for the purposes of this video
I will call this update Android Napoleon
because Napoleon's are delicious if
you've been following the Napoleon
preview progress beta 3 will look very
familiar the new notification shade
layout and animations are running smooth
our own Adam Dowd is super excited about
the clear-all option the multitasking
button can quick toggle you between
recent apps or launch the new
split-screen mode sadly were not able to
stream YouTube and Netflix at the same
time for those of you who aren't just
messing around using this feature for
real is a joy we're really happy to see
native split-screen apps on Android so
what's new in Napoleon for preview 3
well not a lot we can actually show you
yet this build of Android delivers the
new VR mode for Android which will
improve performance for virtual reality
apps but this performance option needs
to be embraced by developers before
consumers will see benefits anecdotally
cardboard apps seem to run about the
same as they always have
for folks you pair up with a hardware
keyboard there's a new option to toggle
keyboard shortcuts users can hit alt
slash to see what shortcuts are
available but again we can't find any
apps that are using this yet so it's
another thing we can't really show you
here we imagine it will look something
like this window from the keyboard
settings menu the one thing we can show
off is the new keyboard app with better
support for themes and background images
look at this snazzy blue typer which is
pretty keen and for some reason if I
wanted my keyboard to also be a picture
of my first Kettlecorn experiment I can
totally do that and the rest is under
the hood stuff developers are sure to
enjoy sustained performance mode should
help manufacturers better communicate
device limits to developers data saver
has a new whitelist option call blocking
has more secure security exceptions
and the launcher shortcuts API will be
delayed pushed back to a future Android
release folks Napoleon is looking good
in day one testing on this nexus
performance has been snappy and stable
for our beta we of course must caution
viewers from using pre-release software
on their daily driver phones but if
you're wanting to see what the future of
Android has to offer
this beta is in pretty good shape now if
only they could sort the name out so
we'd know what to call this thing as
always thanks so much for watching be

our continuing coverage of Android
Napolean help us out with some sharing
and hit that thumbs up button for a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos Pagnell you
can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
as some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video I don't care what
anyone says the most important thing
announced yesterday was Android ends
