receive are very important others not so
much
telling the difference between the two
requires going to your notification
shade pulling it down and dismissing the
unimportant ones so you can hopefully
find the important ones chat heads and
other floating notifications style
notifications try and tell you who it is
it's trying to contact you quicker and
faster so that you can determine if that
is that important contact that you've
been waiting for unfortunately up until
now you've had to had either Facebook
home or some other custom ROM or rooted
app that enables this functionality for
you today I want to show you one that
requires neither let's go take a look
this is my Nexus 4 it is routed but
yours does not have to be I have just
installed floating notifications and the
first thing it tells me once I'm
installed it and run it for the first
time is that I need to turn on my
accessibility options for this so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that it's very
simple you just go ahead and turn that
on it tells you that by doing so it can
collect the information that you type
into text such as credit card
information although that is a
possibility it's really not likely it's
just the method that you need to be able
to do this now we are also familiar with
that if I can get back over here on
pebbles so there's my pebble smartwatch
right there that also uses the
notification and the accessibility
schema if you will the service to get
information over onto the watch the same
way as this uses it to get it on to the
floating notifications on your screen so
once that is done then we can simply go
back home scroll around a little bit and
you'll notice everything looks just the
same if I want to get to my notification
shade I pull it down that's my current
notifications and now we wait the first
thing you'll notice is the app does put
a notification on the screen for you I
can move this around wherever I want
just by tapping and dragging or I can
set it there where after a few seconds
of inactivity it tucks itself neatly off
the side of the screen this is a
notification from the app
self saying hey the service is running
it's doing what it's supposed to to
dismiss it you simply tap on that it's
all gone now to do what this is really
supposed to do let's go ahead and send a
Google hangout chat go ahead and do that
you can see it comes across right over
here I do get the notification up here
in my notification bar but to get it
I've got to pull it down and look at it
here I can just tap from Michael Levi he
says hi
so we'll tap on that and it opens is
right up into the conversation thread
there are very few things that you can
do to come in and customize the app but
you really don't need to it does most of
it for you coming in here will just
launch the app we can choose a theme the
one that you've been seeing has been
default light if you are running a
darker theme you can choose default dark
underneath that you can change the icon
size the default is 100 you can make
that larger or you can make that smaller
you can also change the font size larger
or smaller as well just be advised the
larger the font size the more of the
screen it's going to cover up in the
last of the message you're going to be
able to see on extremely long messages
you can change your animation settings
and other stuff here don't show the the
notification for the currently open app
you're in it you don't need to see those
notifications and then if you want to
close the stack after pressing an action
you can do that as well
animation settings I've got mine set to
dock a few seconds of inactivity after
it's shown that alert so it'll just tuck
those notifications right away for you
just in case you're not looking at the
the device itself when you get that
notification next I don't have the fade
after a few seconds of inactivity when
the stack is closed I like having it
there but that's really a personal
preference choice the amount of the icon
that is hidden when it's docked in my
case and the default is 50% you can
choose more or less you can also expose
these on your lock screen I would
however recommend that you hide the
notification text when locked just in
case that might be a little bit more
private and you don't want people who
are just picking up your device off your
desk or whatnot to be able to see it
Advanced Settings you need to be careful
I haven't messed with them but there's a
double tap threshold that you can set in
there I don't know why that would be
dangerous but you know whatever the
version of floating notifications that
we showed you here
was alpha4 rc1 if you'd like to pick up
that copy or if there's a newer version
available head over to pocketnow.com the

will provide a way for you to get the
latest version of this app directly onto
your device if you liked what you saw go

your friends via your favorite social
