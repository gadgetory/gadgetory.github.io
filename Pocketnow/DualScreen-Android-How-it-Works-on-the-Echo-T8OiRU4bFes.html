pocketnow.com the Kyocera echo is the
first dual screen smartphone and it does
some really cool stuff if you're
wondering exactly how the two screens
work in tandem with one another in this
video we're gonna talk all about that so
let's get to it
so this is probably gonna be a long
video because there's a lot to explain
here so stick with us and you'll
understand exactly how Q Sierra
engineered this phone to work with two
displays because it's pretty fascinating
okay so the first thing that we're gonna
do right out of the gate here is run
quadrant to give you an idea of how fast
the device actually is now we are
running in the single screen mode right
now we're gonna jump into the got a
force close here we're gonna jump into
the dual screen mode in just a minute
but first we're going to run quadrant
I'll be back when this is done okay and
we're done here so let's click yes and
see our result so not too good actually
we're falling at around 754 in quadrant
which is below the galaxy s the Kyocera
echo could definitely benefit from more
horsepower as you're going to see
throughout this video it tends to be a
little bit slow overall it's snappy but
it could definitely use perhaps a
dual-core processor or more RAM so let's
go back to the home screen and flip out
the second display so when first of all
let's turn off the screen and see what
happens when you flip out the second
display when it's in standby the screen
turns on and goes out of the unlock
screen which is great saving you time so
you don't have to unlock the display at
all times so right now we are in tablet
mode and we can actually flip this into
landscape which you might look a lot
better so the way to think about this is
that there are three different ways that
an app can run on both displays number
one in tablet mode and in order to get
that to work we're going to give plenty
of of examples of exactly what that
means you need to get the tablet mode
extension from the Android Market which
I've already gone ahead and done so the
tablet mode will work in for example
Twitter so Twitter will scale to the 960
by 800 resolution pretty good actually
it looks just like it would look on a
gal
see tap the text is rendered at the
operating system level so that looks
crisp and clear some graphics might look
a little bit blurry
especially splash screens but generally
it's usable and it's really cool to be
able to have Twitter run on so many
pixels yeah the black border is annoying
but you get used to it another thing
that's annoying is if you go into
portrait let's see if I can show you an
example see the word someone right there
the som is lower than the e o n e on the
right screen and hopefully the camera
can actually focus on that so you can
see that so the screens aren't perfectly
lined up and I'm not sure if that's an
issue with this particular model or if
all Kyocera echoes are having that issue
but it's it's kind of annoying that they
don't line up which is why you'll
probably want to keep it in landscape
mode now there are a lot of other apps
that do work very well in this tablet
mode here's another example Facebook
will work quite well it will scale to
both screens perfectly let's go back
another app that'll work of course is
Angry Birds so we're going to Angry
Birds and you're gonna see that it will
let let you take advantage of all of the
pixels
there's the splash screen it's not the
clearest because it's not made for so
many pixels but let's let it load okay
here we are at play
so Angry Birds across two displays this
is pretty cool isn't it so we can use
the multi-touch here it can lift back it
jumps to the other side pass us the
black bar and it works it's Angry Birds
and it works quite well and a lot of
other apps work too so let's go to the
Weather Channel that's another app that
will scale very well across both
displays giving you 960 by 800 pixels
worth of screen information so as you
can see apps are kind of slow to load in
the most part especially in tablet mode
but here we go The Weather Channel in
full screen glory really taking
advantage of all of the pixels on the
screen if we go to the ten-day forecast
you can pretty much see the entire
10-day forecast without having to scroll
very much so really cool use of the
pixels so there are plenty of apps that
work just fine in tablet mode but then
the second type of app that I want to
talk about doesn't work in
New York Times is a good example so
where I load that up and sometimes that
is slow to load you can see all the
fingerprints that are accumulating on
the screen and here's what the New York
Times looks like in tablet mode it just
doesn't work it kind of hovers in the
center of the screen you can use it just
fine but it's not taking advantage of
all the screen space let's go back
another app that doesn't work in the
tablet mode is speedtest.net so I want
to load that up and you're gonna see
that it kind of hovers in the center a
little bit better than New York time
this but still you get these thick black
bars on the side you're not really
taking advantage of all of these pixels
so those are the first two kinds of
applications how they behave on this
device number one ones that work just
fine in tablet mode like Twitter and
many many others and the applications
that don't work in tablet mode like New
York Times now there is a third entirely
different set of applications called
simulcast applications these are the
ones that can do some really cool stuff
with two displays the way you know a
simulcast application is that for
example the browser has those two dots
in the bottom right corner contacts has
the two dots email has the two dots that
lets you know that it's a simultaneous
era has made an S SDK available to
developers if they want to make their
application simulcast ready our guess is
that you're not going to see that many
simultaneous because the echo is one
device it's kind of experimental and
developers are probably not going to
spend many hours making their app
simulcast capable if they don't know
that there are going to be a lot of
echoes sold out there so let's talk
about how this works
email is a really good example of the
simulcast capability so what we have
here is the inbox list on the bottom and
on the top you get an email preview and
it's it works kind of like a tablet like
an iPad or whatnot you tap on a message
in the Inbox
it will show up on the top it works even
cooler if you go into portrait you get
the inbox list on the left and the
preview on the right now let's say you
want to view the email on both screens
there's a button right here that says
full it will stretch it down so now
you're using all the pixels to display
just the email or if you want to go back
into the previous view you just click
on full so it works really well and by
the way another cool feature let's reply
to this email when you reply and you're
in the to screen mode and you're doing
something that requires text you get
this awesome huge fullscreen keyboard
and it's really comfortable your fingers
rest nicely on the back of the hinge you
don't want to use it in portrait the
keyboard gets really small and you can
say you know this kind of using it from
a weird angle this is a test this is a
swipe keyboard of course so you can draw
letters with your finger hello did I get
that yes and you get the point
so again in portrait it kind of gets
weird so now we have the text entry up
here and the little sweat keyboard on
the bottom you definitely want to keep
it in landscape mode and even better you
can flip out the screen and lift it up
and you get sort of this HTC Touch pro2
like typing experience really cool let's
go back to the home screen and talk
about another simulcast application
probably the best example is the browser
so if we open up the browser right now
we've got pocket now stretching across
both screens that's pretty cool but even
cooler is if we press this button down
here now we've got two web pages on two
screens and you can use them
independently you can't use them at the
same time you have to use one after the
other but you're not going to use two
websites at the same time if you go into
portrait you get the same really cool
effect to websites two screens at the
same time really awesome and so let's go
to any edge it on the bottom screen here
so let's see there we go and now it's
gonna look Engadget on the bottom screen
here it is now unfortunately in the
simulcast applications you can't use
multi-touch you can't use pinch to zoom
you can only double tap to zoom in this
is because the and in this case you
don't need to zoom in this is because
the simulcast menu is brought up with
two taps of the finger we're going to
talk more about what exactly that does
in a sec but here we are on an end
gadget post we can't double tap or we
can't you know pinch to zoom for example
and we're gonna see that that's the case
in other applications as well even if we
go to the desktop view because you might
be thinking well maybe the double the
pinch to zoom doesn't work because
you're in the mobile view but here we
are in the desk
view it doesn't work but double tap to
zoom in does okay
so you saw that screen before two
fingers on the screen will bring up the
Simon test menu if you get it right and
from here what you can do is you can
reverse the apps
so now pocket now is going to come on
the bottom and yeah it's going to come
on the top another thing you can do is
just change the app on the screen so we
can say let's have gallery on the bottom
and the web on the top so now we've
gallery on the bottom and web at the top
pretty cool right
and what we're actually going to do is
stretch gallery to both screens because
gallery does some really cool things
with the simulcast capability so there's
a button here that should allow us to
scale gallery to both screens here we go
so now we get the gallery on the bottom
and the image on the top and I've only
got one image here and again
pinch-to-zoom doesn't work you have to
double tap to zoom in so imagine having
a library of pictures here on the bottom
and being able to quickly kind of tap on
them to see the images appear on the top
really cool feature let's do the Simon
to the phone application by the way
before I continue these are all of the
site melt as apps that are available
there are only seven of them so we're
going to the phone app and the phone app
will work with two apps at one time so
imagine looking through your photo
gallery while dala dialing your friend
and unfortunately in the dialer we don't
have quick dials so if you want to dial
Bob and quick dial you do two six two
because of the B and the O and the B
no such luck in the dialer let's go back
to the home screen and open up another
simultaneity player made by Kyocera and
you can watch a video on the top screen
while looking for new ones on the bottom
and one of the coolest parts about this
is that you can take any of these videos
tap and hold and if you get it right and
drag it into your cue isn't that awesome
so you can now while you're watching a
video fill up your key with other videos
to play and again
this hinge so you can kind of have a
better viewing angle if you're looking
at it on a tabletop and we can
simultaniously up to you but the fact
that you can do that is is awesome so
there are a couple more apps that we
have to talk about
okay so let's jump into contacts that's
another sign motek
capable app we do the double tap we can
have let's say the browser on the bottom
and then the you know the the contacts
at the top and I think we're pretty much
dining with the cyma task apps and if
you're on the home screen you do a
double tap by the way nothing's going to
happen let's jump back into the browser
see if we missed any we also have
messaging which basically basically
looks the same as you would expect in
email so we can stretch it across both
screens and we don't even have any text
messages but it would work the same
again there's a message index and then
if you tap on a message it will show you
the preview in another screen let's do
the simultaneous apps these are the only
ones that will work with this special
functionality that will allow you to run
one and then the other at the same time
hopefully there will be more again
Kyocera has released an sdk to make it
possible for developers to take
advantage of this functionality but our
guess is that the silo test apps you
just saw are the only ones that are
going to be available for the echo for a
while so wrapping things up just like
you we were wondering whether having two
screens on a smartphone actually makes
sense and if it has any merit we can
tell you that it does make sense and it
does have merit did the idea of being
able to look at two web pages
side-by-side or to look at a web page
while checking your email or watching a
video while checking your email it is
awesome Kyocera 'z execution of it
definitely could have been better but we
certainly can be forgiving since this is
a first generation product we would love
to have seen this with a
ester processor in fact just a second
ago it froze on me performance gets
really bad when you start running to
graphic intensive websites side by side
the design could have been a lot better
this is a very ugly device it looks very
first-generation almost prototype ish
not to mention that it's thick and it's
heavy so the concept is awesome a dual
screen Android phone we just have to say
that Kyocera is execution of the concept
probably wasn't the best and we're
really hoping that other companies
Samsung Motorola HTC follow suit with
this concept of a dual screen phone but
it's very likely the Kyocera has a lot
of patents on this thing making it
difficult for another company to enter
the market and do something likewise
coming up in the full review will have
full benchmark tests remarks on battery
life because you're probably curious
about that plus other remarks on how
this fares as a daily driver if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and thank you for watching that's it for
now
