favorite products of 2018 so naturally a
successor is something to look forward
to
thing as huawei's maple business has
proven to be quite successful with 100
billion units sold in 14% growth over
last year so the company's approach for
2019 is to be even more aggressive
reporting from New York City and
Barcelona I'm hi Mary venerable
PocketNow with Jools want editing let's
go hands-on the company actually showed
us two products and I'm gonna leave the
best for last the made book 14 is a
larger option to the make book 13 that
we saw at CES with a couple of port
enhancements to make the added heft
worth it it has an elegant metal body
with a refined sandblasting process and
diamond-cut chamfers on the borders we
have a 14 inch display at 2160 by 1440
at 300 nits of brightness and a 3 by 2 X
back ratio for enhanced multitasking
some models include a touchscreen and it
allows for multi-touch experiences like
using three fingers to swipe and achieve
a screen shot for example the company
also touts an eye comfort mode made
possible by a chip algorithm included
there are different models but the one I
got to see is an eighth generation Core
i7 options for an NVIDIA GeForce MX 250
graphics card 16 gigs of ram 512 gigs of
storage and Huawei shark-fin 2.0 fans to
make up for 18% improved cooling
efficiency there's a fifty seven point
four watt hour battery with up to 15
hours of video playback and Huawei 65
watt adapter for a quick top-up of up to
three hours of usage in just 15 minutes
its main selling points are really the
added i/o we have USB see USB a 2.0 USB
a 3.0 an audio jack and even a standard
HDMI connector we have Bluetooth five
and also improved Wi-Fi always highly
acclaimed keyboard is here which is
sadly also including the nose cam for
those of you wanting added privacy and
we have the two-in-one power button for
user authentication that also includes
an independent security tip built-in
dual speakers are also included with
Dolby Atmos supports and color options
range from space grey mystic silver and
pink gold sadly and huawei fashioned
price points and availability are still
not confirmed the company spent a good
deal of time showing us their new one
hop technology which uses NFC to connect
with other Huawei phones and quickly
share photos videos
office documents etc it looked really
good on the demo but obviously we'll
have to test it out this works both on
the mate book 14 and also the product
that I was looking forward to most
meet the new Huawei mate book X Pro 2019
from the outside it looks nearly
identical to last year's model with only
a difference in the Huawei text at the
back instead of the logo it's still the
same metal unibody with cnc machining
and sandblasting we have the same LTPS
touchscreen at 3000 by 2000 resolution
at 3 by 2 aspect ratio and a 91% screen
to body ratio and it also includes the
three finger swipe feature for
screenshots we also have the return of
the quad speakers Co engineered with
Dolby Atmos and quad microphones for
far-field communication that support
both Cortana and Microsoft translator up
to 4 meters away what changes are the
upgraded internals with up to a 10% more
powerful 8th generation Core i7 16 gigs
of ram up to one terabyte of a
solid-state drive a fifty seven point
four watt hour battery that gives you up
to 13 hours of video playback in the
same fast 65 watt charger in the box we
also have faster Wi-Fi Bluetooth v and
NFC for Huawei's one hop Thunderbolt 3
now supports full speeds of up to 40
gigabits per second and it supports
connecting a 4k display and includes
Nvidia's GeForce MX 250 for discrete
graphics Huawei also claims that it's
shark-fin 2.0 is 20% more efficient and
now has active in passive mode
sadly the nose cam is back but we do
have the power slash fingerprint scanner
also making a return and the keyboard
which we praised is also splash proof
with improvements to the click pad and
things that I've actually complained
about in the previous review color
options or Space Gray mystic silver but
sadly price points and skew limitations
are still not provided so yeah this is
the new mate book X Pro and mate book 14
