it's almost more camera than smartphone
and Nokia wants you to know that if you
think of it that way that's okay and
there's an accessory for you I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
quick look at the Nokia camera grip for
the Lumia 1020
Nokia's camera grip isn't something
you'd see made for almost any other
phone it's big its clunky it's ugly and
at $79 suggested retail it's not cheap
but for a phone built around its massive
41 megapixel camera this accessory makes
a lot of sense for a certain kind of
shooter the problem nokia is trying to
solve with this case is firstly organ
ohmic the 1020 might not be the smallest
phone on the block but it can still be
pretty thin and ungainly when you're
trying to take a shot there's another
issue here too though the 1020 s big
camera also drains the phone's battery
pretty quickly with extended use
potentially limiting your photo sessions
the camera grip aims to solve both of
those problems it snaps on very snugly
at the top of the phone it's so tight
we're a little worried about scraping up
the casing with long-term use actually
and down at the bottom the 1020 slots
into a charging jack hooked up to the
cases 1020 milliamp hour battery the
case immediately starts replenishing the
phone's battery when plugged in and
it'll keep it topped off to 100% until
its own power supply is exhausted if you
want you can override the charging with
a manual button down below which also
lets you check the cases power level
thanks to some white LEDs alongside the
cases battery might be small but it's a
big help on extended photo sessions out
in the wilderness
Nokia says it will provide power for 285
more photos or 48 minutes of additional
video and we found it gives us about a
half a day more endurance than without
it
as for the ergonomic benefit it's no
illusion though the case adds
substantial weight and thickness to the
already beefy 1020 there's no debating
the added comfort it brings the bulbous
protrusion includes a soft touch pad for
grip and the big shutter key is soft and
easy to find quickly by fee
finally there's the universal tripod
mount down below
it's a quarter-inch mount and it worked
very well with two of our cheap
off-the-shelf tripods in the office it
worked so well in fact that we used the
1020 to shoot the intro and outro to
this video for long exposures or any
shots where stability is important this
is a great feature to have the camera
grip is available directly from Nokia or
cheaper through third-party sites like
Amazon and certain retailers like the
Microsoft Store have been known to offer
the grip for free with purchase of a
Lumia 1020 in the grip comes in three
separate colors to match your own
particular phone if you get the
opportunity to pick one up this isn't
just a big ugly case you probably bought
the 1020 primarily to use the camera and
this accessory actually makes that much
easier even if you need to invest in
special shorts to carry it around
folks hope you enjoyed this quick look
