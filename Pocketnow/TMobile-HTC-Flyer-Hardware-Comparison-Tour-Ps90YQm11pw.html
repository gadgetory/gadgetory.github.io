pocketnow.com and today we're taking the
last and look of the HTC Flyer
specifically a comparison of the
hardware to the specs of some other
noticeable devices like the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 the iPad etc so sit back
relax and enjoy the show compared to one
of its Android siblings the HTC Flyer
versus the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 this
is the one from verizon with the LTE
chip in it really there's an obviously
size difference here the thickness
between these two is a little bit
noticeable this is the HTC Flyer is at
point 5 2 and the galaxy tab is at point
three four inches if you stack them on
top of each other the screen space is
noticeably different from here to there
as far as the screens go brightness on
the other hand between the two is very
negligible between them and also the
viewing angles is very negligible
between the two screens I find that both
are just as easily viewable one to the
other they fall out from this device to
this device is that the galaxy tab is
running honeycomb and the HTC Flyer is
still running Gingerbread which is a bit
of a problem for this particular device
because then it's lacking in some
functionality that could be gained with
the pin which would give it an advantage
over this sort of device in the hand I
actually prefer this 7-inch size and
form factor to the 10.1 this wide angle
screen here camera is between them are
about the same even though the specs may
be different both of them have about the
same number of apps available to them as
well which is kind of the downfall when
you compare it against say the iPad here
and we can see the the thinness again is
about the same with the HT fly HTC Flyer
again is 0 point 5 2 and the ipad is 0
point three four dimensions wise you get
a 10 inch you know screen vs the 7 inch
display it's pretty obvious the year as
well that these screen sizes are
different in hand I finds that again
it's the 7-inch form factor they really
like I'd really did like the nook color
and that's that form factor which is
about this same size and the new kindle
fire which will hopefully have a review
unit next week will be about this same
form factor as well where this has a
downfall that both these devices are a
full brightness here is again the
android devices feel like they are
running as the ipad one there's a lot of
apps available on the android market
there are a lot of capabilities
available on the android market but it
really feels like the initial ipad
market in which there wasn't a whole lot
available that was specific enough or
was really great enough to draw you in
outside of just the default apps and now
that the ipad 2 has come out and the app
developers have done a lot better job of
some of the music creation apps and some
of the news readers such as aight
Flipboard android falls behind in that
respect now androids coming up it's
making progress through this and there's
bit of getting better apps but i find
again compared daily use between these
two devices if i'm just going out and
why want to just take something for
surfing the web or checking email very
quickly this has the advantage over my
ipad 2 is that it has a 4g chip in it
the the pho GA or how we want to call
that the ipad my ipad 2 is only Wi-Fi
and this form factor is a lot easier in
on the hands when you're on the road or
just want to be out in the route don't
want to you know try to pocket the ipad
2 you pretty much have to carry a man
purse for the ipad 2 if you're going to
go out and about with it as far as
getting down to actual content creation
and viewing
objects and creating music and and
actually working most of my workflow has
been based upon the iPad since it came
out and I'm no apple fanboy but really
I've made this work now so going to a
android device where some of those
features and functionality are missing
is a little bit of a letdown that said
again 7-inch form factor has been
fantastic it just remains to be seen
what HTC will do with this device once
it comes the say the kindle fire comes
out and the rest of them the onslaught
of android tablets that will be coming
out this holiday season and the Black
Friday pricing etc etc it really I can't
not recommend this device it will get
updated with at least honeycomb and you
can find XDA developers who can help you
do that now whether or not gets ice
cream sandwich is relatively irrelevant
what really needs to happen for the
Android chaplains to be extremely
relevant is that the market needs to be
increased but that's not a problem of
the HTC Flyer it's a problem with google
