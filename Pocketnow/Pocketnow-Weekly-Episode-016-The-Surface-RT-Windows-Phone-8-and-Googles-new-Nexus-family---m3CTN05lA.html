weekly hello and welcome to episode 01
six of the pocket na weekly the
once-a-week podcasts from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's hot and what's
cool in the world of mobile technology
from smart phones to tablets two
phablets and everything in between I'm
your host Michael Fisher senior editor
at pocket now and I'm joined by our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to you sir hello there hello and
our managing editor and Tandy Naja good
afternoon to you sir good morning
everybody I need to start off right away
by telling everyone that we are the
sixty-six percent of the team on the on
the air today is sick so you've probably
heard it in my voice already I sound
horrible my apologies I assure you I
have done everything I can add to sound
better and it's just not working tony is
only about a day into whatever you think
is his cold so he sounds better it's not
right yeah I don't know you mentioned it
on the pre Cole that he gave me
something as I told you I should have
installed in firewall or something like
that yeah I gave you my cold over the
Internet yeah yes you guys sound fine to
me except for that that sound you just
made Michael that I was indicating imma
it was just gonna say I'm gonna be
making liberal use of my cough button
today but we fortunately I have though
I've done a lot of work this week I have
not done the most visible work on the
site and we have so much to talk about
and I don't want to delay any further I
want to leap into what we're calling our
thought thread the kind of podcast
pre-show that kicks 11 topic list we do
thanks to thanks to some discussion I
think that was that was brandon's idea
so Brendan because you thought of the
title why don't you jump us right in to
the to the thought thread at the top of
episode 16 here alrighty well the
thought threat today is about the
surface RT and literally 10 seconds ago
I press the publish button on the review
so everyone can read it the videos up
all of our coverage of the surface RT is
up and you'll notice that we gave it a
six out of three and it takes a lot it
takes a lot for me to write something
that low and I'm going to talk about why
i rated it that low in addition to some
other things that i think are pretty
ridiculous with with what what microsoft
is doing and I have nothing against
Microsoft I used I've used Windows
products for a very long time pocketnow
wouldn't exist if it wasn't for
microsoft and windows mobile pocket pcs
we've been advocates of Microsoft
because they push the industry forward
as much as some of the other biggest
companies in fact you could say they're
responsible for a lot of what exists
today in technology so the first thing I
want to talk about is how the surface
this is basically two parts so that I'm
going to talk about so talk about the
problem and I'm going to talk about the
solution what Microsoft should have done
with Windows 8 Windows 8/rt windows 8
pro the surface and so forth you guys at
my Colantoni probably saw the minute and
a half long video that Microsoft did
showing people playing with the
kickstand and clicking the keyboard
right yeah that Coon draft dance
commercial yes uh-huh and that was the
first video that Microsoft presented to
the world showing off the the marketing
message for the surface did you buy the
surface for death reason that's a good
thought okay so so so obviously the
service has this awesome kick stand it
and Microsoft likes to go to great
lengths talk about how high quality it
is and it is it's quite high quality it
makes a nice sound when you open it
makes a nice sound when you close it and
it has a lot of utility it's awesome to
have a kickstand integrated into a
tablet that does not increase the
thickness of the tablet that is awesome
and it's also cool that this touch cover
the keyboard cover snaps into place but
I thought that this video it was only
intended to be like some sort of viral
type video and it got around pretty
quickly but it's it's not it's part of
their marketing message I was drawing
driving down i-95 the other day and I
see a billboard for the surface and I
love tech note i love technology
billboards because they're very
interesting and the message was the work
towards click in and it had a picture of
the surface with the live tiles and a
keyboard drawing closer to the surface
i'm trying to tell that
there are nice strong magnets in the
keyboard that make a click sound when
you attach it to the surface and I
thought to myself who the cares who
cares so only the only time that that
that matters is when you first get it
out of the box and you're like wow this
is pretty cool how it clicks in and then
you show some friends and then you
forget about it and then it becomes
about actually using the product and
when you start using the product its
it's ugly it's ugly because it's a tale
of two worlds neither of which works
very well on one hand you've got the
desktop environment and the desktop
environment is awesome because or it
should be awesome because we know the
desktop from all the way back to Windows
95 and a little bit before it's a
productive environment it's so familiar
we get it we get it how it works
everyone's used Windows but desktop on
the surface RT is not the desktop it's a
fake world it's a phantom desktop where
you can only run a small handful of apps
you try to install it um your favorite
Windows app which is natural when you
see the desktop but it's not the desktop
and the only thing you can do in it is
run the Microsoft Office suite and run a
second version of windows internet
explorer there are two internet explorer
okay so that's that's a guy this is a
limitation of Windows Windows RT right
it's a limitation of Windows RT so it
will only run apps that are designed for
ARM processors which which okay so are
there going to be apps will Spotify be
available for ARM processors yes maybe
probably and it will be in the other
side the other world which is this
touch-friendly metro-style world and
it's a nice world if you ever wanted to
have Windows Phone on a tablet this is
it this is Windows Phone on tablet and
it's it's good the interface is
beautiful it's got the fluidity of
Windows Phone it's laggy and slow at
times if you're loading a program that
hasn't been in RAM you can wait I count
up to ten when Netflix was loading and
another third-party app um loading from
the metro it's given from the from the
new UI yeah loading from the new UI it's
just it's just slow
and playing games are slow okay so so
let's say let's say you like the
interface and it's fast and fluid and
it's 2d which is very refreshing and
then you go to the App Store and there's
nothing there there there are some major
apps like Netflix and Hulu but if you
think of 20 of your favorite apps that
you can find an Android and iOS probably
two out of 20 are there now they were
mentioning this as a deficiency in some
of the earlier reviews like some of the
reviews that came out you know earlier
than today and I think a lot of the
commenters on those reviews were saying
well you know you got it you guys
reviewed it before the product launched
you know you've got to you gotta wait
for the the ecosystem to you know come
online and stuff have you noticed any
apps like flooding the flooding the
market in your time with it or has it
been basically static throughout I I
haven't been counting the number of
individuals because you can't do that
how you kind of could do that with
Windows Phone and I sort of watched a
day to day but I see really no
difference from the week on by when
surface RT landed 22 now so it's it's a
slow grind and it's it's going to be
even slower than it was for windows
phone because back in the days when
Windows Phone 7 series or seven came out
the stakes were a little bit lower
because it was earlier in time three
years ago fewer people had these touch
devices but now Microsoft dropped this
thing into the laps of developers that
already have a lot of work to do and and
so whether whether the App Store ever
becomes populated with a full suite of
apps remains to be seen it might never
or it might take a year or two years or
three years isn't that isn't it crazy I
mean how different this this product is
I mean you talk about those microsoft
product that's come out and we're
talking about apps I mean you know we're
talking about this this kind of
ecosystem question which is old hat to
everybody who follows technology now
sure but if you think about the last
time Microsoft really had this much buzz
around around a release you know when
they're talking about windows 7 i'm
talking about desktop stuff and you know
vista for for all its failures and stuff
but when it first came out you know apps
are not a question when you're talking
about the desktop app sir you know
that's not it's not weird what you're
talking about so it's just fascinating
to see that to do and i kind of wonder
if it's just a question of them running
out of
time of his question that I'm not not
not courting the developers well enough
or or what Oh Michael we don't know okay
let it wait let me say that I not we I
am tired of microsoft running out of
time I am tired of giving always
microsoft a second chance when windows
phone 7 came out they were out of time
they rushed a product to the market
there were no applications and we said
okay let's give them another chance and
then no dough came and another chance
and then mango key and another chance
and now Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8
and RT is out there and another chance
so I'm completely indifference towards
Windows RT on the surface RT but Abbott
and the early adopter of Windows Phone 7
back in the day when I first laid my
hands on the lg optimus 7 which I was
reviewing at that time after a couple of
hours of usage I had that feeling I
don't know exactly how to describe it
but that was both angry and sad that I
have no applications to install on the
on the phone itself which actually make
use of my day-to-day usage and what I
feel right now is that went surface RT
Microsoft is doing the exact same thing
and I don't want to go through that
feeling again because i feel i don't
know betrayed do you feel the same way
Brandon uh I mean they I i don't know
that's that's that's a tough question it
was it was almost like it was almost
died or die and as opposed to do or die
for Microsoft because if they released
this product now with without a real
robust app store it would be harmful or
if they waited somehow a little bit
longer that would have been harmful to
Microsoft uh you know and then and then
you gotta wonder well why couldn't they
have assembled a team of developers to
make a huge suite of software that runs
natively on the surface RT that covers
all the bases well you sorta can't do I
mean you can't make a twitter Microsoft
can't make a twitter client well they
can technically because it's it's it's
open then they'll come in and shut it
down after yeah yeah yeah um I mean they
did do that with some software like
Skype Skype Oh
so microsoft on skype right and so i
might get one of the benefits of the
surface RT is that you can run you can
run skype and you can benefit from the
22 degree angle that the camera is
positioned which is just right it's a
wide angle lens and then you get into
the skype software and I talked about
this in the video review not only is the
quality of the video pretty poor in fact
it seems like it's like vga video blown
up new 1366 x 768 resolution and and i
was communicating over a fast Wi-Fi
connection with someone else that had a
fast Wi-Fi connection so not only is the
quality of the interaction on skype low
quality when it shouldn't you know this
is microsoft's product right but there
is advertising in the chat screen oh i
don't know really i have cheese for a
wholly-owned for considering that
microsoft own skype as you pointed out
that is uh wow that's a giant i just i
cannot understand why they would clutter
the interface with an ad on a flagship
communication product that they now own
and don't need to derive revenue from I
don't get it yeah so so anyway to not
make this an endlessly long rent now on
to the solution cuz it's easy to you
know bad these things they don't work
very well so here's what I think
Microsoft should have done and perhaps
this isn't a fully baked solution and I
might have come up with it late one
night so I think they should have made
two separate products and one should
have been called Windows 8 desktop for
those like me that are considering
keeping windows 7 because I like Windows
7 but also I recognize that Windows 8
desktop when running on a full computer
has some awesome advantages it's got a
new 2d like interface less fluff the
task managers improve there's more
ribbon style interfaces around it's
faster it's all very good stuff so they
make a product called Windows 8 desktop
for office environments for people that
like windows and then they make an
entirely separate product called windows
8 touch that is all about this this
metro-style interface and and instead
calling it windows 8 style modern UI
style whatever they call it door style
wonder windows 8 store style I mean how
many times I've the chin j they go with
Metro because people know Metro people
are thrilled about metro and somehow
they associate Windows Phone 8 with
windows 8 Touch saying that hey if you
like Windows Phone 8 but you want a
bigger experience this is what we've
created for your windows 8 touch and I
don't know how to solve the app problem
but at least this creating two different
products and not combining them solves
the confusion problem the disappointment
that people get when they open their
surface RT they go to the desktop and
they're like this is not the desktop
this is this is fake so that's that's my
solution that's my right what do you
guys think about well let me ask you
guys what would you do differently if
you were Microsoft if you if you had to
create a touch experience but you also
had to keep the desktop like experience
how would you make sense of that yeah
I'm not sure that I would rely on that I
would split the product for like fork
the products into a desktop and a tablet
experience I mean that's what Mike shaft
has done it but if you're going to do
that I agree i think you I think got to
go all the way and you can't just um you
can't include the desktop in the RT
version just so that you can run some
versions of office I think it would be
really infuriating for people to hear no
you can't run we haven't ported office
to the new style yet or we have imported
whatever to the new to the new desktop
yet so you can't run it but yeah I think
it would be a cleaner solution than then
this kind of half-baked Windows RT
desktop implementation which I've played
with and been annoyed by more than once
but you know III don't know I am kind of
interested in seeing what happens as the
as time goes by now because yeah before
you know we gave them the benefit of the
doubt on windows phone 7 but they were
like well some people in the same kernel
so we wait until windows phone 8 comes
out and windows phone 8 will be built in
the same thing so now Windows Phone 8 is
sharing a kernel cheering an
architecture with with Windows RT with
windows 8 pro these things are all now
finally in the same family it's like a
whole bunch of children that really
didn't get along when they were growing
up and now they're all kind of teenagers
and they're like all right well yeah but
they
play together via well but they they're
starting to write I mean I think that's
if they if they fail from this point
forward and I hate to say that stone you
have a great point like every single
time they release a product it's like Oh
we'll give them another two well this is
it this is the one yeah you know I don't
think that's what this is I mean I did
that with multiple iterations of webos
and of course it never worked out but
Microsoft is not you know is not Paul
Microsoft is not is not a smaller firm
and this is quite literally their future
they have no choice but to succeed in
this or you know or just you know
dissolve so I think they will find a way
to do that and I think it's just a
matter of waiting of India we're gonna
have to wait a while it looks like but I
think they're gonna force this into
relevant eight not know if you look so
good it's a it then the chicken egg
problem comes up if I mean the consensus
is out across the internet that the
surface RT is is is a good product but
it's not it's not good enough and and
people read that stuff and they're gonna
make buying decisions based on that and
and so there's gonna be this awkward
period of time where the informed
consumers that read reviews are going to
turn away from the surface RT product
and other Windows RT products for now
and so that's going to harm the
installed base that's going to have
developers think that you know maybe I
should spend more time on Android or iOS
this windows thing I don't know about it
and then we check back in a year from
now and it's almost the same thing right
and either it's almost the same thing or
they all the headlines read 30 times
over the surface 2 is what the surface
should have been and then you know blah
blah blah we go from there yeah and and
you know they should have I can't
believe they put us Tegra 3 in here why
don't they use the s4 pro that would
have made this thing hum and sing like a
yeah I got lovely opera opera opera
saying you know as you guys talk about
this I'm just watching every now and
then the comments on our review which is
on the front page and there's this guy
who comments in the following way and he
says quote the RT does everything I want
in a tablet browser check netflix check
word check excel check I don't really
need or want that much more
tablet unquote so I guess the surface RT
is good for those types of people and
and full stop no other things to add
here but on the other hand those who
expected more from the windows RT and
those who pre-order the tablet without
having a hands-on without reading a
review so blindly pre-ordered like you
Michael implied in your editorial yeah
those will now have two options option
number one is to admit that it was a
mistake and get rid of it and those with
the cojones will do that and those who
will not admit to the mistake and will
blindly defend the RT against every
critic out there well I mean I gotta say
in this guy's a situation um I'm Emily
the same comment the surface RT is gonna
be just fine he wants a browser and
Netflix excel and so forth that's that's
fine but absolutely but as a as a tablet
enthusiast or somebody that just likes
to experience lots of different things
and have lots of different options it's
just it doesn't fill in the boxes yeah
it's like somebody was saying on another
piece I wrote about the android tablet
app problem where somebody's like look
at all these android tablet apps that
scale right and then proceeded to list
like 50 apps that that he used and that
he found you know interesting and it's
like you can do that on any product you
can go to any review that Doug something
for not having of apps and say but it
has everything I need and then you list
you know some bunch of really niche apps
that that work for you and it's like so
therefore you're wrong it's like okay
you are not every person you know most
people want to have the choice it's in
it's not a question of having 700,000
apps of course most people only download
about a hundred and then they only use
ten of those regularly but it's it's
about having the ability to be in a
situation like wow this app about look
with a Berlin map would be really handy
right now I wish I could download it but
my platform doesn't have it because it's
not a thriving platform yeah it is not
the issue it's about having the choice
and don't forget if you're gonna buy a
surface you are gonna take you're gonna
spend five or six hundred bucks for that
same five or six hundred bucks you could
get a nexus 10 and a nexus 7 and you
could also get an ipad for right or an
iPad Mini
or what have you and and if you I mean
that's kind of how we look at these
things right if you're going to spend
500 600 bucks what platform is going to
give you the most flexibility and and so
you know that so this is that so that's
an interesting point one thing I wanted
to ask you guys is why when when I ever
want the ipad there were very few to no
ipad apps so they let you run iphone
apps and the experience wasn't amazing
you have this little window but like
that satisfied people why didn't they do
that with the surface and let people run
Windows Phone apps well is that is it
possible because i feel like the Windows
Phone apps ah what's the difference that
you got windows phone 8 apps and Windows
Phone 7 apps and they they're not they
are they are different they use the one
uses the NT kernel right when uses I
think the what's that thing called that
windows mobile was based off of what was
that cee cee haha yeah yeah okay so the
current could have created an Emmy some
environment that like did the coding
whatever you know what's interesting
that whenever you bring an emulator into
the question is cuz palm did that right
like everyone thought that that was what
the the palm pre's saving grace was
gonna be is like no it doesn't have many
apps for webos but we've got this cool
palm an emulator and you can run any of
the 25,000 paulo maps that are out there
and really like the amulet they didn't
work well in the emulator and like
performance right the emulator like it
would cost money I don't know I feel
like maybe if you made it free on this
and then you made sure the apps ran well
inside it it would be a good thing I
agree maybe that but yeah but I feel
like maybe that was a victim of of time
I don't know how I don't know how
applicable this is but we did see a
story this morning where a Microsoft
employee commented this was your story I
think Tony yeah yeah What did he say he
said that he was talking about Windows
Phone 8 but he's just said they ran out
of time they ran out of time of course
as usual as I implied in my first
comments at the beginning it was about a
notification tray a notification center
for windows phone 8 and this was at the
build conference this was a story from
the verge they have asked the guy what
happened to that and he admitted that
this was a plan to include it in Windows
Phone 8 but they had ran out of time and
they did not include it and of course
the normal follow-up question was okay
then how do you solve the notification
problems and the person the Microsoft he
said you've got live tiles were in to
reach i agree to fifty percent because i
don't want to been all my life styles or
all my applications which notify me to
my home screen what happens if if i
receive a notification up there a toast
notification how it is gold and I don't
take adult action on it and it
disappears because another one push it
pushes it away and I don't have a tile i
miss a notification or two right yeah i
don't want to do that and and it's
interesting like I agree I agree with
you I think that there should be a
notification center in there will be in
Windows funny but it's just interesting
to see a company executive just kind of
come out and say yeah we ran out of time
you know and I just wonder how much of
that happened in in windows 8 and
windows RT but you know I'm sure we'll
hear about this in the kind of in the
coming weeks and days but um how many
times does Microsoft need to run out of
the time until once they get it right I
mean it's a good question you know but
Microsoft is in this position still for
now and I keep saying this and you know
I don't have a business degree obviously
but I mean they're in a position where
they they have they still have time to
burn you know they can keep getting it
wrong on release and they're not gonna
alienate enough people they're gonna
alienate more people each time they do
that but they're not going to you know
they're not going to sink into the sea
they're not gonna dive in because they
have enough money they have enough
success and they have enough cell riff
for now the market is already dominated
by Android like 55 or 60 percent right
and like twenty thirty percent by by iOS
how much time how does that time
translate in the markets here I mean
I've got time when I have sixty percent
market share but when i have madame
below five percent market share or zero
in the case of the surface how much time
do i need or how much time am i willing
to lose it's a good question i don't
know um you know guys I guess we will
see going forward a you know and there
is still more of the surface story to be
told I mean when is the surface pro kind
of gonna drop is that that is that gonna
happen before the end of the year mo
most probably at the beginning of next
year so surf the surface pro is actually
uh
a great way to fix the the I guess now
part image of the surface brand because
it fulfills one of those promises very
well and then some like it gives you the
full desktop experience but then it's
like and some people are saying well
it's gonna be like twelve or thirteen
hundred bucks but yeah it's going to be
basically a laptop replacement with a
touchscreen and and it's gonna be pretty
darn cool and you know what if that's a
successful product mean that there's
there is nothing saying that this
initial kind of half-and-half feeling
about the surface brand can't be
overcome I was just writing about this
with the Nexus stuff like that the nexus
brand was starting to get a little bit
bogged down by this kind of Galaxy Nexus
LTE problems and all this stuff and not
a lot of people knew about the Nexus
phones because they're sort of
enthusiasts developer phones and then
Google drops this nexus 7 and they sell
three million of them and it's like wow
people suddenly know the Nexus name and
its associated with a good product so I
think Microsoft can definitely there's
no there's no real lasting damage yet
because I branded I you can disagree if
you want i don't think the surface RT is
necessarily a bad product just think
it's a confused one right yeah i mean
the hardware is is fantastic and you
know it's it's got some good points it's
just like you said it's a confusing
product it's a tale of two two worlds
neither of which right now one of them
permanently the desktop will never work
well but the other side they're just not
enough apps to fulfill to fulfill the
the round out the experience so just to
kind of wrap this up before we jump into
Windows Phone 8 but who would you say
who should buy the surface RT both Tony
and and Brandon both but uh Brandon
first a few because you've used it ah I
think I think a perfect example is of
this commenter who just wants office and
and yeah you cannot you know you go into
the desktop environment and you use
office in the desktop world you get out
a mouse pointer or you use the trackpad
and it feels very familiar they did that
part very well so if you want office if
you don't mind waiting for apps and you
got the the very basics cover like
Netflix it has it hulu it has it you
know there's a there's there isn't a
Twitter Facebook client yet but there
are sort of you remember with Windows
Phone they were those fake apps like
instead of YouTube there's like YouTube
downloader youtube yeah worm worm tube
or whatever that other one was ya lazy
war ya lazy where I yeah yeah yeah and
instead of Angry Birds there was like
upset ostriches there's a lot of that
going on and and there is angry birds by
the way um okay but you know that if you
don't if you know I recommend that
people that are kids are in service go
to a best buy and play around with this
touch-friendly aspect of of windows 8
and go to the app store and search for
your favorite apps apps that you
couldn't live without and if there
there's and great if not then you know
let that be part of your consideration
what's a good call yeah Tony what did
you do you agree no no I'm trying to be
nice here but I just can't I here's my
advice stay away from the surface art
they don't buy that thing not for this
Christmas by for next Christmas wait for
a generation wait for another OEM wait
for another update I don't know but wait
until this thing delivers on but I don't
know these people who actually use and
pre-order the surface RT and Windows RT
actually come on comments and bash every
other tablet whether it's Android or iOS
that post purchase justification yeah
absolutely i mean i mean come on take a
look at what you're holding you can't do
anything with that of course you have
office you have explorer but even for
that wait way to generation skip this
holiday season maybe buy a DVD player
plasma TV anything else don't buy the
surface RT this is my personal opinion
well let's uh let's let's jump into two
windows phone 8 because i feel like this
is a very interesting kind of a perfect
inversion of the windows 8 story and you
guys can agree or disagree with me but I
feel like Windows Phone 8 is one of
those cases where it is maybe what
Windows Phone 7 should have been but we
have a really in-depth review listeners
if you are if you have not seen it yet
this Windows Phone 8 review by Adam who
is just
amy is huge its massive i read it the
other day and i think i've reread it a
couple times i still haven't gotten
absorbed all the information so check it
out if you haven't already it's but
what's so interesting about Windows
Phone 8 to me is that it is so so
similar to windows phone 7 from a UI
perspective of course it's built under
different kernel as we've discussed and
the whole architecture is different and
I think that's where a lot of the time
went on the engineering side to building
windows phone 8 was to adapting it to
this new you know framework but it's
amazing just how similar it is in
operation in appearance obviously we've
got those changeable live tile size
that's the most visual change if i don't
hear that again i will be happy i'm so
looking forward to Windows Phone 7.8
dropping and never having to see another
demo of how how to change a live tile
size because it's week that's all we've
seen the urban month um but you know and
I even though it is such an in-depth
review from from Adam I'm struck by how
much by all the little changes are
absolutely inconsequential compared to
the fact that there is that that there
are more apps now that we have I think
over 120,000 apps in the in the windows
phone marketplace which is amazing so in
a lot of ways is exactly the opposite
story this of this windows 8 apt earth
on the tablet side I mean what do you
guys think I feel like this this makes
me feel really good about the future of
the Windows Phone platform if they can
market it right yeah in fact I want to
set an outlook reminder to talk about
this on on November second 2013 because
Microsoft clearly as a strategy they're
bridging together all of their products
and all of their ecosystems and they're
making finally a cohesive world where
you know if you got an xbox if you get a
Windows 8 PC if you got a windows phone
8 they all talk to each other it's it's
great i mean it's it's what android
continued continues to or good google
continues to do it's what Apple has has
been doing um and and yeah I would I'm
fascinated to see if it works out in
their benefit if for example someone
buys a Windows 8 PC and they're like you
know
I I want a phone that kind of like
meshes with I want I like this look I'm
so curious if that happens me too and I
think that's something that we always
kind of talk about on the air we three
were we were like well yeah I mean just
once the desktop and the mobile and the
intermediate platforms all look the same
then there will be this kind of unifying
trickle effect I don't think that's
borne out by history I don't think
there's ever been really a situation
where that where that has really
happened I don't think it happened with
windows mobile and windows I don't think
people were clamoring for a start button
on their phone but whatever you know I
don't know but that network I mean that
helps that helps to sell windows mobile
because people were like oh I get it you
press Start and just like on my computer
I press Start yeah I mean I does that
was one of the tactics I used when I was
selling windows mobile phones back at
that sprint and nextel but I don't know
if I can't I wish I'd kept track of
whether it worked or not um I don't know
Tony are you looking forward to getting
your hands on one of these no I love
know and we'll Here Come explanations
those of you guys who prefer who have
followed bucket now since the early days
know that ever since I've been on board
with bucket now I've been a huge fan of
windows mobile I've spent a tremendous
amount of energy defending and promoting
Windows Mobile which later on turned
into a huge amount of energy and
promoting and defending windows film
seven because at that day I was an MVP
at Microsoft but I didn't defend the
platform because of that I believed in
the platform I believed in Microsoft and
I just no longer do so i will pay
serious attention to Windows Phone 8
whenever it will reach a ten percent
market share and then i will start
taking it seriously so ten percent is
your threshold yeah well they're you
know they're at four percent of globally
right now I think right there little
looks like 3.9 yeah something like that
after two years and we saw said was true
I know and but we saw some interesting
numbers indicating that it's it's
climbing in market share much more
rapidly in that I really hate I really
hope they they manage to do that but I
have lost my how should I say this and
no longer attract me I mean when I saw
the present
asian and I'm when I read the review all
I seen was windows phone 7 of course the
Metro UI is the same the principles are
the same that kernel has changed and but
from the end users perspective it
doesn't matter what the colonel is what
the what the end users cares about is a
consistent fluid user interface with
lots of applications now there are
applications in the store but I I know I
don't want to be the bearer of bad news
but my prediction is or no I am very
afraid of that Microsoft will at one
point do with Windows Phone 8 whatever
they did with Windows Phone 7 and I hope
they will not abandon it and I hope they
will not show the finger to all those
who believe in them and and will
probably buy a phone on contract or not
and just move on to Windows Phone 9 so I
fail to be excited about this until they
prove me that they are serious about
things I I kind of I kind of want to do
my own investigation here because
Windows Phone 8 for me fixes three
problems that i had with windows from
seven and seven point five which is
number one the hardware I was tired of
looking at wvga screens and running on
slower processors that's fixed with
Windows Phone 8 number two the app
situation while not completely fixed
it's tremendously better so I can't wait
to search for stuff and actually find it
and and and number three windows phone 7
+ 7.5 made me feel like iOS like tam I
can't change a thing here this is just a
this is just how Microsoft wants it to
be and and I and you know I was kind of
thinking I had in mind the Start screen
because you know you could have these
tiles and I was like damn I don't want
my pictures tile to take up to space I
don't want that and Windows Phone 8 you
know is still iOS ish in the fact that
there's not that much you can change you
can't really you know your windows phone
8 put on a custom rom and change
everything about it but at least now you
can change more so of that that Start
screen where you spend most of your time
so that's a 3ds rate of what's that
that's a week trade off man great mean
nobody I get it though that it is it is
more
I zabal then then iOS though Tony after
do you have to agree with that at least
what would the fact that i can make
triple double or half the size of the
life bells that means customize yeah you
can make out yes yeah it's a much more
you customization is when you can set a
wallpaper customization is when you can
I don't know do stuff I don't know i
don't agree i don't think it's just that
you can set a wallpaper i think it's you
know I I think it's much more useful to
be able to say hey here's my home screen
here's what I want out of my home screen
from a notification standpoint and then
like you know trigger it that way I mean
I you know compared to iOS it's it's
gives you many more options I absolutely
absolutely but compared to android gives
you nothing oh well compared to android
yeah sure nothing says customized both
android it's kind of fun how we have the
spectrum writer of like iOS Windows
Phone kind of in the middle and Android
an extreme end of customizability it's
great that that that except that has
happened that's true yeah just from out
from a choice standpoint it's nice that
you can pick your platform based on how
much you do or don't want to think in
when you're setting up your mobile phone
and I you know I'm not that's not a dig
I'm not I'm not saying you know I always
users are stupider and like that it's
just you can make a choice you're like
if you want customization go android you
want ease of use and out-of-the-box
functionality go iOS you want something
in between and something with a very
distinct you I you go Windows Phone I
mean it is cool that we have that choice
but it's turning to how they're going to
sell this kind of stuff we have we had
two articles this week about about
windows phone commercials windows
commercials and it's so funny just how
you know this this plays into this
larger question of the difference
between platform makers and
manufacturers we have first of all this
commercial from Microsoft for windows
phone 8 by Steve Ballmer Steve Ballmer
once again on TV has he been on TV since
that hilarious windows phone excuse me
windows like 10 commercial from the 80s
wait just one minute before you answer
oh yeah nice I see what you did there Oh
mobile sorry she's five hundred dollars
a thousand
that's one of the best listeners that
you obviously have seen this commercial
if you haven't go google it right now
steve ballmer windows commercial it is
the best thing you will ever see um but
this this this windows phone 8
commercial I i love it i think it's
insignificant that it's steve ballmer
because i think eighty percent of the
world you know sounds good not gonna get
it but like I think it's a charming
commercial I really do yeah it's it's
it's basically the camera view just
panning and scanning around different
live tiles on ostensibly Steve Ballmer's
phone I like his me tell and yeah me too
and he's he's he's doing the voice over
India's like this is some advice I'd
take and some advice I don't and here's
what I do and here's what I don't and
it's a very straightforward very clean
very well you know it's a very good
commercial I think it's a great
commercial yeah and it's like um I the
windows phone 8 more than ever is about
this message of like it Sammie phone you
set it up and it becomes about you and
it remains to be seen whether people
respond to that like I get it that I
want my phone to work the way I want it
but I um maybe it's it's almost a little
too extreme little too creepy the fact
that like um you know my phone you know
was I guess windows phone 7 when this
17.5 was the same way but when does
funny more so I just wonder if this is
too extreme what do you guys think about
this message of the me phone the
microphone the ant I'm fine it's a good
concept but for me it would be more
reassuring to do something like this do
you guys remember the joint microsoft
nokia commercials where they would prob
basically bash I think it was the iphone
&amp;amp; bash the users because they were
actually beta testers of phone oh yeah
the smartphone betta tell ok so his nose
for me right back at you guys how do all
the windows phone 7 users feel if not as
a beta tester so I think it would be
more reassuring for the customer to say
that hey this is our new platform it's
here to stay and this is what you can do
with it but
this advert this ad transmits the
information that yes this is my phone
but knowing what Microsoft did in the
best how long will it stay my phone you
know I think that I think Tony you're
right for the for the but as you as you
said before you know their market share
is so low on Windows Phone that I hate
to say this but I think that they they
probably don't care collateral damage
it's not that they don't care i think
that they they look at the numbers and
they're like all right we need to do
something to make it right for those
people but it's got to be some kind of
web-based videos we got to reassure them
in a different way and if we're going to
spend the big dollars on a national or
international advertising push then
we're gonna you know we're going to
focus on this big broader concept and
the windows phone seven people will fix
that in a smaller way and maybe they
never will and you know what they
probably won't but I just feel like
going forward they have to look at the
big the whole world and they have to say
how are we going to sell did the idea
this phone to the whole world and what's
left well look iOS says you all have to
be the same Android says a variation on
that is there is there take on this like
Android they seem to think android is
the same as iOS which is hilarious it's
not but but I like there but I like this
push where it's like this is a known
that will customize itself to you to
your needs you to your phone it's a take
on what HTC did with you you are special
you were unique you are not yet
absolutely i think that's that can be
very effective if we stick with it for
this and all the other reasons i think
that windows phone regardless if it's
seven or eight is an impulse product
they are trying to market it as such but
here's a question to you and aside from
the live tiles being smaller larger or
XXL in dimension there isn't at first
glance a huge difference between Windows
Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 I mean all
the commercials with Windows Phone 7
emphasize them the fact that you can
make this phone yours do you remember
the really or seriously ads which were
yeah very good yeah and if this impulse
thing didn't happen with Windows Phone 7
I mean it happened up until at four
percent market share point why do you
think what do you I do you think that it
will happen more
now with Windows Phone 8 I mean it's the
same concert well I don't think it is
the same concert I think at the core
it's a different things I think windows
phone 7 was but they don't hear about
course no you and I care about course
but no that's not what I mean I'm sorry
i mean the the heart of the of the push
is different I seem yeah like I think
with Windows Phone 7 they were saying
look at get in get out get back to your
life they're saying like look at these
tiles and they show you things so you
don't have to spend as much time in your
phone and they've kind of abandoned that
that advertising push with the with
Windows Phone 8 where they're saying
instead make your phone yours and I
think that's very different whether it
will be effective or not you know that
who knows but I'm glad that it's
different and don't forget that what and
dont and dont forget that phones are
sold in stores where people are gonna
see on our rack they're gonna see a
Lumia 920 they're gonna see windows
phone 8x they're gonna see an at TS and
they're gonna have beautiful screens
wonderful hardware high-res displays and
they're gonna have these live tiles that
fill up the entire screen whereas in
seven and 7.5 you have that bar on the
side and they were all relegated to the
left so so I think I here's a question
to both of you you guys are not bucket
now editors you guys are the normal
regular user and you go into a store and
you see the Samsung at CVS on the left
and you see the samsung galaxy s3 on the
right of course in the store a phone
will never be as customized as with with
your own account so you will probably
have all those dull tiles which probably
the photo style will probably be
animating the music that will be
animating but the rest life and all that
yes yeah the rest will be only colored
tiles and then you see the galaxy s3
with the beautiful weather widget with
with all the icons and you've heard all
about the galaxy s3 and you know what
android is what would you pick yeah if
I'm if I'm gonna speak for myself I'm
gonna look at both of them as a consumer
and as a consumer if I'm just a regular
guy I would gravitate to the galaxy s3
first because I know the name I would
look at the achieve and say why why is
this different and and at that point it
would come down to the sales guy this is
why the carrier sales people are so
incredibly crucial because he would have
to come
Vince me one way or the other I think
for to me windows phone is much more
aesthetically appealing than anything
the TouchWiz has ever done and I like
TouchWiz nature UX better than the other
versions so I I would give them a fair
shake it would come down to the sales
got for me Brenda that's I I don't know
what I would I can't do this role play
effectively I because I would I mean do
I have knowledge that that i can
customize android see that's that's all
you read about on the internet okay so i
know it okay um i would probably go with
with the android device because I i I'm
a control freak I want to control every
part of the experience on the phone and
I want to have the option to do so in
the future whereas with this windows
phone 8 thing while it looks pretty and
different I I know that that will be the
way it's going to look for the next two
years on my contract give or take mm-hmm
well it's yeah that it's a solid it's a
solid question um I'm glad you brought
up the achieve Tony because I wanted to
compare samsung samsung not too low mia
sure and and we've got an example of how
samsung's gonna try and move their
products with we kind of launched off
this discussion with the placebo more
commercial from microsoft and then
samsung dropped to this other ad where
it this is like a minute and 30 so i
think this is something that is not for
broadcast is that right Tony well it's
close to two minutes and I don't know
about the US laws but in Europe you can
as much if you have enough money you can
go with a five minutes at two so but
probably a shorter version of this
should be or will be aired in the US
probably so yeah it looks like a peek at
how Samsung is gonna sell a toll at Eve
line and for me you know this thing was
just was just too much so it looks like
they're positioning the the achieve
liner they're trying to as this kind of
prosumer / professional line where
they're like here's the pro tablet
here's the consumer tablet and here's
the achieve as smartphone and is this
whole narrative in the commercial about
like oh we got this project coming on
the clients are coming in where generic
white collar workers
oh no we just lost a bunch of data so
we're doing deals yeah exactly yeah so
like calling everybody across the planet
like somebody's in a taxi cab somewhere
and she's got her tablet and the
students like had a business lunch and
he gets this message on his a team pro
and he's like sorry bro I gotta go and
he liked attaches the tablet from its
keyboard dock and walks away leaving his
friend with his keyboard dock for some
reason that's absurd and then you know
this guy is talking to some beautiful
woman and on a tropical island and all
the sudden is at Eve s goes off he's
like oh I've got to take this I'm
obvious on vacation but I'm very
dedicating to my job so I got to take
this and its just oh it's the most dull
commercial ever Michael it's funny that
i usually don't agree regards if what we
talked about i disagree with everything
you guys say i don't think there's
there's a person in this world who hates
samsung adds more than I do I told you
last time I hate them up to the point
that I want to puke yeah but this ad I
like you like this I of course you like
I said well why do you why do you like I
said I like I've said about why I don't
like it I don't think it's very I don't
think it's it moves my heart so why does
it jumps right to the point where ever
you are you can work and you can play
because if you've seen everybody is
playing at the beginning the girl is
with the maps and the guys with his
phone and the other one is at lunch but
you can't play and collaborate and this
is the most important thing and I think
the core of this ad is the collaboration
between the three otherwise totally
different platforms windows phone 8
Windows RT and Windows 8 so they play
nicely together and this is I think this
is the point of the sad it's almost it's
like that one because I was like an
advertisement for the windows 8
ecosystem and not for samsung because
you know that these products don't
necessarily do anything together I mean
they just all have a samsung brand on
them yeah no that's that's a good point
and antonio i think i think you're right
i think that this is advertising more
effectively advertising the
interoperability of the user experience
or you know the disabilities experience
between different flavors of windows and
that that could help to a degree i don't
i think it needs to be a better
commercial if they want to they want to
push that idea but it's cool that
samsung is coming at it from a different
angle than then microsoft is
at least in these two examples which
kind of apples Norwich is but you know
good to the point of to the point of
Brandon that this is a an ad for the
ecosystem the Nokia aside which gives
all those nakia applications and HTC SI
2 gives you now the HTC hub in the form
of a lifestyle OEMs don't really have
that freedom to customize and
differentiate their phones so of course
they will push the ecosystem because
they cannot tell you anything what
pushes their particular phone or tablet
it comes down to build quality yeah
right which-- and it's gonna be
interesting to see how HTC markets their
windows phone products they will
probably see that the bear phones just
like Nokia said that their phones worthy
windows phones HTC will see that this is
the windows phone ages as the name says
it's the windows phone yeah i saw them
mention in more than one mentioned
across the web that like you know people
are already starting to perceive the HTC
windows phones as the sort of the Nexus
equivalent we'll have to see how that
that goes on I I'm glad we touched on
those I i do want to kind of move on to
android here because we have spent a
long time justifiably a long time on
windows because there's a whole lot of
news from windows today i want to remind
our listeners that we've got a bunch of
reviews coming down the line we headed
unboxing of the HTC windows phone we
will have a review on that up shortly i
believe and that'll be followed of
course about the Lumia 920 a whole bunch
and stuffs coming down the road so
before I jump into before we all jump in
android if final thoughts on on Windows
Phone Tony's like no no I yes no comment
no really I want to say this guy's I'm
not hating on Microsoft really I am
being so harsh on Microsoft because I
know given the size of that company its
potential its background I know that
they can do much better and when I say
that I don't recommend the surface RT
I'm not to say that I hate on Microsoft
I just want them to be better at what
they do and I want there to be a solid
third platform an option for those who
hate me
about iOS for those who also hate me
about Android I want a solid competing
company with solid product that's all
yeah Brandon amen my thoughts are in the
review well let's let's start talking
about what what mountain view is done
here because either has had a giant week
as well google had to cancel its
official event unveiling the the nexus
10 and officially announced in the nexus
4 in the new Nexus 7 and we didn't know
if they thought was going to be
rescheduled maybe even though they said
was cancelled her I did I was like ah
they got to have an event but no they
just kind of quietly unveiled their
devices on their on their android blog
and so we have a nexus family now in
small medium and large we've got the
nexus 4 on the small size replacing the
Galaxy Nexus from LG we've got the new
Nexus 7 with different storage
capacities and cellular radio and we've
got the nexus 10 this new giant tablet
from from Samsung that looks depending
on your feelings either looks awesome or
looks like an old CRT TV tube so I this
is this is interesting we also have
android for tattoo has dropped I want to
touch on we've kind of talked about the
nexus for a little bit we'll talk about
it in a second but I want to touch on
the Nexus 10 real quick with you guys
kind of touch base I've written a lot of
pieces I feel like on the Nexus 10 this
week there's another one going up today
what what do you guys feel about this
this thing this is in a landmark product
for Google in in a way that I didn't
necessarily expect because I feel like
they're using it to turn this app model
on its head and they're like well the
apps aren't there for the 10-inch but we
made an awesome device and this awesome
device is going to motivate developers
to write apps for the 10-inch form
factor and I'm like I hope it's the case
okay yeah do you guys think that that
will happen this is by the way taken
from an interview they they did with the
the verge a couple to couple days ago so
what what do you think I mean anyway
they are they're priced to sell really I
mean that ya know the nexus 4 in the
nexus 10 are ended and all the nexus
yeah in the seven yeah it's unbelievable
it's like sometimes you have to remind
yourself that the nexus that you can get
a tablet that's very good for 200 bucks
and now you can get a 10 inch tablet
that has significantly higher resolution
than the ipad 3 and 4 for 399 bucks yeah
that is awesome but whether whether I
mean I mean you can kind of look at it
when was the nexus 7 released in the
spring maybe uh no it was low barely
four months ago yeah I was like this
start of the summer wouldn't barely four
months ago it was the end of july at the
end of june i'm sorry end of june end of
joy and in july it's it's far too early
to determine whether the strategy of
coming out with hero hardware low price
points is enough to get developers
excited but I I'm gonna guess that
eventually to keep firing cannons like
the Nexus 10 at such low price points
and it's ventually going to work and
people are gonna bite I mean a lot of
people bought the Nexus 7 and I think a
lot of people are not that many not that
many Brandon well we mean three million
units and four months throws relative to
other each other's their tablet yes
relative absolute I mean that's I that's
a lot of that I was gonna mention that
later on but i mean you know i think
that's that's a cool milestone I don't
know that we have enough data to compare
it to look at look at the way the 7-inch
tablet you know market was was before we
had the kindle which was its own little
flavor of Android and you had to buy
into amazon's ecosystem and that that
sold very well this kindle fire fire
rather but this a nexus product selling
that many units in that that amount of
time to me is very impressive and i
think it speaks to this this nexus
approach being a good one where you have
really cheap hardware as you're saying
Brandon but it's not economy hardware
it's like buying a first-class ticket
for you know for coach class prices you
know I I think that strategy is really
cool and Google can afford to take a to
slim those margins down on those
products because they're not trying to
make money on the
products are trying to make money by
getting your more eyeballs on Google
content and I think it's a great great
strategy I just questioned with regard
to the nexus 10 launching a 10 inch
android tablet without an app ecosystem
which contrary to to what some some
commenters think is the case there is no
legitimate android tablet ecosystem
unless you're talking about scaling up
smartphone apps which is frankly ugly
and stupid yeah I think I think it's
about time the Twitter comes out with a
proper android smartphone app because on
a 2560 by 1600 display that Twitter
phone app is gonna look disgustingly bad
yeah yeah yeah yeah um anyway well you
know well we'll we'll see how it how it
plays out but I mean I it's so yeah I
feel you you know yeah it's it's I get
it and I it makes me excited for the
future but right now I'm I wouldn't be
excited about buying a nexus 10 just
because I do tend to rely more on apps
when I'm in the tablet form factor and
I'm not browsing but i think they are
also that they're also going to make
that this enhanced play for hey remember
we're Google we have the google play
store and it has all this amazing
content in it which they have managed to
build up very quickly i have to give
them credit for this you remember when
the nexus 7 dropped and and they were
like look at look at all this content
we've gotten the google play store we're
relaunching the Google Play stores this
content destination I mean since then
I've been able to search for books and
eight times out of ten four times out of
five I've been able to find the title
I'm looking for you know in movies as
well and and it's like wow this is you
guys have really built up a destination
for content faster than I would have
expected so I think they're going to use
that to try and sell the nexus 10 and I
think it's gonna work pretty well while
while we wait for apps I don't know
absent the user interface I don't know
if I'm right probably i'm wrong but i
had this feeling that the android aside
from the fact that has many many many
screen sizes and many many many
resolutions has basically three modes
and please
drop me a line if I'm wrong it has a
smartphone mode a phablet mode and a
tablet mode now all it would take for
Google is to improve the tablet mode
because I you remember guys last week I
talked about my nexus 7 experience
Michael you remember my five completely
empty home screens yes that's because I
I don't really find a widget which could
fill up that space now what I'm saying
here is that even the user interface
itself has to be a little more polished
to justify in my particular case
personally the purchase of a 10-inch
Google tablet yeah they're gonna use the
space intelligently right they need to
do that and we we went and thought about
this last week I thought that you guys
agreed that it would be intelligent for
them to okc we're not gonna make
applications and we're not gonna make
developers code another app for the
tablet go with windows guys limit the
application to a certain height and
width in pixels just like the window
mode on the galaxy note 2 and let me
drag that around on the screen and do no
more super huge white space i can
arrange stuff i can bring them forward i
can close them i can multitask and
problem partially solved agreed yeah and
you're talking about fleshing out the
space between the mobile and the desktop
kind of you I paradigm yeah it's in and
it gets annoying to me when I'm using an
American Galaxy Note 2 right now which
doesn't have the multiscreen support
which is amazingly frustrating and and
so half the time i'm using this galaxy
note 2 which is this giant smartphone
with just a scaled-up smartphone OS yeah
like one of the one of the crucial
features that differentiated it because
it used the see added screen size
intelligently is absent and if the nexus
10 ships without enough you know enough
intelligent usage of its of its massive
canvas and its high resolution canvas i
think it'll be similarly disappointing i
agree you know what I always dreamed of
what what well well rocket sure has it
except for the things you told me yeah
as it relates to android tablets is that
and and this kind of ties into how are
people gonna use 10 inches of
high-resolution screen space um I've
always dreamed of a tablet where I could
set it up to be a console a dashboard
for my life so everything that I do on a
daily basis is in one screen I can see
my email I can see traffic static stats
for pocket now from yesterday I can see
my bank balance I can see um let's see I
could see my favorite websites I could
see my delivery status for my ipad mini
that's coming today I can see the score
for the game that I missed and it's just
like one view my entire life is there
and it seems like you're talking about
windows are demon she was gonna say it
seems like you're talking about Windows
but your are you talking about not
having to tap on the on the tiles to
shoving them all omnipresent all the
time yeah and further the the widgets
would act as many apps so I could if I
got an email in the upper left corner of
the email widget I tap on the email it
would pop up in a slightly larger screen
that would overlap against all the other
widgets for just that moment sure and
and so I would sort of live in this
world of I would live in the dashboard I
wouldn't go into any apps I would
interact with everything everything
would be updated right when I turn on
the tablet the problem with Android or
last time I tried to do this and it was
with the Galaxy Tab 7.7 when I used that
for a long period of time Bravo Android
is that all these widgets are coded
differently so some of them will update
some of them will not some of the more
lags I'm a little crash um so so like I
I'm hoping with the nexus 10 I can try
that again because there's so many
pixels on the screen and because
hopefully widgets have gotten a little
bit better um den and you don't get no I
don't mean to interrupt I'm just coming
right on the end of your point with a
firm agreement but I think that they
will not build in the support necessary
to do it because no matter how high-rez
the screen is going to be it just seems
to me that Google doesn't care about how
many pixels it has it'll still confine
you to widget sizes that are way too big
for that high
res screen where you can't make it small
enough and still make it functional yeah
it's it's gonna be like a macbook pro
where while the resolution is higher the
effective resolution is the same if you
know what I mean exactly yes because you
can't downsize it enough even though if
you made it a one and a half inch by one
and a half inch widget it would be
readable at that resolution they won't
you do it yeah yeah unless unless you
get like I mean there you can you can
put some third-party software on there
that allow you to change the DPI
settings you talking about that fancy
fancy routing and things of that sort
yes I sent you what's the catch the
stage already damn kids seriously guys
two more things and wrapping this up as
far as I'm concerned first of all I have
no doubt that the nexus 10 will sell
very well it has great specifications
but i would i would be as bold as saying
that both the nexus 10 and the surface
RT are excellent hardware and their
software counterparts are lacking at the
moment and i'm not saying listen android
fans know android is not lacking i'm
talking about the user experience on a
10 inch screen yeah and the second thing
i want to say and this for those of you
who know me this is a great thing i will
buy a nexus 10 before i buy a surface
wow wow you know what I can't disagree I
if I were to if I were making a decision
based on utility on getting things done
yeah I would probably buy an extra time
before i bought a surface as well and
then and then some people might say well
well you're not gonna get the full
office experience that's true but
they're having the COG from quick
there's there's something called I mean
let's let's be honest here how many mmm
how often do you use microsoft office I
use Google Docs a lot cuz I like
spreadsheet I do use spreadsheets and I
do use word processing and so forth and
I make a powerpoint not once every six
months and maybe if you're in a lot of
work where you need to do a presentation
up more often you do that but there you
know microsoft office used to be like
this this pillar with which that's not
very her a pillar where if you remove
the pillar everything would fall down
because you needed office office office
right it's not it's not like that
anymore if you get the nexus 10 or get
an app like quick off
where you can make powerpoint
presentations you can do Excel and so
forth yeah yeah I don't know I I I never
comment on this the utility of office of
microsoft office because I'm in that
world and so long that I just if I have
to do a document i use google docs if i
have to a spreadsheet i use google docs
it's not because i'm a fan boys because
i've used gmail since 2006 and it's
there and it's handy and it's
streamlined and it's clean so whatever
well you know what we'll we'll talk
about all that stuff i want to i don't
want to get too far back into to
Microsoft there is something android for
dot to has brought some some
improvements and stuff and some of that
a showcased on the nexus 4 which we've
talked about a lot on the site this week
in editorial content would obviously
have a review of that coming up soon as
well d are you or either of you guys at
Tony I know you're probably not but it
attempted to carry the nexus 4 as a
daily driver in any respect if I I had
to carry an android phone probably the
nexus 4 would be on my top free list
right there with the HTC One X and
probably maybe the Samsung Galaxy S free
if I don't see any more ads cord and and
and brand it I am so excited about uh
well the nexus 4 of course for the
hardware but for point to add some
really cool stuff like this this is 360
degree panorama is the way panorama
should be done on an iOS what are we up
to six you know you've got that panorama
mode but while it works very well it is
it is so unintuitive to use because what
you get and if you're looking at it on
your iphone is this extremely horizontal
picture and you gotta like you gotta
pinch to zoom yeah pinch to zoom is like
and and it and I think the purpose of a
panorama is to make somebody have an
experience a wide 180 degree experience
that you had when you were looking at
something cool and and the panorama on
on all other products doesn't recreate
that but with this new panorama 360
degree mode on an Android is brilliant
it's awesome yeah and joel eva has a
great demo up if you haven't seen it
lists
it's awesome i just watched it this
morning because i was trying to get
caught up on all the news before we
broadcast and photo sphere is a really
cool thing I was concerned about it I
mean it's kind of gimmicky in whatever
but it does make I love taking panoramic
photos but I have the same complaint
that Brandon does you see him in the
gallery and it's this thin ribbon that
you have to pinch to zoom on and it's
really not a very fun experience plus
the software almost never stitches it
together right no matter what Android
build you're using it there's always
these seam lines and it looks like
straight lines get all distorted as the
software is kind of its its it sucks
yeah it's normal because white balance
is changing from seeing to see I mean no
I get the white balance I don't have a
problem with it's just there's their
spatial distortion between the show yeah
for those two been aramas which you take
on a yearly basis you can live with that
but but my point i would take more
panoramas if it worked better and as a
matter of fact I did when I first got
the Galaxy Nexus LTE the NT of four dot
0 dot whatever version had shipped with
did panoramas excellently and then I got
some kind of OTA update to another
version of Android and all of us on the
panorama feature sucked it screwed it up
yeah I'm like come on man and then then
I stopped taking panoramic so whatever I
think photosphere is something I didn't
want to talk about until I saw Joe's
Vidiot video demo and I was like this is
actually really cool so I it is yeah it
is well I'm not a panoramic I'll
probably as i mentioned i never take Ben
Rama's but I'm a huge photo enthusiasts
hence running with the 808 PureView all
the time but it is a great feature
Photosynth was a microsoft thing which
was available for iOS and it's also was
available for Microsoft products but
what my main key takeaway here is that
running through the key changes of
Android 4.2 I couldn't justify a point
release maybe a 4.1 points free but that
for a four points you I I think this is
not that much I mean swipe gesture
typing yeah yeah you know panorama mode
yeah wireless display and multi-user
support were already there in place
multi-user in 4.1 point2 so I think it
would have been better for a 4.1 for
free and bring something I don't know a
UI overhaul for Nexus
then in 4.2 I I think I think that the
the point one update was was a good
iteration to go to because um you know
if you usually the point X point X point
X are reserved for bug fixes and I you
know I look just your typing for me as a
must-have I I swear by it sorry swipe
you know the the widgets on the lock
screen is awesome sorry widget locker
the the improvements to Google now our
awesome the the photo spheres we just
talked about I think you're cool yeah
the google now improvements that's
something we don't talk about often
those are those arrogant those are
really crucial because that's kind of
what the future of Google's looking is
looking at I want to be just one sec
just just let me disagree shortly with
Brandon on the point release a 4.0 and
4.1 ice cream sandwich versus jelly bean
now that's justifiable but 4.1 2 4.2
it's not well we can't have project
butter on everyone right yeah I don't
you know I mean we can we can argue
about the points all day long I I think
that I think it's cool they're
continuing to iterate I I do want to i
have kind of a couple ideas about about
the future of Android that I want to
discuss next week but we have to we have
to keep moving because we we have a
couple more things to cover while we're
still in android though the the galaxy
note tablet has been rumored can we just
touch on this briefly i think we we all
have different opinions on this maybe or
maybe we're all the same the this galaxy
note 7 has been rumored in the Android
world and i don't think that it has a
point I don't think of that it needs to
exist based on the fact that the galaxy
note 5 dot five exists and the galaxy
note 10 dot one for better or worse
exists what do you guys think do you
think they're just going to use the
galaxy note 7 if Samsung releases it do
you think they're just going to do that
to replace the tab 7 dot 7 yeah and this
is just a mindset what it is they're
just going to add an s pen and and it's
the normal evolution of the Samsung
products they brought the s pen to the
10-inch form factor they brought the s
pen to the 5-inch form factor and they
will probably bring
yes been to the 7-inch form factor
they're already there in the market the
the there are the tab 7.7 the tab to the
tab 1 so they had lots of product right
there and bringing the S Pen is just a
good addition yeah i think it's i think
it's huge because the the galaxy note is
not it's a little too small for
aggressive note-taking and the hung the
10 inch tablet is a little too unwieldy
to have the portability the 7-inch talon
so you know they got to go in the middle
right yeah i just a it's just that every
time I carry around my galaxy do you
think they'll put a phone on it wouldn't
it be hilarious i wish i wish they won't
i I know yeah that would be your dream
phone Tony yeah yeah um anyway you know
and then speaking of big phones of
course is that one of the bit of news
about the the droid the droid that the
android phone that can't seem to keep
the same name the the butterfly j / di x
/ DLX / now DNA the droid DNA on verizon
looking confirmed this is HTC's giant
giant beast of a not a phablet but a
super phone with the 5-inch screen we'll
we'll see you know I don't know I i I'm
if this thing changes his name again I'm
just never gonna talk about it again
maybe maybe they're just that variety
somebody got the idea from a leak which
was handwritten and it was poorly done
at stat that they could yeah yeah just
to just just typos and things so
obviously a lot a lot going on with
Android it for me the most exciting news
from Android just wrap it up for from my
perspective is that the the nexus 4 is
going to have an a wireless charging orb
available which almost as I tweeted
earlier in the week almost makes up for
the lack of LTE which for me is a deal
breaker at this point just because I
live in a in a market where if you don't
have LTE you're nobody you were right
yes totally status no it's just that
your phones useless as Brandon saw in
New York so I can't buy a phone without
LTE I will not be buying the nexus for
it personally but that wireless charging
orb almost made me change my mind yeah
so just to touch on iOS stuff briefly
guys the your iPad Mini is coming in
today Brandon you said
it's coming today yes feeling lucky
bastard um the more hands-on I see if
that thing that's just it's just so wide
in that aspect ratio at that screen size
I don't know I can't wait to hear your
thoughts on it next week I'm very
nervous um I'm nervous because uh right
i mean i unfortunately i was in here
last week so I didn't get to cry and cry
about the lowest screen res but yeah I
don't want to have deja vu that I had
with the ipad won an ipad to where i
couldn't use the device for more than an
hour without getting a high strain and
the pixel density is slightly higher cuz
it's a smaller screen but i have a
feeling that i'm just gonna not be able
to use it so I'll you know I'll let my
wife easy okay what you could get send
it up here to boss and I could find
something to do then you have my name
you have my Nexus yeah i've got all your
stuff yeah brandon is as you come into
my base and stolen all my dudes the UK
court orders Apple to apologize better
is a hilarious hilarious story that's
already a little bit stale but I just
think it's great so it would tell me
what was the story on the Samsung the
court ordered Apple to apologize to
Samsung and Apple kind of did it and
like this is all being forced to do it
this is where people seem to be confused
and I might be wrong here there's a ten
percent chance i'm wrong but ninety
percent chance and right the court
didn't order apple to apologize the
court ordered Apple to acknowledge that
and state that Samsung did not copy its
products and from what i see they just
did that so it's not about an apology
it's not like kids playing in a
kindergartner I'm sorry I stole your
whatever it's just an acknowledgement so
if you care to read the text that's also
on our website in case it gets pulled
down Apple did just that Apple
acknowledged that the court found
samsung not to copy its design and goes
on and say that opposed to other courts
in germany and the US for instance in
the UK that particular court had this
rolling so right so it kind of be yeah
it's it's just been this headline like
all across the all across the internet
about
about the court saying Apple you you you
posted an acknowledgement that was not
in line with with what we with what we
said that you had to do so maybe it's
not i think you're right Tony I think
technically it's not quite an apology as
much as it is misinformation in the
place of information where it's like we
told you you had to make this clear to
consumers and instead you you made the
rule you made it sound like our ruling
was exactly the opposite so quickly see
better they say it on the 9th of July
the higher of Justice of England and
Wales ruled that the Samsung electronic
limited galaxy tablet computer namely
tab 10.1 7.9 and tab 7.7 do not infringe
apples register design number blah blah
blah right so they acknowledge that okay
well it's yeah I don't know it's it's
it's weird it's just interesting to see
this that note that they're not done
with this peeing match between them
it'll never be done now and they won't
you know and but the far larger news of
course this week from Apple was that the
there are some major changes in
management that have gone on John
Browett has left the company i don't
know if i'm pronouncing his name right I
can't even talk at this time I'm
actually getting sicker as the podcast
goes on the x senior vice president of
retail is leaving but also scott
forstall um big big name apparently from
all the stories that are coming out from
everywhere this week apparently nobody
liked him wasn't Scott Forstall the guy
that used the phrase this is blow away
is that what he said it didn't remember
this is blow away Tony can I get a
confirmation on that or what mm I don't
know he was referring to an iOS feature
he was like this is absolute blow away
like this is absolutely blow away he
said yeah this October 2011 yeah I when
I think of it I I can only remember
these words and that's it about and
insert the feature here and he was
always going to the next feature and
ending the presentation with that's all
about maps let's take a look at series
what a little and that's all materi
apparently he was he was like the big
guy but behind the push for ski or
morphism to continue at Apple please
stop it yeah and so it'll be interesting
to see how iOS changes that's why this
is significant I'm not interested in the
drama as much of this corporate you know
a guy leaving but
he was you know how it will affect iOS
going forward it'll be really
interesting to see how this I language
iOS changes both iOS and Mac OS and
Johnny I've sir Jonathan Ive is taking
over and just take a look at the
products if you have an Apple product in
four in front of you take a look at that
it's been drawn and thought out by jony
ive yeah and he will bring this design
to iOS I don't know to what extent I
don't know what they will change but
just knowing that there will be a change
is enough for those who got tired of the
good old user interface and this is
great timing for that because if Apple
doesn't change iOS 7 to make it truly
different this time after all these
years then people are gonna start
turning away and I by firing the guy who
was responsible for the way did he quit
heard was he fired because the rumor has
it that he was fired cuz he minimized
all the critics about Apple maps and he
refused to sign off the apology letter
and Tim Cook the CEO himself had to sign
that one off rabbit good so it's kind of
symbolic it's like yeah and maybe Apple
didn't put up a big try to keep them
keep them at the company and said you
know we're gonna part with the old here
and bringing the new jony ive's in
charge of iOS 7 because we need to do
something pretty dramatically awesome to
keep this going well yeah and if that
results in something incredible i will
be very pleased because it's so nice to
see iOS with fresh eyes i will be
tickled yeah i will be tickled pink just
over 10 minutes left in the podcast want
to get to listener mail because we can't
skip it every time once again just a
reminder to everyone we appreciate your
reader mail sorry we can't get it all on
the air but we do have a few pieces here
which are really interesting number one
is from someone whose name I haven't
decided how to pronounce it is either
cure kire or keep it somewhere he's
writing the Front's always running from
we don't know that he's a mystery he or
she is a mystery person question is why
is apps on the windows market more
expensive than android and apple's
marketplace who sets the price do you
think ten dollar apps is overpriced and
and why do you agree or disagree yeah
brandon i love this question is a good
question a long time ago not too long
ago
uh software companies would charge you
know twenty thirty dollars for a piece
of software and I don't know about you
guys but at that time I didn't buy that
much soft fur cuz it was expensive and
maybe that was even though I mean $50
software wasn't rare and you had no foot
Photoshop at six hundred fifty dollars
and you could go into the thousands and
then and then iowa's came around in the
app store opened and Apple Apple
introduced this idea where apps should
be one dollars or two dollars and and
developers were kind of upset about it
at first but something crazy happened
people started to buy a lot more
software and so and so the new norm is
that applications should be priced at
five dollars or below because it allows
for an impulse purchase I mean there's a
big difference there's a big difference
between four dollars and ten dollars um
you know yeah so so but windows the
windows brand is is still a little bit
set in that old school mentality and I
imagine that over time as Archie evolves
or as the windows 8 style Metro thingy
App Store um you know matures at prices
will come down because people aren't
going to buy a ten-dollar game like like
like I showed in my in my video review
when you could you know by the same game
or a similar game for half the price or
a quarter of the price in iOS App Store
or Android App Store so it's all I I
don't think this is permanent I think
they're gonna come down because no one's
gonna buy apps that are that expensive
because we're trained now to pay for
cheaper apps and by four of them I have
a different perspective though I agree
with Brandon that the price will come
down but I think that the reason for
this is simply economics and thinking
business and thinking numbers when you
are a developer and you get a plan
plication in the android store or in the
apple store you expect that many people
will buy your application at 199 299
multiply 199 by a thousand and you get
the amount of x if you are a Windows RT
or Windows Phone 8 developer you expect
your application to be bought by less
people because of the last market share
exactly so I'm I'm pricing it higher
because if
less people will buy it maybe it will
make it worth my time and the more
people will be caught in with the
ecosystem the prices will drop down
exactly it's a point that then we saw a
lot of that back in the webos days when
like the apps would be ported to webos
and it'd be free and another platformer
that she's a big dollar in another
platform they be five bucks in webos and
got in the forums is like why and the
developers would frequently participate
in the threads and they would give the
same exact answer you did Tony there was
just like there's not enough user base
we have to be able to justify our man
hours and not only porting this app to
begin with but maintaining it after it
sported true it makes it even more
difficult much more difficult for a new
platform to come come come about for
that very reason yes exactly that's so
thank you very much that was an awesome
question perfect i was for one day
because Michael never answers questions
no it is like I just I just I just ride
on your coattails that's what one of the
great things a little in the host I do
to answer questions shut up um this is
the second questions from Tom huffmaster
first love the podcast keep up the great
work thank you Tom the second a question
about the nexus for tom is debating
whether you get a cheaper at t-mobile
instead of getting it straight from
google because of the chance of
hindering the pure Google Experience
he's concerned he says with updates
being delayed through carriers since
it's being sold through google on the
play store with the t-mobile contract do
you guys know if it will still have the
same pure Google status if bought with a
tmobile contract instead of unlocked I
think this is a very good question it's
something I've never thought about this
happened before this happened with the
Galaxy Nexus right well I don't know
about the guys next I know the nexus one
was was a tmobile product in addition to
being its unlocked self and I think it
was the same I don't think there was any
tmobile bloatware I don't think there's
any team of lower I don't think you've
to worry about that yeah I don't think I
my gut says that after the absolute
train wreck of headaches with the Galaxy
Nexus LTE the Galaxy Nexus on sprint an
xss with these update problems they've
even Google as mentioned this in
interviews and they've said you know
that wasn't a very good user experience
I don't think they are going to try and
reproduce that at all Tom personally I
wouldn't worry that the t-mobile
one is going to be is going to be any
different from it from an update
perspective I think what because the
guys just backed me up on this the nexus
4 has support for t-mobile's AWS bands
right yeah I think it's Pentagon's yeah
like the Galaxy Nexus was llama yeah so
uh yeah I agree I don't I I would be
very surprised at the t-mobile version
varied significantly from habits for I
come from a different region of the
world and the everybody knows that I
prefer to buy phones unlocked and given
that this phone is very cheap it will
probably be like one hundred dollars
cheaper on on contract I would go for it
on lock straight from google and then
you don't even have that ? that's true
that whether it will happen or not I
mean one hundred dollars is not too much
this is what I would and and it's it's a
good point because it used to be like a
discrepancy if like 250 bucks but now
that price is so low we're talking $99
difference agreed yeah no that's that's
a good point and also and you're not
locked into a two-year contract with
with tmobile in that case and that's
that's good too so yeah Tom that's and
then time had a follow-on question for
our opinions on the Nexus 4 we touched
on them a little bit earlier in the
podcast and are the specs powerful
enough to compel you to use one tom yes
but the lack of LTE torpedoes it for me
in my region of America oh shut up you
I've just answered a question Tony look
what I did yeah and I will disagree with
you I will of course by this because we
don't have LTE here in this region so I
don't care about LG but respect
something executor excellent they are
they are excellent and that wireless
charging orb is awesome the second last
piece of listener mails from Myron gun
listener and viewer from Trinidad and
Tobago awesome yeah just wanted to say i
love your podcast and youtube vids keep
up the good work thank you for listening
and watching Lehren I listen at work and
it's very entertaining I wondering
what's your personal opinions on rim and
do you think they're too far gone and if
so will blackberry messenger be doomed
along with them or as a last resort will
they eventually go multi-platform next
year mmm i speaking personally I think
if BBM survives if rim survives long
enough to safeguard the future of BBM
they will have to go multi-platform and
I think not only will they do that I
think it'll be too late
you know III don't have personally
there's a reason we don't talk about rim
a lot on the podcast or on the site you
know it i personally don't have much
hope for them either way you can I don't
think BBM matters anymore with facebook
Messenger and with Windows Live and with
all those applications like samsung chat
on with which chef I mean yeah
especially they have all inter
compatibilities and even if not it
doesn't matter BBM unfortunately will
not matter next year and I don't think
it matters this year either yeah unless
you're really like married to read read
receipts and delivery receipts and
things like yeah but facebook Messenger
has that already sure yeah and all these
other platforms do I mean BBM's big
compelling thing was that you weren't
being charged per SMS which is kind of
no longer a situation I think people
have gotten over that and and that you
know your delivery receipts read
receipts and you could have little chat
rooms and stuff and as you said Tony
there's there's so many different
third-party alternatives to this that I
don't think it's relevant anymore yeah
uh Brendon anything else before yeah
yeah this last one is from the whim
first of all thank you for keeping me
thinking up to date with all new cool
stuff thank you for reading I was
following your discussions on mobile
note-taking past and future and maybe
wonder yet again what is happening with
display technologies like Mirasol this
is an awesome question because I had
forgotten all about Mirasol which
Wikipedia informs me the the technical
name is the interferometric modular
display yeah yeah which is this
interesting kind of hybrid between
capacitive displays that we know and
love and and ii inc and it's a Qualcomm
product i believe and yeah the shouldn't
this be a pinnacle asks the web for a
note device that just stays on and has
the displays be to work with android i
promised myself i would only buy a new
e-reader if it had full color and ian
capability unfortunately my firsty broke
down so why are there no mainstream
devices at all with mirasol did it fail
to be mass producing mmm why would
somebody in 2012 at the end of the year
by an e-reader instead of a tablet I
think just for for daytime reader
OT for tablets the kindle paperwhite is
super suit I me if you're if you're a
bookworm there's nothing like a paper
white or yeah print the glow light I
mean they're just so good at what they
do is unbelievable okay then I have no
opinion on this I i I'd say that Mira
saw isn't ready yet it's either too
expensive or it's not good enough and if
they came out with a product with it no
one would like it so I think it's just a
matter of time I think you know we'll be
in this in a future where this week a
new display technology coupled with low
power using processors dramatically
extend battery life and batteries
continue to get bigger and not
necessarily smarter um so I think it's
part of the future but just not ready
yet yeah I i agree i think i think just
development wise where we're not seeing
the e I think if they were ready to ship
we would have seen them already and
apparently inventec LG some some
companies come to be developing some
phones with using maricel technology but
i think the initial wave even when it's
ready for release ostensibly will be
will be unimpressive i think this is
something that has so much promise
because it does it promises capacitive
touchscreen full-color awesome not
forget I said capacitive but the full
color of today's regular touch screens
the but with a with an anti-glare aspect
to it kind of like the old blackberry
displays but yeah I don't know we'll see
how it goes thank you for thank you for
all of those pieces of listener mail
everyone thank you for for writing in
