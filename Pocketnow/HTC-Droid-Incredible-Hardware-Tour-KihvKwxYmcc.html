pocket now calm in this video we're
going to take a look at the hardware of
the HTC droid incredible from verizon
like the HTC Desire and nexus one the
incredible is lightning fast thanks to a
1 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor it also has 8 gigabytes of
internal storage 748 megabytes of rom
and 512 megabytes of ram Bluetooth Wi-Fi
GPS FM radio all the other usual
suspects are here as well the front of
the device has a glossy black finish
near the top we have proximity and light
sensors a metallic red speaker grill and
an LED light for notifications below the
verizon logo we have a large 3.7 inch
capacitive multi-touch display with wvga
resolution so that's 480 across by 800
down let's slides it up next to a touch
pro 2 with a slightly smaller 3.6 inch
display and next to an HTC pure with an
even smaller 3.2 inch display the
incredibles display is of AMOLED
technology so blacks are going to be
crisp and colors should be nice and
vibrant it should also help with battery
life at the bottom we have a row of
capacitive touch buttons the four
buttons are for home menu back and
search so far I found them to be very
responsive and they don't get in the way
of a regular screen usage at all below
that we have an optical trackpad for
on-screen navigation which can be
pressed in and used as a selector if we
turn to the left side of the device we
have an up and down volume rocker a
micro USB port on the bottom we have a
lanyard hole a latch for removing the
battery cover and a microphone
on the right side absolutely nothing and
up top we have a three point three point
five millimeter headphone jack and the
power button moving to the back we have
a beautiful eight megapixel autofocus
camera with dual-led flash as you can
see it does stick out a bit but the
edges aren't sharp at all next to that
we have a speaker which I found to be
quite good in terms of loudness and
clarity large HTC branding and at the
bottom we have with Google splashed
along the bottom so reading through some
comments a lot of you seem to really
dislike the multi-layered design of the
soft touch battery cover I certainly
don't blame you as it is unconventional
and it looks rather odd at first I will
say this though during the last couple
of days I've actually found that it's
starting to grow on me there's nothing
out there that looks like it so it's
kind of an eye catcher the layer design
helps improve grip and I just think the
look of it fits the droid title nicely
another thing I noticed is that it gives
the speaker some room to breathe so when
it's laying flat on a surface it's not
going to sound as muffled as it probably
would otherwise so while you might may
not like the design right now perhaps
after some time passes you'll find that
it starts to grow on you one thing that
does concern me is the quality of the
cover the feels solid while attached to
the rest of the phone as it doesn't
really Creek or bend in words but when
you remove it you can see that it's
super flimsy and extremely bendable I
actually feel like it's going to snap in
half right now of course battery covers
are meant to stay on most of the time
and most of you aren't going to twist
and torture it like I'm doing right now
but hopefully still stays on tightly
over time
as we saw during the unboxing the inside
of the device is completely red it kind
of reminds me of an expensive sports car
and I can't say this enough but I really
like what HTC is doing with some of
these devices I think it's a good thing
that they're adding these custom colors
behind some of these battery covers we
saw with the HTC HD Mini it has an all
yellow interior the incredible has an
all red interior and I can't wait to see
what color will see next on a future
device so moving on we have a microSD
slot on the side which supports up to 32
gigs I really like that they put it on
the side rather than under the battery
cover which they sometimes do with some
devices and its really annoying so let's
go ahead and close it up alright with
the battery in the incredible feels good
in hand it's really light but with
enough heft and grip to feel like it
won't fly out of your hand which is
definitely a good thing so this was the
hardware tour of the HTC droid
incredible to stay on top of all of our
