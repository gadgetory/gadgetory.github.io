pocketnow.com and today we're going to
unbox the palm treo pro now I realize
that we're a little bit late on our
coverage on the trio pro but I know that
a lot of people still have their eye on
this device especially as we're hearing
about the samsung epix we just going to
be coming out on the AT&amp;amp;T network the
epics is a very similar device to the
palm treo pro but it will be offered at
a subsidised lower price when and if it
comes out on AT&amp;amp;T so watch out for that
let's get started I like how the Box can
actually sit on a corner that's really
interesting they took off a corner so
that you can place the box like so very
interesting box very small
unconventional box for windows mobile
device
we look at that in a minute but I do
like how they put the device right in
the front just like an iphone I mean
this is a very similar unboxing
experience to the iphone so I'm going to
take this piece of plastic off some kind
of piece of plastic looks like we have
some getting miss getting started
material not in color and then we have
some other documentation then we have
some accessories in here starting off
with the USB charger and I'm assuming
that there is a plug that goes along
with that there's a USB whole kind of
like the iPhone there's a lot of
similarities so far plug for the United
States then we have a sync cable using
what looks to be micro USB and set
instead of mini USB and then finally we
have some headphones okay so let's take
a look at the device it's got a really
nice flush touchscreen as is the case
with most newer windows mobile devices
the keyboard is kind of small I'll
compare that to other devices in a
second it's it's pretty thin it's 14
millimeters thin which is about the same
thickness as the blackjack two on the
back we pretty much have nothing but fit
but the camera on the back plus a
speaker dedicated Wi-Fi button alright
let's compare it to some other devices
let's compare to the blackjack two that
comes to mind because they're both you
know similar form factor devices
although obviously the blackjack two
does not have a touchscreen the keyboard
on the blackjack two is much more
generous in fact it's almost two times
as high because each button is much
taller so that's going to be something
to get used to and in terms of thickness
like I said the blackjack two and the
trail Pro are very similar in thickness
so not the thinnest devices around but
not thick like the you know the HTC
touch pro for example which is
absolutely monstrous in terms of
thickness alright let's compare it to
the motorola q 9h which has probably one
of the best keyboards on any mobile
device that i've ever used and of course
the keys are taller wider they
have a texture to them a kind of a bump
on each key words on the treo pro
they're all pretty much smooth and flat
on the top it's probably something that
you have to get used to so that's pretty
much it for the unboxing video we've got
a ton of interesting coverage coming up
so be sure to keep it to the pocket now
video YouTube channel to stay abreast of
when we post these new videos that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
