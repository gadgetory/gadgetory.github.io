Park geun-hye calm and today I'm assure
you opera mobile 9.7 beta and what this
program is going to allow you to do is
use presto 2.2 to render pages much
faster than many other mobile browsing
experiences available and there's one
other neat feature about opera mobile
9.7 is it also includes opera turbo and
what that's going to do is it's going to
accelerate web pages by reducing
bandwidth consumption up to eighty
percent and if you're familiar with
opera mini you have probably seen the
opera turbo but soon it will be out of
the beta testing version and will be in
full release so we're just going to go
into some of the settings real fast on
this opera mobile 9.7 and we can go to
the start page setting and that will
give you your default and you can use
the current so whichever web page is
currently on you can also define it
whichever web page you want to have as
your start page go to the display you
can switch between a mobile view you can
show the image an automatic full screen
you can also pick which size font you
want privacy this will allow you to
delete cookies delete cache delete
history and manage your passwords will
also go into the advanced feature where
the opera turbo is we're going to
actually enable up block pop-ups enable
plugins enable cookies enable javascript
and set Opera as default browser you can
also change your check cash sighs so
Opera Mobile nine point seven states
that will get 100 out of 100 on the acid
three test so I'm just going to run the
test on a couple of other browsers to
show you some comparisons so if you run
it on it pok the Internet Explorer the
acid three test doesn't even state that
it will run on this device on this web
browser so go into another web browser
and we're just going to go into skyfire
real fast okay so going add to menu go
to navigation to bookmarks so I already
have the page bookmarked
and we'll just go to the acid three
tests and we'll let skyfire load this so
already it says that the Allen the acid
three tests that the skyfire browser has
failed and right now it's only at 23 out
of 100 will let it load so the final
verdict is 52 out of 100 on the acid
three test so now i'm going to show you
opera mobile 9.7 so just exeter this
real fast and we'll start loading of
course it's much better already as the
pocket internet explorer it will
continue to load and no actually surpass
the skyfire browser so we're approaching
the passing point of sky fire and there
we have fit
so there you have 100 out of 100 on an
acid three tests on a mobile browser
that's amazing I've never seen this on a
internet browser for a windows mobile
device before if I will load a webpage
that's just pakka medicom this web page
actually has a JAX on it so I can show
you how the Ajax support works on this
new browser so just let it load and it
loads very fast with the new opera turbo
so just go into something right here
this is just a link to Brandon just
click on that and it should open our
Ajax supported contact page so as you
can see it loaded here so that's a great
feature to have a browser that actually
has ajax support on it so we're just
going to go to another web page i'm just
going to go to youtube com and show you
that this program still does not support
flash so that's a little bit
disappointing so for some flashing rich
web pages that doesn't really work so
just go to the desktop version roll fast
well just go to one of these first
videos as you can see when you scroll in
and scroll out or zoom in and zoom out
it's much more intuitive it's a lot
faster and the pages scroll much easier
than on opera opera mobile 9.5 so that's
great feature
and as you can see it still does not
support flash unfortunately a so now I'm
going to compare Opera Mobile 9.7 beta 2
skyfire version 1 and I go into a couple
of my favorites and actually have just a
tease website pulled up so go in there
it's much easier to get to the favorites
on the Opera Mobile 9.7 because you
don't have to actually log on to their
skyfire server so here we are we have
ATT right here both of them ATT so we're
going to click on both of them at this
get exact same time so here we go and of
course the AT&amp;amp;T loaded much faster on
opera mole 9.7 but then again it doesn't
give the intuitive features of the flash
enabled web sites like skyfire does so
it's a lot it's a lot more media rich to
use skyfire than to use opera mobile 9.7
beta but it still does provide the same
browsing experience technically so
another neat feature at the Opera Mobile
9.7 beta is that it allows for a
smoother transition as you can see it
will close the web address as well as
your settings in your home and your
favorites down here but this page still
only allows for three separate web pages
so if I load pacquiao calm and add
another one I was good msn com
allow me to add any more as you can see
it's grayed out so that is kind of a
little bit of a disappointment I was
hoping there would be more pages that
would be allowed to be used on operable
9.7 so some major issues that have been
fixed with opera mobile 9.7 is that you
can now install onto your storage card
it also has better ime support so i will
post a link on parking other comments on
how to get this and remember to follow
