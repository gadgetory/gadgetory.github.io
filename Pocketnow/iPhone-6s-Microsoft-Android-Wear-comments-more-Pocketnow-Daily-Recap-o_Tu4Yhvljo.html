vacation hi Mary better take that they
often relax I'll do the parking out
daily for tomorrow got yourself a deal
and upload before midnight is this a
fake video no an 8-megapixel lesser on
the back that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Natalie vana this is
pocket now and this is the parking out
daily recap for last week on Monday
asked you what would you fix from
Android whereas the rumors are that the
service is going to get some major
revamps going forward we have 454
comments one of them says android wear
spine smartwatches are just dumb
actually I thought it was the other way
around Android wear is done but the
SmartWatch is actually look cool I'd
like Android wear to be future proof
once I find the right hardware I don't
want it to be the case of its being
obsolete after a few months in the past
five years I've upgraded my phone five
times I don't want to have to do the
same thing with the watch and I do agree
with you the biggest problem with the
wearable technology is that you're gonna
plan to wear it for a couple of years
not every year snap on a removable
battery so that I could come home and
swap to a full battery also receiving
calls on the watch talking back to me
would be really cool and I do agree with
you that feature of being able to see
that you're getting a phone call but not
being able to take it as useless and the
removable battery is actually a very
cool idea on Tuesdays it was all about
digital assistants the rumors are that
Facebook is working on its new service
that will be powered by people and it's
code name is Moneypenny we had 626
comments one of them says I used to love
s voice just kidding nobody likes s
voice haha yeah I thought something was
wrong with you are you Seri but in my
opinion this personal assistants need to
get a lot smarter and I do agree with
you I like him for reminders but I wish
they had more context information over
the things that matter to me so they do
need to do a little more learning even
though that's a little creepy go Sri
google now is cool but it's just too
boring it can't tell jokes it doesn't
have a personality Sri is fun and gives
you great responses I like it every time
that Sri gets something right then yeah
but that's the problem Google now is a
little more accurate in my opinion
Wednesday was about Microsoft satya
nadella late
this plan that Windows 10 is actually
designed to push mobile and I ask you if
you trust him we have 600 6 comments one
of them says windows 10 looks like if
it's going to be more awesome yeah I'm
waiting for it and more people are
waiting for it than ever let's just see
if it delivers I believe Microsoft
Windows Phone is much faster and more
stable and Android that's been the case
for windows phone 7 Windows Phone 8 and
it still hasn't done what it had to do I
/ soft on the shot via is a just moving
forward to the drink company that
everyone wanted the Microsoft to be to
be honest this is the best time to trust
Microsoft under this brand new
leadership and direction totally
disagree with you and I would agree with
you if he wouldn't be firing so many
people how can the company become better
without the talent that got it the work
was in the past and word should be in
the future and then on Thursday we
talked about the need for a sim card
particularly because Apple and Samsung
in a couple of carriers are working on a
new Isom project that plans to get rid
of the sim card but in a different way
to cdma we have 163 comments one of them
says not being able to swap your sim
card is called CDMA and there is a
reason why it's not as popular as gsm
agreed true but that's not the case for
the United States by the way first
expandable storage and interchangeable
batteries now sim cards what will be
next disappear from smartphones well the
stylist was part of that as well but
you've got a good point there so Apple
and Samsung and carriers trying to kill
unlock phones no thank you I refuse to
buy a phone from a carrier give me a
clean phone without look wearing crap
please and actually that's not
necessarily the plan the idea is free to
be able to choose your carrier from
within the settings of your phone which
is great so long as you fly to countries
that support that and that's the reason
why I particularly don't like it but hey
you've got a point there as well it
could be a threat as well too and
finally Friday was about expandable
storage or how much is the minimum
capacity of storage you can live with
because the rumors are that Apple is
doing away with 16 gigs on the iphone
success we have 1169 comments thanks a
lot guys one of them says I can live
with 16 gigabytes just gotta pick
right porn right I could actually
survive what 16 gigabytes I don't have a
lot of applications on my iPhone but on
the iPad definitely 64 and yes that is a
very important point in tablets you can
do a lot more than you can do with
smartphones so you do need the starting
point on tablets to be broader I'm
perfectly fine with 16 gigabytes 32
gigabytes as a plus and that storage
capacity I'd rarely check to see where I
am with a limited photo back up with
google photos two terabytes in Google
Drive and Google play music all access
with carrier unlimited data I'm good and
you know a lot of companies have bet on
the cloud but the problem is technology
is not there yet your case is particular
but them the rest of the world doesn't
have LTE speeds yet the rest of the
world doesn't get unlimited data the
rest of the world doesn't get fast
internet speeds even on hspa+ so these
services aren't really reliable that
will probably be the ideal five years
from now three years from now but that's
not the case now not the case for me
particularly that's the reason why I
need so much storage think about driving
in a you know long direction or going on
a plane your cloud storage is gone so
that's when you actually need it the
most that's it for the pocket out daily
