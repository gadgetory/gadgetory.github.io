pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you all the interesting
and unique features of the Apple Newton
message pad 2100 now if you've been
following this series that we've been
doing you know that the Newton is about
an 11-year old device it's the last
Newton that Apple ever made that they
came up with it came out in 1997 and it
cost $1,000 and the purpose of this of
this video series is to see how far
we've come and yet how far we haven't
come because there is a lot of things
that the Apple Newton can do a lot of
really intelligent features that we
still don't see on mobile devices of
today okay so what is the Apple Newton
well the way I think about it is like a
really advanced note pet and you'll see
what I mean by that in a second I'm
gonna start by turning it on and there's
a switch in the upper left corner and
you probably won't be able to see the
screen so I'm gonna turn on the
backlight and hopefully the backlight
won't burn out by the time I'm done with
this video the back lights kind of this
ugly green color and it there's a little
hum coming from the device but it serves
the purpose of bringing the bringing
some light to the device when you're in
a dark room or something like that
because obviously it's not backlit like
a traditional LCD is so let's start out
the the the kind of desktop for the
Apple Newton is the notepad application
that's where you always go back to
whether you're in you're in contacts or
calendar or you're faxing something or
anything like that and I'm gonna make a
new note and show you some things that
this can do and how you input data into
this so quite simply we can start off by
just naturally writing and I have to
change the mode down here to text and
now I'm going to write on the screen
today is Tuesday
now looks like the words wrong and I'll
show you how to correct that in a second
you can write anywhere on the screen and
it will always show up where the cursor
is so I could have done today is Tuesday
I could have done today is Tuesday and
so on and so forth
now you see I've misspelled the word nor
the Newton is misspelled to Tuesday so
the way I correct it is quite simply by
writing on top of it so that you needs
to be an A so I'm gonna do an a changes
to an A that period needs to be a Y so
I'm going to write on top of that and it
corrects it so let's say I want to
delete the word Tuesday how do you do it
well kind of like in a real notepad you
scribble it out so I'm gonna scribble
out Tuesday you get this little
animation and this whoosh sound and it's
off the screen and you can do that with
the whole entire sentence or just one
word or one letter so it's a really
smart way of just simply removing or
deleting what you've just written in now
you can also type with the on-screen
keyboard though I'm sure most people
prefer to use the handwriting
recognition so if I type today is
Tuesday it's a really nice keyboard
actually it's quite large it makes this
annoying sound every time you type on it
but you know you can turn off the sound
obviously to close the keyboard and this
is kind of a deviation from other mobile
devices the close button is in the
bottom right and you'll find that to be
the case in most of the screens on the
Newton so now once we have text on the
screen we can do some things with it we
can move it around we can copy and paste
and other sort of things first thing we
have to do is select the text and the
way we do that is by clicking and
holding and then dragging the selection
line through the text or the shape as
we'll see soon that you want to
manipulate so I'm going to tap down and
you're all through now I can move this
around if I want I can place this
anywhere on the page if I want to copy
it or duplicate it I double tap and
slide so watch this double tap and slide
double tap and slide the iPhone still
doesn't have copy and paste but the
Newton can do it here and let's say I
want to undo that last copy there's an
undo button on the bottom here but
unfortunately it only goes back one undo
compared to you know other devices and
uh you know on your computer you can go
back many different times so I'm going
to erase everything that's on the screen
here
so I can show you another feature now
another thing that you can do in the
Newton is sketch and the Newton will
automatically smooth out your shapes
because you know you can't drill can't
draw a perfect circle or a perfect
square so if we go down here to where I
changed the the input method I'm going
to go to shapes the cursor goes away I'm
going to draw a square to the best of my
ability and it automatically smoothes it
out I'm going to draw a circle to the
best of my ability
it automatically smooths it out now
what's really neat is that you can move
around these shapes and resize them so
I'm gonna select it just like I told you
how to select before just draw through
the item and because this is now a
vector watch what I can do yeah this is
a really good tool for someone who does
a lot of sketching or drawing I can draw
a triangle and it will be smoothed out
although that didn't work out too well
let me try that again perfect and we can
tap and drag one of the corners now we
can also move some of these so let's say
we want to move the circle and the
triangle we move the selection line
through both items and we can slide them
around on the screen so the net effect
of this is that you can mix text and
shapes and drawing so that let me show
you something that I I made earlier and
I'll take you through the screen in a
minute where is floor plan floor plan
here it is floor plan you get something
like this which is a really nice looking
mix of text and shapes and everything
like this and from here you can fax a
note you can fax a note you can email a
note you can be Manute and the way you
do that is that in the upper right
corner there's a picture of a mailbox
now I can't do any of this because I
don't have the right equipment nor do I
have why isn't it responding here we go
nor do I have another Newton - beam -
but here we have print note fax note and
beam and I'm assuming if you have the
right capabilities and the right card
we're hooked up to this you could also
email the note now I showed you the
screen down here when I press the dot it
shows me all of the different entries in
notes that I have right now and if
you're in calendar pressing on that dot
will show you all the different calendar
entries you have and you can flip
through them with the up and down
buttons or I can just make a new note by
new and going to note we can also choose
a few other things from this note
application we can do a new checklist so
we can say you know milk and we're in
the wrong mode let me change it once
we're in shapes though so I need to
change the text so let me do milk and
I'm gonna go down an item cheese say
we're going shopping and then when
you're done with them you can check them
off and that sort of thing a really
intuitive way to to make a list I think
and let's go to the next one which is
outline this is really great for a
student so
biography got the word right so let's go
down a indent and we'll type another
item in the list and from here we can go
down another item and so on and so forth
now something that's really neat is the
Newton's integration with the notepad
with the other PIM programs such as
names and dates which we'll cover in a
minute
that lets you do calendar and contacts
if I write lunch with Brandon watch what
happens and I am in the right mode so
I'm just going to do lunch that's
probably not going to come out very well
so I'm gonna scribble that out although
I could have corrected it lunch with
Brandon and now I'm gonna highlight this
and I'm gonna go to the assist button on
the bottom the assist button responds to
certain commands so it knows that I want
to schedule a meeting so it brings up a
new meeting card and all I have to do is
input the date and the time and it's
already got the title lunch with Brandon
pretty smart right Windows Mobile can't
do that
let me scribble that out you can do
other things such as call people so I'm
gonna do call Bob if there's a bob in my
contact list so I'm gonna do call Bob
and of course it's showing though
showing up where the cursor is I'm going
to highlight it do the assist button and
look look what comes up Bob Anderson his
contact card if I press the call button
it will call Bob and no this doesn't
have a phone but the idea is that you
hold up your phone to the speaker and
you hear it dialing it will dial Bob
Anderson for you
and I'm going to close this and note
where the close button is down here in
the bottom right corner there's other
things that you can do with this assist
function so we can set a reminder to do
something so remind me - I don't know
I'm just gonna type remind me and you'll
see what it does remind me and I'm gonna
highlight it go to assist and what you
get is a to do tasks automatically comes
up pretty smart
okay so let's take a look at the other
PIM applications down here we have names
which is basically like a Rolodex or
contacts list and we can sort the names
by category and here are all the
contexts that I have now let's say I
want to add a new one I love the way
that you add a contact in the the Newton
operating system it's just so fast and
so intuitive so I'm going to write new
person and let's see I let's say I want
to write a new contact for Bill Gates
I know his phone number I know his name
look how fast I can enter this ready
done talk about a fast way to interact
with the device it's completely natural
it misspelled the name gates so I'm
gonna change that to a G well and that
should be a T there we go and it's added
perfect now let's go into the dates
application which is the calendar
application we can change view by
clicking the show button here we can go
to a week view we can go to a month view
and just like in any PIM application if
you click on a day it will take you to
that day we can click our cursor at one
o'clock and we can start typing anywhere
on the screen just like we could do in
the notes application so let's say I'm
gonna have lunch with Bob so I'm gonna
do lunch with Bob and we're done there
it is lunch with Bob has been made and
as I mentioned this dot in the calendar
application will draw a list of all of
your different appointments just like in
notes application it will bring up a
list of all of your different notes so
it's a really great way to kind of see
them one glance the appointments that
you have over the next period of time
now I want to go into the extras button
because there are a few other programs
that is on the Newton message pad 2100
here we have something called styles
which will allow you to change the kind
of style that shows up on the screen
when it converts your ten writing to
text or when you type with the on-screen
keyboard so we can do bold italics
underline we can change the size right
now it's on 18-point we can even change
the font there are only three fonts but
you know that's that's appreciated we've
casual fancy and simple and we can also
change the thickness of the pen so right
now it's on a two so you can see it's
kind of kind of thin if we change it to
a four much thicker some people may
prefer to prefer that so that they can
see it on the screen going back into
extras we have a simple clock and we
have also a preferences screen which
doesn't let you do do that many things I
mean you can change how loud the volume
is you can configure a modem specify how
it's synchronized with your computer and
that sort of thing even adjust the
handwriting recognition
little bit you can specify how
closely-spaced your writing is and you
can also check off if you want it to do
cursive or if you want it to do print
and I have it set to print because I
can't do cursive very well okay back in
extras we have a formulas program which
will allow us to do things like loan
amortization net present value currency
exchange deed calculator so useful
things that may be of use on the go to
the mobile professional we have a simple
calculator we can change the time zone
that we're in and we can see a list of
all the calls we've made and you know
recently we've caught we've called Bob
Anderson and why would you want to see
this on a device that doesn't even have
a phone well you could want to write a
note on the call so that the next time
you call Bob you could say Oh last time
we talked about the westcoast account or
something like that and over here on the
bottom we have some system statistics so
we have the amount of battery that's
currently remaining and I have to say
the battery on the Newton lasts a very
long time and I'm sure the batteries in
here are very old but this device
doesn't seem very power-hungry contrasts
we can change the contrast of the screen
and it makes this ticking sound and over
here we have volume because as you have
heard throughout the demonstration it
makes a lot of sounds now there's
actually screen rotation built into this
which is great if we click on rotate we
can rotate it in any direction so I'm
going to go to the left and it takes a
minute to redraw and what's interesting
is that it makes really good use of the
screen real estate so it places the
icons on the left side and if you want
you can actually have the buttons go on
the right like so in conclusion the
Apple Newton message pad is a fantastic
note-taking device every time I go to a
convention or conference I bring along
one of these notepads and you know what
it's a really inconvenient and not
organized way to keep track of my notes
because I can't search for text I can't
organize them by category it's just a
big mess
of yellow pages and the Newton really
would be a good remedy to that back in
1997 when this came out I don't think
the world was ready for an advanced
note-taking device especially when it
was trying to be a PDA communication
device note-taking device all in one the
world was just not ready for it I guess
the modern-day equivalent of this would
be a tablet PC because it's a larger
form factor tablet PC doesn't fit in
your pocket and it does a lot with
natural text input so that's it for the
video series on the Apple Newton message
pad 2100 I hope you enjoyed this tech
step back in time at the device that
really helped pave the way for mobile
technology and mobile devices that we
have today that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
