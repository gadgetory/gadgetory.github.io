demo area that's beautifully lived with
natural light who'da thunk it hey folks
one bag now here for pocket now we're
just minutes out of the Samsung unpacked
event and we're going hands on with the
new Galaxy s8 and the s a flush both of
these phones very similar just different
screen size wide HD plus sort of display
it's a little similar to what we were
talking about with the LG G 6 a little
bit taller and that they're really
trying to maximize that screen real
estate and bringing in those design
elements from phones that are missed
like say the Galaxy Note 7 in really
creating a beautiful symmetrical device
really nice color options and a really
great feel in the hand start hearing
about a 5.8 inch diagonal display and
you start getting a little worried like
maybe they're smaller phones really
going to be in phablet territory in this
new aspect ratio this two by one aspect
ratio really does help maximize screen
real estate of hacking all that into a
much smaller form factor now all of
those rumors all of those leaks there
weren't a tremendous number of surprises
for this phone a lot of this was just
getting confirmed we are looking at in
April 21st released for this device a
little bit earlier than we were
expecting so that's definitely great for
people wanting to get their hands on the
next Samsung and then all of the other
metrics were right on point we've got
the 12 megapixel camera that dual pixel
autofocus that we saw in the s7 and the
the note 7 that's made of return and
then a number of new fun features that
kind of help maximize the screen real
estate bringing back some of those
customizations from previous Samsung
devices I could do split screen
especially considering that this is not
a standard screen resolution we do have
some tools to make sure that our games
will play without pillarboxing so that's
definitely appreciated and for anyone
who is concerned there is a sort of
taptic motor II feel to the buttons
underneath so that even though we have
on-screen controls they do feel they do
resemble Hardware controls
I'm still a little torn on the placement
of the fingerprint scanner on the back
every time I reach for this even on the
smaller s8 with my little Hobbit hand I
know I'm kind of smudging over my camera
to get to the fingerprint sensor but if
that's not your jam you don't want to
have to worry about doing the unlock
from the back we do have base on locks
and iris scanning so we have a
combination of two different facial
feature unlock modes from the phone so
that should help take some of the
pressure off you sort of smearing the
back glass of your gout you're pretty
galaxy si to try and make sure that you
can get into your apps and your services
one of the biggest announcements our
Samsung on the s8 with a 460 their
software layer where they're going to
start incorporating more intelligence
into interactions voice commands and
camera controls unfortunately while
there is some Bixby software on this
phone it's not fully activated so we
can't really show you what that's going
to look like that side of some of their
demo videos but it does sound like it's
got some promise especially if Samsung
can continue to reach out to third-party
developers and make sure that their
services will integrate with Bixby then
I think we could see some really cool
interactions with getting away from
always having to focus both your touch
and your eyes and your ears all on one
glowing rectangle screen one of the
fascinating things about this
symmetrical design is it really does cut
back on how big these phones feel we put
the s8 next to the s8 plus the s8 plus
does not feel like a tremendously big
device until you compare it to a smaller
phone these the way that these sides
curve around I'm a little concerned
about holding on to this doing our real
camera review but when I went over to
start shooting all of my hands on
footage for this video I was doing
almost all of it on the si plus that's
why you see the black si plus in this
video before I realized that I was
actually holding the larger of the two
phones I put it up next to my g6 and
that's when I realized oh I'm holding
the phablet version I should probably
switch over it's already making my hands
look small enough as it is Samsung is
building a little story of redemption
the s8 is going to be their flagship
phone not only for you know their normal
flagship phones delivery at the
beginning of the year then also to
continue telling that story of their
commitment to their consumers listening
to the products and to the feature sets
and to the experiences that people want
to have with their mobile devices and
then also looking to the past for some
of their missteps to make sure
they don't make those same mistakes
again moving into the future did you
know that pirates wore eye patches so
that when they went below deck they
could remove it and have better vision
in the dark
I actually did we'd like to thank our
sponsor Dee brand for reminding us that
it's tough to see in the dark this
Bazaar add-in our Samsung unpacked event
coverage is brought to you by Dee brand
check them out in the link below
reliability consumer safety and of
course improving on all of those
experiences that we need to have to get
our work done day to day that's the
story that Samsung is trying to tell and
of course we'll be going hands-on with a
few more videos with Jules and with hi
mate
looking at different comparisons looking
at the g6 looking at the iPhone and also
is this a phone that you should consider
upgrading from your Galaxy s7 maybe that
one-year upgrade it's a little bit more
impressive when we start looking at a
change in form factoring capabilities so
definitely stay tuned make sure you're
subscribed to the channel for our full
Samsung unpacked coverage we also got
some gear 360s to play with so I'll
probably be harassing you guys up 360
degree videos soon for pocket now I'm
Juan Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
