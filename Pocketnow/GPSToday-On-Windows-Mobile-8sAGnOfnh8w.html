calm and today I'm going to show you a
cool little GPS application called GPS
today and this application will give you
your current position the street that's
closest to you friends and their
vicinity it'll give you directions you
can search in the proximity of your GPS
location you can send your location can
see other friend geotag photos get
current weather current speed the
direction your send your location to
your friends and save your location to
your device so we'll go in two
directions real fast and it's pretty
easy to set up you just hit start and
you can go from your current GPS
position to your end location so if I
wanted to pick a street address i can do
that or go to a contact or any other
jeep or if i want to end at my current
gps location i can do that if i want to
give directions to someone else so just
enter address i'm going on the address
button we'll just hit seattle and
washington and then there it is already
so i'll just hit accept and we're going
to be driving so click on the driving
button and it go you can also optimized
for traffic it'll get traffic
information from google maps and here
are directions so we can likely go clear
we can clear all this and change reverse
and we'll just close it so you can
actually sit the map so click on the map
and you can see see my current location
right now and it does require an online
account and it is free and i'll post a
link and pocketnow.com as to how to get
this program so it'll give you
turn-by-turn directions it'll actually
track you on your GPS so you can zoom in
and out you can also change between
satellite view and hybrid view and if
you want to geocache a photo along the
way you can click on this button it'll
send a photo so just close this so the
next one is search so if we wanted to
search for something I already have
starbucks here if so they want to search
for that I can do that I click on the
starbucks there and search for starbucks
in my area
and there's none that are too close
right now so I can zoom out and still
nothing so zooming out one more time
brought me to three starbucks in my area
it looks like this one might be closer
than this one but they're still pretty
close so that's pretty neat close that
go here and this actually is your GPS
today information so it'll give you an
email account from your friends so if
they send you their location or whatnot
if they have GPS today as well and
that's always free so close this so this
will allow you to broadcast your
position you know you can create a group
so if let's say it's a group of your
friends you can create a group you can
also browse public groups and you can
make yourself public as well so if I
want to browse public groups I can
search for groups and it looks like
there's a few groups around so let's say
I wanted to search for earthquake last
24 hours I can do that and see see where
the last 24 hour earthquakes have been
North in the past 10 minutes where
cancel cancel again you can also see GPS
locations of my friends so this will
post my location to the groups that
selected below so if we wanted to make
its public I can just say okay and it
will post my location I can also set a
picture for myself and create a group
just kind of like the last one but a
little more personal so okay you can
also geotag photos so if we want to
select a photo here if this is where I
took the photo I can select a photo so
if I select a photo in here so here's
the photo that i just took so i can
click on this so i can just add a title
so i'm just going to put late because
that's what the photo is it's a picture
of a lake I like okay and then when I'm
done I can just create post and it will
say post created click OK and this will
allow you right here use your your
current GPS fix with longitude and
latitude your altitude as well as the
time so you can also copy that to your
clipboard and if you can see that it
says copy to clipboard but it's pretty
fast you can also search in your
proximity so if I want to search for an
address or longitude latitude I can do
that hit cancel this also gives you a
street address so if you are not in tune
with the longitude latitude as is most
people are not
can also cook you can also copy the
street so we can just copy that and post
it and send it as a text message if you
want to later it can also search in the
vicinity as well so cancel that you can
you get current weather updates so if i
wanted to refresh i can click here and
it will refresh my weather so if i click
on here give me a my current weather in
the forecast and if i click on this
button which says more it'll launch my
internet browser enter on whether calm
and it will give you a forecast for the
next week or so we'll just close this
hey okay so this button right here will
give my GPS fix interval so you can
change it between one minute five minute
ten minutes three minutes an hour
whatever you select i selected auto
because i wanted to update as fast as i
can and this will help save on battery
power as well so this next one right
here will automatically geotag photos so
it is you can see here says five minutes
so you can pick which pictures you take
in listening last five minutes or so and
it goes all the way up to 24 hours and
no geotag your position as to those
photos so you can go current map
position or current gps position so
that's pretty nice okay if you go to
autorun settings you can select where
the pictures come from and you can hit
stop or start if you want your photos to
stop updating to the server and you can
also see it starts oh there's ok and ok
again the next button is where you can
actually send your location so if you
want to send your location to your
friends you can do that through email or
SMS and you can pick an application or
gps location and you can just click Save
one to send an email i can click next
and i can just tap the email here and
click send down here and it'll
automatically send where my position is
and the closest street address so close
that and the last one is actually this
one right here which will save your
position so if you wanted to start
logging your GPS position let's say
you're going to take a trip you know I
show your friends or you've gone can it
start and it will save you can pick a
file name and save to your documents
that's pretty useful as well so they go
down the options I can check for updates
change my settings so from here we can
change the daily use the general
today's screen options GPS location and
regional units so if I wanted to change
it to kilometers again Celsius I can do
that as well and pick my country when
you first load the program it will ask
you which country you live in in which
language you prefer so I'd ok and close
and it has a large array of countries to
choose from so that's a nice feature so
going down options go to about you can
see you let's get tips &amp;amp; help so if you
have any trouble using this program when
you first start up it'll actually give
you a run-through of everything that the
program entails so that's pretty nice
and go down to more and you can run GPS
just like the clicking this button this
is pretty much exactly the same as this
little button control panel right here
so that's always nice so that is GPS
today and it is a free program i will
post a link in pocket calm as to how to
get this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
