why I'm using an iPhone let alone
reviewing it I come from a long history
with Android as my daily driver but let
me make one thing clear I don't have any
allegiances to any one operating system
just because I've made a career of
talking about one particular operating
system doesn't mean I'm closed-minded
I've actually used iPhones in the past
and I have said on multiple occasions
that it is a perfectly fine ecosystem
it's got quirks but it's undeniably
accessible and useful for just about
anyone what really matters is what you
need from your phone but no matter where
you lie on the spectrum you owe it to
yourself to give the new iPhones a
proper look this is PocketNow and I'm
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and this is my review of the iPhone 10's
max brought to you by Wix I have the Max
Edition because I'm a glutton for
monetary punishment okay jokes aside I
thought it would be a good idea to get
the version that is the most different
from previous generations especially
compared to the iPhone 10 and compared
to its non s predecessor the phone
retains much of the originals look and
feel I have the gold Edition that might
be closer to rose gold than anything
else because this backing evokes more of
a peach or pink shade rather than the
rich shine that is better found on the
sides and keeping with the 10 there is
no home button no fingerprint reader no
headphone jack and that notch is up top
speaking of which it's definitely all
face ID now for biometrics with no
foreseeable return of the fingerprint
reader thankfully it is fast enough to
be reliable even if putting on a hat
confused it a couple of times so it's an
iPhone 10 blown up to a bigger size for
the most part that means good things for
people who want even more scream 6.5
inches on this AMOLED screen is cut a
little bit by that notch but even if
you're not a fan of the extra bits up
top you have to admit that this is a lot
of screen it also means that the phone
might not be the easiest to handle for
some people let's face it gone are the
days of the small flagship phone I'm
still stubborn enough to try and balance
the phone on my pinkie and when using
the phone in my right hand it's just a
chore to reach the other side either to
hit the back button or to swipe to go
backward reach ability is still here and
easily trigger now by swiping down on
the bottom bar and I've had to lean on
that more than I've expected watching
all forms of media is great on this big
screen even when the notch slightly cuts
into the content
never actually gets in the way though so
I can essentially look past it YouTube
Netflix HBO even Instagram feeds look
pretty great on this display that is
just shy of quad-hd resolution I have
played a lot of mobile games new and old
on this phone already to the latest
release by Nintendo for example drag
Elia Lost is a colorful and vivid game
that shines through and thank goodness
it's easy to play with one hand fast I
have to admit iOS is fast on this phone
I've always known that iOS is Spartan
made but having used this phone
exclusively as my daily driver since the
phone was released I can feel the
optimization of Apple's operating system
getting better thanks to the Bionic 812
this seven nanometer process is making
its mark on the performance aspect and
thus moving around the operating system
is an absolute breeze even if to me it's
not the most exciting part of this phone
after all once you get past the
operating system it's all about the apps
right the App Store has been my second
home lately because there is an
unfortunate truth about the app gap
between iOS and Android simply put there
are some apps on iOS that never make it
to Android and sometimes you really wish
they did I have yet to find an
experience that is so exclusive to iOS
though that I would get a pen v on an
Android phone but I have to mention that
while many iOS apps are a high point of
the experience that this Google guy
appreciates how all of the familiar
applications I've been faithfully
brought to the iPhone I just couldn't
get away from Google Calendar and Google
Maps in particular and then there are
the cameras not too much has changed on
the external side when it comes to the
rear cameras instead there's the
inclusion of smart HDR which works to
make sure every shot is well exposed due
to multi frame processing still you get
dual 12 megapixel cameras with a normal
focal length and then a telephoto two
times ooh Apple continues to do well in
the automatic shooting Department these
new iPhones even shoot when you're not
hitting the shutter buttons so when you
do hit the trigger there's no lag this
enhancement is definitely palpable
compared to the galaxy note 9 that takes
a little longer to release the shutter
in some cases the iPhone is quite
literally a snap it is also the same
auto camera that most people can rely on
those seeking more control can download
one of the many camera apps in the App
Store but at least in the main app you
can just hit the button and smart HDR
will try to make the shot as good as
possible that will mean different things
to different people though a couple
things are obvious Apple doesn't go too
too far with the saturation on its
photos and smart HDR can roughly
translate to less contrast it does some
real work on the shadows and if you're
trying to capture a more contrasted
scene you might have to remember to turn
off the HDR portrait mode returns with
the portrait lighting effects coming out
of beta but how they turn out is up to
your personal tastes the lines are still
a bit of a hit or miss situation and
aside from contour lighting I don't
really see many of these effects being
used in a practical daily sense what has
been added is a depth slider that can
customize the bouquet blur effect it
works well enough as long as your
subject is defined when shooting but it
is trying very hard to emulate a real
aperture effect cranking the perceived
aperture setting could make more of the
scene blurred out than you would like
now as a vlogger video recording is
actually a highlight of this phone even
if some manual controls would have been
more than appreciated what I can say is
that the slow-motion mode in particular
includes 120 frames per second recording
which I love many phones are moving to
240 outright for slo-mo and that
introduces a lot of flicker from
incandescent lighting it's great to have
the option between both I also notice
that the focus doesn't jump around a ton
while shooting and the auto exposure is
smooth enough to not be jarring when
it's changing however the white balance
can go a bit crazy depending on your
scene taking the step to lock the focus
and exposure can go a long way with
video finally the front-facing camera
yes there seems to be some smoothening
going on when taking portrait mode shots
which some people will like and others
will hate I think it's basically coming
down to whether or not you like the
beauty modes that can be found in
Android phones really this move doesn't
come off as really all that strange to
me considering half the world loves
their beauty modes and their beauty apps
but here in the West we tend to
prioritize detail over airbrushing so I
get where the reactions are coming from
ok so so far this outlines the mostly
positive experience I've had with the
iPhone Tenace max but not everything
that shines is gold let's talk about the
price yes this is the expensive version
of this year's iPhones and that will be
a hard pill for some to swallow it's not
overpriced because of the phone itself
though if the overall experience is to
be measured it is a top-tier smartphone
and definitely the best that Apple has
ever made but what you get with the
phone is simply not enough take audio
for example you get ear pods in the case
but no adapter for your existing
probably been
headphones and if you want to get what
is considered the quintessential Apple
audio experience you'll have to shell
out even more money for the wireless air
pots
battery life is perfectly fun with the
10s Macs in fact I have been able to get
pretty much all of my days through
without having to break out the power
bank and wireless charging is easy to
lean on but you get a regular charger
and cable in the box with the fast
charger bits requiring even more money
compare this to other smart phones that
come with arguably better in box
headphones and many of that come with
fast chargers not to mention any other
accessories that make the iPhone
unboxing experience now feel much more
sterile and emptier than it used to if
we're going to pay the most to get the
best Apple seems to believe that the
phone alone justifies it and honestly
that's the hard part figuring out if the
somewhat larger battery in the largest
screen are worth the premium our own
brand and minimun outlined it in his
video the screen is not used to its full
potential
outside of media consumption there are
no multitasking options or dual windows
that take advantage of all that real
estate and even ios itself feels a
little blown up just to fit the space
and finally I just have to mention one
final thing about iOS it is a perfectly
capable operating system but I can't
help but feel that it's just a little
bit boring I get it it is accessible to
literally all users and I myself am in a
privileged position and that I can use
and thus compare both iOS and Android
but the feeling I can't quite shake
about iOS on the daily is that the way I
use this phone is the way that many many
other people maybe even everyone else
uses it I have tried to get some
customization in there in the ways that
I could but maybe one day we'll get a
version of this operating system that
puts a bit more personalization power in
the hands of the user this collaboration
between JV and pocket now has a back
about pocketnow.com where you can get a
ton of news and commentary via the
written word it's been around for a long
time and much of that work could have
been made easier by the tools found at
wicks if you're looking to make your own
website easy drag and drop tools and
hundreds of templates from the geniuses
over at waiks make it easy you don't
even have to have any coding experience
just bring your creativity and Wix will
help you do the rest find out more about
Wix the powerful website builder and
host in the links in the description
down below and so there you have it a
phone that is as easy to love as it is
to hate
because it is one of the speediest most
reliable easiest smartphone experiences
you can have while simultaneously asking
even more of you and maybe your wallet
if you find yourself wanting more if you
have the iPhone 10 you might not find
enough to really pull that $1,100
minimum out of your pocket if you are
using an earlier iPhone their new line
is a compelling prospect and finally if
you're coming from any other phone this
is the competition and it is fierce in
multiple ways
I ought line in a video on my own
channel the types of users this phone
might be for so you can check that out
over at youtube.com slash Joshua Vergara

watching and I really appreciate all of
you being as open-minded with me in this
review as I have been with my experience
of the iPhone there's really not a whole
lot for me to complain about with this
phone there just a couple of things I
can't really shake but that doesn't
change the fact that this is a really
premium device both in price but also in
experience keep it tuned to pocket now
and also check out my channel as well
