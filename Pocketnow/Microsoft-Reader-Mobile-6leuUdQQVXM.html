pocket comm and today I'm going to show
you a new program brought to us by
Microsoft and the program is called
Microsoft Reader and I'll go into that
right now and it's pretty much just an
e-book reader on your Windows mobile
device but it actually has some pretty
powerful features it allows you to copy
and to add pictures and to do some other
cool features on this program so I
downloaded a free ebook of The
Adventures of Peter Pan from Microsoft's
website and there's a whole bunch of
free ebooks if you just want to read a
free ebook that's a that's a good way to
go but of course you can always buy the
other one and if you're considering
buying a Kindle or some sort of Sony
Reader you might want to reconsider
because you already have the power in
the palm of your hand with your windows
mobile device so I'm just going to go
into this book right now and it's just
the Adventures of Peter Pan we'll open
it up and click on the title and that
will open the e-book so to go down to a
page it will also work on a standard
windows mobile device if you have a
keypad you can either push three or four
to go to the next page or previous page
but on this device all you have to do is
at the bottom and it'll continue to go
to the next page and it's actually
pretty clear you can also change the
size of the font so if you don't have
the best vision in the world you can
also change the sum of the size to
either larger a medium or a small font
this is the small font right here and as
you can see it goes through the entire
book and to go back a page all you have
to do is hit the 3 button and it'll go
back to the beginning okay so we can
also click on return if we want to but
let me open this up again real quick so
I'm going to show you some of the cool
features on this let's say that you want
to highlight something so all you have
to do is select it and it will
automatically open this window so you
can add a bookmark add highlight add a
text note at a drawing you can also view
picture if there's a picture there you
can find certain text in the in the in
the book or you can copy the text so if
you wanted to let's say you wanted to do
a report or something and you needed
something from this book you can just
copy it quickly and easily on this
little box right here so we'll just
close that go back okay so here are some
of the settings we can go into
so we can also change the size so as you
can see there's something written in
Latin down here so we can change it to
medium or large depending on what you
prefer go to the next settings just
click on page go to more settings we can
change the way our booklet marks work
can change your highlights or text notes
or drawings just going next
and you may need to activate your
Microsoft Reader for Windows Mobile
devices because some ebooks are
protected like mp3s for instance when
you download an mp3 let's say you
download something from iTunes is there
actually a protected file that will only
work on your iTunes account it's kind of
like the same thing with this so as you
can see we're all done with our settings
so we'll go back and if you need any
help information there's quite a vast
help manual that you can search through
so if I just wanted to search for
something like oh I don't know let's try
page click on this and hit click search
and it will search through the e-reader
help page so as you can see we we go
through the entire guide so that that's
pretty nice you can actually search
through any help so if you have anything
you can click on something and as you
can see we just got to page by page so
Oh Chloe back so another cool feature
about this program is that anytime you
can go back to either the previous book
table contents or your library if you're
done reading so if I want to just go to
my library I can go to there and it will
load my library and I only have two
books and right now but the Microsoft
reader uses a dot Li T extension so any
ebook with that extension will work on
this program so I will post a link on
pocket not a comma so how to get this
the program is free and rather small
only about two megabytes thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
