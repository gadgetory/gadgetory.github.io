office mobile on windows phone 7 to hear
it this is the office live tile and
click here this opens the office hub and
as we showed before office of combined
snow taking with OneNote my documents on
the phone and SharePoint way to connect
to SharePoint there are several ways I
can either open a URL so click here and
then type in the URL if I know
or I can also click on URL that I
receive an email so if you receive a
link directly to a SharePoint site or a
document and shareable I can click it
and a little bit in office mobile here
but in the office hover then once you've
opened the SharePoint site it will show
up here in the list of different
sharepoint sites that I have
and then here are all the different
information types that I have in
SharePoint so for example I could have
announcements that are featured on the
on the side or on the intranet site and
look at those the most common the most
common object go within a SharePoint
site that I most people are interested
in are the document libraries so here
we've got my fourth coffee document
library as you can see I've got
different office document types here
Word Excel PowerPoint and also one node
one of this new in office mobile for
windows phone 7 at least the fact that i
can download and sync one no documents
that are stored on sharepoint so i could
for example take this one who'd notebook
it will open it up in a in the notebook
with one of the clients here on the
phone so here's a here's a note story to
share points that i'm now having a look
at it just as with any other office
document on sharepoint i could just add
some
add some text here
so this is a shared notebook stored on a
shirt sharepoint server so I'm now
I now save that back up to my SharePoint
site automatically saved would you have
to sing well I i saved it
and I think for downloading though you
have to press sync as i'm done i'm gonna
show you things can come down or go back
into the sharepoint sites to show new
notes or if you show
and so here I've my word documents or
Excel spreadsheet or this PowerPoint
presentation on
that again I can I can go into I can
open up and in PowerPoint presentation
shift row show up in landscape and then
here for example I could these are my
speaker notes but I should also be able
to edit edit my slide here
so if I wanted to
it's here and these are now our clock
fridays and only edit the text of yes in
a PowerPoint you can at this point only
edit the text and move stuff and you
rearrange it slide you can rearrange
slides so if i go into mix this if i go
into the outline slide i should be able
to rearrange or move slides around
now I do that
comedian eight modes
so Americans in slide and I can
this light up to another account later
go
I can save this
and save changes back up to cheer for me
that
similarly in Word and Excel I can make
edits to documents i can add comments to
the documents and then upload those
again
good sharepoint and finally the one one
last thing that I want to show is when I
hold down on any of these documents
there are additional features that
become available to me one of them is
sending a link so often I don't want to
send given that this documents on my
internets I don't want to send the
entire fire over again I just want to
send a link using email another thing
another option is to always keep a file
offline and so what's doing now is
downloading this file so i can take like
it's a my poor set of 10 files
presentation document spitter i always
want to have with me on the road i can
download those and yet it goes with me
even if I don't have any network access
so that time it's a quick overview of
sharepoint on office mobile unit
