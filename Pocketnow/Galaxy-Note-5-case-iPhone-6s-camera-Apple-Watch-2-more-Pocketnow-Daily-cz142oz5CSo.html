galaxy note5 to get more details of the
iphone 6s camera design and if you want
a moto 360 there is simply no better
time I'm hi Mary vetta and bear with me
as I try to record this video blooper
free this is pocket out daily the
official news today start with the Moto
360 you have to remember that the watch
is close to a refresh it was announced
the full year ago even though it was
launched much later but Motorola is
showing us that it's a little desperate
to get rid of existing stock it's now a
hundred and fifty dollars on the Google
store on Amazon even Motorola's own
store and if you want to know if I would
recommend this watch $150 I paid three
hundred dollars for this particular
stainless steel model and i would pay it
all over again i really love this watch
and speaking of smartwatches it seems
that Apple is already working on making
the next generation Apple watch thinner
lighter and brighter and let's hope they
don't make it thinner and lighter
because I really wish it were actually
larger but rumors have it that Apple is
already considering a brighter OLED
display as sapphire crystal Apple watch
owners are complaining about the fact
that it is not so bright in direct
sunlight then you would most likely look
at your watch it just loses its whole
purpose so stay tuned let's see what
Apple brings to this next OLED display
and for those of you to think that HTC
is done when it comes to flagships with
the one and nine or the one of nine plus
and see the company is already working
for a product this fall and it's
codename arrow and it seems that the
major deal about this product is that it
will have a substantially better camera
now we've been hearing this from hcc for
years let's just hope they figure it out
a company that is desperate to bring us
a better camera on its next-generation
iphone is Apple we've got some leaks
from Foxconn that shows us the blueprint
of the next generation iphones cameras
we have a 12 megapixel shooter at the
back that is apparently capable of not
only 4k video but slow motion video in
4k up to 240 frames per second which
should be really cool even more
interesting is that apparently we are
getting a 5 megapixel shooter /
front-facing camera which is something
important considering the 1.2 megapixel
camera we have now the phone should
already be in manufacturing or at least
very close so let's see if it's true and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day we've got some leaks from case
makers that show us of the galaxy s6
edge+ and the galaxy note 5 different
cases no there is no Galaxy Note edge 5
case and I am already getting stuck with
these names but it seems that these are
the two products that are coming and
judging by the similarities of the
galaxy note5 to the galaxy s6 edge+
sorry about that it seems that there
will be a change in design it seems that
it'll look a lot like the galaxy s6 in a
way which is interesting but it does
lead me to the question of the day would
you like a galaxy note5 of it came
without expandable storage and a
replaceable battery as we see on the
leaks as a probability given the designs
of molarity because in my case it would
totally kill the note lineup for me I
feel that the s6 edge+ should be that
phone for those people that want that
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case friends as always you know
