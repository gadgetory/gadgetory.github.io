iPhones again along with their crazy
price tags if you want the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 with 5g capabilities it
seems that there might be some hope for
you and Samsung seems to be reinventing
the knotch and some new patents that
were just leaked I'm high memory that
and is it Friday yet please say yes at
least lie to me about that this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals those of you in the
market for a project 5 device but Google
is now offering you $200 back if you go
for the Google pixel to excel $300 if
you go for the g7 or the LG be 35
obviously there is a catch the problem
is that you're not exactly sure when
you're gonna get your money back and
obviously this is credit and the credit
apparently won't be applied initially
it's all weird but you can learn more in
the description now let's talk about
Apple is we've got rumors that the
company doesn't want to invest heavily
just in Apple music apparently they want
to create their own video platform to
compete with Netflix Amazon video and
Hulu and all these services out there
now exactly sure if the company is
planning to buy out any company in order
to do that which would make sense seems
that they want to start their own thing
and they've got a ton of original
content that they've already invested on
for Apple music which I don't know how
that made sense but anyways now for
those of you that are afraid of Samsung
taking the plunge into knotch territory
I don't think it's gonna happen but
apparently the company is working on
some sort of a notch now this is not
going to be at the top of the device
apparently the company is working on a
way to put it to the side and if they do
it in the side then apparently that will
allow for the side vessels to get shrunk
even more there's a whole list of
patents over what the company is
planning and obviously this doesn't
necessarily mean that it'll happen
and speaking of Samsung we've got some
trusted sources claiming that there will
be a 5 g variant of the Galaxy S 10 at
some point for those of you that
remember back in the day when the Galaxy
s4 was launching there was an LTE a
variant I know that was a long time ago
but it wouldn't be the first time that
s√°mi launches a couple of variants and
then later launches another with more
capabilities think of
it is 5g is a whole different animal
it's not like in the case of that lte-a
or it could be to a certain degree so
stay tuned that might be that buying the
Galaxy S 10 on launch won't be such a
good idea and finally the hot news today
have to do with iPhones yet again were
just a couple of days away from the
event and we hear two things number one
names of the other price tags from
sources claiming that the names will be
just iPhone for the entry-level less
expensive iPhone they will be costing
around seven hundred and ninety nine
bucks
either in Euros or in dollars then there
will be the iPhone XS 10s or whatever
they're gonna be calling that thing that
will be the one thousand dollar variant
and then if you want to go for the
iPhone X s max according to the rumors
that's a 11:50 I guess whatever the case
may be it seems that yeah these could
probably be the names they're weird let
us know in the comments what you think
about that and also keep in mind this
might be about that best time for you to
sell that current iPhone that you have
for you to consider any of the exiting
models and swapper has got a ton of
really great options either for you to
get the best value for your current
iPhone or for you to get the best deal
for an existing iPhone if you want to
upgrade if you could say that so anyways
leave us a comment down below over your
thoughts on the names of these possible
iPhones in addition to the price tag and
at the same time you can also find in
the link of the description for swap for
more details on what I just told you

news early or follow us I'm talking out
