pocketnow.com and this is the video
unboxing of the eatin glofish x800 this
is one of the few windows mobile
professional devices that has a vga
screen so let's get started okay package
this pretty well this all right very
nice box it's got some plastic on it
sharper smoother grass graphics with
high-resolution vga all right let's see
what we have here looks like a carrying
case smell test reveals that it is can't
decide I think it's leather it should be
whether it's a higher end device it's
got a metal a a magnetic clasp they're
all right stylus a battery of size
fifteen hundred and thirty milliamp
hours it's a pretty pretty big size
we've got a charger hopefully with an
international or a u.s. plug let's see
off the look for that up yup here it is
us plug then we've got a USB cable uses
mini USB that's good headphones and here
is the device put that down
and it looks like a screen protector yep
and okay so the screen the screen is
quite small actually relative to the to
the rest of the body there are a lot of
buttons let's take a look at the size of
this thing compared some other devices
remember the glofish x500 yeah they have
the exact same screen size they're
actually the same look to be the same
width and the same height also the same
thickness and the x the x 500 was a thin
device so you know this is pretty good
okay next to the 18t tilt but of course
the X 800 doesn't have a slide out
keyboard so that explains why it's it's
significantly thinner there and it's a
bit taller and wider and then the good
old iphone certainly has a much bigger
screen and is thinner of course and
taller interesting in hand it feels
pretty small it feels quite light right
now because I don't have the battery in
but we'll be back soon with more video
coverage of the X 800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
