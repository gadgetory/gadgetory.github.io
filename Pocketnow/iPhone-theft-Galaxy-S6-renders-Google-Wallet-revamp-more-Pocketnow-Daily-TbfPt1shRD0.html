significant changes over the last year
Google still focused on making mobile
payments work somehow and Sony seems
focused on making xperia shine but at
least in the entry-level sector I'm hi
mera mera and shouldn't it be that
Thursday's should be skippable this is
pocket out daily brought to you by
lynda.com let's begin today with what's
official starting with NVIDIA the
company has just sent out press
invitations for an event to happen on
March third no it's not going to happen
at number two you see it'll happen in
San Francisco and according to the
company this has everything to do with
gaming we were expecting something hot
to happen at CES and that wasn't the
case so let's see what Nvidia brings to
the table this time now let's talk about
Sony and media tech MediaTek processor
probably not our favorites but we gotta
admit that the the smart phones that are
being powered by it are extremely
affordable such as the case of the sony
xperia e for the company you know focus
on media tech hearing rumors from digit
times claimed that sony is going to
build a lot more media tech based
smartphones which is really interesting
sony has not really shine when it comes
to the high-end market but that doesn't
mean their smartphones are bad they're
probably the best out there and it seems
that the company is going to do the same
samsung thing focus on the entry level
it's here because apparently that's
where the money is if you thought the
google wallet was that it's far from the
case apparently google is working on
this new product code name fasho it's
Bluetooth enabled and you won't need NFC
it seems that you walk into a store the
store clerk will detect you through your
smartphone initials and you will be able
to pay everything wirelessly meaning it
seems you won't even need to walk to the
store clerk you'll just be able to do
anything wherever you are within the
store which is really interesting
hopefully it works and we are just a
couple of weeks away from mwc 2015 and
we get more and more leaks on the galaxy
s6 that's probably going to be one of
the hottest smartphones of the event
because it's a galaxy smartphone of
course but the design looks extremely
different to every other galaxy that
we've seen probably the face is the same
and then the back of everything is just
different look at the links in the
description we've got a ton of photos of
leaked renders of the phone the
schematics apparently are right and
probably the most interesting thing is
that the battery doesn't seem removable
let's see what we get and finally for
the very interesting news of the day
we've got the first statistics on
smartphone theft over the last couple of
years we know that the United States and
other countries have been enforcing
activation locks in order for thieves
not to want to steal smartphones because
they just won't be able to use them
Apple was one of the first companies to
use this activation lock cable that iOS
7 and it's been bundled into iCloud and
find my iphone it's really cool you try
to wipe a phone or whatever iphone or
ipad and then if you try to activate it
you can't without the iCloud password
which is really cool but interesting
statistics show us that after this was
implemented a theft had dropped 40
percent in cities like San Francisco
twenty five percent in New York and a
staggering fifty percent in London alone
and just to give you an idea 1.6 million
smartphones were stolen in 2012 and in
certain cities like for example San
Francisco fifty percent of all crime
cases were smart phone related so it
leads me to the question of the day have
you ever had your smartphone stolen and
shares your experience what phone wasn't
an everything in my case it happened
years ago anybody remember a company
named eat n the e10 glofish something
that was a smartphone that got stolen

good news hopefully this continues to
drop in years going forward and folks if
