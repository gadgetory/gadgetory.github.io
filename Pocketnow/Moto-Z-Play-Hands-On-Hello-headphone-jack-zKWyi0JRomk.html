surprise because in many ways it's the
Moto Z that many people always want it
if you're wondering what makes it hot
we've got just the video for you I'm
high medal inventor with pocket now here
ready for 2016 and let's talk about it
all of pocket now Ziva 2016 coverage is
brought to you by ex-con Global
disclaimer folks we actually received an
early review unit of the Moto Z play but
decided to use it for Adam lanes recent
true zoom moto mod review I highly
suggest you read it for added context
moto Z play is the third of three new
Moto's but providing a different focus
than its siblings the Z play is slightly
taller and wider than the Moto Z's in
addition to far thicker and heavier now
call this a premium mid ranger given the
Snapdragon 62:5 CPU and three gigs of
ram along with a 1080p display all
specifications which you will find
better on the other moto Z's the camera
might have a smaller hump and more
megapixels than the Z at 16 but there is
less aperture at F 2.0 compared to F 1.8
and then there are the features where
it's almost identical starting with its
iconic and reflective design along with
the water-repellent nano coating and to
make matters better it supports every
single moto mod then it's Z siblings you
can even say that the magnets are
stronger on the Z play given the fact
that certain mods actually don't wiggle
around as they do on other Z variants
this allows you to take the Moto Z play
to a whole other dimension of
expandability which is optional
depending on your needs and then there
are the things that the Z play does
better than its siblings like the case
of the larger 35 10 milliamp hour
battery to power less pixels with a
1080p display but last but not least the
return of the much renowned headphone
jack for those of you that were
complaining why should you consider the
Moto Z play well because if you want a
moto Z that supports moto mods it
doesn't burn a hole in your wallet this
might be the best option but again our
full review will report more
instead of paying horrible roaming fees
when traveling abroad or the hassle of
buying another sim why not try a smarter
solution
