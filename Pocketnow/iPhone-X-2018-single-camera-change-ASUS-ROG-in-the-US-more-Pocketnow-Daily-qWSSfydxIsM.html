iPhone 10 2018 it looks like the real
deal if you thought that the oneplus 6
sold fast trust me Xiaomi just that
showed the company how to do it and if
you get your hands on iOS 12 beta well
it just went live I'm Jaime Mehta Rivera
and believe it or not I who we just got
here to Milan and now we have to pack to
go to Frankfurt so this place of jetlag
has just gotten worse the lighting is
terrible big of a deal this is PocketNow
daily beat official news today was
inexistent for some reason it seems that
rumours are the name of the game right
now for those of you wondering what is
going to happen with that a soos ROG
phone you know that gaming phone that
plants to give competition to the razer
device well as it turns out the company
is already teasing a possible launch in
the United States we don't have any
dates or anything but if you're into
gaming that phone is pretty much it lay
beyond it so stay tuned for that
now let's talk about Nokia as we have a
lot of admiration for what hmd global is
doing with the company and the company
continues pushing we now hear that the
company is going to push out a software
update that's going to bring fishel and
lock features that will complement the
fingerprint scanner to pretty much all
of the mid to high-end full lineup that
we see from Nokia what are we going to
see over the rest of the year from the
company it's hard to tell there weren't
many launches later but if they're
already pushing for facial on lock
features at that price tag with all
those Android features oh my god these
phones are getting really good and for
those of you that wanted to try I owe
s12 I actually thought it twice and have
been waiting for the public beta it is
now live for those of you that want to
give it a try obviously you know it's a
beta so there are things that might not
necessarily work the most important part
is there are a couple of really cool
features when it comes to parental
controls and actually just the control
of using your iPhone with iOS 12 so I
can't wait to give it a try we will
report back and if you thought that
oneplus has broken records with the
sales of the one plus six oh my god
let's talk about show me that me eight
that looks pretty much like an iPhone 10
has sold the same 1 million units in not
22 days but 18 days
it is proven that Xiaomi has a lot of
pull I was at their event in Shanghai
for the me mix 2s they've got a lot of
fans a ton of fanbase and it's clear
that they're onto something they just
made a showcase in the United States
with a products and yet they're not
selling them there so this tells you a
lot about what the future of Xiaomi will
be and finally the most important news
today has to do with the iPhone 10 2018
but the LCD variant for those of you
wondering exactly what's going to
differentiate this phone aside from the
fact that it's got an LCD display we've
got case makers already chiming in and
we see things that we confirm pretty
much in the CAD renders in the past
where it seems you won't be getting a
dual camera on this phone that's
probably the way that Apple is going to
keep the price tag down if you could say
that's going to be keeping the price tag
dad as we hear that it's gonna be over
600 bucks
we do see a notch at the front we do see
other design elements of the iPhone 10
but in today's question let us know I
mean in a world of dual cameras and with
pretty much every other smartphone out
there bringing dual cameras up to the
mid to high-end range do you think it's
a good idea for Apple to go single
camera lens on this one alright or do
you think that this is probably just a
fad cuz uh I don't know we'll see so
long as the camera delivers I don't care
but the iPhone hasn't really been the
best camera out there in my opinion for
the last couple of generations leave us
