windows-based habit amazon's next Kindle
Fire lineup specs get leads and it seems
that the Nokia Lumia 1020 has been off
to a slow start
I'm Jaime Rivera and you know I'm gonna
vote for Tuesday's to be days off
because mondays are stressful enough
this is PocketNow daily let's start off
with some sad no kid news as everybody
here at pocket now wants to Lumia 1020
we all do but as it turns out apparently
the market is not behaving the same
apparently the phone is not really the
best selling phone anywhere which is odd
since phones really are bestsellers
during their first days and then they
obviously decline them as it turns out
the phone's not charted anywhere not on
Amazon not on AT&amp;amp;T and the behavior is
just odd so obviously we're waiting for
numbers coming from no care AT&amp;amp;T but
it's really sad this phone being what it
is is not really what Windows Phone and
Nokia need to pull them out of the water
let's see what happens
now speaking of Nokia we've got more
rumors of the company working on
building a windows-based tablet the
model rx 114 apparently is already being
showing off on benchmark tests and even
though we can't obviously judge of that
tablet is ever gonna make the light of
day the sad news scares that that thing
runs Windows RT so anyways and just how
bad is Windows RT well we know that a
SUSE is pretty much the second best
seller when it comes to arm-based
tablets after Apple and as it turns out
the company's CEO has just confirmed
that they will not be building anymore
Windows RT tablets they have confirmed
that nobody is wanting this operating
system which is just funny cuz you can't
really tell the difference visually
between RT and Windows 8 and it seems
that consumers do understand what
they're buying has apparently they're
vivo tabs never picked up so yeah that's
how bad Windows RT is let's see and
let's hope that Microsoft fixes this in
future updates now let's talk about some
Samsung news as well first of all
benchmark companies have detected that
samsung has been faking the benchmark
results of the galaxy s4 and just think
about this I mean apparently the s4 the
Exynos version detects when it's being
tested and it boosts the GPU performance
in order to obviously show itself to be
better which is odd since the phone is
good on its own and then on the other
hand we've got some other news of the
company actually working on an
eight-core processor coming in the
future that will actually use the 8
cores all the time so no more faking it
see and finally for the well for the
interesting news of the day we've got
some lake specifications of the future
Kindle Fire lineup well there's gonna be
called HD or whatever it's gonna be
called we've got a Snapdragon 800
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM and a lot
of other high-end specifications coming
to this tablet lineup links down below
in the description for full details on
every single spec on the list but you
know anyways that leads me to the
question of the day I mean does any of
you actually care about these Kindle
Fire tablets because in my particular
case honestly any large tablet
regardless of how well I can route it is
a worthless tablet but leave us a
comment down below do you actually care
about these Kindle Fire tablets because
the market doesn't seem to care that
much of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's helpful
