for pocket now and mwc is right around
the corner we'll be getting the full
scoop on a number of major smartphone
announcements but we wanted to take a
couple minutes here to focus on a brand
it's been struggling a little bit with
its own brand identity of late and
that's LG rounding up what we know what
we don't know what we hope for and what
we're a little nervous about for the LG
G 6 immediately one of the biggest
talking points LG is showcasing is the
bigger screen in the smaller body we're
pretty confident about these numbers a
5.7 inch display with a resolution of 28
80 x 1440 if you're one of those tech
publications that's still calling that
an 18 x 9 screen maybe try reducing
those fractions that's like pre-algebra
stuff the screen will be twice as tall
as it is why that's a two by one aspect
ratio this will still be an LCD but LG
is rumored to have been working on
improvements to light transmission and
contrast alongside this taller and
skinnier display we should also see the
requisite shaping of bezel keeping that
smaller hand feel is going to be
important for the model of LG which
typically is not phablet territory now
we're all hoping for a little of that
magic the g2 brought to the table and
delivering a larger screen size and an
impressively small form factor and of
course putting big specs and shrinking
down that overall form factor LG has
been very vocal about the reliability of
the phone and the battery performance of
the device the company's still trying to
work off that negative vibe from the
boot looping issues at the g4 and the
v10 suffered and of course we all have
battery issues on the mind following the
note 7 moving over to performance we
probably will see a Qualcomm Snapdragon
820 one so the disappointment of LG fans
out there it's a minor spec bump over
the Qualcomm a 20 and we probably won't
see the Qualcomm 835 the next generation
chipset in the g6 one of those timing
issues is welcome sorts out fabrication
issues with the smaller chipset knowing
that Samsung is going to eat up a huge
chunk of that initial batch and it's
potentially also a cost savings measure
we don't fully know yet the extent of
all of the improvements at the a35 going
to bring to the table and the a21 has
proven to be a pretty reliable chipset
for the pixel and the one plus 3t we
also shouldn't underestimate what hells
he's been able to do in the past with
the less powerful chipset eking out
tremendous performance in the v10 in the
g4 using the welcome 808 instead of be
more powerful but hotter
and more inconsistent running a 10
getting back to the g6 we're also
expecting to see a killer headphone amp
and DAC combination in this phone for
audio fans in North America the g5 was a
supreme disappointment as the built-in
headphone jack was kind of mediocre and
we never got proper support for the
add-on friend DAC for this phone the v
20 was a revelation for fans of higher
quality audio and folks using nicer
headphones getting that Hardware built
in natively on a g-series phone will be
an excellent talking point for what
differentiates an LG phone from the rest
of the market we're absolutely expecting
the g6 to inherit the dual camera
shooters from the b20 so the
disappointment of some of the folks who
follow our videos that means moving from
a native aspect ratio of 16 by 9 on the
g five to four by three on the g6 what
remains to be seen is whether or not the
g series phones will inherit some of
those more advanced photo and video
features found on the v series phones
with a more powerful tips that there's
absolutely no reason why the g6 couldn't
inherit manual video controls and
expanding on some of those microphone
and audio controls that we love on the
b20 less artificial more intelligent and
that means we're probably going to be
seeing google assistant show up on the
g6 in fact LG is billing it as the first
non pixel phone to have it built into
the operating system we really would
have expected more devices by now would
include assistant but if any
manufacturer has the relationship with
Google to really push that AI envelope
it probably would be LG especially after
their recent run with Android wear one
thing we're not entirely clear on the
back casing design we've seen several
weeks photos pointing to a brushed metal
exterior rear and a really high quality
leaked photo pointing to a glossy back
for the g6 and both phones might be real
we also have some other rumors pointing
to a premium option for the g6 and maybe
that's where the glossy back comes into
play that certain markets might be
picking up the g6 with LG pay which is
very similar to Samsung pay and having
different coils on the back of the phone
and other markets might be picking up a
g6 with wireless charging built in both
of those technologies a little more
difficult to implement on a metal back
phone regardless which type of back the
phone head were pretty confident that
this phone is going to swap a user
removable battery for enhanced water
resistance will have to say good
bye to that fan favorite feature but the
trade-off is a pretty solid one knowing
that your phone will better survive
spills or being completely submerged
underwater what we don't yet know is if
the g6 will include the enhanced drop
resistance found on the b20 if this is
going to be something of a sister phone
to the v34 which is found only in Japan
that mil-spec 810g drop in shock
resistance would be a pretty excellent
feature to include alongside the
enhanced water resistant and of course
the most important details to wrap up
will be pricing and availability right
now rumors are pointing to a March 9th
launch in South Korea with the American
market following almost a month later on
april seven this would still put LG
ahead of the proposed timetable for
samsung's next generation galaxies but
it's close enough that there's a danger
of people playing wait and see before
putting their money down on a phone like
the g6 so long as consumers know exactly
what these products are going to cost
and when they will be able to get their
hands on them that'll be a step in the
right direction for this company the
smartphone industry is still feeling
that gap left by the note 7 and LG has a
timing window here to win over some
hearts in mind for consumers competition
is key so let's hope LG is able to take
advantage of those opportunities and of
course we want to hear from you what
rumors do you think are most plausible
about the LG G six so far what do you
hope to see inside LG's next-generation
g-series phone and what would convince
you to switch teams if you're currently
using a different manufacturers products
