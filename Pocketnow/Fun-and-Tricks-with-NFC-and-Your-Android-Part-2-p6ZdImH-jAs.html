cool things you could do if you were
running CyanogenMod and had an
nfc-enabled phone switching profiles and
well some other cool stuff but what if
you're not running a custom ROM what
cool things can you do with NFC chips
I'm Joe Levi this is PocketNow let's go
take a look so the first thing that I
want to mention is not all NFC stickers
or tags are created equal this one over
here cost me about a dollar and a
quarter dollar and a half it is I paid a
little bit more because it's an outdoor
compatible sticker so you peel off the
backing and you have a nice adhesive
back there it's kind of tacky not too
much but it sticks really well and on
the front you have this nice vinyl cover
you can kind of see it's probably not
going to show through on the video you
can see where the microchip is kind of
where the traces to the antenna are and
it's a little bit flexible so if you
wanted to put it on a curved surface you
could do that now this overall is very
nice except the chip that's inside it
can only handle up to 46 bytes not
kilobytes bytes relatively small still
you can do cool stuff with it you can
put CyanogenMod profiles on it like we
showed you in the last video if you
missed that click the link right there
but you can't put say your business card
other than some very basic information
web URL not a problem plain text as long
as it's not too much your business card
if it's a really basic one you bet what
you need is something a little bit more
beefy than that that's what this is sort
of essentially the same thing again
sticky back like that this is a hard
kind of PVC it's got a nice Android logo
on it and this one comes from tags for
Droid comm about the same price a dollar
and a half a piece here but this not
flexible in the slightest
all the stuff inside it should be a
little bit more durable because it's not
as thin as the vinyl covered one over
here but it also can carry up to seven
hundred and sixteen bytes
again that's bytes now I ran into some
issues putting my business card over on
here my v card because it's got a
picture associated with it you know when
people call I like to see their picture
that's because it's part of my contact
or their contact information in my phone
well my contact I want to do the same
thing but pictures are too big in fact
with my picture it was about 7,300 bytes
a little bit more than that so as long
as I take my picture out I'm great you
can do it just fine so let's see what
kinds of cool things we can do for the
purpose of this example I'm going to put
this one aside and we'll just use this
new fangled one but we're gonna need an
app there are two apps that I want to
show you today the first one is called
tag writer we'll go right into that and
it essentially does exactly what you'd
expect it to do it has I'm actually in
the professional view right now which
gives me a few more menu options you can
toggle that by going into your
preferences but I can scan a QR code and
convert that into an NFC data set and
then store that to an NFC chip kind of
cool I can share an NFC data set just
device to device I can look at the
history of what I've done I've got some
tools tools are really helpful because I
can erase I can full erase I can do all
kinds of stuff
full erase is the same as a race but it
overwrites with random data so let's go
ahead and do that here I've written
something on to that let's securely
erase the content and just do that keep
it right there
it erases and overwrites I believe three
or four times and realises the the chip
now you see that this is a My Fair tag
that's the type it does have seven
hundred and sixteen bytes and the the
previous content was something else
which I don't even know what that is but
we're all done very cool these chips
come unformatted so just like a floppy
disk way back in the day that we had to
format you may want to come in here I
just do an erase and that initializes it
and everything has been just fine
couple things otherwise that you can do
once you've got a an NFC chip programmed
you may want to write protect that there
are a couple ways that you can do it you
can either do a soft protect which is
simply setting it as read-only it's like
on your computer you've got that
read-only flag on your file attributes
well if you want to write to it you just
take that check mark out and update it
and you're done so that's what that is
you can reuse the chips over and over
and over again but it's going to have an
extra level of protection that says hey
this is right protected are you sure you
want to override it yes okay and then it
does it and then you've got permanent
protect permanent is permanent it will
lock the contents permanently into
read-only they cannot be changed at all
if you're distributing these you may
want to do that permanent but I'd
recommend you experiment first before
you go in and do some permanent stuff
because the tags aren't cheap and then
of course we have clean so you can just
factory reset the tag right there and
that's in the Tools menu so over here we
can read and view the content from an
nfc-enabled item let's do that with the
tag that we just erased see what it says
content is empty just like that alright
so we could read something else or we
can move on to something else we'll move
on let's go ahead and create and write
we'll open this up you can see some of
the stuff that I've done ok and here is
my contact I've already created this so
let's go ahead and tap that I can write
multiple times I can protect it I can
choose if I want to confirm the
overwrite which is kind of just a pain
and then it goes an extra step further
it says based on this which is 713 bytes
it'll work on any one of these the
Mifare classic 1k which is what I'm
using the DESFire which holds a bit more
the Mifare classic 4k yada yada yada and
on and on and on if I wanted to put my
picture in my business card I could use
this which is seven point six K
roughly I don't have that they're more
expensive so we're just going to use
that one but it's nice that this program
tells you what chips you can write to
and which ones you can't for example let
me come back to this other one remember
that one really small let's go ahead and
try and write to it so we'll say next
got my sticker down there put that there
and nope can't do it store failed
because I don't know it doesn't tell us
so let's go ahead and try that again
come back over here we'll write this
next see if it gives us a better message
this time around
and right there store failed because the
data set is too large so this was not
initialized first when I set it up and
tried and it failed it initialized the
chip write it again which we did there
and it said oh hey oh no you can't do
that because it's too big okay so let's
go to a bigger chip that's that one and
let's go back and write the contact
again this will take a minute because
it's a little bit bigger but there you
go
it's already in there and everything's
great now when I scan this put my phone
on it again I don't have to run in the
app I just have to have NFC turned on of
course I have to have an NFC enabled
device to be able to do that but it will
then ask me which address book I want to
store this in I have to address books my
gmail and my exchange server so it'll
ask me which one and then right there
I've got that business card already put
in so really kind of nice let's go ahead
and erase this again that's under tools
so in tools we're just gonna do a quick
erase that and just like that it's
erased it does backup the content so if
you did that on accident you can quickly
and easily restore it really kind of
nice but that's not the coolest thing
you can go ahead and do other stuff I
can get back in there for you if we want
to go to Joe Levi dot
we can write Jolie viacom as a URL just
like that and then when I come in here
and scan that it automatically fires my
browser and puts that URL in the address
bar launches it up for me just fine
I don't have Wi-Fi turned on so it's
taking a little bit longer to do that
overall pretty cool you can also go in
and do some some other cool stuff you
can see down here I've put in a
different contact I put in some plain
text with sending that to my wife wasn't
that sweet of me
and just you know other cool stuff but
there's something else really cool that
I want to show you and that's another
app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
