might extend to three for the next
iPhone there are some sketchy invites
for the oneplus event to be happening
apparently soon and Spotify and Alexa
may be coming together in your vehicle
very soon
I'm high-mettled Iveta and vehicle you
forgot the joke this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with
interesting developments is PayPal has
just brought up features like FDIC
production in addition to the fact that
the company is even working on getting
its own ATM service why because the
company wants to start working into
becoming a bank so much so that it's
partnering with banks in order to be
able to provide usual Bank services you
can learn more about everything you
might be getting if you're interested in
the description now let's talk about HTC
we don't know exactly when we're getting
the you 12 or you 12 plus or whatever it
is that we're getting but we do have
some links of a possible box for these
devices it seems ip68 water and dust
resistant this coming in addition it
seems that there will be dual SIM
features and at least one of these
phones in addition to pretty much other
things that we've heard the most
interesting one being that there is edge
sense to then I never used that sense
one so I can't wait to see exactly how
that's gonna improve anything now let's
move the spotlight over to Spotify the
company has literally taken the
spotlight for the last couple of weeks
with things like its IPO now the company
is planning an event to happen on April
24 and we hear that it's gonna be about
hardware and software that comes to
hardware apparently there's a service
that will work in your car or a vehicle
product something interesting that it
also works with Alexa so it seems that
Spotify wants to get it to hardware but
it wants to compete with carplay I guess
not exactly sure stay tuned now let's
talk about oneplus in the oneplus 6 I
mean usually the phone the update gets
announced somewhere around June but this
time we've got some sketchy leaks that
show us press invitations to be
happening in the beginning of May
between the fifth and the 15 of events
to happen in try
one place has never launched phones and
well they've done virtual launches in
the past obviously those happened in
China but nobody was invited things like
that but yeah I mean the one plus 5t was
that in new york we're not exactly sure
what we're getting from one plus well we
do know is that it seems we're getting
the oneplus six early and finally the
very interesting news is they have to do
with the iPhone 10 but apparently not
necessarily the 2018 model
it seems that Cupertino has already
started working hard on the 2019 model
with things like the Huawei P 20 probe
bringing so much competition yes my unit
is waiting back in studio one I will
have it very soon I can't wait to try
out that forty megapixel camera I really
don't care about those triple sensors
but it seems that that's what Apple's
gonna do it seems that we are getting
three cameras on whatever iPhone 10
we're getting that we're getting insane
photography capabilities and that's all
great but in today's question let us
know I mean do you think that a triple
camera approach would be smart for Apple
to follow now that Huawei is doing this
I mean has the whole launch of the speed
20 pro made you consider a huawei p20
Pro or no leave us a comment down below
I again I've tried the demo units it is
insane it's great I think it would but
that's my opinion we would love to know
yours friends again if you want to get
to lose earlier for wasn't behind our
comment subscribe to our channel by
