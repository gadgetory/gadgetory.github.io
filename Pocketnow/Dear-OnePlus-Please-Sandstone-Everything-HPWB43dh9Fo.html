behaviors when using a smartphone this
this and this phones have become the
tool that you'll be using most
throughout the day they're fragile so a
case is usually the first accessory
you'll buy even if the beauty of the
design goes out the window and whatever
is not protected you'll have to be
wiping off constantly because it looks
gross I've always wished there was a
better way for the case to actually
blend with the phone or for a material
that didn't look horrible after a few
weeks of use if anything I'd say oneplus
is the only company that has gone a few
of these things right and their last
edition proves that we're heading in the
right direction I'm high metal even I
with pocket now and dear one plus can we
sandstone everything
the holidays in CES really made it hard
for us to get this video out to you we
actually filmed the unboxing experience
at CES given the hectic travel I had to
do what you get in the Box is pretty
much the same standard we've come to
expect from one plus a decent sized box
with premium materials the phone up and
center literature behind that includes a
sim ejector and transparent plastic case
a dash charger at the bottom with a USBC
cable now even if this phone was a
one-time thing that's sold out in
minutes there's a major reason why I
still chose to run this video and it's
really kind of a request like dear
oneplus could you do this more often
or pay even permanently I mean look at
this phone this is really cool the
sandstone white 1 + 5 T is simply
gorgeous the finish appears to be a
matte anodized Asian of the aluminum but
it's really a finish achieved by
painting and baking the shield numerous
times the result is this paper-like feel
that's got a few advantages for starters
this finishes and prone to smudges as
you'll notice on standard matte finishes
there's also a minor grip to it solving
the slippery issues that other phones
provide best of all it's different its
unique it reminds me of the sandstone
finish of the oneplus one or the oneplus
2 that was ditched for aluminum for
reasons I don't understand and last but
not least I'm gonna have to agree with
marques in that this red accent on the
meets which is genius seriously all
phones should do this and then that
leads me to my second point I love how
these oneplus covers complement the
phone
someone actually gave me the tip to use
the sandstone cover and I have to agree
this sort of furniture like blend looks
very elegant and everything else this is
a 1 + 5 t and absolutely every aspect so
I recommend you watch my full review for
details oxygen OS four point seven point
six still on top of android 7.1.1 -
which should change the oreo soon the
same fluidness the bear and useful
approach to android that i've prais'd in
our previous videos
all-in-all the 1 plus 5t continues to be
one of my favorite phones of 2017 all we
need now is for the company to do more
of this as part of its unique trademark
the question left is if this approach
will age well over time so stay tuned
for our after the buzz video as we'll
definitely be covering this soon how
about you what do you think about the
sandstone white 1 plus 5t chime in the
comments and while you're at that make
