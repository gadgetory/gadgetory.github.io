yes I finally made it to CES 2013 I'll
show you a quick look at the Sony Xperia
z1s for t-mobile USA so the z1s has a
lot of familiar elements from the old z1
as you can see we take a little tour
around the hardware here there's not a
lot different of course we have a nice
Hardware key there and that plays a very
important part in the waterproof nature
of this device like the earlier z1s
there the alternative on us rather
there's no flap over the headphone jack
so this device is coated with in with a
water-repellent nano coating that we've
talked about on other devices it is
resistant to immersion in water and
exposure to dust of course just quickly
even though we know it's nothing new we
have micro SD for expansion magnetic
connector along the other side and on
the back the 20.7 megapixel camera we
are used to seeing on this line the
frame is no longer aluminum this is a
carrier request from t-mobile USA
apparently a reception concern the frame
is now plastic I can tell you that the
glass sandwich construction means that
this device feels no less sturdy in the
hand as a result of it is still nice and
lightweight with this kind of pronounced
power standby key right here in the in
the nice sweet spot this display that
you're seeing here doesn't quite have
the side on visibility of the compact we
viewed just a few minutes ago but it is
a 5-inch full-hd panel and at least from
head on it can deliver some some very
very nice color this is Android for dot
3 with Sony's skin running a top
obviously running very very smoothly on
this demo unit but wouldn't be surprised
to run to see it run very smoothly on a
review device or even the retail unit
because we really haven't had much
trouble with Sony skin in that regard
but just a quick look at the z1s from
Sony the Sony Xperia z1s obviously from
Sony for t-mobile USA I'm Michael Fisher
with pocket now that's Tony behind the
camera we're at CES 2014 and things are
just getting started stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
