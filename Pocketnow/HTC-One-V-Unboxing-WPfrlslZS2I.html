pocketnow.com if you like what HTC is
doing with their new one series of
devices but don't feel like shelling out
600 plus bucks for a 1x you might
consider the 1v the least expensive HTC
one series device it's only about 350
bucks and it has some really interesting
specs oh and it's got the chin in homage
to the HTC legend and the HTC Hero from
yesteryear so let's do the unboxing of
the HTC One V now and you can get one of
these for about 350 bucks unlocked over
at Negri electronics calm reasonable
price for a brand new device the spec
sheet is not the most impressive but I'm
sure it's going to be a fast device with
really good build quality and again it's
got that really cool chin this is
available in brown and grey this is the
brown version it's kind of interesting
let's turn over to the back and take a
look at the specs that we've got here
you're going to get just a single core
CPU here although it's a tried-and-true
Qualcomm Snapdragon 1 gigahertz CPU you
know it's going to be snappy it's not
going to be amazing with gaming but it's
definitely going to get the job done
it's got 512 megabytes of RAM it's got 4
gigs of storage built in but it does
have microSD expansion so that you can
certainly add more memory if you need to
we've got a 3.7 inch WVGA display so
it's much lower resolution than the One
X lower than the 1s but it still is a
high pixel density because it's only a
three point seven inch screen 800 by 480
that puts it at about 250 PPI so it's
still going to be a super crisp and
clear screen although is smaller it's
got a 5 megapixel camera f 2.0 to allow
for a lot of light into the lens just
like the other HTC One devices 720p HD
video recording not 1080p and all that
other good stuff so let's get to the
unboxing here
really curious to see what HTC has done
with this I don't want to call it
low-end but their budget HTC one device
because it has some of those premium
features just cost less and doesn't have
an amazing spec sheet and again we see
I'm the one you've been waiting for by
the way if you haven't seen our HTC One
X review yet
we're going to put a link up here
throughout the video so that you can go
back and check that so really cool
device here it feels just like the HTC
legend it's got this wonderful aluminum
unibody construction it kind of has some
heft to it which makes it actually feel
pretty high-quality in the hand this
really feels like the hero although much
evolved it feels very thin it's got a
little bit of a rubbery texture down
here it says Beats Audio I'm assuming
this slides off let's see if it's using
micro SIM or regular SIM can't really
tell from here it looks like it's micro
SIM and here is the area where you put
in the micro SD card lots of micro stuff
to talk about let's slide this back on
will power on the phone in a moment and
see what the screen looks like once we
finish with the unboxing all right to
put that aside so this is writing Sense
4.0 whether you love it or you hate it
it's better than previous versions of
sense we can tell you that it's still a
little bit heavy in some areas but it
adds some pretty cool features so we've
got that and that and I'm assuming
because there is no micro SIM a little
guy like this that came in the One X
that's actually using the standard sim
so I've got a wall charger this is for
other country and some headphones this
stuff is boring so anyway let's turn on
the HTC One V see what this screen looks
like power buttons on the top like other
HTC devices this is kind of an
interesting element perhaps this is an
LED notification light which would be
super cool to have it right there just a
little strip there really feels awesome
with this metal it's really great to see
HTC using the unibody construction we
saw it on the desire hd and several
other phones from them looking at the
front we just have a flat piece of glass
we've got the buttons built in here for
Ice Cream Sandwich and I didn't turn it
on yet by the way just a really sharp
edge here I'm just noticing some of
these details it overall it feels like
it's been etched with a laser so let's
turn this on it looks like it's a non
user replaceable battery and perhaps
it's not charged at all or perhaps I'm
just not holding the button and long
enough and we're back after going
through the first time setup and the
device actually came with no charge
which was very strange usually
advice that you get new has a little bit
of a charge very strange indeed so how
does sense 4.0 work with a device that
is a single core processor because the
1s and the 1x both have a multi-core
processors so we're not a full review
coming up
looks like the leap feature isn't even
enabled and I've also noticed that there
are fewer animations like when you click
on a folder it just pops open rather
than on the One X for example and there
I take it out and make the one v look
very small next to it
folders open the little bit of a flare a
little bit of an animation there
certainly to take advantage of all those
cores so we've got a for review coming
up with the HTC One V will also have
further videos to see this is the device
for you if you don't feel like spending
600 bucks to get one of HTC's latest and
greatest this certainly has all the
great features of the One X like the
great camera the great camera
application the new version of sense and
all that other stuff you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now
