normal super in-depth review for the
honor eight and for good reason it's an
exceedingly similar system to what we
enjoyed on the foie way p9 we'd highly
recommend watching that review for the
nitty gritty and here we'll discuss the
few small differences we found between
these two phones up first some
housekeeping the honor eight uses dual
12 megapixel Sony IMX two eight six
camera sensors each sensor is a one over
two point nine inch sensor with 1.25
micron pixels and this is paired with a
twenty seven millimeter equivalent lens
and an F 2.2 aperture laser focus
assistance is onboard as is software
image stabilization for video but there
is no hardware image stabilization so
how does this setup perform in a word
great in three words
great first Stills this dual sensor
arrangement tries to mimic how the rods
and cones in the human eye work one
sensor pulls color info and the other
pulls light when those images are merged
we get still photos unlike anything
we've seen from any other phone the
honor delivers incredible dynamic range
and many normal photos from this camera
will rival the brightness shadow detail
and color from other phones shooting HDR
this is stunning performance and talking
about those subjective metrics you don't
feel like this app is fighting you to
produce photographic images now video
might be the weak link though as the
honor eight tops out at 60 frames per
second 1080p but you can only use
software stabilization at 30 frames per
second this was something we didn't test
as much as we probably should have on
the p9 the EIS crops in significantly to
produce some wiggle room on smoothing
out the frame it does help in reducing
handshake and holding the phone with two
hands while walking evenly you can
almost get that Apple like floating
performance but the actual quality it's
just somewhat unimpressive footage
compared to the stills everything looks
a bit dull details look a bit soft all
heartily admit that we're totally
spoiled by shooting UHD video on other
phones but even comparing 1080p output
this is just adequate performance even
when viewing footage back on 1080p
displays this is a perfect example of
you HD video looks better on HD screens
than HD footage will so what's different
from the p9 not a whole lot
the camera app gets a nice little
refresh and this might help with
Organization Pro Mode now just lives in
the modes menu on its own there isn't a
bottom slide gesture to bring up those
options all of your adjustments now live
in a curve bar as opposed to a straight
doc giving you just a bit more room to
finesse the settings you want for images
and output that honor 8 does seem to
juice up the saturation a bit more than
the p9 did we'd maybe recommend dialing
back the saturation just to touch in the
photo settings it's always easier to add
more color than to try and remove color
from an oversaturated shot the biggest
difference between the two however comes
down to one pro setting which is going
to annoy more than a few people
considering this phone
there is no native raw capture in the
honor 8 camera app even in Pro Mode this
phone will only produce JPEGs thankfully
the phone still supports raw capture so
using a third-party camera app will
replace that function but it is annoying
to switch out for those times you think
you might want to edit and for those
wondering yes the RAW images are
virtually indistinguishable from the p9
we might engage in some wild speculation
that Huawei's partnership with Leica
mandated some changes here on the honor
as it doesn't carry that like a branding
we're not sure though that's pretty much
all that's different we still have all
the other modes and features things like
the light painting feature for example
can be fun to use but the manual mode
will still let you shoot up to a
30-second exposure and we still have
that phenomenal software depth of field
blur to help highlight your subject
there aren't any compromises for the fun
stuff lastly we wanted to use this video
to address some of the concerns we got
in comments from people on our p9 review
regarding the lack of optical image
stabilization that this might be an
issue for still photos especially
low-light situations now why do we use
oh is stabilization helps smooth out
handshake and smoothing out handshake
allows the camera to use a longer
shutter speed before the image starts to
degrade from blur using a longer shutter
speed soaks up more light the more light
you can capture the better your photo
will be however the honor 8 uses too
sensors so each exposure is soaking up
twice as much light over the same period
of time as a phone with a similarly
sized sensor in low-light tests the
honor√© can't quite unseat the galaxy s7
but it's extremely close battling right
up against phones like the LG g5 and
edging out devices like the HTC 10 if
anything the phone often produces too
bright of an image which we regularly
had to dial back almost to stop against
other phones in this price tear the
honor eight handily walks away with
victories in almost every still photo
shooting situation we put it in and
that's probably where we should wrap
this review up at $400 we might be
inclined to say the 1 plus 3 could be
the better all-rounder as it produces
better video but for the person who
shoots more stills there is not another
phone which can compete until you climb
up to a higher price bracket all devices
represent a collection of benefits and
compromises subjectively on a personal
note it's always more exciting to play
with something unique the honor rate
surely bring some compromises to the
table but the benefits it delivers are
fer middle it's fun I like it a lot as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more camera reviews like these again
we'd highly recommend checking out our
in-depth look at the Huawei p9 for even
more commentary on what makes this
camera system special and helped us out
with some sharing on your favorite
social networks for pocket now i'm juan
carlos back now some gadget guy on
twitter and instagram and i will catch
you all on the next review
