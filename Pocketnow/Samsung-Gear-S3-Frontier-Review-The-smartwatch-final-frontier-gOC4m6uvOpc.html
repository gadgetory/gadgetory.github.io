replace my favorite SmartWatch in the
comments of our recent videos and
podcasts the most recommended
replacement was this gadget here and
I've finally been able to take Samsung's
gear s3 frontier for a spin Samsung
Smart Watch evolution has been
interesting to observe watching
experiments with cameras and home
buttons to outright putting a mini phone
on your wrist the frontier takes what we
liked about the gear s2 and refines it
this gear wears a lot more like a
traditional timepiece and will be
appreciated by folks who enjoy a larger
bolder watch body another personal
aspect of this review I'm not currently
using a Samsung phone as my daily driver
now the setup process for the frontier
isn't painful but there are several apps
necessary to install before you can use
the watch on a different manufacturers
phone this is a lot more involved than
setting up an Android wear or Pebble
watch for instance as you'll be tight in
the Samsung services like s health the
construction on the frontier is
fantastic excellent build quality this
is maybe the best wearable hardware I've
ever handled
mind you I'm coming from a plastic
pebble is my daily timepiece but often
using a Huawei watch to check out
Android wear the frontier feels a lot
less like a gadget it doesn't broadcast
its geekery nearly as much as past
Samsung efforts and this is the best
AMOLED screen I've personally used on a
watch it doesn't handle direct Sun as
well as ePaper or digital ink solutions
but it's well readable in bright
conditions it almost passes the SoCal
driving test we're at an angle
reflections can still be troublesome
though the battery saving option of
disabling the screen means you'll have
to move your hand off the steering wheel
to see content but more on that later
getting into the watch operation two
buttons on the side are used as a back
and a home button the latter also
doubles as the app drawer shortcut went
on the main watch phase the diol around
the screen turns to navigate through
pinned applets to the right and
notifications to the left and then the
touchscreen can be used to swipe or pull
down a status shade the gear s3 is
refined but it still very much continues
the notion that a SmartWatch should
perform like a mini phone on your wrist
I'd prefer Samsung move to a three
button layout giving us a selection
button
there's a tactile disconnect between
using this great clicky wheel and then
smudging up the screen to make a
selection or hitting these small three
menus wedged to the side of a circle the
ability to navigate fully through
hardware would be appreciated maybe even
disabling the touchscreen at times like
when my baby daughter gets her hands on
it the frontier is running Tizen
Samsung's in-house software and
performance is terrific the watch easily
slides through applets and notifications
I can't recall any instances of lag or
unresponsiveness which is critical as
there's a lot going on navigation isn't
difficult but it takes a while to
program the muscle memory for where
every feature setting an option live a
checking heart rate for example from the
main watch face you hit the bottom
button and click wheel to s-health where
you touch the screen to activate then
click wheel five menus over to the
heartrate section and then it'll take a
reading this is phone grade software and
the gear routinely rides that line
between functionality and time it's
impressive that we can do this much from
a watch but many of these interactions
would be faster from your phone further
complicating matters Samsung doesn't
really fully support other phones
notifications are delivered and calls
are alerted but any action or reply you
take will be sent back to your phone
want to reply to a message using speech
to text nope can't do that on my mate
nine throughout my week using it I
continually had the sense that I was
missing notifications that they were
delayed somehow glancing down at the
watch only to see that five alerts had
arrived that I either didn't feel the
vibrations or that they were all sent in
one batch that also seemed to hold true
for the Bluetooth alert one of my
biggest frustrations with Android wear
it doesn't notify when it loses the
Bluetooth connection the gear will but
it could sometimes take well over a
minute just enough time for example to
accidentally leave my phone somewhere
and make it to my car not the most
consistent leash function
lastly Samsung advertises an always-on
display and up to three days of battery
life you just can't have both at the
same time individually each statement is
true but if you want that runtime you
need to disable the screen the
frustrating aspect of having to perform
a gesture to see the time
somewhat defeats the convenience of
wearing a watch that said with the
screen auto-dimming we easily reached
three full days with moderate use
notifications and a couple workouts so
let's wrap this up
where does that leave us with the
Samsung gear s three frontier man I love
this hardware but the recommendation on
this watch requires two critical issues
be discussed first this is a tough
recommendation if you don't own a
Samsung phone
the experience is hamstrung when
tackling notifications and calls and you
pay for features you won't get to use
for how good speech-to-text is on a
cheap pebble or Android wear it's a
shame that Samsung couldn't really
translate the gear experience over to
other devices
it's a walled garden approach I don't
appreciate don't punish me for not
owning a Samsung phone instead impress
me with how good this accessory is and
maybe I'll consider a Samsung phone in
the future the second issue was a little
more philosophical if your idea of what
a SmartWatch should be is migrating as
much smartphone functionality as you can
to a small screen then the frontier is
hands down the best SmartWatch on the
market full stop
however if your idea of a SmartWatch is
targeting at a glance information in the
most streamlined way possible that a
watch should complement a phone and not
replace it then the gear can feel
downright cumbersome as this review is
tempered by my personal quest to replace
my pebble I'll have to keep searching
which is a shame as I absolutely love
this hardware as always thanks so much
