disappoints even its own creator my
garage already working on making the
xbox more of a computer terminal and
Samsung continues to slip and market
share just about everywhere I'm hi Mary
vetta and yeah if I sound funny I know I
had this major cold I apologize but this
is pocket out daily brought to you by
Squarespace
the official news that I have to do with
HTC the company has just confirmed that
we are getting its new HTC One on march
first they didn't say if it's going to
be called the one and nine or what the
final name is going to be but we've seen
the Champions League games we've seen
them publicize the One m9 or the new HTC
One so stay tuned hopefully it's not
going to be that m8 I now in other
official news that are rather
disappointing let's talk about Samsung
azza the IDC has just brought the market
share results for China and believe it
or not even though the company was king
last year CIO me is now king and the
company has slipped to fifth place not
second that's actually apples not third
because that belongs to huawei not
fourth that belongs to lenovo samsang is
currently the fifth place in China and
it's just slipping away everywhere so
hopefully the galaxy s5 and presses
somebody at least that was move the
spotlight over to Apple as the company
is apparently working on a new accessory
but we're talking about a patent here
the company filed for a patent back in
two thousand eight and two thousand ten
for a VR headset or you can use your
iPhone so this is pretty much what we
see with the gear VR what we see with
the google cardboard design but
interesting Apple pended years before
Google or Sam cig made something of it
so could it be that the company is
working on its own VR set head said we
will probably find out my WWDC will keep
you posted and speaking of Apple
something that is rather interesting is
that apparently the Apple watch is
disappointing to its own creator it
seems that the company wanted to make
the apple watch this Super health
machine where you could get glucose
levels and it could replace it EKG and
so many other things and it turns out
that Apple is extremely disappointed
with the fact that the sensors didn't
really do what they were supposed to do
up to the point where the first
generation apple watch will not be what
the company wanted and apparently this
will come in future generations so
buyers beware so it turns out though it
depends on how tight your watch is
strapped it depends on so many variables
that Apple wasn't able to nail so let's
see what we get in April and finally for
the very interesting news of the day it
seems that Microsoft is getting ready to
make the xbox one more than just the
game console and it already is but as it
turns out the company is apparently
already
preparing its SDK for developers to
large or should I say be announced that
April it built and then apparently the
launch will happen in May developers
will be able to beta test games
applications and services with users and
apparently use existing game consoles
for development which is great even more
interesting is apparently a Microsoft is
going to give functionality to
developers for apps to work in the
background so you can play a game listen
to music and so many other things that
are apparently coming but it means me to
the question of the day what all the
functionality of this xbox one make you
want to buy into the Microsoft ecosystem
meaning Windows Windows Phone and the
xbox because in my gaze yeah why not why
would I buy a ps4 if I could do so many
other things with the xbox but leave us
