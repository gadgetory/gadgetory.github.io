smartphone is between four and $500 the
new Nexus and the new Moto X are both
excellent choices but what if you only
want to buy one of them i'm michael
fisher with pocket now here to help you
make the call
in Nexus 6p versus Moto X pure edition
the second you pick them up you can tell
you're dealing with very different
animals here with the Nexus is slim
angular and cool to the touch with it's
all aluminum chassis the Moto X is
chubby rounded and rubbery with its soft
touch resin finish that might sound like
a win for the Nexus but really this is
more a question of taste where the nexus
comes in three colors and that's about
it
the Motorola phone gives you options
galore with thousands of possible
combinations including wood and leather
you can even put your name on it if you
have the more sentimental type that
makes the Moto X easier to bond with
than the comparatively sterile Nexus 6p
if you're the more pragmatic sort
well the Moto X also gets a utility
point here for its added expandability
the microSD slot built into the SIM tray
lets you add more storage on the fly
while the Nexus makes you choose right
up front how much memory you'll need if
you spend a lot of time outdoors you
might prefer the Moto X to it screen
packs just as many pixels as the Nexus
but its LCD technology produces brighter
cleaner whites that make for a more
readable panel in direct sunlight
Motorola's water-repellent nano coating
protects the Moto X from spills or
splashes and if you go for the silicon
back it'll probably stand up to drops a
little better as well you're also less
likely to drop the Moto X in the first
place it's more ergonomic and much less
slippery than the nexuses smooth
aluminum and Motorola's trademark dimple
provides a nice tactile anchor point for
a fingertip on the flipside the Nexus P
gives you one of those two and its
dimple actually does something the
fingerprint reader is fast accurate and
reliable
it makes unlocking the phone or
authorizing a payment and absolute
breeze on the Moto X you've got to
resort to a PIN code the Nexus 6p also
uses Gorilla Glass 4 for its display
protection which
turning says is twice as tough as the
Gorilla Glass 3 on the Moto X and the
nexus screen features the super
saturated colors and pure Raven blacks
that we love from AMOLED which makes its
display seem the more alive more
dramatic of the two these are both
Android phones and they're both running
an almost pure version of Google's
platform so the fundamentals of the
experiencer of course similar but the
few modifications motorola has made make
for a phone that's much easier to get
addicted to take moto display which uses
proximity and motion sensors to intuit
when you want it to activate you just
pull it from a pocket or wave a hand
over it to see the time and you're
waiting notifications this is executed
much better than the ambient display on
the Nexus 6p which is slower and not as
easy to trigger same with the verbal
command while you can use the
traditional Google prompt to control the
Nexus 6p the Moto X offers more
customized ability you can choose pretty
much any key phrase you want to activate
it
ok Jarvis and the phone can respond to a
wider range of commands what's up hi
there the time is 1:10 p.m. you received
a notification from periscope at 12:58
p.m. at Josh Denny is the Moto X will
automatically detect when you're driving
a car and if someone sends you a text
it'll dictate their message to you and
even allow you to reply by voice if you
want the phone to silence itself when it
detects you're in certain places you can
do that too
again the Nexus 6p does some of this in
stock marshmallow but in a simpler less
capable form speaking of marshmallow our
Moto X pure Edition doesn't have it yet
which gives the 6p a big opportunity to
make up some ground as a Nexus the 6p
gets software updates faster than any
other Android phone motorola used to
enjoy a similar standing when it was
owned by Google but that's not the case
anymore so if it's prompt updates and
long-term support that you value above
all else
nothing beats a nexus in the camera
corner it's a punch for punch slugfest
Motorola's camera offers much higher
resolution but it's also got
significantly smaller pixels the Nexus
6p
primary sensor was designed for
camcorders and point-and-shoots and it's
also got a cool bonus in its laser
assisted autofocus the motox has more
fun tricks built into its viewfinder
like the ability to scan barcodes
automatically and the quick launch
motion gesture to fire it up in the
first place
but it's awkward to use with one hand
and it gets really laggy when shooting
4k video the nexus viewfinder has a more
straightforward interface but it's just
as clumsy to use with one hand thanks to
the ridiculous location of the settings
menu and it lacks features like HDR
video when it comes to the photos
themselves each camera has its strengths
the Moto X shines in terms of sheer
resolution if you're taking a photo of a
far-off object and you want it to be as
sharp as possible when you zoom in the
21 megapixels of the Moto X will help
out a lot if you're more of a casual
shutter bug you'll have a tougher choice
in broad daylight and mixed lighting
where these phones produce photos that
are very similar in overall quality
sometimes the Moto X will produce the
preferred shot and sometimes the Nexus P
will do a better job each one gets
focused quickly and each seems to do a
pretty good job of cancelling out the
kind of hand Wiggles that come from
holding two phones at the same time
where these phones start to show a bit
of difference is in high dynamic range
mode the Nexus 6p is more subtle with
its HDR effect
well the Moto X really goes the extra
mile and trying to lighten up the
shadows sometimes that results in some
cartoonish color mixing but more often
than not it's a welcomed brightness
boost the Moto X completely loses the
competition in low-light where it's
higher resolution does it no favors
instead it's smaller pixel size handicap
set even when using its dedicated night
mode the Nexus 6p consistently produces
brighter more discernable photos
sometimes the Nexus can get a passable
shot where the Moto X can't even capture
enough light to get focused properly
selfies are about the same the Nexus has
a higher resolution front-facing camera
but the Moto X has a front-facing flash
much of what's true for stills usually
holds up in video while each phone
produces nice 4k footage
the Nexus brings more saturation and
contrast for a more dramatic if not
necessarily more accurate scene that's
especially true in the case of cooler
colors if there's anything blue in the
shot the Nexus is bound to really punch
it up while the Moto will tone it down
meanwhile the Moto X continues to stand
out with digital stabilization and look
at this
these 4k videos were taken with the
phones in the same hand being exposed to
the same footsteps the Moto X does a
much better job of keeping the frame
steady combined with the ability to
shoot HDR video absent on the Nexus this
smoothness goes a long way toward making
up for the Moto X is somewhat debtor
colors whether you agree will depend on
your own smartphone camera priorities if
you're an action junkie who needs
excellent stabilization and usually
shoots in daylight you'll probably favor
the Moto X if you want more color and
much better night shots the Nexus is by
far the better choice the fact that
these phones are running different
Android versions makes a pretty big
difference in their day-to-day
performance the Nexus is tighter crisper
and cleaner at almost every turn which
is most prominent in the keyboard
responsiveness the Moto X isn't laggy
necessarily considered a loan it's just
fine but next to the Nexus it seems
slower that doesn't usually translate to
games or multitasking performance where
the Moto X keeps pace despite its less
powerful snapdragon 808 processor
interestingly the Moto X tends to run
hot a lot of the time while the Nexus
usually keeps its cool despite its metal
frame and a much chastised snapdragon
810 processor the Nexus doesn't do quite
as well acoustically phone calls on the
Motorola phone are more comfortable
because of the rounded edges and audio
quality is warmer and richer on the Moto
X to a quality that holds true even when
you transfer audio to the external
speakers
the Nexus does pull off a definitive win
in endurance it's battery is 15 percent
larger than the pure editions and that
combined with the power saving features
of marshmallow mean that it usually
lasts a full day of heavy use while the
Moto X will probably need a late
afternoon top-up if you're planning to
go out at night after a full day that's
not too big a deal if you're surrounded
by power outlets the Moto X charges
significantly faster than the Nexus and
it's older USB port means you don't need
to worry about getting a special type C
cable if you need to buy one but no one
wants to charge if they don't have to so
the Nexus wins this round we say this
pretty often but it's especially true in
this case get either of these phones and
you're getting one of the best Android
devices around at a very competitive
price point to boot the Nexus is more
expensive but it's also bringing
features like a fingerprint scanner a
better low-light camera and the fastest
Android updates available if those are
the things that matter more to you that
extra hundred bucks is well worth it if
instead you care more about
customizability expandability and a
smarter feature set and you get with
plain stock Android then the Moto X pure
Edition is the better choice for you
personally that's the one I'd go for
because I've gotten used to the Moto
software suite I tend to like a more
rugged handheld and I really like
building a totally customized phone but
that's me which one would you choose let
us know in the comments below and don't
forget that we've got a lot more on each
of these phones in our full reviews both
