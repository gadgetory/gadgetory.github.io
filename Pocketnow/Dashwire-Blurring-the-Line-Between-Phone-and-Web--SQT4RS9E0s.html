going to take a look at how dashwire can
make your life easier first we're going
to take a look at what dashwire does and
lastly we'll go through the setup if you
spend a portion of your day on a
computer for work school or simply to
stay in touch with friends then dash
wires for you dashwire automatically
uploads your videos contacts text
messages and more to your dash wire
account don't worry about privacy though
it's only public if you want it to be
let's take a look at some of the
features I'm not going to show you my
contacts but i will tell you but that
once yours are uploaded you can send
text messages emails or edit their
details from the web interface speaking
of text messages dashwire will
automatically track your messages for
you and if you have a back-and-forth
dialogue with a friend it will list it
as a threaded text conversation so you
know where you're at you can pick up
where you left off without a hitch if
you're prone and recording video with
your phone dashwire will automatically
upload those videos for you to your
account from which you can share it with
friends or even post it to Facebook
Twitter friendfeed or bebo handling
bookmarks is easier with dashwire
although it only syncs with pocket
internet explorer it can still be useful
if you need to send a link to your phone
and don't feel like tapping away with t
nine additionally there's a catalog you
can choose from if you don't have any
mobile favourites of your own to begin
with ringtones everybody loves ringtones
but not everybody loves your ringtones
you might not even love your honor
that's why dashwire has ringtones
manager built in from the browser
interface you can peruse the ringtones
on your device and even make them play
on your device this is much easier and
faster than trying to pick a ring ton
with the phone's interface this feature
is also helpful if you misplace your
phone and don't have a second phone to
call from just bring up dashwire and
play a ring tongue voicemail dashwire is
extended with visual voicemail from call
wave which is indispensable for many
busybodies in the world if you use call
wave plug in your details and you can
view your voicemail through dashwire
calls received made and missed you can
see them all and search them all right
from the browser the history goes back a
lot further than most phone so you can
figure out who you were talking to at
3am on march 21st for an alibi aside
from being a great web two point oh tool
for your phone dashwire is also a bit of
a social network you can also tell
dashwire to update your status on sites
like Facebook and Twitter you like photo
documenting your day you can take a
photo and it will be uploaded to
dashwire where you can choose to post it
to Facebook Flickr or Twitter all at
once saving you tons of time updating
individual social networks it gets
started with dashwire you will need an
account go to dashwire com sign up and
enter your information there might be a
step or two but it shouldn't take more
than five minutes now you're ready to
set up your device first a warning when
setting up dash wiring syncing for the
first time I highly recommend that your
device be connected over Wi-Fi and
charging at the same time further go to
start settings power management and
change the settings for display timeout
on AC to never you should change this

times to get it installed once installed
