pocket comm and today I will show you a
useful application for finding and
setting up your wireless network in your
house so the program is called Wi-Fi
analyzer and it's free on Android Market
and the first thing you'll notice is
that I have Wi-Fi channels on the bottom
and a decibel rating corresponding to
signal strength on the left so what this
means is that my wireless network which
is free network is on channel 6 and it
looks as though a few other networks are
on that same channel and the reason why
that can be a particularly bad situation
is that I can get interference from
those other networks in my area so these
are probably my neighbours of course so
I can also go to different views if I'd
like so I can also do different views if
I like I can change the view so if I
want to see a time graph it gives me a
breakdown of what the signal strengths
are in my particular area and on my
specific networks and it shows which
networks are down at the bottom and I
can scroll across to see which ones
there are and go to another view I get a
channel rating so it shows that channels
13 12 11 14 and 1 are probably going to
be the best channels in my area and it
shows that channel 6 is you being used
more than any other channel so we can go
to another view and we can look at AP
list and this gives a breakdown of which
networks are in my area I can also go to
another view and Sigma meter all I have
to do is click here to select and let's
say I want to use this one right here
which is my network and the closest to
negative 0 is going to be the strongest
signal of course this meter only shows
up to negative 40 which is probably what
the highest settings can be on a
wireless network so we can go into some
of the settings and we can scan
automatically scan interval view
available channels we can set the screen
on open network indicator fill channel
graph auto Wi-Fi on so this will launch
the Wi-Fi chip in your Android device
you can also auto Wi-Fi off when you
exit and show exit if you want so if you
have an issue of Wi-Fi
well you might want to change your
channel if you're on the same channel as
your neighbors and this is another
Android Market pick and the program is
called Wi-Fi analyzer and you can find
that on Android Market for free thanks
for watching and if at any time you want
to download this program directly to
your device just use Google Goggles to
click on the QR code on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
