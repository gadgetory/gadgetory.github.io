significant changes to come LG extends
its trademark portfolio to cover a very
new phone option that just launched and
we get more details on samsung galaxy s7
game bundles I'm hi Mary vera and my
older son seems to believe that my
t-shirts are his Yeah right this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Samsung as the company
has just detailed its bundles if you buy
a galaxy a7 or galaxy s7 edge last year
you got a few bundles that included free
these four games in addition to also
some subscriptions for certain apps like
audible but this time you're only
getting games and we're actually talking
about games that you download that are
currently freemium models where you will
get some credit for playing those games
games are not bad though asphalt 8 in
addition to others learn more in the
links of the description now let's talk
about LG as the company has just filed a
new trademark that is rather interesting
we now see the trademark for the g 5s e
and well right now the iphone s is in
the market we know that it's being
dubbed the special edition and it
wouldn't be the first time that LG works
on a mini version of its flagship we
just hope that by se they also mean that
they're actually launching a smaller g5
in every single thing from
specifications to everything and for
those of you that are wondering exactly
what Foxconn plans to do with its recent
sixty-six percent acquisition over sharp
well it seems the company has just
invested 1.8 billion dollars in having
sharp work more on OLED displays we know
that Apple is a crazy 4 0 lead as of the
iphone that comes out in 2018 so it only
makes sense the company's largest
partner Foxconn is now working on
specialising itself for 0 lead as the
company previously invested a lot of
money on a factory to build IPS displays
for Apple so we all know where this is
going another company that is rumored to
bring products very soon is amazon the
last time we got kindle updates was a
rather long time ago and i hate
because my kindle paperwhite is barely
two months old but still we hear that
the company is working on new kindles it
could be announced over the next few
weeks and also that some of the
accessories for these candles are going
to be really cool like for example a
solar charged up I don't know case
because I don't really believe that it's
a battery pack or anything but I just
wonder exactly what the plan is here
given the fact that a kindle could run
for a full month without battery charge
or it could just be that there is an
update to tablets that would require the
solar charger let's see what we get and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the iphone 7s we've got
leaked components in theory and we
noticed that there is a dual camera
module bear in mind that we've heard
that this dual camera module will only
work on the plus variant as a
differentiating factor hopefully they'll
bring oh I asked the smaller variance
eventually and this new update but yeah
it seems that the the dual camera module
is there sadly we can't really make to
what kind of cameras will these be if
this will be stitching photos or if
these modules will actually be able to
do something different together so that
leads me to the question of today would
you like for both the camera modules to
work together or would you prefer for
one camera to do one thing and one
camera to do another in my case I would
rather prefer that I love that feature
on the g5 that wide angle lens when you
need it the regular angle lens when you
don't it makes a ton of sense of you're
on the go but we'd love to know your
opinion in the comments down below
