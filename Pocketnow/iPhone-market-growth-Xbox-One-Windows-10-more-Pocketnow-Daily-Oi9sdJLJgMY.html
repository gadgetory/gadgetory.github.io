that it keeps growing even today dr.
Dre's new album becomes an apple music
exclusive go figure and when those 10 on
the Xbox already has a timeline I'm high
memory that I and no in 2008 we never
thought in our wildest dreams that we
would ever reach 1 million subscribers
thanks a lot guys this is pocket out
daily the official news today start with
cantar analytics worldpanel the company
has just provided us some statistics on
its surveys around the world this is
very interesting q2 is never really a
big quarter for Apple because the new
galaxy is out and well the iphone is on
decline as users are waiting for the
newer one but it seems that Apple
continues to grow in market share not in
the United States which is interesting
they've grown in China significantly
where Android is actually losing market
share to the iphone and other countries
in Europe Australia's well crazy news
let's see if African continue that
momentum with the iphone success and yes
Windows 10 is already out for computers
and with those sim mobile should be out
in the fall but we had no information on
Windows 10 for the Xbox until today
preview will be available in September
we are not sure that's going to be a
close they're open one but yeah it
should be available by then and we
should expect it to launch probably
later this year we just don't have any
solid data on that we will keep you
posted and for those of you with a need
for speed and want to know more about
that qualcomm snapdragon 820 processor
brewers because we don't have any
official data yet is that there will be
an event on august eleventh where
qualcomm will let us know exactly what
they're planning to do with this 820
obviously we are waiting for this
processor to power certain devices
probably in the fall or early next year
so this will be very interesting news at
your calendars and speaking of hot
devices that are set for the fall the
sony xperia z5 and z5 compact made an
appearance yesterday today we get more
photos of its fingerprint scanner and
yet it is part of the power button so it
could be that this is a touch base and
not a slight base fingerprint scanner
which is great news and it's probably
the best placement ever
you're always reaching for the power
button as well let's see if it does make
it to the cuttest prototyping is common
in this industry and finally for the
very interesting news of the day two
things for Apple music number one you
can now download your favorite beats one
shows and listen to them on demand not
live which makes all the sense in the
world this is the internet but even more
interesting dr. dre is launching his new
studio album Compton ahead of the movie
Straight Outta Compton tonight and yes
you bet it's an apple music exclusive
something interesting given the fact
that the Apple music is not available on
Android yet so yeah they're pretty much
making this an iphone exclusive you
could say which is really interesting
again this is the first album from this
guy in 16 years I used to be a big fan
of the guy in my teenage years but it
does lead me to the question of the day
do you believe that album was like these
would make you want to move to Apple
music because this won't be the first
this is just the start of this in my
case oh they would have to be really hot
but leave us a comment down below let's
see what you would do with your current
streaming service friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com it's a strep trajan
channel as well if all me on Twitter hi
underscore be better run Instagram at
high never leave it out please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
