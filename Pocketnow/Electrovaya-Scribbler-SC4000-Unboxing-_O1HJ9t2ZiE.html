a video unboxing of the electro via
scribbler SC 4000
4000 is a Windows Vista tablet pc with a
12.1 inch screen and the device was
announced earlier this year at the
Consumer Electronics Show out in Las
Vegas so let's get started here we could
see kind of a standard box here and if I
turn it on the side you'll see that we
have here an intel core 2 duo processor
running at 1.06 gigahertz one gigabytes
of ram 60 gigabyte hard drive and xga
panel with a 3900 milliamp hour battery
so let's open this box here I open it up
I just want to show you how nicely
packaged it is inside looks like it's
kind of securely put in and start
pulling some things up the first thing
we've got here it looks like it's a
little carrying case so I take it out of
the bag here it's a vinyl bag here with
looks like a velcro enclosure I feel
around then the inside here it's a felt
lining which is kind of nice while
protecting the device and we've got a
shoulder strap here so you can carry
around easily or on your shoulder don't
know if you can tell but it's roughly
about the size of a padfolio of those
things that you put your notepads in
almost resembles a a man bag but at
least electro via provided a carrying
case for your for your device it's not
something I normally used to seeing in a
in a computer so that's that's pretty
great I open this box here this box once
I'm seems focused accessories
is we open it up and we've got here the
limited warranty we've got a full
cleaning cloth here which is nice check
out here good size feels like it's like
a microfiber cloth same kind of things I
used to clean their glasses with your
camera lenses got a lanyard here I'm
assuming this is probably for the tablet
pen got the 3900 milliamp hour battery
to go to the back here
nice decent size we've got the power
block with the power cable and last I'm
assuming looks like this is probably the
pen open this one so we've got here look
so they've got some stuff sticking out
I've got a metal ring here not sure what
this does yet and this little plastic
little plastic tip so I'm assuming he's
probably replacement tips for your
tablet pen and then mess up a little
further and there we have the pen itself
just about the size of you know just
like a regular pen it's got a little
clip here you can see clipping your cell
your shirt I've got your buttons here
the tip and and raise our tab for use on
that nice Wacom digitizer that will take
a look at later make sure there's
nothing else in the box here think so so
let's see you take out the device here
it looks like it's nicely packaged
and there we have it the scribbler a
nice little tablet pad here you see it
looks pretty thin on the other side is
where the battery goes in I go ahead and
stick that in sit here just put it in
just not a bad wait and you know just
see we'll leave that here on the side
for a minute let's make sure there's
nothing else looks like this one more
accessory here looks like we've got
looks like it could be a stance to mount
your tablet up nice little addition
there just gives you an idea of how big
the scribbler is I've got my own
personal this is my compact laptop with
a 15.4 inch screen and we'll just put
this on top here so we can see it's
pretty pretty small nice size if we look
at the screen here it's got this nice
kind of matte finish and assuming just
to reduce glare and probably last a
little longer so in the next few days I
will be doing a some additional video
reviews here just to go through the
hardware and the software of the device
so keep a lookout for that and this has
been red wine with pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
