and redemption stories companies getting
back on track riding missteps and
rebuilding consumer relationships
Alcatel made a move to the premium
mid-range last year in one of the most
competitive packs we've ever witnessed
the idol 4s was a fine phone but it
couldn't quite rise to the same
visibility as its competition this year
the idol 5s might seem to be a retreat
on paper but there's something charming
about a return to what originally put
the idol on our collective radar while
retaining some of the elements which
worked well on the 4s and what worked
really well was the shift in design
moving from plastic on the idol 3 to
metal and glass the idol 5 retains this
visible rim which contains the
front-facing stereo speakers it's a
gorgeous way to incorporate hardware
which often distracts from a phone's
front face and this elevates the idol
above most of its low cost competition
what won't win some folks over however
the large forehead and chin bezels using
a smaller screen we were hoping for a
slightly better one-handed fit but
dimensions are nearly identical to
phones with larger displays it's a
respectable LCD with good outdoor view
ability but it does feel like the phone
is wearing a picture frame but we were
hoping that this was to maintain
compatibility with the VR viewer
designed for the 4s but this turned out
not to be the case we don't have any
complaints with the tech inside we've
reviewed several phones now using
similar hardware and this kit arrives at
a competitive price this probably won't
wow folks in our audience but that's not
really the point if the goal is back to
basics we'd say all Cattell achieves
that goal handily
ditto our look at software where the
idol ships with a current build of
largely stock Android a few small
additions to help customize the phone
but otherwise this is a lean skin to
help complement the hardware so
performance is about what you would
expect this phone is plenty powerful
enough to tackle the daily smartphone
grind communication and social media no
issues and we're only seeing this
Hardware taxed as we start running more
graphics intense fare like say VR apps
Alcatel continues to include their own
VR store though we wouldn't point to
this is a primary use for a more
see focus phone camera tech produces
reasonable though often washed out
images the camera app is well featured
for this price tear auto modes manual
controls with raw capture and software
stabilization for video performances
generally solid though with some
inconsistencies for HDR sometimes
delivering a wonderful blend of
highlights and shadow detail other times
just blowing out brightness the
low-light boost is appreciated though
holding still the phone will drive ISO a
little higher to give your dark shots a
nudge its video which might be the weak
link the idle 5 s tops out at 1080p with
respectable software stabilization we
know this chipset is capable of 4k
output but Alcatel might have made the
right play and disabling that there's no
Hardware stabilization and shaky UHD
isn't much fun to look at so stick to
what works right like the stills though
this HD video is mid-pack detail
somewhat dull and with an auto exposure
that can be difficult to rein in this
camera covers the basics including some
well implemented fun features but it
won't go down as a top budget shooter
what the idle should be recognized for
is audio these are terrific speakers at
any price just to touch quieter than the
axon 7 but with a slightly fuller range
to our ears
the headphone game is on point to
playback is truncated to 16-bit but
quality numbers for noise and dynamic
range handily compete with flagship
phones the audio enhancements also give
headphone output and nice bump though
with more EQ manipulation this
performance punches well above the price
tag looking at runtime the Qualcomm
six-to-five has proven time and time
again to be a power efficiency champion
we were a bit concerned by the smaller
battery capacity but the idle posts
competitive numbers in our media bench
you should have room to make it past
dinner time with moderate use the
recharge game is also quick enough the
smaller battery doesn't require a lot of
time plugged in for a healthy top off so
let's wrap this up
where does that leave us with the
Alcatel idol 5s how should we recognize
progress alka tells course-correct is an
interesting examination of business
strategy budget-busting mid rangers are
succumbing to the same price creep as
their premium flagship counterparts with
that pricing buffer new gaps are created
in the market and there's an opportunity
to push back at the entry level and
lower mid-range
partnerships are key we don't have word
on any carrier deals or retail outlets
at the time this video was produced but
the idol 5s is available unlocked
through Amazon with ads served on the
lock screen for one $99.99 that pricing
is critical the charm here is
recapturing some of the magic of the
idol 3 and my time with the phone it
totally works for me it faces tough
competition but it deserves some
spotlight we all want to be impressed by
fatter specs or companies delivering
powerful hardware to increasingly
smaller margins but there's always an
opportunity to elevate the experience
for less expensive phones just like the
uh Nigel 3 did as always thanks so much
