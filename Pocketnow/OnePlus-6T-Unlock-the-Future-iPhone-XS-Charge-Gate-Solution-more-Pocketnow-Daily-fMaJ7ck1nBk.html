inviting us to unlock the future with
the oneplus 60 so those of you having
charging issues with your iPhone it
looks like the solution may be coming
soon and Google just revealed that the
Google pixel 3 will be available for
pre-orders sooner than we thought I'm hi
I'm Adam Iveta and yes the be 40 was
awesome spent more than a week with it
and got the pipeline of phones that are
coming up is crazy but - stay tuned it's
gonna be great this is PocketNow daily
sponsored by swap ah the official news
today begin with product launches as a
Nokia is wanting to join the United
States market with a bang the company
has just announced the Nokia 7.1 we have
a full hands-on video in the link in the
description I am definitely very
impressed I mean I love their build
quality I love what they've been doing
with the brand for the past two years
and I'm talking about hmd handling the
brand and so far so good
I you can learn more about this phone
again in the description now let's talk
about LG as we hear a couple of rumors
of what the company is working on we
hear two things the first one that
flexible displays are coming into we
would say mobile form factors a foldable
smartphone tablet whatever the company
is working on and we also hear big plans
for 5 G's now we don't have a timeline
but knowing how LG works very closely
with both Qualcomm and Google it could
be that we might be seeing this very
soon move the spotlight over to Google
as a company pretty much just tease that
we should expect three orders to begin
pretty much on the day of the events or
very close to it we see three possible
color options for the pixels I am really
looking forward to this event we will be
covering it live and you can bet that
we've got a ton of coverage plan for
that let's just see in the end with
these three color options will be of
they're great and if they're not just
going to be probably the size of the
whole event square I don't know I'll
starve out Apple and iPhones for this
would be having issues with charge gate
meaning your phone doesn't charge if
it's on standby and you connected to a
wire apparently Apple is working on a
solution they have taken full
responsibility
apparently iOS 12.1 is going to address
this the only problem is we don't really
have a timeline and this is not me
saying go buy a wireless charger
huh that actually makes a lot of sense
because there's no issue of your using
wireless chargers
could this be Apple's way to try to lure
us into that funny because they don't
have air power yet and finally the hot
new stood a have to do with oneplus as
the company is now teasing what to
expect for the one plus six T yes
there's a full teaser video it starts
with the evolution of mankind in the
different ways we can unlock our future
quote-unquote definitely the company is
trying to show us something really cool
we've seen so many rumors I know that a
ton of you are disappointed with the
whole idea of losing the headphone jack
which was confirmed let us know in the
comments what do you think I mean is
this the oneplus device that you're
gonna be considering or are you going to
stick with whatever particular device
you have because my god the oneplus X is
probably one of my favorite phones of
2018 and definitely the 60 is probably
just gonna build on that but leave us a
comment down but love with upsetting
your opinion more than mine before we
conclude this video we would love to
thank our sponsor swap for making our
content possible now we have new iPhones

favorite models like the iPhone 10
