argue that the pure Android experiences
the way to go the question is if
following an ideal is really better than
everything else
I'm hi meadow Nevada with pocket now and
this is Samsung Galaxy s7 edge vs.
Google Nexus 6p
by now most of the world already knows
about Samsung's new galaxy the company
does a tremendous job in marketing as
flagships and our reviews prove that
this year marketing isn't the only good
thing about this phone
by contrast Google is at the opposite
end of the marketing food chain but at
least among geeks the cult following
behind pure Android experience is strong
today we decided to test what it's like
to live on either side of the spectrum
and we chose the cream of the crop in
their respective lineups the Nexus 6p
made by Huawei has been available since
September 2015 it marks the first time
that Google goes all-out with aluminum
and design elements like the camera
visor have proven to be quite unique
these days the Galaxy s7 edge in turn
has been available since February 2016
and this is an iteration of last year's
Galaxy s6 with a glass finish match by
7000 series aluminum along with curves
all around the Nexus is more commanding
in the hand being nine millimeters
taller five millimeters wider and 21
grams heavier than the galaxy but in
turn the galaxy scratches a millimeter
in added thickness the choice of
materials leads to both phones offering
a premium feel in the hand and while the
Nexus is more substantial it's easier to
grip them the edge curves of the galaxy
in the specs Department the newer Galaxy
s7 edge punches hard at snapdragon 820
processor is newer than the snapdragon
810 on the Nexus it has an extra
gigabyte of RAM compared to the Nexus
storage is expandable on the galaxy and
the 3500 milliamp hour battery on the
galaxy is better than the 3450 power
pack on the Nexus at least by a hair
both devices sport fingerprint scanners
in opposite directions but the Nexus 6p
is faster at unlocking the device and
also more convenient with capacitive
unlock features
we're the Galaxy s7 edge excels is an
ip68 water and dust resistance where the
Nexus 6p has none and finally the galaxy
s7 supports fast and wireless charging
while the case of the Nexus is more
about USB type-c and some sort of fast
charging that's not necessarily
mentioned overall it's amazing just how
much Hardware can change in just five
months between both these devices
showing off the goods both devices sport
gorgeous AMOLED panels protected by
Gorilla Glass 4 the 5.7 inch panel on
the Nexus might be larger in number
compared to the 5.5 inch on the galaxy
but the capacitive buttons on the galaxy
end up offering more screen real estate
when compared to the Nexus powering each
display is Android 6.1 marshmallow if
you decided to go the Google route
you're running Android as the company
intended Lotus nowhere to be seen and
the whole experience is designed around
the availability of Google services by
contrast Samsung is all about making its
own services seen and that times it
clashes with Google's mentality by
offering duplicates like to calendars
for example the only advantage of
Samsung's approaches that if you want to
make it look like stock Android through
themes well there's something available
for that to a certain degree Google has
improved its approach the larger
displays by providing a larger grid of
icons on the launcher but it's not as
customizable as samsung's there's also
the promise for multi window support
with Android n but Samsung already has
it in addition to quick edge features
that make access to shortcuts easier
both devices offer some sort of
always-on display with Samsung providing
additional customization features and a
more elegant finish the Nexus may not be
always on as it claims but it does offer
far more usability whenever it actually
decides to work which I never really
figure out now when you narrow down the
experience of using both phones and day
to day use the difference is rather
shocking you'd assume that the pure
vanilla Android experience without load
would perform
better but it actually doesn't there are
cases where the Nexus 6p just slows down
to a crawl
even with basic tasks like moving around
through the launcher the galaxy may not
be famous for its restraint to software
but its launcher is extremely fluid and
the added gig of ram allows you to
launch up to 14 applications at the same
time on the background which is crazy
performance on graphics intensive games
is fluid on both devices though and I
actually find the experience on the
Nexus that he more immersive thanks to
its front firing speakers the Galaxy
forces you to find ways to not muffle
that speaker in turn when it comes to
the battery the battle goes beyond just
having similar power packs the
Snapdragon 820 on the Galaxy is clearly
a more efficient machine allowing you to
go up to a crazy five hours of screen on
time while the Nexus scratches for and
charging on the Galaxy is also faster
now where the experiences really tight
as in the camera Department both devices
support 12 megapixel shooters and the
Galaxy even provides a brighter F 1.7
aperture compared to F 2.0 on the Nexus
4 the Nexus wins is in the larger pixels
at 1.5 5 microns compared to 1.4 on the
Galaxy but where the Galaxy wins back at
least on paper is an optical image
stabilization versus electronic photos
on both devices are gorgeous with deep
saturation and great contrast on both
cameras but in my opinion the Galaxy
tends to provide brighter photos without
blowing out exposure and also providing
more detail the face detection autofocus
on the Galaxy is far quicker than on the
Nexus and the Galaxy is also faster at
taking the shot as well in dark
scenarios the speed of the galaxy is
clearly better than the Nexus but oddly
I find the Nexus to provide more
accurate depictions of the scenery when
compared to the brighter photos of the
galaxy
and then our video comparison was rather
odd
mainly because footage of the Nexus 6p
looks stabilized on the phone but once
you pull it out it's clear that the
Galaxy s7 edge is far superior thanks to
optical image stabilization and this is
just one of the reasons why this
comparison is so complicated the Nexus
6p may be the pure Android experience
that Google intended which at some point
in time meant a lot but in 2016
things are rather different and the
galaxy s7 edge proves to be a better
device than the Nexus and pretty much
every way you can pair it this doesn't
necessarily mean that the Nexus 6p is a
bad phone on the contrary it's a very
good phone and it has a lot of potential
mainly when it comes to software updates
where we know that samsung is terrible
for the Android Pyrrhus the Nexus 6p
continues to be the best that Google has
ever launched but for everyone else and
I literally mean everyone else the
Galaxy s7 edge continues to be one of
the best phones of 2016 folks just like
with this comparison there is a lot of
