phone/tablet hybrids or phablets deserve
to exist we sympathize pockets can only
get so big after all but in our view the
more important question is if you're a
smart phone manufacturer can you afford
to ignore this category well unless your
Apple the answer for now is no and
that's why Nokia launched the Lumia 1520
just a few weeks ago it's prodigious
it's powerful and it's Windows Phones
only phablet to date but is it worth
buying let's see I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow
and this is our video review of the
Nokia Lumia 1520 if you're familiar with
Nokia's design language up till now the
1520 will come as little surprise in the
looks department
it's basically an upscaling of the
company's Lumia 925 one of Nokia's best
looking windows phones to date
considered alone the 1520 doesn't
particularly standout at first there's
all the usual hallmarks of excellent but
understated Nokia design from the gently
curved Gorilla Glass 2 to the ceramic
buttons on our black unit here it's only
when you pick it up and put it alongside
more common smart phones that the
devices sighs truly hits you and in that
way the 1520 is much more like the HTC
One Maxx or Samsung's Galaxy mega 6.3
its huge size is a big part of its
overall story but the 1520 outpaces both
of those devices on the spec sheet
landing closer to the sony xperia z
ultra in terms of horsepower a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 sits at its core a first
for Windows Phone and it powers another
first the six inch IPS display up front
boasts 1080p resolution this processor
and display pair isn't insignificant
it's fast becoming the standard on
flagship smartphones and the 1520 is for
now the only Windows Phone to live up to
that standard it's also the highest end
nokia device to include a microSD card
slot for storage expansion a big deal
for media hounds so the 1520 is
definitely the phone to get if you want
the cutting edge of Microsoft's mobile
offering
this holiday season that cutting edge
isn't quite so sharp in terms of
software we talked a bit about why that
is in our recent after the buzz reira
view of the Lumia 925 so hop over to
that episode after this review for our
thoughts on how Windows Phone is aging
but the larger higher resolution display
allows for the interface to spread out a
lot more on the 15:20 with the screen
like this Microsoft can finally deliver
on the glance ability promise of the
modern UI instead of scrolling around to
find the tile you're looking for the
1520 has enough room to display
everything all at once it's very
convenient to have so much canvas to
work with
right on the front page still we've
dogged other plus-sized smartphones for
not doing enough to intelligently
utilize their large screens and the 1520
deserves the same rebuke the Start
screen is really the only place Windows
Phone takes advantage of this phones
hulking dimensions there's no split pane
simultaneity asking approach to work
with more than one app at a time we're
hopeful the forthcoming threshold update
will bring some of this but that's a
ways off and until then you're stuck
using that huge screen for just one app
at a time
still big is big and that added room is
very handy for taking advantage of the
built-in Microsoft Office suite and when
skyping netflix inc reading and gaming a
little more on gaming though the Windows
Store continues to lag behind its
competitors in this arena those games
that are here play very well low impact
apps like sparkle 2 and rise of glory as
well as high demand titles like asphalt
8 play with nary a hiccup on the 1520
the rear mounted speaker is clear and
very loud and the IPS display does a
great job of rendering graphics the
saturation and contrast high enough that
we didn't really miss the AMOLED
technology from other Lumias
the screen also does justice to the
output from the 1520's camera it's not
the 41 megapixel monster from the Lumia
1020 but the 20 megapixel shooter here
is still PureView optically stabilized
with a 6 element carl zeiss lens and the
new integrated nokia camera app with
automatic shooting modes alongside
professional manual controls the photos
it produces are quite nice outdoors with
crisp lines and authentic colors if
sometimes it touch on the oversaturated
side in keeping with Nokia's reputation
sometimes indoor results are just as
good but other times more noise creeps
into the image than we'd like then the
automatic white balance isn't always
consistent thankfully the 15 20 lives up
to Nokia's name in low-light photography
the same trends by and large hold true
in video output as well with a lot of
fuzz in this challenging lighting
situation on an Amtrak train but
beautiful crisp colors and nice sound
even with a face full of Sun and wind in
this video shot from a ferry boat
you may have noticed a bit of wiggle in
those videos because the 1520 just isn't
as comfy to shoot with thanks to its
size that cumbersome nature is also
evident when putting the phone up to our
ear the 1520 is just as much a monster
up to the head as any other phablet
but fortunately Nokia's excellent voice
quality more than makes up for the
awkwardness in private and in
loudspeaker calls and those calls can go
on for quite a while AT&amp;amp;T voice network
in the Greater Boston area is just as
reliable as its LTE network is speedy
we had no carrier complaints in the 12
days we carry the device and the huge
3,400 milliamp hour battery means we
weren't looking for a power outlet all
that often will have more battery life
impressions in our written review at the
end of the day the Lumia 1520 is a
monster but a friendly lovable one it
doesn't do all it can to leverage its
massive screen and it's bound to be just
too big for many people's pockets but in
a world where gargantuan smartphones
seem here to stay for the moment the
1520 gets a lot right it packs the best
specs of any Windows Phone to date while
keeping compromise to a minimum so it
gets a score in line with its fellow
mammoth competitors we give it an 8
point 4 out of 10
