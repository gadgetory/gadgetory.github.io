this is your first look at z launcher a
new Android launcher from Nokia
we tried Z launcher on an lg g3 this
morning shortly after nokia took the
wraps off it installation was a cinch
with the direct download from Nokia's
special website Z launcher comm there's
a limited number of beta downloads
available so go snap one up if you're an
Android user and you're seeing this
video early enough loading it up and
installing it just like any other
launcher so the main advantage of the Z
launcher is that it's supposed to learn
what you use most often on your phone
over time so this video is obviously not
going to cover that because we just
installed it but let's take you through
the interface true to Nokia's roots this
is minimalism at its most elegant
there's nothing extraneous on the
homescreen just some core apps down at
the bottom and a clock and calendar up
top since it's just a launcher things
like the notification tray and the
Google now gesture aren't affected and
tapping any of these elements takes you
to the stock apps on the phone so your
experience will vary from phone to phone
there's no manual control over what apps
appear in the middle again the phone
learns what you want over time and
presents it so in theory if you always
tell your friends what you're eating at
lunchtime the launcher would put
Facebook or Twitter on the top of this
list at noon but everyone needs to
manually launch an app sometime and for
that nokia gives you an alphabetized
list similar to the one on Windows Phone
or you can be fun and trace the first
few letters of the app or contact you're
looking for anything over four letters
will trigger a Google search but about
half the time the phone just ignores it
and dumps you back to the homescreen
it's an early beta after all we'll have
more thoughts on the Z launcher in the
days ahead for now we're just happy to
see the other new Nokia still bringing
interesting moves to the smartphone game
