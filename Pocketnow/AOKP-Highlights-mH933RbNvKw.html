past I've shown you an awful lot of
custom roms roms that aren't distributed
by the big name brand manufacturers HTC
Samsung and the like well my favorite
one has been cyanogenmod today i want to
show you AOKP and it's full of pink
unicorns let's go take a look this is my
samsung galaxy nexus the GSM variety now
I'm going to shoot two videos for you
here one that is just kind of a an
overview of a couple and when I say a
couple I mean just one or two really
cool features of a okp build 31 and then
another one that's really in depth but I
gotta warn yet it's long it covers
everything that I could find but it's
it's a watch so if you want really
in-depth detail after this video I'll
have a link at the end so you can watch
that full length video and see all the
details in it but i want to show you
just the highlights so what you'll see
here just your traditional home screen
with your traditional buttons down in
the navigation bar but watch what we can
do here let's go into settings and into
rom control and navigation bar now from
there what i want to do is change the
navigation button quantity and let's
bump that up to five you'll notice down
here that it automatically refreshed so
we've got now the stock three and then
two more that yes they are unicorns we
can change that though so let's go ahead
and do that down here in our navigation
bar buttons we have one two three four
five in fact we have 10 because we not
only have the buttons but we also have
the long press action for those buttons
so you can have these things do 10
things if you want to you can set up the
action you can set up the icon so let's
go ahead and let's change this tasks in
position three
home so we're just going to change that
to home quick and easy let's change
position to to be back and let's change
position for rather to be or is it
recent is what they call it the task
manager so now we've got our three icons
they're nice and centered but we've got
a couple of others that we can do what
can we do with those okay check this out
first of all if you want to change the
icon you can you tap over here and it
will actually take you to a pic or an
image picker you essentially pick a
whether it's jpg a ping whatever from
your gallery and put it in here you even
have the option to crop it to make it
fit the way that you want it to now I
don't have any of those I assume that
you could go out and get like an icon
pack and just put a folder in there that
you can choose from but if you tap over
on the left side that's where you can
assign that the action itself so again
right side icon left side action just
like it says your action icon so let's
change one and see what we can do well I
use my phone to make phone calls so
let's put a phone dialer down there what
do you say we r l to do that we're going
to go to a custom app and then an
application and from here we are going
to go to phone and there's my phone icon
you can see that showed up down here
well another thing that I do with my
phone a lot is I look for contacts I
look up my people so for that let's come
down here to button one long press
action again custom app applications and
we're going to come down here to people
now you noticed in that other list there
were some other things like contact and
direct-dial if there's someone that you
call all the time a significant other
espouse a parent whatever you can do
that and just set it so you can long
press on that and it will say
automatically call that person that has
pocket by all written all over it for me
so that's why I'm not doing it let's go
ahead and do another and then i'll show
you can how these work I also do email a
lot so let's do a custom app over here
again applications and there
my gmail but I also use this for the web
a lot so let's go back and set up
browser so now if I long press there's
my browser if I single press there's my
gmail which I haven't set up on this rom
yet no problems there go back home if I
want to call somebody there's my dialer
and if i want to go to my contacts there
you go I don't have this set up
obviously but there's my contacts so
very very cool awesome what you can do
with it if we come in here and take a
look there are just tons and tons and
tons of things that you can do the other
cool thing that i want to show you in
this video and we'll save all the more
in-depth stuff for the next video check
that out all of your toggles are up here
you can add to these toggles you can
rearrange them you can just all kinds of
stuff you can even change the style if
you don't like the toggling you want
more of the power control button you can
do that too one thing that I don't like
about this if you tap on the Settings
button it just hides those toggles it
doesn't take you to settings if you tap
it again it brings them back I'd still
like that to take you right into your
settings but hey I'm not going to
complain about that so very cool again
the roms name is aokp that's the android
open kang project say that again for you
the android open king project it is
based on AOSP it is available for free
and we will have a link where you can
get this like I said this is build
number 31 and we'll put that over in the
article at pocketnow.com for the full
length version of the video including
all the detail and when I say all I mean
lots and lots of detail go ahead and
click on the link at the end of the
video do you like seeing custom roms
give the video a thumbs up for pocket
now I'm Joe Levi
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
