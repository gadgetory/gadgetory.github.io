quad HD display other reports have
samsung wanting to buy new ones away
from Apple and if you're interested in
an easy way to root your android phone
geo hot might have your back I'm hi meri
beta tan slimmer and kind of ready for
action this is walking out daily let's
speak in today with what's official as I
know a lot of you were interested in the
Moto G up to the point where even though
the price tag was compelling you did not
have 4G LTE connectivity and you did not
have expandable storage and it gigabytes
is really not enough well the company
has just launched its 4G LTE variants of
the Moto G in the United States you can
buy it today for the crazy amount of 219
bucks yes this will buy you pretty much
a very high mid tiered smartphone with a
lot of great capabilities so link to the
script for full details are one you
could buy it buying scalp phones is kind
of common especially when you have a
phone like the one plus one which you
don't have it invite to get right now I
don't either and as it turns out
obviously there is a black market out
there they're awesome scalp devices that
are available for 400 bucks which is
actually just 100 bucks more than the
retail price not really bad but
according to one plus you should not buy
these Scout bones because these are
intended for the Chinese market they do
not have a cyanogenmod operating system
on it actually they have a typical
version that one plus offers from Oppo
and aside from that well you sadly don't
get a warranty on these phones so buyers
beware the river grille on the iphone 6
is pretty big and we get more leaks of
the design and we even get the first
leaked photos of the dummy unit for the
5.5 inch iphone 6 which apparently has a
different spot for the FaceTime camera
but that's really the only difference
now you're wondering exactly how Apple
plans to keep its retina display
technology or resolution on its phones
well get more rumors that there will be
a quad HD display on these smartphones a
apparently both of them which is hard to
really pinpoint exactly what ppi were
getting us obviously these are just
rumors but stay tuned this could make
these phones compelling especially if
Apple figures out what else to do with
the home screen
you know and speaking of apple one of
the most important features that iphones
offer is siri and we know that it's been
famous ever since its launch on the
iphone 4s but the reason why it's
powered is because there's this company
called nuance which provides the
technology and nuance is also in charge
of s voice and other services from
Panasonic and even the Smart TVs from
Samsung but it seems that this is so
valuable to Samsung that the company is
planning to buy new ones which is
currently valued at 5.5 billion dollars
so yeah even though Apple hasn't made it
public that it wants to buy the company
as well it should be the case as a
obviously shouldn't fall into the hands
of competition right and probably for
the very interesting news of the day I
know that rooting android smartphones is
cool for a lot of you but it's really
not that easy for a lot of us I mean you
don't own a windows computer if you
don't know your way around certain
smartphones rooting them is really
complicated for the average human but
you remember geo hot the guy that used
to jailbreak iphones and then got sued
and so many other things that happen to
the guy the guy just launched this new
service called towel route and it routes
almost every android smartphone
according to him but even more primarily
samsung smartphones from AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon which are really tough to route
unless you have a lot of services and
you know all your way around Odin and a
lot of stuff and this is just the APK
you downloaded it routes your smartphone
works on the galaxy note 3 works on the
galaxy s5 and pretty much every other
phone according to him but i may speak
to the question of the day how important
is it for you to root your smartphone is
your smartphone root it right now in my
particular case i have had so much
trouble trying to root my old galaxy s4
and note 3 because of the whole knock
services that yeah I'm definitely gonna
give this a try trust me I'm just gonna
finish putting this video together and
I'm gonna give it a try but leave us a
comment down below how important is it
to you and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video with Spanish Apollo was on
pagano comment subscribe to youtube
channel as well you also follow me on
Twitter Jaime lenders quarterly data
