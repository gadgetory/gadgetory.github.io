weekly hello and welcome to episode
double 09 of the pocket down weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discussed news and opinion from
the world of mobile technology
smartphones tablets phablets of every
color shape and size I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket
now and I'm joined by our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to you good morning and video
extraordinaire and iOS expert the man
from Honduras Jaime Rivera good morning
to you good morning how's everything oh
you know terrific listeners thanks for
tuning in again our last podcast was a
special edition podcast from Berlin as
you may recall and that is where our
managing editor aunt Tandy Naja is this
week he's back in Berlin correcting for
an error that was not his fault there's
an apple mishap actually which I'm sure
he will be more than happy to tell us
about when he returns but he's not here
this week and but so what we will miss
him but but this week's episode is is no
less special because there has been a
ton of news in fact that is a huge
understatement there has been so much
news between now and when we did our
last podcast that i'm frankly
overwhelmed i was putting the outline
for this together and it's just it's
outrageous how much happened this week
this is easily the biggest week that
I've encountered since coming aboard is
it is it would you would prefer to say
this is the biggest week this year
Brandon Hyman yeah I'd say so I mean
this I mean this week we have we get
really busy when announcements happen
because then we follow up with you know
editorial and video and we sort of we
sort of do what we do best during these
periods of time and it's been it was
kind of boring actually in the summer
for a while the last the last three
weeks we had you know we had nokia we
had motorola microsoft wait that's part
of the nokia event we had the iphone 5
announcement next week HTC there's also
an LG
announcement next week which actually
right which actually I don't know if
that many people know about but you know
this we have to keep in mind that this
is all for for the holiday season so
that when you go and buy your loved ones
some technology you've got the latest
ingredients to choose from and you'll
know you'll pay for it um yeah but but
but it's it's fun for us and actually
yesterday the iphone 5 announcement it
was our biggest traffic day in our
12-year history so i'm very grateful to
everyone that read our stuff that
commented we had so much good discussion
on the site and you know i'm really
proud of the pocket no team in
particular for for doing such a good job
with their writing in their videos it
was a fun day thank you sir right back
at you it was it was nice to you know
but when i was putting the podcast
together actually brandon had sent out
this email to everybody indicating that
it was such a an awesome day for us
yesterday and that's great because you
know we spend when we're following these
announcements you know we're spending
all this time kind of just getting all
the information together and then the
hours afterwards are spent cobbling
together opinion pieces and stuff and
we're going to talk a little bit about
that today so why don't we when we do
that do we have there's so much has
happened and part of the reason that I'm
really glad to have high me on the show
today is because he is our kind of our
resident iOS what would you call
yourself I'm a maven superfan does the
I'm just the iPhone guy the iPhone guy
right so if you know listeners long time
readers have no this Joe Levi is kind of
our Android focus guy Adam lien is our
windows phone 8 expert and then hi Mei
is our iOS guy and then you know the
rest of us all of course love love of
our own particular platforms I would
have been the webos guy if I'd come
aboard a year earlier um and you know in
yada yada so let's let's just jump right
in here I want to talk about those
apples finally announced the iphone 5 we
have a ton of editorial content but just
I meet can you just take us down like
the bullet points of yesterday like what
what this brings to the table that's an
improvement over the 4s just for a
review ballpark figure is we've got a
longer device that's thinner that's
lighter that's more powerful but it's
sadly running iOS
which is and not my not my cup of tea
sadly i think i'm just spoiled by iOS 5
it was just so big it was such a big
change that i was expecting for our for
you know for the iphone 5 to bring
something different I mean the 4s wasn't
really great but it brought Siri and it
was good enough for that to sell so the
iPhone 5 is a beautiful design really
nice the 4-inch form factor is the sweet
spot for me um but sadly that's that's
pretty much it when it comes to hardware
that's the only thing you get 4G LTE you
get a new a6 processor which is nobody
knows if its quad-core not we know that
I think it's dual core with a great
architecture which just makes it even
faster than some quad core processors
but again it's just the real it's just a
really nice design with last year's
software that's what it is it's so funny
you say that i was going if if Michael
said to me Brandon what do you think
about the iphone 5 I was going to say I
was gonna say three thumbs up for the
hardware four thumbs down for the
software and I may just said that in
more or less words and I totally agree
yeah and imagine I I believe somebody a
very handsome member of the team wrote a
piece called the iphone 5 tomorrow's
hardware running yesterday's software
again very very handsome I don't think
that's on the list of our attributes
well I think you know I think it's nice
that world got him on the same page here
I III want to talk about the software in
a second but the hardware you know
there's a lot to like here first of all
it is always interesting to me to see
where our reader base sits and you know
on a big news day like this you get a
lot of comments you get a ton of
feedback from the community and you can
really kind of get to feel out at least
the most vocal members of the community
and it is amazing how how these people
don't want to give Apple any slack
whatsoever because most of our readers
are not what you would call Apple fans
the thing is I wrote that piece that I
just talked about tomorrow's hardware
running yesterday software and I got
something like 33 comments in a few
hours
and any comment that disagreed with any
element of my piece was disagreeing with
me giving apple any credit whatsoever
for the hardware like there were no
defenders you know leaping to two apples
you know defense everyone was just like
what do you mean tomorrow's hardware but
I think that we have to really give up a
little some credit here and I know I may
we have some industrial design kind of
quanta qualms to talk about but uh I
think as an extrapolation of what was
happening on the 4s this is an okay
improvement oh it's it is an improvement
I mean to be honest with you I you know
I was starting to talk about you know in
the last double-oh-seven podcast about
how jumbo phones are just becoming too
uncomfortable and and you weren't
agreeing with me with the HTC One X for
example which in my prop my problem is
with the phone is the weight
distribution of the phone is just so bad
that the phone is just too heavy on the
One X and the One X yes which you don't
get that problem with the Galaxy Nexus
or the galaxy s3 for example even though
it's a jumbo phone and what I like about
the iphone for the iphone 5 sorry is the
fact that it's it's bigger but it's not
that big and it's much lighter so i am
expecting for the experience to be good
I just I don't know I'm just the the
design is is good I mean they figured
out a way to use aluminum back like in
the first generation iphone and instead
of using plastic at the bottom what they
did was use glass for the antennas which
is really smart but let's just hope
we're not gonna have antenna gain issues
with this phone then we'll just have to
wait for the phone to be released to
guess those are that's glass on the top
and bottom of the back of the back plate
is that correct yeah and you know it's
funny because when I did the first
impressions video I said you know
finally you don't have to worry about
cracking the back you drop your phone
but actually that wasn't exactly right
because now you've got three pieces of
glass to crack and not to although
that's the you know it seems that the
the glasses is isn't in a place that
wouldn't get hit and you for example
would it would hit the edge first but
it's still glass and you know it's
beautiful and everything but it's you
know I thought in this case I get away
without needing a case even though I
never use a case anyway and I destroy my
phone's you slam your phone
to ya what come on guys you slam your
phone I've never seen anybody let's
treat their phones more than I mate what
you don't realize is that I'm doing
durability tests when I slam I constant
durability testing over the glossary
Lipton I've got so much data on
durability phone that's unreal you're
the perfect editor for after the buzz
man you really tell people what to
expect yeah um I this is this kind of
segues nicely what we're talking about
Hardware on the iphone 5 here because I
like while I appreciate it i think that
it is a little bit dull but also it's
different and it's different in some
ways that are you know obviously the
headphone jack has been moved to the
bottom yuck that you've right I'm it
does not like that I don't really mind
that I don't know I got used to it on my
galaxy nexus but what's interesting as
you look at the bottom while you're
looking at that and you see the
speakerphone you know the speaker holes
alongside the new dock connector are
much much larger there they're drilled
out to a larger degree and it kind of
looks I really cheap and yeah kind of
really ugly you mentioned this in a
piece that you should read called what
would Steve Jobs say about the iphone 5
which I want to talk about right now
because this is a fascinating topic this
phone got a little bit of buzz behind it
on based on the fact that maybe it was
the last prototypical iphone that Steve
Jobs saw before he you know left the
company yeah you don't think so it hit
me know what's what's what's the story I
don't think so see if you notice Apple
Design look at any of the macbooks look
at any of their previous products and
you'll notice that the back of any
product that they've launched it only
has at most two different colors or two
different materials but that's that's it
and everything is either centered on one
area or the other like for example on
the macbook all you have is aluminum
with a shiny apple or with the ipad you
have just the back with the little apple
and I don't know you've got two pieces
of glass one at the top and one at the
bottom then you've got an apple in the
middle then you've got aluminum then
you've got everything looking like a
checkerboard that
totally changes when you go into the
borders and then you've got class at the
front and then you look at the bottom
and the speakers are not even
symmetrically designed one is larger
than the other and I'm like man Steve
Jobs would have been like what what what
is this I mean this is not apple you've
never seen a macbook pro with with the
one speaker larger than the other you've
never seen that and I don't know it I
don't feel that Steve Jobs would have
been proud of this design I mean yes the
the product is thinner can you believe
that this phone is actually almost half
lighter than the Nokia Lumia 920 that
hasn't even been launched so yeah there
are a lot of things that are going to
set the bar for the next smartphones to
come next year when it comes to thinness
and lightness probably materials but
then the design aesthetics of the device
just don't look like steve jobs at all
can we talk about that for a second I I
am magnet I'm a rapidly dwindling
minority member when it comes to wait on
smartphones I don't like I don't want a
lighter phone when the iphone 4s came
out or the four came out and i hefted at
it and it you know yeah it's heavy okay
heavy to me says quality heavy to me
says it's it's built of materials that
are going to last like stainless steel
not aluminum you know like like hardened
glass and not plastic you know so it's
like I don't know I don't want a lighter
phone I I found it to be I found it
quite disappointing when they said that
this was a lighter device am I crazy
you're crazy I think right good I think
they you know we Jaime was talking about
you know how device feels in the hand
and it's so mysterious to me how how a
device like the the 1x feels not so good
for my hands typing whereas i get the
galaxy s2 which is plasticky on the back
and there's just something about the
weighting of the phone and it can't be
too light I agree Michael that makes it
feel weak and cheap and in substantial
but it can't be too too heavy to where
your hands get tired and it's just it's
almost some some mysterious quality and
engineering that that must go into
getting a phone to weigh the right
amount I've got faith that the iPhone 5
is light
uh to where it feels amazing but it's
heavy enough to where it feels
substantial and high-quality I mean
they're not going to they're they're not
going to release a product that people
would say oh this feels like it's like
air in my hands chintzy right yeah I'll
give you an example and and you're gonna
agree with me on this one how do you
feel about your Galaxy Nexus I feel like
it's broken oh you sorry red no no
really how do you feel when you hold
your Galaxy Nexus and type away I
personally I I felt like I was coming
home after I gave up a review device and
I came back to the Galaxy Nexus I felt
like that was the perfect device for me
you know a lot of people criticize the
hump at the bottom but that weight
distribution of the hump allows for the
phone to feel light but not too light
and in my case I do a lot of typing on
phones I do and even though i love the
1x i love it to death it's the most
beautiful phone i've ever owned yeah my
problem with it is the weight
distribution is so high at the top that
my pinky fingers become tired of holding
the phone as i try to tight it's gotta
be that image sense chimp up there I
don't know what an amazing Canada I
don't I don't know what it is I just
feel that the Galaxy Nexus is a great
example of a well-designed smartphone
hump and all it feels great in the hand
and and the iphone for the iphone 4s in
the 4 and even the 3gs what i liked
about the device is that it wasn't so
heavy it was heavy up to the point where
it then feel cheap but it wasn't too
heavy in order for me to enjoy holding
it while i typed so I'm expecting for
the for the iphone 5 to feel the same
that's just me yeah I hope so I you know
we we will see there's a I'm kind of
still looking at the the spec sheet here
we have this it enhanced camera as well
which which interested me first of all I
don't want to give the thing short
shrift on the display because this
display this new 16 by 9 4 inch display
is still with retina resolution at the
three and 126 PPI but their Apple is
claiming forty four percent more color
saturation uh so it's so funny that they
say that because then I think I myself
this phone has to have over saturated
color because
the iphone 4s had one of the best
screens and then I take out my 4s and I
look at the icons and I'm like you know
what this this green could be a lot
greener and this blue could be bluer and
so is it because you've spent so much
time from Samsung phones like with Super
AMOLED with the really poppin color or
you know I I think so i think i think
Super AMOLED screens kind of set the
benchmark in color saturation yeah and
else lcds by design have lower color
saturation so and and you know if you if
you pull up a black screen on the iphone
4s it's not entirely black it's like
really dark grey yeah so I mean maybe
they fix that maybe they have some of
the characteristics of AMOLED with the
quality of LCD I we will see I it was
one of the things that I was very happy
to see in the announcement it's so nice
to see a company focus on something
other cuz apples already won that you
know the pixel war right like it's like
here look the it's it's a Retina quality
display we're going to call it whatever
we want but it's a really high pixel
density display so the next thing we're
going to do is do color better and I
think some people probably wouldn't
agree i think people Brandon I think
you're one of the ones who kind of
prefers more accurate color whereas I
have this really tacky element of my of
my taste where I'm like no man if
there's color I want I want super color
you know I want there to be like the
greenest green I've ever seen just
popping off the screen yummy so yeah and
just to give you I some of the comments
yesterday on our post for like I can't
believe this iphone doesn't bring a
high-definition display 720p anyways I'm
like why would you want 720p on such a
small screen it's it's it's a good point
honey but it's also kind of ridiculous
if you think about it because when the
iphone 5 plays back video and it'll do
it without letterboxing or black bars
it'll have two down sample 12 1280 by
720 into 11 36 x 640 which which is it's
not really true to life and it's also
kind of weird and not standard it is
yeah it's a very odd set of numbers
there that you don't see very often um
you've got a good point there yes yes I
mean I'd
feel how much how much what would be the
pixels per inch of a 720p display on
four inches no don't worry about making
the numbers I'm just um do you really
think the downtown sampling will make
any difference on a screen that small is
the question I mean 720p makes sense on
a 4-point x 45 inch screen but on on a
foreign screener I don't know I don't
know uh answer is 3 367 all right in the
calculation that would be the headaches
per inch frating yeah that's that's
gonna be insane I mean I'm not trying to
say that Apple shouldn't have brought an
HD display probably that's what we're
gonna see in the next iPhone 6 let me
let the rumors begin yeah that was like
one of our favorite tweets from
yesterday was like after today now we
can all start looking forward to the
iphone 6 yeah but but still I'm just you
know for all those that are bashing the
display I want to see to believe Apple
has done a good job ever since the four
and I don't think this displays gonna
disappoint even though it's not HD I
don't think it's kind of disappointing
they're really but I have a question
about that my roommate posed to me while
I was drawing up the outline for the
podcast here actually which is about the
developer question you know we saw at
the announcement yesterday there was
some discussion about existing apps
running with black bars to the left and
right in landscape and how iOS is you
know development framework makes it easy
to to scale up your apps if you want to
and then they showed off CNN an open
table which they always love showing off
all these companies just love love
pimping open table I've never used it I
should use it I guess but like what do
you what is the story there like is it
as easy as as Apple is saying or are we
going to have a long period sort of like
we had with the initial iPad we're like
we're kind of running scaled up apps
waiting for apps to be rewritten for a
while well the good thing is the pixels
aren't really changing when it comes to
density so the app is still going to
look good all you're gonna have is two
black bars on the top and the bottom 888
pixels of 88 pixels that's right um the
only problem you'll have and if anybody
relies on old you know old applications
that were designed by people that are
probably not
supporting them anymore like the free
apps from from from the beginning that
is going to be a problem because most
likely those applications are going to
stay that way for example i have this
converter application that's free and
i've had it ever since the fourth a
mount for example and i don't see any of
that i haven't seen any updates for that
happen in a year so so most likely yes
those kind of applications are going to
be you know sadly not going to be
updated um but again it's it's going to
be cumbersome at the beginning but like
like we saw with the iPad or like we saw
with the iphone for all it took
developers was probably a month and i
think it took more for apple to approve
the apps than for the changes to be a
hammy approved so and you know one thing
about the iowa six sdk is that it
includes a way for for applications to
be dynamic so that they can work on both
larger displays and short of this place
so i think that that's all they have to
do i don't think it's gonna take long
yeah and in fact when when the ipad 3
came out i was very closely watching how
long it would take for the apps to be
updated for retina and and all not all
but I a big percentage of the major apps
like New York Times and Amazon and so
forth were updated by day one because
because they had like a week or two or
three or however long the pre-order
period was to get it ready but you know
I think that developers are getting
really used to this process where Apple
changes the hardware and they have to
they have to scramble to update the
software so I I think a month might
actually be a bit longer than then it's
actually going to take it's probably
going to be more like two weeks or three
weeks and and something else I actually
want to mention um that's sort of
interesting so Android has crept up in
resolution over time you know the g1 was
like what hvga and then we got wvga and
then we got qhd then we got 720p and we
really haven't gotten above 720p but
with each each iteration of screen
resolution what has happened to the apps
they've basically been stretched out
right yeah yeah but and even in a lot of
cases we talk about this all the time on
the podcast you get like a like a
like a transformer prime infinity with
1920 x 1200 resolution and you run the
Twitter app on it and it is just like
discussed comical it's comical it's like
a three-year-old could have could have
done something like that but what act
but what Apple does is they
interestingly frame it differently when
I think it was Phil Schiller when he was
talking about the increased amount of
pixels going you know up beyond the 960
going to the 1136 he didn't say you know
you know it won't take very long for for
developers to stretch out their abs he
said he won't take very long for
developers to figure out ways to make
apps better and take advantage of that
screen space here are several examples
of before and after and so what he is
doing by standing on stage and saying
that is that he's paving the way for
higher quality apps than even we're
seeing today on the iPhone because he's
saying that these apps should not be
just stretched they should be better it
should be really designed to be better
yes exactly and and you don't see the
Google guys really talking about this
much as I just interesting still you
don't and ambien we've been talking
about this since since the podcast
started since before which in since I
came aboard since before then you know
is this Google's lack of focus on on
creating an application environment you
know I on incentivizing developers to
build tablet-optimized apps or write
apps off 24 different screen sizes I
agree and I guess one of the problems
with that is just that if I'm a
developer I'm gonna go crazy developing
apps for six different screen sizes
right where is now with with iOS you do
basically to you do ipad and and an
iphone / ipod touch and now you gotta
get I I think it'll I think it'll be
three because obviously the 4s and the
poor are still gonna remain true rats
good point yeah and then you and then
you've got the ipad 2 so that's actually
what that's for well I don't know I mean
I don't know if you were if you actually
have to make four separate apps or if
it's a situation like you make one and
app for the iPad 2 and then it's got
some extra lines of code to boost the
resolution and some some placement
changes for the ipad 3 I don't know it
works that way I will leave that for
developers but yeah it'll be interesting
i just i do like the approach also i
find that ironic that
android being a software company doesn't
push this any any further than Apple
does but you know aside from my
curiosity of how the how developers will
handle this on iOS I wonder what
developers are going to do windows phone
8 you know with new screen resolutions
and everything you know yeah that's a
really good question but anyways that's
another topic it is but we've got um III
while we're talking about this so I
don't leave the iphone quite yet because
we have we've covered the hardware but I
have a question and this is kind of a
personal question so we're gonna get to
know each other a little bit better and
am I crazy am I and I want to ask this
to both of you but hi may I think you
are the one I'd like to ask first like
because you love the iOS ecosystem
you're an iPhone guy or an iPad guy ah
but I am so tired of iOS of iOS is kind
of visual aesthetic and I have to check
myself sometimes because I'll write a
piece like I rode yesterday and I'll be
like is it just me being a UI snob does
does everyone else can everyone else
live with this kind of static grid of
icons that we've had since 2007 you
mentioned before that you're not a fan
of it but how much a gear enough of a
fatter like you can tolerate it like
you're sticking with the platform is
your daily driver and you still like it
so what is it about that I mean like
what first of all what would you like to
see changed and second of all why why
are you not jumping ship and don't say
ecosystem lock in because that's a
cop-out haha he's gonna use gonna say
that ecosys ecosystem wagon oh yes I
have 250 apps out of which I own over
300 I've got 30 gigabytes of music out
of which I've purchased around I don't
know like like a half of it I've got
books I've got movies it's more of an
ecosystem walk out but um probably to be
honest with you let's just be frank
about this I hate the grid of icons but
when you were writing that piece and as
I was reading it yesterday I you know I
there were certain there was just one
aspect that I didn't agree with and it
was the title um because you know its
iOS is not really
yesterday's software in my personal
opinion okay just I just I feel for
example Syria I mean try to compare
Syria with us boys you just can't no but
I mean I'm in the most literal sense
Siri is old like Siri is yesterday's
news because she came out at which is
coming on the 4s right there was a year
ago I mean this long yep yeah but the
thing is it'll still be not yesterday's
heart software since not not nobody else
has been able to do it s voice is trash
on google's voice searches is getting
better but it's not there yet so yes
sirree makes the operating system look
new but yes if you have to ask me about
the grid of icons I hate them I can't
believe that Apple at this point in time
five years later they haven't figured
out how to make those icons animated I I
find it stupid that you have a clock
icon that doesn't give you've got it
you've got a weather icon and this is
stupid I've got this application called
Celsius which in the United States you
could buy a spare in height and the only
reason i buy it is because the badge at
the top gives me the real temperature
and it's it's just stupid i mean how can
i OS not do that right only 73 degrees
yeah it's always 7th right in its eye
and you know i probably my biggest
letdown and this is true is when I saw
iOS 6 beta 2 and I send it to you and I
and I and I begun looking looking at the
update and I saw that the that the
Settings icon begun animating itself
movie with the update I was like oh my
god okay fine we're fine we're not gonna
get widgets but we're gonna get animated
icons fine I could live with that and
then boom you know that's my point ever
since the beginning of this podcast I
love the iphone 5s design yes I do um I
hate the software iOS 6 is boring yeah
you're really boring is it like a
Cadillac with the Buicks internals I
think you said exactly that exactly
that's what i said it's we've got a
Ferrari here in design and everything
and then we've got the interiors of the
Buick I completely agree now how how is
I mean Brandon are you on the same page
there or you uh what's your what's your
thing yeah I am on the same page and you
know for me it's about
it's about control because I'm someone
of the control freakin in my life my
wife doesn't really like that about me
but um so you know one of the reasons I
I feel like I use Android half the year
and I use iOS the other half and Windows
Phones like maybe for a month or two um
I I always come back to Android because
I can control everything so if I want to
have my home screen give me my agenda
with my battery percentage and a quick
shortcut to call my wife I can do that I
can do anything that I want and then I
take out my iphone and even if I wanted
to I couldn't make it look different I
can change the wallpaper whoop-dee-doo I
can add more folders which open to
slowly anyway what they do I can move
around the icons but I can't even place
them where I want because they're
aligned to a left alignment grid right
so for me it just it gets it gets
exhausting using the iPhone because I
that that sense of control that I have
it just cannot be fulfilled now because
you can you can you do all that if you
jailbreak yeah not really not really um
there are winterboard options but
they're not they're not great salary how
breakings a dirty practice uh yeah the
winter boards the winterboard themes
aren't great i jailbroke my suffered
yeah i jailbroke my iphone 4 and i did a
series of videos showing some pretty
cool stuff you could do like you can you
can really you can android a Phi it a
little bit but what happens is because
jailbreaking is even less supportive
then than a you know hacking Android
things get slow fast and then suddenly
you don't get software updates and it
just gets dirty real fast yeah I was
that is a good counterpoint because I
was definitely going to bring up the
point that this is the same man who said
to a to a listener be a man and and root
your Android I wish I wish y'all
breaking was a better story in iOS but
it's just last I checked and it's no
well maybe it's better but um that you
can control everything literally but it
just gets messy dirty and smell
really fast it's not it's not and I'll
give you a couple of examples I'm a
multilingual guy speak English in
Spanish and for example there are some
stupid things on iOS and I'm like why
why don't these guys fix it like for
example I sometimes one Syria to work in
Spanish but if i wanted to work in
spanish i have to go with iOS 6
obviously i have to go to settings and
then switch the language I mean how
could it be so difficult to put a stupid
button on Cirie that allows me to switch
the language that that's you know and
you know just to be fair with iOS iOS
customers okay what things do i love
about iOS try to read HTML email on
android nobody does email better than
the iphone that's just a truth and it is
it is i mean if you get HTML email on
android you get a small portion of it
and you have to pan around and with the
iphone you get everything centered it's
just smart um the messaging app is
better there are certain things about
iOS that are superior um but again as I
posted my editorial i feel that a Steve
Jobs said hey when the iphone came out
it was five years out of its time the
software was and he was right but the
problem is those five years ended max
and when you've got with when you've got
something like Android 4.1 jelly bean my
god I mean I would jelly bean it just
becomes difficult for iOS to compete
like that yeah i was i was thinking that
the other day i was using the iphone i
was on vacation recently and I'll using
the iphone because i love the camera and
i love to be able to take pictures they
show up on my ipad i get back to the
hotel room i can review them um but but
then uh right after i got back from my
vacation i used my galaxy s3 which is
jelly bean and I'm used to going from
the iphone to an android and being like
oh this is not as smooth and not as nice
but like that is not true anymore like
like you said hi make it like jelly bean
has fixed android to make it as smooth
and responsive isn't as as iOS and it
that's amazing because you know that
doesn't always happen I feel like other
platforms come out and you're like wow
if only this were a smooth that's say
iOS and then you kind of like wait and
wait and wait through iteration after
iteration it just never happens
and I think project butter is probably
one of the most under celebrated and
significant developments in Android ever
it's probably under celebrated because
it's on one point to two percent of
devices very true and yeah that's that's
a big Android problem but you're
absolutely right returning to an Android
device that's running jellybean like I
ihop back and forth between the ipad in
my Nexus 7 it is not at all the same
experience as it used to be hopping back
and forth between my iPad and say the
touchpad running ICS you know cm9
whatever you know so I completely agree
and it's the other manufacturers the
other software developers they're all
bringing the heat and Apple is going to
be caught with its pants down if it
stays with the the concepts behind iOS
as they are now for much longer and I
guess that that's my question I kind of
want to know we're nerds we're talking
about this from the standpoint of people
who love this stuff and who talk about
this stuff all day when is the average
Joe going to get fed up with boring
boring iOS because it's not happening
right now I still talk to people left
and right everywhere who are like oh you
don't have an iphone but why you know
with this kind of sympathetic town like
I can't afford one or maybe I'm stupid
or sometimes ya know it's yes it's
happening now it's happening now the
galaxy s3 is the best soul smartphone
for last month it's happening now when
had you ever seen android cell 20
million phones in a hundred days that's
what's happening now and you know it's
just funny because I got this comment
yesterday it was really good probably
the best car man I've ever read and with
and what the guy was saying was like the
reason why the iPhone is so successful
is because the average Joe wants
simplicity and you know the guys right
the guys right i mean i asked everybody
and everybody just want something simple
just what then work exactly they just
want it to work but then when you've got
something like the galaxy s3 that first
of all the design is beautiful um second
of all men Samson's marketing is
probably the best piece of work that
I've ever seen it's amazing they've got
marketing everywhere they've got
billboards in bathrooms I think I mean
you wanted a yes yes
one anyways I agree yeah they've got
they've got billboards in bathrooms
they've got they've gone where marketing
has never gone before it's very true and
I just I feel that they're doing a great
job and making Android relevant they're
doing a great job and you know its
product placement that's what that's
what it's called in marketing they're
doing a great job and it's been so well
and they've sold so many phones and
that's the point I mean the average Joe
is no longer the average show the
average Joe evolved five years ago no
longer is the smartphone a niche product
that's only base for geeks everybody has
a smartphone now and we said it an
episode double-oh-seven we can't really
impress anybody anymore anymore with a
smartphone everybody's got maps
everybody's got abs and so right now
everybody has a smartphone and they have
the choice of thinking the biggest hype
or the biggest what you know the iphone
is gonna end up being yesterday's phone
if Scott Forstall doesn't come out of
his comfort zone there's there's one
force here that I think we're under
estimating which is the fact that
everyone has an iphone let me explain
one of the reasons another reason i like
to use the iphone half of the year is
because all of my friends all of my
family literally have an iphone probably
because i told them to get one and and
what that means is that i can do things
with them I cannot do with other people
I can I message them I can now do shared
photostream I can facetime them I can do
find my friends with them all those four
things really really make it compelling
for me to pick up and use an iPhone and
that's I think actually a missed
opportunity for the iphone 5 yeah iOS 6
has shared photo streams so all those
millions and millions devices that are
capable of having iOS 6 will be able to
do that I think that's an awesome
feature but I really think that that
Apple could have come up with some other
interesting iPhone to iPhone technology
because finally it's not kind of pompous
to do that it's actually reasonable and
valuable because so many people have the
iphone mm-hmm I think shared photostream
is gonna go down I mean you've got
facebook already what's the point this
is all that's what i was thinking
yesterday i was looking at the
announcement I've never used photostream
because I don't have that iOS ecosystem
so maybe I'm exactly the wrong kind of
person to be thinking about that too but
Brandon you seemed like the perfect
example photostream is
coolest thing ever and shared
photostream um yeah you know I think it
is ridiculous that you can like you can
like a picture you can put comments on
it that's kind of stupid because that
kind of it's almost like the ping effect
right like we don't want we don't want
another place to like and do stuff you
want to stay on Facebook and Twitter and
whatever else and apple doesn't know how
to do social media they've proved that
more than once so they should not be
doing that I you should not they should
not be doing it but the fact that like
you know I'm at Michael imagine or you
know I imagine going to a bachelor party
all your friends have iphones and you
guys are just like you guys shoot
pictures and then they show up on your
friends phone and then something fun and
it's no longer like it's no longer like
hey look at the picture i took last
night it's it's like I I know I saw it
when I was walking back last night you
idiot look what you did at that crazy
all right and it and that's what Samsung
is trying to do with whatever there is
that book buddy share one of the
billions of features that they brought
up with the galaxy s3 where you have to
tap your phone against someone else's
phone no no no it's a continuous stream
it's just like photostream oh yeah
what's that the problem is it's not
across the entire galaxy product
portfolio you have to have a galaxy s3
ah at the moment which is ridiculous
even though it's selling so many
millions and millions of units it's
still not enough to get that critical
mass and i think you're right i think
Apple has reached that point with the
iphones you know penetration where it's
like oh yeah they can actually start
doing this and do this blackberry
messenger effect that worked so well for
rim back in the day because they were
sort of the only game in town even
though there were other smart phones out
there blackberry was a much more
prevalent choice uh you know the iPhone
5 is gonna be successful and it's gonna
be successful because and I'm gonna lay
this on the table Apple is showing
everybody how you launch a product on
more time they have a release date they
have pre-order time which is tomorrow um
ask ask anybody when is the Lumia 920
gonna be launched damn it it just pisses
me off it looks like every time you go
to an event they're like what does the
HTC One X going to come out and oh they
silently announced that in April um this
is what really infuriates me of
everybody else that's not Apple the fact
that I know when I can buy the phone and
I know what
and I know what carriers are going to
get it and I know when it's going to be
international and which options do I get
and I know that from day one so even if
the Nokia Lumia 920 is a superior device
when it comes to speeches and everything
on insulin after know people is that
people are not gonna waiting I'm not
gonna wait for it because it's there's
no defined period that they can say okay
on this day I'll be able to buy it I
just think about it it's the fall season
I mean how many people do you think are
gonna be waiting to know whatever nokia
is gonna be launching the product
they're not gonna wait and to be honest
with you this has nothing to do with
nokia i feel that milk is not at fault
here I feel like it's microsoft's fault
I didn't listen samson could not feature
the ateam s in their announcement
because the operating system was not
ready and the same thing happened with
no k I mean Adam was at the events and
they didn't even let him touch the
device because the operating system was
not ready so nokia if you're listening
to this please I love windows phone but
you need to go android if you want to
succeed bad ah look oh god that made me
feel bad inside yeah just personal did
you throw up in your mouth a little
Brandon I might have Koopa little guys
guys come on no I purse often Microsoft
has lost their edge they're behaving
like a government and not like a
software they are the others yes they
are sluggish they are they're crawling
their ponderously huge and they cannot
become agile again to save their lives I
agree listen we're already talking about
it let's talk about it that we haven't
even covered this okay the Nokia Lumia
820 @ 9 20 wherein head wait a second
wait a second before we move on to
windows when I just have a question for
you too um what color of iphone do you
want uh-huh that is so funny because I
actually have a screen up right now with
the two different colors because I'm
trying to design you're trying to decide
huh well I'll tell you I would get the
white one because I because 40 billion
people are gonna have the black one and
I want the white one let's see we that's
funny you say that because I thought it
would be the opposite we did a poll
yesterday let's see what the poor
results say the polls say I didn't put
this in the outline because uh well I
just I'm glad that you brought it up
homie um it seems like black is the is
the winner in terms
pocketnow cumshaw missed okay i'm
getting the white one by the way that's
me retail i feel i feel the black ones
cool it just it's like if we're
comparing a Ferrari with a Mercedes it's
just the black one looks futuristic but
the white one looks elegant that's not
why you're getting the white one you're
gonna you're getting the white one cuz
it photographs better oh yeah that's
true well to be honest with you yes it's
much easier to film a white phone on a
review than a black woman yes that's
that's another that's another point
another point no no III agree i think
the white one is is elegant i think that
is a nice word I feel like what he had a
pose that was like was it was it you how
many was kind of like lambasted other
people for for further endless praises
of the hardware but I feel like elegant
is exactly the right word for this kind
of thing yeah yeah I think that's that's
it hey guys before before we move on I
just want to bring up one more thing
with the iphone 5 yeah it's a big deal
something that I don't think anyone's
really talking about but I think it's an
interesting story so Apple tends to pay
attention to things that normal normally
are skipped over let me give you example
the magsafe adapter I mean previous to
that um people had these clunky adapters
that if you tripped over it your whole
computer would come crashing to the
ground it would be difficult to and put
it into the hole no she said jokes place
but um but here's a belittling very
interesting yesterday they redefined
reinvented a little bit the included
cheapo earbuds they're no longer cheapo
there they're a $29 accessory called
earpods that have been engineered and
studied over time and it's just really
interested they kind of D commoditized
the earbud for a sec yeah yeah they did
and I think that is significant yeah go
ahead i mean i'm looking forward to
trying them out i have no opinion on
them yet for the record the current
earbuds before those ear pods cost
twenty nine dollars just the same ah and
they are cheap oh oh yeah you know for
me that your pods I'd like to try to
believe I just want to try them out but
for me these these apple ear plugs which
I'm actually you
for this podcast because they've got
they've got a good microphone or at
least they try but you know they're good
i just like the controls that's the only
thing i like that's all i'm looking for
because their quality is you know I wish
tony was here because he hates I hate
them too III don't mind the earbuds
themselves but you know that the the
control module on the wire is the
perfect example of Apple taking form
over function way too far because it is
this beautifully squared off little you
know little button module on the wire
but it looks great but you wear a shirt
with a collar and that thing is getting
hung up all the time on your right side
collar and it's like popping out your
ear button it's the most annoying thing
and then Samsung having learned nothing
and forgotten nothing about copying
other people's BS that's exactly the
same thing on the set of earphones I'm
currently wearing and I am wearing a
collared shirt like I usually do and
just every time i turn my head it's like
BAM and just rips it out of my ear it's
stupid so it looks like the new ear pods
have tapered that design a little bit
and I'm that's probably what I'm most
excited about with the new ear putt yeah
hosting it's funny where we're using the
same headphones my boy years white too
yeah samsung white from the galaxy s3
yep yeah so so what's what's sort of
interesting to take this one step
further for a sec is that there's this
whole huge industry for really high-end
ear ear buds or earphones um but it's
really intimidating because they can get
three or four hundred dollars they have
very fancy acoustics that that only
audio files can really understand an
apple sort of has has brought that to
the masses and has sort of redefined
something that we all take for granted
these white earbuds that come in everett
with every iphone now they're now
they're potentially much better although
some people that were trying them on
some of the other tech sites said that
they were definitely better but not like
you know the three hundred dollar
headphones that you can you can get if
you do enough research they're they're
not made by Bose that's what they said
they're not they're not made by boos
although I I think true audiophiles
don't use bows products he's right right
but glad I've got a bluetooth pair of
sennheiser headphones that you know are
for audio files or at least audio files
who can tolerate bluetooth stereo and
they screw up all the time so I'm not I
have no faith or trust in or loyalty to
any sound hardware designer right now
because they've I've just had horrible
up with all them I don't know you want
me to say something about headphones I'm
just a desperate Apple i I just I just
I'm just surprised that Apple is not
using wire a wireless headset you know
if their headset is crashy anyways it's
trashy so why not make it wireless and
make some use of Bluetooth 4.0 I know I
don't know I don't know can they make a
better protocol or something I don't
know they could have done that with the
iphone 5 minute and they've been you
know that that's exactly good point
actually Apple has Apple loves
redesigning and reinventing stuff and
then re releasing it in a better form
and bluetooth you know wireless audio
desperately needs that because bluetooth
as a protocol for it in my opinion is
not very good I'm always dropping the
connection pairing as always not
necessarily difficult but at least
cumbersome there's so many better ways
to do it and nobody's done it yet
because for some reason we're all
married to having these tethers between
our ears and the thing in our pocket
that gets hung up on seat belts and
doorknobs and shirt collars and I am so
fed up with wires and speaking of which
and this is the last thing I want to say
about the iphone 5 for me you guys keep
keep talking about but the fact that we
didn't get wireless charging I nobody
else cares I know but I know nobody
cares but the fact that that Nokia is
rolling it out for their new devices is
awesome the fact that Apple couldn't
build that in and also didn't include
NFC another wireless standard that I
really like I i I'm just I was endlessly
disappointed by both of those things you
want me to tell you something about
wireless charging so so badly yes okay
whenever the charger is smaller than the
phone I'll probably like it well hold on
that that happened in 2009 shall I send
you my palm pre listen come on I've got
the part that I've got the pre three man
and that that that can rock that charger
rock that it included it's like um come
on what's the point of a wireless
charger of the charging port is going to
be so
big wait it's not bigoted something is
it something you're gonna be carrying in
your bag of it's so big its voluminous
no it's not yeah it is that it's a great
word no but it's not that's not the
point of the of the wireless charging
dock those live at home and when you
travel yeah you take your you know USB
cable with you and then you're reminded
of how convenient it is to have your
wireless charging at home I mean have
you ever used wireless charging on your
daily driver hi may not not a pre three
that's you know that you don't use no
not really and to the engine is amazing
but the read the reason is this before I
before I work the pocket now I used to
work in Airlines and I did that for 15
years and for me the size of every you
know for me I travel light so I am the
type of guy that looks for the smallest
accessories possible and if you ask me
the question and what I ever spent a
dime on a wireless charger my answer
would be no we even if something like
you left at home like it's not something
you would bring with you know because
I'd have to buy it and then why would I
buy another wireless charger when I
could just use the same wire it'll do
the same job and does the same job but
poorly like why would I buy an iphone
when I can just buy like a samsung you
know transform ultra I mean ultimately
they do the same job you know what I
mean like one of them does it better I
feel like I don't know here we go how
may I owe you about forty two beers for
all the favors you've done me so I think
instead of those I'm gonna I'm gonna get
you a wireless charger for a device of
yours and I'm gonna ask you to use it
for two weeks and then when I want to
revisit this conversation is there is
their sleeve you can put on the iphone
4s that makes it a work with a wireless
charging system yeah I think there is so
there is there isn't terrible it's the
powermat but it's just so big you're
like white and this is that's lame I
feel this is the problem when companies
don't really understand what enables a
product what enables a mobile phone is
for it to be light portable and easy to
carry around what enables a charger is
for it to be uninsured so when you have
a charger that's bigger or the same size
of the phone why would people ever want
to buy the separate thing now if you
include the wireless charger in the box
people are going to use it but nobody in
the right mind would ever buy it
separately that's
they were sold out on launch weekend for
the pre Aaron people will there is a
market for this and it is a cool thing
particularly if you build in like
location-aware features into it which is
also really cool like tectiles that
samsung is doing but I don't know we
should we can we can I do this now I do
it can I do this nokia little me no no
no not yet now i'm more thing course
though we're think I I think it's you
know it Apple solved a big problem with
the Lightning charging thing and I I
think it's got very unfortunate and
frustrating that once again they've
invented a new standard especially now
that we have to use that heinous
expensive stupid converter adapter yeah
but but I think it's really damn cool
that you can plug in the iphone uh
either a right side up or upside down
because so many times I maybe fumbled at
coming home from a night uh you know a
night out I don't know what I'm doing
for certain reasons and I try to plug in
the charger to my iphone and I I like
miss it because you have to look at the
you have to look at it to see the little
lines with you know you're on the top
yeah and that sucks and you know
microUSB is is sort of the same way
although I'm for some reason that's
easier i don't know why but but with
this lightning thing you don't even have
to think about it yes so my own my only
gripe with lightning you know is the
fact that i've got an itrip I've got so
many docs and and that you know I wish
that that adapter would have a way of
making the phone stand or something
because it for me all my accessories are
pretty much obsolete as of yesterday
yeah yeah yeah no it's true but you know
i'm not i'm not gonna use the accessory
that's it you know what's uh what's an
even cooler way of docking things and
you know transferring things and doing
stuff is like wirelessly which um you
know company out of finland nokia has
done okay let's move on to know oh thank
god okay um this is important because
there are some parallels here with the
iphone with the iphone launch and and
you know so we can still kind of tie an
apple of this because this is huge news
but the Nokia announcement happened on
September 5th which i think i was in the
middle of flying back from Berlin
and we had Adam covering the event in
new york city nokia released as everyone
knows that the Nokia Lumia 820 and 920
their new windows phone 8 handsets which
for me are just endlessly more exciting
than the iphone launch because nokia has
done some different stuff Dave we've
just discussed the wireless charging
obviously there are there doing the
polycarbonate thing but they're doing
this kind of like super glaze coating on
it which I don't necessarily like
there's what is this it's 32 gigs of
internal storage on the 920 that they're
calling the camera PureView which we
would need to talk about because I think
that's a total train wreck what I want
to ask I mean how does this how does
your excitement level between the two
devices compare hi may I think I know
your answer but I do want to have your
answer anyway but Brandon what which I
mean you use Windows Phones maybe two
months out of the year you said and yeah
what's your what's your situation on
this because I am really excited about
the 920 I'm glad the 820 is there but
you know the 920 is obviously where my
focus is um I don't know I tell me what
you're what you're feeling is on there I
I kind of always like Windows Phone
because for me it's got the reliability
the simplicity and the smoothness of iOS
but it gives you a little bit of that
Android pneus by allowing you to
customize your home screen and you know
I thought Windows Phone 8 was pretty
brilliant and allowing you to have
multiple resizable tiles although you
could argue that's not that brilliant
that's just a reasonable thing to do um
the the the Lumia 920 is um really
really sweet looking hardware the fact
that that screen is so high resolution
it's AMOLED it's got a dual-core
processor it's got windows phone 8 and
and by the way something that I didn't
realize until recently is in Windows
Phone 8 you lose the the right-facing
arrow button on your home screen
allowing you to have wider basically a
column isn't used up by by the black
yeah exactly exactly which which makes
the the home screen I think much more
usable and beautiful I think
this is just gonna be such a beautiful
experience and a beautiful phone and I'm
so excited about it and I love what they
did with the 820 with a removable back
because it's not it's not like a
gimmicky um you know skin that goes on
top of something it's like the actual
backing of the device that you can
change out and and I think that's cool
because I think it gets boring when you
have the same you know phone for two
years and maybe one day you decide I
want to be yellow tonight because I'm
going I want to match my my tuxedo
yellow yellow tuxedo that's gonna be
nice I won't be putting my I am really
excited about the 920 I think it's just
so premium looking the software's gonna
be amazing and I just I can't wait to
try it yeah I completely agree i like I
admire bold moves and Nokia didn't
depart too much from their Lumia 900
design with this but they've made some
significant changes and some feature
additions that are that are really
important meeting yeah exactly um hi
mate what's your you know what's your
feeling on this would you carry one of
these as you know as somebody okay as an
average guy for the record I will buy a
920 you would yes yes I'll look for it
in white and I'll buy one I do you know
the camera um the the screen the design
of the phone is just beautiful I like it
I really do I you know my biggest
problem with windows phone is that
you've got really genius operating
system it looks you know it looks really
good but I would always get pissed off
and taking a photograph I would never be
able to get a good photograph on anyone
those phone that I've used my software
oh yeah I mean not even on the Titan not
on the dell venue pro always the photos
are either moved or something and you
had that same experience with the Lumia
900 well then Lumia 900 had really
horrible optics but I used to samsung
focus for a number of months and I
really I got some really good photos out
of that one oh me too well okay that's
when I was about to tell you that's free
mango for some reason photos on Windows
Phone were great before mango and I
don't know what happened after mango
that's interesting i mean i think i was
running I was running mango on the on
the focus when I was when I was
cross country but so you think that's
something there was a serious software
tweak that really jacked up windows
phones yeah but but but as of the
operating system some really I really
have high expectancies for the Lumia for
you I do want I I do want the Lumia 920
that's me I the design is pretty much
the culmination of what the Lumia was
from the beginning and this is like okay
this is the perfected product here you
go and I feel that they've got a hit
there um sadly um the on the other side
I just I feel that the 820 is what the
920 should have been because you know
who's gonna buy 920 the 920 is going to
be bought by power users and the irony
is that you get expandable storage on
the 820 that you don't get on the 920
and then one of the things that I used
to love about HTC designed for example
is that you could remove the whole back
plate in order to leave only the screen
and then just switch the back plate so
if you if you if the phone fell off your
hands and you got a dented or something
all you had to do was buy a back plate
you have a new phone so that's that's
another thing that I like about the 820
and I just I feel that if they would
have brought the elements of the 820
when it came to you know expandable
storage and everything so the 920 would
have been a much better product do you
think that did you you as far as people
buying it you actually bring up an
interesting question in my mind do you
think that carriers will that nokia and
microsoft will strike another deal with
carriers to get them to so heavily
subsidize these like AT&amp;amp;T did with the
900 do you think there's I hope really
high focus push I hope but you know what
they did with the Lumia 900 was a
mistake because they priced it they
pressed it so aggressively that people
have the opinion of the Lumia 900 being
cheap I mean I see how that could could
be possible I don't know is that I mean
they sold a lot and they sell like four
million and two months or something no
no they didn't get that one they say
didn't get that far almost but listen
Lumia phones not Lumia 900 sorry yeah
that's not family I'm talking
specifically a balloon e900 and you know
just just to make a point I feel that
nokia has a really great product it is
the culmination of what they were
supposed to do years ago and you know
this is the nokia that i remember by the
way for the record my first three four
cell phones that i've ever owned were no
okay I was a no cab all the way a full
no get customer um and I'm just glad to
see Nokia come back to its roots of
design and just the whole package
looking as great as it does my only
disappointment is that I don't know when
it's gonna launch and I'm not gonna wait
for it that's just me Brandon I think
the Lumia 900 was uh was a badly timed
device it came out when did it come out
so yes CES when when was it actually
available for sale ah sure like I think
it was on our two months later yeah two
months later yeah it was in the spring
as I recall ya later than it was it was
a strange time they discounted it too
quickly the galaxy s3 was was coming out
and was was announced shortly thereafter
it was just stomped on Windows Phone 8
was announced and then the the horrible
horrible horrible news that Windows
Phone 8 would not be capable of running
on the the flagship windows phone um it
was just a lot of bad timing for the
Lumia 900 which you know I think if if
Microsoft was a little bit better at
executing and in terms of software
releases and planning and such I think
it could have been a lot bigger but
there was just so much against it well I
want to I want to ask you guys a
question yeah um and this is a personal
question um I like Windows Phone and I
know you guys do but have you ever done
the exercise of trying to give Windows
Phone to either a child or a senior
citizen or an average user and asking
them what they think about the operating
system it to gave it to him that they
got smoked by it she just smoked him
right away no seriously seriously
because you know I I gave my grandfather
a couple of months ago I gave him my
nexus one um and even though it was
complicated for him to learn android the
advantage of the skeuomorph in the
design just made everything easy for him
to learn the operating system and so did
i give my father and android phone last
week and he just liked it but the
problem is that i showed my father both
the dell venue pro and i showed him the
the HTC sensation and I I asked them you
know which one do you like the most and
he was like
I don't know I find the HTC device
better he was like and I just find that
the problem with Windows Phone and this
is probably going to happen to Lumia 920
also is you know Microsoft is just so
blind with their Metro UI that they
don't really know if people like it or
not it hasn't really sold in two years
so do you guys think that it's gonna
succeed because I don't think it is
sadly I mean if I if I if you tell them
talk talk to me about like my gut
feeling and stuff I mean it's I I have
very serious concerns about Windows
Phones future not because of Microsoft's
lack of trying I think they're gonna
keep throwing money at it until it
succeeds but that also might require
some changes I don't know if Metro is a
winning ticket i think Metro is so so
advanced it's such a strange unique
combination of retro and futuristic that
I'm not sure it will be accessible to
many to most people I remember the looks
I used to get though when i was at bars
with my focus you know and I'd have it
out on the table and it would light up
for some reason people be like oh my god
what is that is that true that's not
android is it you know so it it got
people's attention and people did seem
to like it in their time with it because
also that device happened to be very
responsive like most Windows Phone
devices so it has the ingredients for
success i'm not sure i don't think i
would ever advocate it to my to my
parents know or do my grandparents
earnings like that i don't think it's
necessarily a a what is our metric on
the reviews are granny user a granny
user yeah you knowing and then probably
probably the example is not the correct
one what I what I'm trying to say is so
far what I've noticed that is that the
average user doesn't like Windows Phone
it could probably change once windows 8
is out and everybody's forced to use
metro whether they like it or not but so
far it hasn't been the case so I do feel
that the Lumia is going to be a great
product I just don't feel it's gonna get
the push that you know that that it's
that it deserves and just by the
experience of what happened to the Lumia
900 and at all the marketing in the
world and still the phone didn't sell
hmm so I that's unfair to say first I
don't think we have enough data to say
it didn't sell I know it didn't blow up
the market but i think it's sold Oh
trust me if it would have sold they
would have told you its soul well I yeah
well that's true but I don't think it
was it was a sales disaster but go ahead
love it it wasn't Brandon come on come
on uh-huh so so I am reminded of uh of
have either of you ever taken a micro
economics class oh man I tell you oh
yeah love it yeah well yeah where they
they talk about you know sort of
different kinds of uh you know if you
have multiple companies there's an
oligopoly gah Polly I don't I don't know
if I'm saying oh yes but it turns out
that in almost every major industry
there are usually there's a leader then
there's someone close behind and then
there's a usually a distant third but a
very important distant third that
matters because people like to root for
the underdog and usually the distant
third has an interesting product it's
just that there's some Thor some barrier
to entry may be the first two were first
or they they have a lower price or
something like that and I think the same
is going to exist for a while in the
mobile phone industry weather's going to
be iOS Android and a distant third
windows phone for for the foreseeable
future until Microsoft decides that it's
not making money for them and they need
to pull the plug which I don't I don't
think that they're going to do that for
the foreseeable future because mobile is
so important than Microsoft with an
infinite amount of cash is going to do
whatever it takes to keep this thing
going and another thing is that the
windows phone it's not like it's it's
bad it's a good product and I think we
all agree that at the end of the day
it's a good product it's compelling it's
different yeah so I don't have that same
gut feeling that you do Michael that
windows phone is not going to survive
the test of time because i think the the
sort of the way that these industries
kind of shape up plus the fact that you
know they have a good product is very
much but its welfare for microsoft
that's a very good point and you know to
be completely fair I was not thinking
about Windows 8 which I played with
extensively at Aoife on tablets on
convertibles on computers and
once microsoft has manages to kind of
force metro what used to be called metro
design language into the minds of the
consumers through windows which is still
a very powerful desktop influence i
think that will drive adoption of
windows phones because they're both for
now there you know excuse me finally
they're very cool vista was definitely
not cool windows 7 was much better
people like it but i think its suffered
from vistas kind of stink a little bit
and as a result Windows has been a bad
word even in the mobile space when
people say oh it's a windows oh and well
no I don't think I want to go near that
but now you know once once windows 8
kind of gains ground it which it will do
very quickly that may help that is fun a
lot it now now tell me mr. zune pass
customer branded minimun what do you
think of all this because um I I have 60
ebooks from Microsoft reader that I lost
when Microsoft ditched windows mobile
and I didn't get uh you know I didn't
get a Nana zon gift card or anything to
compensate for the money that I lost so
I mean this is my problem with Microsoft
just like they just ditched the zune and
they're ditching the zoo software and
the zune pass and every every you know
every song that everybody purchased when
they move on to a new computer they're
gonna lose everything so do you trust
Microsoft because I've lost complete
faith in you that is such a good
question it is um yeah I I think
Microsoft has broken trust Ellis too
many times to be trustworthy so i am
gonna say that i don't really trust
Microsoft for for me to invest in their
their content offering for example or
their music offering but but we're
talking about this notion of a desktop
operating system helping to sell a
mobile operating system and I'm really
thinking about this and I don't think
there's any precedent for this where
this has happened before and you know on
one hand you could argue that yeah
people are gonna get windows 8 they're
gonna be like I got these tiles can I
have a phone that's got these tiles and
then they get the windows phone 8 and
then you could argue that no one's going
to care
cuz the iphone 6 will be awesome and the
galaxy s5 is gonna be awesome oh honey
do you guys think that this is going to
be a legitimate a force to sell windows
phone 8 devices the fact that Windows 8
is kind of out of that same vein no I
don't think that it's gonna originate
from that from that kind of thinking
where it's like oh wow this desktop
thing is awesome I want it on my phone I
think it's more the case that people are
going to see the phones in the stores
and say oh yes I recognize this so I'm
inherently a little more comfortable
with it then is the case now where they
don't see that design language anywhere
else it's like what's this weird thing
and depending on the personality type
then either they go up to it or much
more often they're like a no this is
unfamiliar to me and I'm frightened and
then they go and touch a galaxy s3 and
then wouldn't that person walk up to an
iphone 6 or whatever and say oh you know
I've absolutely no this interface my
friends I've had I had the first iphone
blah blah blah isn't the same effect
yeah well yeah I think exactly so yeah
familiarity were just reinforces itself
and which is why changing iOS would be a
giant risk that I don't think they're
willing to take right yes good point
yeah um we uh we're running a little
tight on time guys I do want to get to
to Android before we kind of sign out
which won't take very long but did you
have some parting thoughts on the on the
Nokia stuff on Windows Phone stuff in
general nope okay good i do i do yeah
yeah hit it out that gorgeous here you
add that Anton discovered oh wait yeah
oh yeah I mean it's in the wall street
journal by the way and oh oh thanks God
you know it was just funny because
everybody was like man this was found on
the verge and I'm like yeah right we
published in like an hour earlier yeah
who was it um Tony that was Tony Tony
notas no I was on Twitter it just like
Joe from somebody focus yeah the
editor-in-chief of goose moto is like
wait a second come on guys very good job
but pocketnow had a three hours earlier
exactly exactly now the Virgin the
virtual was nice enough to build the
video on it was really good but man you
know forget about who discovered it I
mean it doesn't
doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
matters here is this every company uses
deceptive marketing I mean Kellogg's
uses glue instead of milk for to make
their cereal cereal ads yeah yeah they
use that is that an apple uses that I
mean whenever they try to make the
iphone 3g look fast those ads were
terribly we're even banned in the UK um
you know was good about whatever Apple
did was the fact that they were smart
enough they could not get caught at it
you know meaning even though the UK band
the ads they weren't stupid enough to
film you know the the editor just
slicing the video in part and you know
since I I edit our videos and talking
down I just find it incredibly amusing
that this ad passed by everybody in the
Nokia VP and CEO Department and nobody
could notice that they were trying to
show the world what the PureView camera
was gonna be with a DSLR yeah in which
was plainly visible in a van window
reflection on the commercial listeners
if you haven't seen as it is with like
how are you how are you not going to
bring optical civilization to a van and
a DSLR right and and nokia actually made
a press release I think yesterday where
they said they're conducting kind of
this like it company-wide ethics review
and I was like okay listen whatever you
guys this blew up in your face you don't
have to like overcompensate but I didn't
realize that they were doing that in
response to not just this flap but also
some of the pictures they purported to
be from the from the Lumia 920 we're not
actually from the Lumia 920 is that
correct that was discovered by the verge
they actually have photos of when the
the the that portion of the video was
being filmed and you can see that they
were the photos were being taken by a
bigger camp ah so you know my point with
this and for all those for although I
can imagine the YouTube comments right
now they're going crazy oh they're just
exploded all over the place into how
dare they're hating my upgrade oh my god
your fear is crazy okay the big to be
fair right here I am going to buy the
Lumia 920 even of the ads totally blew
the project yes I feel that if Nokia did
not have a finalized product they could
use for the ads
all they had to do was do the apple
thing where Apple only tells you that
it's a great camera but they don't
really try to show you they don't try
they don't really try to you know try to
point out that they're filming this with
a camera when they're not ready right
all they had to do was say this is gonna
be a great camera and I would have
believed it and I would have bought it
they did not need to lie and that's
where that's where they should with up
but where and and and finally did that
we in that same vein with the PureView
stuff do you think very briefly that
they have diminished the PureView brand
we as with this camera yeah yeah III
agree I completely agree i think there
was a big misstep to put the pure
because i used up your values tony's
PureView he wrote a great editorial on
this you know in berlin I was like this
is an amazing camera as we all know and
when Nokia releases their windows phone
8 with a PureView camera I'm buying it
and then they announced the 920 with its
8 megapixel shooter with you know some
great stuff and everyone's kind of
kicking us for judging this thing before
we've used it and i get it and doubtless
the pictures will be very nice they're
not going to be what PureView gave us in
the first product in the 808 and that is
a big problem for the wait a sec wait a
sec you guys are forgetting some things
about the PureView michael you you are
in a unique situation because you got to
use one and you've also spent a lot of
time with a guy I hope Tony doesn't
listen to this pot is he's gonna kill me
with a guy that thinks that the PureView
808 is the most amazing piece of
technology to ever grace this this world
and and you know what I've seen the
pictures and they are damn good they're
amazing it takes really good pictures um
but the fact is that the PureView brand
doesn't have the notoriety that we're
assuming it to have for a lot of people
in the US they're hearing the word
PureView for a very long time and they
have no idea that its associated with a
41-megapixel super camera phone and if
PureView to them means that it takes
above-average pictures which it looks
like the 920 is capable of then that's a
win for the PureView brand here in the
United States maybe in Europe there will
be people crying like Tony because this
is not pure of you well that's a very
good point that says that's a solid
point P
you is a brand that many people in the
States will be hearing for the first
time as a matter of fact agreed agreed
yeah good point yeah it is a good point
we'll have to see how that plays out I
want to talk about that more in depth at
a later time we're running Android ver
and let's let's hand over android uh
right can I say something about Andrew
before he gets started I would love it
if you did so a question what is the
worst what what's what's bad what's the
worst thing about the nexus 7 the screen
yes okay so you know kindle announced
this kindle fire HD recently and there's
a couple of early reviews in let's say
that this tablet which has the same
screen resolution about the same size
about the same specs in terms of raw
processing power is has a far far
superior screen to the Nexus 7 and it's
the same price but you get double the
storage here's what I think um I've kind
of had to deal with this issue recently
because i pre-ordered one to review on
pocket now and then I'm thinking myself
what am I gonna do after this should I
sell it should I give it you know give
it to my mother um I'm gonna root the
sucker and put jelly bean on it and and
make the nexus 7 the way it should have
been in the beginning it's gonna have a
beautiful screen apparently it's gonna
be fast and it's not you know I I don't
agree that the kindle fire HD should be
saddled with Amazon's version of Android
I mean I think it's great for mom and
dad but it's not great for Brandon and I
me and Michael um so I I suddenly think
that if people out there are looking at
the nexus 7 for a hundred ninety nine
dollars with 8 gigabytes of storage they
should look at the kindle fire HD 499
with 16 gigs of storage and you know
plan on rooting it and putting stock
jelly bean on it yeah yeah yeah i know
the screen is bad I know the screen is
bad everyone says the screen is better
than nexus 7 and i believe it i know the
reds are more like pinks and it's kind
of like looking at a pastel drawing but
it's but i use the thing all the time
and you know I I feel like I maybe am
the closest to the average consumer on
on the team when it comes to displays
I never notice and i watch stuff on that
thing all the time and I'm surprised you
say that cuz you tonight you've an ipad
3 Michael right yeah yeah but you know
ever since I got the nexus 7 I never use
it Wow yeah okay the only reason why i
love the nexus 7 i'll be honest with you
it's because I've got a sinner be
working I've got a 64 gigabyte um orgy
verizon ipad which cost a thousand
dollars ooh so if i get if i get mugged
with that thing i am going to cry but if
i get mugged with the nexus 7 the cosby
two hundred dollars it's not really
gonna hurt and i love the convenience of
the 7-inch tablet and listen by the way
this is an amazon prime customers going
to talk right now i like the kindle fire
HD yes the only problem i have with it
is that it's an amazon terminal and by
terminal and this was actually taught to
me by a customer by a reader in a
comment is a terminal is just a blank
screen that's nothing without its
content and the problem with the kindle
fires that if you're not an amazon
customer you've got nothing yeah i
supposed to the nexus 7 you can do
whatever you want with it so unless
you're willing to route that thing go
with the nexus 7 that is my opinion
exactly i completely agree yeah now I i
I'm bored to tears by the kindle fire
stuff I'm just that's the word I'm
portlet tell you what guys when I when I
route the kindle fire HD 7-inch i'm
going to make an awesome video tutorial
so that there's no excuse for anybody to
suffer with a pastel screen please
listen i will i will wait for that first
my experience and this is the last thing
I'll say about it i used a kindle fire
on and off for a few months it was
exciting i was like okay whatever this
is cool at this price point when i use
the nexus 7 and i saw what android could
be at that form factor I never gave the
kindle fire another thought and I don't
want to again original kindle fire was
terrible and yet as low as 1 see it was
look what it looked like a play work it
what it basically yeah anyway anyway
anyway that's what let's move on that is
not the big nose of the of the week in
the Android world motorola dropped a
razor bomb on us and that's pretty
awesome i was i was about to say are
those
big news actually are they I mean like
all right maybe they're not I want them
to be big news so badly I loved the
razor line i love that Motorola
resurrected the razor brand with
products that are actually you know
notable because the razor the original
droid razr was notable for its thinness
the razr maxx obviously for its battery
life and there wasn't a mid-tier razor
category until now and that's the razr m
which i just recently reviewed i'm a cut
that video together so he's fully fully
informed as to my feelings on the razr m
and so are you listeners if you've read
the review i think Motorola's got a
really nice trio here and i think that
for for a company that was acquired by
google and which is still getting
integrated it's it's kind of cool to see
their slow quiet progress toward a
really awesome stock Android experience
on the software side and when you make
that with hardware that is as good as
the razors hardware is I think it's
really exciting for Android as a whole
and considering the disappointment that
I had with Motorola earlier in the year
with the atrix HD and then that the
photon q which I liked but which you
know just is not terribly remarkable at
the razor line I think I think says good
things about the future of Motorola with
Android so I mean what do you what do
you guys think mmm I just hate the fact
that it's stuck on verizon I mean it but
you know they'll bring up the
international like they did with the
original raiser in the mia yeah but I'm
you know speaking at in the opinion of
for example us customers i mean the
atrix HD was like the variant of the
razor coming to AT&amp;amp;T was like the first
iteration i like to be honest with you
one dat when we posted the news and the
atrix was coming out I needed this I
immediately called Brandon that was like
I want to review that phone and the
reason why I wanted to review that phone
is because ever since before i started
using HTC products all my phones were
motorola I've been a motorola customer
before that and after nokia and i just
wanted a motorola smartphone because of
the nano coating because of a Kevlar
yeah it's a strong phone
it's I love the design awesome hard
every everything was great until I turn
the thing on yeah yep my ad enough so
okay the screen the screen Michael you
can agree on the atrix HD the screen was
beautiful i love the screen on the atrix
HD yes i did love it but the problem is
that the software is sluggish well the
sun trouble yeah on the atrix on the
atrix it is but on the foot on the razr
m at least they corrected that on the
photon they corrected it but on the razr
m they corrected it and went beyond that
and it's very very responsive and very
reliable ok what I'm finished it's not
even final software ok what I'm trying
to say is this the problem with
motorola's products is that it killed
their brand with motoblur there was just
so sluggish and stupid that even though
the droid was popular ask any of the
previous droid customers that they're
using one right now everybody's using a
galaxy s3 now what they told hey burrows
and i think verizon is is the is the
carrier that has sold more galaxy s3's
than any other carrier in the united
states and that's because even though
the troy friend is great nobody's using
any other motorola droid III feel that
they just kill the branding that's my
person working yet i feel i feel that
their design is great and this is like
this is like with the sony thing that i
wrote recently man these guys had come
out with this beautiful design great
phones but then the software portion of
the company doesn't know the hardware
guys right the terrible heart is
software that's my point yeah well I I
think that was the case of Motorola I
think there was a gap between the droid
x and the droid x2 and then something
else interesting but no with the razor
family and and the new software
especially especially as we saw in the M
no I think Motorola is in a in a really
great place and they're only going to go
up I mean I've been I was prepared to be
disappointed now twice in a row with
Motorola roads like okay well after this
bed that bad experience but no it's
there I think they're they're on point
um it's only gonna get better I I just
want to say that the first company need
to make a true edge-to-edge phone is
going to become very very wealthy
it's amazing how much buzz yeah the
rumor caught on that you know motorola
was gonna announce this edge to edge
screen and and that's like a that's like
a unicorn feature right something that
we you know may never see it's gonna be
so futuristic and you know I'm of the
opinion that it won't be that great of a
phone because you'll have so many miss
presses it'll be ridiculous but the
first company to make an edge-to-edge
phone screen is going to just it they're
gonna do something they're just gonna
make a lot of money with it and you're
right and the razr m is still like
motorola had to figure out a way to make
this mid-range offering like stand out
so i think they kind of went with thee
yeah it's sort of like an edge to edge
screen look at our thin bezel oh and by
the way by the way far for listeners um
if you know it's hard with the razr m if
you have not really held the phone or
seen it i do recommend that you go to
michael's review and look at his
photography of the phone because the
phone is a lot prettier than it looks
yes it is it is really pretty i mean i
think that motorola they screwed up with
the screen making a qvga what is it qhd
yeah they screwed up with the screen but
then everything else of that phone looks
gorgeous it looks beautiful yeah and
it's it's great i actually brandon just
asked me rose going to do with it I'm
like I'm going to hold on to it as long
as possible because it's it's so good on
the hardware side and yeah no I agree i
think the edge to edge thing was
definitely a stretch i think but if
motor oil is able to get snagged that
much buzz with releasing a not really
edge to edge screen just suggesting that
maybe it's closed then yeah you're right
the first company the table to actually
do it is really gonna benefit for a very
short time until the returns start
happening because of all the false taps
uh let's um let's move on to to our
two-minute concluding bit gentlemen
we're not gonna get to listener mail
today unfortunately because we're
running very long list of a very long
newsweek I want to ask each of you
starting with Brandon if you could
choose only one device for your daily
driver what would you select and we're
talking about using it like for an
extended period of time like six months
at least would you buy one of the new
Lumias one of the new droid razors or
the iphone five
and why oh my goodness well that's
pretty easy and i'd say i'd say the
iphone 5 because i know what to expect I
know that over time the iPhone 5 is
extraordinarily reliable it takes great
pictures I'm not gonna talk about all
the merits at the iphone 5 I choose the
iphone 5 because its trustee and it's
it's a great quality and you know I
maybe in two months from now and
actually to use a Lumia 920 I would
change my answer but I can't because I
haven't actually used it so definitely
the iphone 5 you have an Uzi iphone 5
either but I like your answer that's
good like I gotta know to expect though
yeah you know what I mean like the Lumia
920 is very different just giving you a
hard time yeah absolutely great uh we
have one for the iphone 5 i'm sure hi
mate just like Apple is gonna come out
from left field and surprise everyone
with his please uh the iphone 5 and well
the only the only reason again is I'm
really locked up in the ecosystem I've
got three max to Apple TVs I've got a
time capsule at home um it's just the
next way to go for me I mean it's I I
find that really annoying that that's
the way the ecosystem works they want to
lock you into it but you know going
forward to it Brandon says and by the
way I carry two phones is my daily
driver so usually it's an android phone
or Windows Phone and the iphone and the
reason why the iphone is always with me
is because it makes me not need to carry
a camera where I go or it's a carry a
music player where I go because I've got
everything there that's that's probably
it whenever somebody comes out with a
smartphone that has and actually there
is the galaxy s3 on the great camera but
I don't have one but if I would have a
galaxy s3 I would leave the iphone home
but since I don't and obviously now
everything's about the iphone 5 then yes
the iphone 5s the next okay that's a
that's a good answer and actually I'm
glad you mentioned the galaxy s3 because
I do carry gs3 is my daily driver since
I busted my Nexus and it does serve as
all that for me and it does really way
the camera i love the camera my answer
and i will keep mine very brief is the
Nokia Lumia 920 is what I would select
given those options
I like carrying something different I
know it's untested it's a risk it's a
bold move I wish it were in cyan because
I would make my answer even simpler but
i would i would carry one of those just
because i really enjoyed my time with
Windows Phone 7 I think when this phone
8 corrects all the deficiencies that I
complained about with seven or at least
in theory and the optics considering the
noise nokia is making about PureView and
also the lessons they undoubtedly
learned from the horrible 900 camera I
think the I think it's reasonable to
assume the optics are going to be really
good again and is good go ahead you know
speaking of cyan you know where you're
gonna get mad about this but they'll
most likely launch the cyan in like two
hours after launch right no no for a
carrier specific a carrier specific cyan
let's just do it's just stupid the event
was blue the event was blue everything
the body is branding is blue yeah
everything is blue so yes they're gonna
launch a blue Lumia it's just gonna
happen for a specific carrier it almost
like the land that feel if it's an
American carrier I will be pleased
because that's what I want I want I want
to cyan 920 um before we before we close
it up Brandon do we have any closing
thoughts from you sir not today Thanks
risk it's alright group and and uh and
Jaime no I think it was great sharing
the floor with you guys yesterday with
the iphone coverage that we did it was
it was great and all the other coverage
you guys did at IFA and everything
that's happening it's been a crazy week
I just hope that manufacturers and OEMs
learned their lesson from here on um
that you can't just stand in front of a
stage and tell how great your product is
if you're not gonna give people a launch
date please change that or you can and
you can for for a while but eventually
people will tire of it just eventually
Apple will come out with their iphone
and kill you that's what's gonna happen
um alright guys that that that wraps it
up for its time I agree it was great
sharing the floor but with with you guys
yesterday as well as today it was a
really it's great to get back to kind of
