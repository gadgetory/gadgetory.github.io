pakka now calm and today we're unboxing
Verizon's latest and greatest Android
device the HTC Droid Incredible if
you're a Verizon Wireless subscriber and
you're looking into purchasing an
Android device you've probably been
keeping tabs on this powerhouse of the
phone it has a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor a large AMOLED display and
it's running Android 2.1 which is Eclair
it also sports the newest version of
sense so that means you get HTC's custom
interface widgets and other goodies
it'll be available from Verizon on April
29th for a penny under $200 with a
two-year contract let's take a look
around the box
looks like they've gone with their
traditional packaging as pictures of the
incredible on the back and on the front
something interesting here is that
there's no mention of the word droid
anywhere on this box
it just says HTC incredible so that's
kind of strange I'm not sure what that's
about but hey I'm all for more concise
names alright let's go ahead and open it
beautiful it's a slick looking device
very light in hand almost too light of
course I haven't put the battery in yet
so hopefully that'll change and it'll
feel better in hand let's go ahead and
see what else is in the box
we've got manuals for tips hints and
tricks we'll just toss that aside if you
tips you want you want to visit
pocketnow.com will give you tons of tips
Wow check out this battery it's
completely red it's very unique stands
out a lot it's something new HTC is
doing with some of their devices and
we'll see why in a minute
let's check the size of the battery
okay it's 1300 milliamp hours which
should complement the AMOLED display
nicely okay let's see what's behind this
looks like we have a micro USB syncing
and charging cable and we have one of
these newer more rounded compact
chargers which is nice I guess that's it
no headphones memory card case or
anything of that nature let's go ahead
and bulldoze this out of the way and
bring back the main attraction and it's
gorgeous 3.7 inch capacitive display
that has some capacitive touch buttons
at the bottom and an optical trackpad on
the back we have a soft touch cover and
as you can see the backing is quite
unique it has almost a pyramid like step
design to it with three distinct layers
I don't know how well you can see that
in the video but it's definitely
something I'll have to get used to it
shouldn't be a problem though it's kind
of cool actually
we also have the new larger bolder HTC
branding which is fine by me and eight
megapixel camera with dual LED flash I'm
definitely excited to take some pictures
with this camera as you can see it has
some red trimming around the lens area
that's pretty much a teaser to what's
behind this battery cover so let's go
ahead and open it up
and I'll go ahead and fill in the
missing piece of the puzzle wow that
looks awesome
so HTC is trying to make some of their
devices as appealing on the inside as
they are on the outside so we saw this
first with the HD Mini which had an all
yellow interior the incredible is decked
out all in red kind of makes you just
stop and kind of look at the phone I
can't say that I've ever had that
feeling with any other phone when taking
off the battery cover so let's close it
up and we'll do some size comparisons so
first we'll compare it to an HTC Pierre
the incredible looks taller and a bit
wider looks like they have about the
same thickness
although the incredible does look a bit
thinner near the bottom layer let's
compare it to a Touch pro2
about the same height and width but
obviously the touch pro2 is much thicker
due to its slide-out QWERTY keyboard so
this was a an unboxing of the HTC Droid
Incredible from Verizon that's it for
now but stay tuned for more video

the device don't forget to subscribe to
