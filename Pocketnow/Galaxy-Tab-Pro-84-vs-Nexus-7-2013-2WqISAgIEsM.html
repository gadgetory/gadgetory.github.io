Samsung's new miniature tablet
let's take a look I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is a Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 versus the Google
Nexus 7 for the last two years Google's
Nexus 7 has been the small Android
tablet to beat in terms of value and
quality starting at just $2.99 it's
incredibly affordable and it packs a ton
of great features but it isn't perfect
and there's plenty of room for another
small tablet to compete is Samsung's
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 the tablet to do just
that let's find out the hardware
situation between these two tablets is
interesting the Nexus 7 doesn't try to
be anything it isn't it's a budget
tablet and it's designed as such it's
minimal and understated the entire back
side is a matte finished partly
carbonate the tapered edges make it feel
incredibly thin in the face is as stark
as it gets no buttons just to display
notification LED and front-facing camera
it's actually quite beautiful in its
simplicity the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 does
its best to live up to the 400 our base
price by using facades and spoof
materials the backside is made of
plastic with a leather-like appearance
with faux leather stitching and the trim
along the edges is a faux brushed metal
it feels notably better than previous
Galaxy Tabs but it doesn't necessarily
look all that much better the Nexus 7 is
easier to hang on to with one hand due
to its smaller size it measures 200
millimetres tall 114 millimetres wide
and eight point seven millimeters thick
the Tab pro 8.4 is 19 millimeters taller
14.5 millimeters wider yet 1.5
millimeters thinner at 290 grams the
Nexus 7 is also 41 grams lighter than
the Tab pro that said we actually prefer
the size and shape of the Tab pro 8.4
likely due to the much larger display in
the form factor that in the grand scheme
of things isn't all that different than
the insides the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4
certainly has the upper hand in terms of
specs both come with the same storage
options 16 or 32 gigabytes and 2
gigabytes of RAM but the Tab pro has a
Snapdragon 800 chipset made of a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core Krait 400 CPU and
Adreno 330 GPU
eight megapixel camera and a 19-point to
one hour battery the Nexus 7 has a
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset made up of a
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Krait 300 CPU
and Adreno 320 GPU if I have megapixel
camera in a 16 watt hour battery the
Nexus also has qi wireless charging to
boot while the Tab pro features an IR
blaster and Wi-Fi AC the displays on
these two tablets are quite impressive
the Nexus 7 has a 7 inch IPS LCD panel
with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels
and was one of the most impressive
tablet displays at the time of its
launch with a density of 323 PPI the Tab
pro 8.4 comes with an 8.4 inch WQXGA
Super Clear LCD that's 2560 by 1600
pixels and an overall pixel density of
359 PPI both displays look great by
themselves but when compared
side-by-side the Tab pro 8.4 has the
more vibrant panel with more natural
tones the Nexus 7 appears cooler and
some images tend to look a little less
lively the tap pros display is sharper
and prettier even if it may arrow on the
side of oversaturation frankly we prefer
the design and build of the Nexus 7 more
we like its rear facing speakers which
shoot audio into the palm of your hands
in landscape mode to offer better stereo
separation the feel of the tablet and
its appearance more so than the Tab pro
8.4 we prefer on-screen buttons
particularly on a tablet and wireless
charging is a huge plus but the Tab pro
and the speck Department is the clear
winner this comparison is far from over
however let's dive into the software
shall we both tablets come running
KitKat version 4.4.2
however the Nexus 7 runs a pure stock
version of KitKat whereas the Galaxy Tab
pro 8.4 software has been heavily
customized by Samsung to include it
smart features TouchWiz and the magazine
UX homescreen it also has a host of
other features for better or for worse
if you're a bare-bones no-nonsense sort
of person the Nexus 7 will certainly
speak to you more deliberately it's as
vanilla as it gets with no bloatware and
running Android exactly as Google
intended and it will have access to
future software updates months before
the Tab pro 8.4 the tab pro isn't
totally worth writing off though amongst
all the Samsung clutter like Samsung
Apps and its own digital content library
alongside
Google's own stores Samsung software has
some redeeming features like
multi-window
for those unaware multi-window allows
users to run two compatible applications
side by side such as YouTube and Chrome
you can drag and drop information
between the two applications without
needing to copy and paste and it's all
possible through a quick swipe from the
right edge of the display
however we definitely feel samsung
software can be detrimental to the
overall experience
it looks like a confusing mixture of a
modern tiled interface Tizen OS and
Samsung's old TouchWiz interface it
looks and feels conflicted and possibly
incomplete and the Settings app only
seemed to get worse with each update
making it more and more confusing to
navigate and find even some of the most
simple settings if you want the most
useful tablet features to date though
Samsung has a corner on multitasking in
this specific comparison as the
multitasking experience on the stock
Nexus 7 is bland and uninviting however
it being a Nexus device by nature it has
a far brighter future if modding and
custom roms are your thing this
particular part of the comparison boils
down to preference all the changes made
in Samsung's software however have a
lasting effect which includes lag in
some of the most vital areas the home
screens we know the Snapdragon 800 is an
impressive chipset we've seen time and
again how great it is with performance
and even the Nexus 7 Snapdragon s4 pro
chip is highly capable and efficient
both tablets are capable of running
games with impressive graphics but where
the Nexus 7 continues to run buttery
smooth the Tab pro 8.4 begins to hiccup
and stutter something as simple as
flicking through the home screens can
call the tablet to pause for a split
second and that's unfortunate
considering the near flawless history of
the Snapdragon 800 and Krait 400 as well
as its promising benchmark performance
this is yet another lesson in how
misleading benchmarks can often be if
consistent performance is what you're
after your odds of getting just that are
far greater on the Nexus 7 battery life
on the Nexus 7 isn't exactly the
greatest the 16 watt hour 39 50 milliamp
hour battery is a bit small for a tablet
but it has managed to last us one day
plus since we first bought it in the
summer of 2013 you may need to recharge
it every night if you're a heavy user we
can't say for sure yet but the Tab pro
8.4 may be a similar story it has a 19
point
what our battery rated at 4800 milliamp
hours so far its stamina seems to be
comparable to the Nexus 7's we found the
camera on the Nexus 7 to be pretty
lackluster after all it is a tablet the
camera isn't a priority for most but
it's essentially a toss-up for the
camera quality between these two
particular tablets out of the box the
Tab pro 8.4 is set to capture at 6
megapixels instead of 8 for the 16:9
aspect ratio
this means it's cropped and its field of
view is narrower however its images were
definitely more lively and warmer than
those taken to the Nexus 7 which
produced cool lifeless images frankly
neither camera is mind-blowing but at
the end of the day we give it to the Tab
pro 8.4 for taking more balanced
colorful images in all it boils down to
a couple of things which you can likely
answer for yourself with a few simple
questions are you after a better value
or a better tablet how important is the
display and can you deal with occasional
performance stutters the Nexus 7
starting at only two hundred and twenty
nine dollars is undoubtedly the better
value but the Tab pro 8.4 comes with
things we wish the Nexus 7 had all along
like an IR blaster snapdragon 800 and
true simultaneity after using the Tab
pro we're smitten with its size and
almost feel cramped on a 7-inch tablet
and the performance issues of the Tab
pro 8.4 aren't wildly out of control it
may seem that way in this short video
but keep in mind you're only getting a
snippet of our use so the lag and
stutters will likely seem far worse than
they actually are if you've got the
extra cash to spend we highly recommend
giving the Tab pro 8.4 a try but if
you're on a tighter budget you'll be
pleased for the Nexus 7 just as well
