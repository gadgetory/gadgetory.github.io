pocketnow.com the HTC Sensation is
finally out and with it we've got a new
version of the Sense interface from HTC
it's pretty darn cool and in this video
we're gonna talk all about it let's get
to it
okay so since 3.0 starts here on the
lockscreen
and right now I've got the weather lock
screen selected so you get the weather
in big beautiful letters here it's even
animated a little bit if you watch it
the clouds are moving just slightly so
what we can do from here is we can take
this metal ring which is kind of like a
brushed metal looking ring very polished
very nice and we can just put it in the
center of the screen
we get this cool animation and then if
you listen we get a sound this sound is
a sound effect for the weather animation
you can fortunately turn this off
because it's super annoying now another
thing you can do from the lock screen
which is a great feature which every
Android phone had this is the ability to
quickly launch an application you could
get a choice of four it would be nice if
you could choose eight or twelve or
whatever but let's say you really want
to take a picture and you don't want to
fumble with your your application tray
boom you've launched your app your
camera application and you don't miss
the moment and there are four or five
different lock screens to choose from so
if we bring that circle back in and we
go into the personalized manual lock
screen you can see all of the different
available lock screens and hopefully
there will be more I'd love to see one
that's fully customizable because right
now you can only change the shortcuts so
here we have the photo album this is
kind of a novelty it's very beautiful
and 3d looking we can swipe to the right
this is the friend stream which is cool
it shows you instead of a 3d environment
updates to social networks this is the
weather one which we just had on stock
is pretty useful if you're following
some stock quotes and the last one here
is clock kind of just a static
homescreen this one I want to show you
it's really cool photo album if you
click on settings you can select the
shortcuts that you want so let's say you
want to change call history to say
something else let's say you want to
change it to clock maybe so you can
adjust your alarms you click done and
then we can click apply and if we go
back to the lock screen we'll
that the shortcut has been changed and
now it's loading the photo stream so
pretty cool here it's bringing up a
photo slideshow of photos I've taken
just sort of bouncing in and out but who
sits there and stares at their lock
screen I don't know but it's kind of
cool to have I guess right so let's
bring the circle back into the center of
the screen and here we are back on the
home screen now HTC Sense home screens
haven't changed that much but finally
they're different so we get this cool
little effect when you turn from home
screen to home screen third-party
launchers like launcher Pro ADW launcher
have had these effects for a while in
fact they let you change them since 3.0
you still can't change them HTC also
likes to show off the fact that if you
spin this thing real quick it becomes
like a 3d carousel well what would you
do is what we say because it's not
really functional it's a cool party
trick but who cares that your home
screens can become kind of like 3d when
you spin them really fast anyhow let's
get back to the main home screen here
we've got the HTC weather clock along
with some shortcuts got the got a
battery widget here there's just a
third-party quick battery that we like
to use scrolling to the left we get the
weather they've done a really really
good job with weather HTC really
pioneered the animated 3d looking
weather with early early devices that
ran Windows Mobile so what we can do
here is flick through our weather
full-screen animations sound effects
super immersive and if you tap on the
weather you go into an even more
immersive environment again with these
sound effects which you can remove and
we can flick through the various
different home screens we can click on
this button to be able to jump into the
hourly or five-day forecast really
beautiful this is taking great advantage
of the qHD display we're going to talk
more about how the qHD display makes a
difference in a minute
now something else you can do here is
you can go to demo if you want to show
your friends how cool this device is
show them this so it shows you the
animation for every different weather
situation looks like the HTC thunderbolt
start up doesn't it probably is related
to that so again we get sound effects
with all of these again this is weather
to the next level probably a little more
than most people need but it's it's
great to have it's really taking
advantage of the dual-core processor on
the HTC Sensation just gorgeous gorgeous
animations and we're almost through them
all partly sunny rain is always a good
one on HTC looks like raindrops are on
your screen snow and finally windy so
that was a look at the weather pretty
cool stuff what HTC has done this looks
kind of like the Windows Phone 7 HDC
weather app with this sort of shiny tops
anyhow so let's move along we've just
got some shortcuts over there here's my
shelf which is the HTC e-reader
application so we can click on any of
these and dive into the built-in book
app and text looks really good on this
so we can flick to the next page really
cool animation and if we look really
close on the screen to get a sense for
how clear the text is and hopefully the
camera will focus
text is very very very sharp it's not as
sharp as you would get on the iPhone 4
because you get ppi which means pixel
density is about 326 per inch so if you
take a little inch you count up all the
pixels you get 326 on the sensation with
the qHD display 4.3 inches we are
getting a ppi of about 250 now the the
predecessor to this the Desire HD with a
WVGA screen had a pixel density of about
217 so you're really getting an
improvement there in terms of the pixel
density which surely makes text sharp
and crisp but what's awesome which it
was very impressive is what HTC is done
with the extra pixels in some of the
built-in applications like email web and
so forth we're going to go through that
in just a minute want to talk a little
bit more about these home screens and
adding widgets so let's go into widgets
of course with each passing generation
of devices HTC adds more and more
widgets so if we go into browse all HTC
widgets we'll see that there are 81 on
previous devices like the Desire HD you
were in the 70s so what they've really
done is added refinements to some of the
more popular widgets you might see some
new ones as I flick through I'm not
gonna flick through all 81 but just to
give you a sense of what HT is HTC has
done and these widgets look better than
ever with a qHD display so we've got
things for Twitter we've got music
widgets unfortunately you still cannot
resize widgets in HTC Sense you can do
that in launcher Pro you can do that
with a wide variety of other third-party
replacements but in terms of
customizability HTC still really mixed
misses the mark this is actually new one
here photo grid really cool looking kind
of like a mosaic so we've got news see
if there's any other new ones this is a
new social clock which actually comes
from the HTC Facebook phones like the
cha-cha and the salsa right within your
clock you can see Facebook updates kind
of fun and we've got a bunch of clocks
you've seen the clocks for many
generations of devices calculators
nothing new there this is new stocks Wow
full screen stocks widget now some
people really like widgets and some
people don't
the thing with widgets is that they take
up RAM they use CPU cycles in the
background when you're doing other
things so some people like to keep it
simple with launcher pro with ADW
launcher and some people like to make it
really visually intense with widgets
from HTC so it's really up to you how
you want to do that now the notification
tray has been redone here for the HTC
Sensation because we get more pixels HTC
has more space to work with
they can fit more stuff in here so we've
got this new bar with the Clear button a
little bit different than before we've
got shortcuts right here although of
course an Android you tap and hold on
the home button to get to your recent
applications like so of course and now
we've got a new tab down here finally
HTC is bringing forth settings samsung
has been doing this for a long time now
from here we can quickly toggle on on
and off GPS Wi-Fi bluetooth we can also
go into HTC's new beautifully designed
task manager so here we can see how much
RAM we have free we can selectively kill
applications right from the screen very
beautiful display here in the new
notification shade on the HTC Sensation
so now let's dive into some built-in
apps on the HTC Sensation email on this
phone is probably the best email
experience of any Android phone we've
ever
tested okay let's jump into the mail
application HDC is brilliant when it
comes to designing this email app up
here at the top we have the drop down
arrow where we can switch between mail
applications to the right of that we
have a new message button and then we've
got these emails with four line previews
but you can change it to be no lines or
up to I think five so if we go into more
and settings and general settings so
versatile here we can go to portrait
body preview so we can do three lines
like we have now one line or none this
is really awesome so if you're the kind
of person that likes to just glance at
their box inbox to see previews you can
turn this up to five lines and really
instantly without having to go into a
message read the top few lines or if you
like to see just a simple index maybe
with one line you can do that if you
want to make the font size really small
and fit a lot of text on the screen if
you have good eyes you can change the
smallest end on the sensation you can
really get away with that because the
pixel density is nice and so it just
looks really really good
on the screen so here we have our inbox
we've got check boxes already exposed
the Samsung Galaxy S 2 for example
doesn't have the check boxes as expose
making it difficult to do email
arbitrage so what we can do here is we
can check off multiple messages
boom within a second mark red delete or
move to and fortunately unlike stock
Android when you check something and you
do an action on it it becomes unchecked
huh if you get a Nexus S and you try to
do this it stays checked no matter what
you do with it which is very frustrating
so we can go to delete from here we can
obviously click on a message and now we
get these buttons along the bottom a
little bit different than what we got
with the previous HTC mail apps so you
got to kind of experiment with these to
figure out what they are this is reply
this is reply halt forward move to
folder and trash so kind of a little bit
of a learning curve there let's also go
back into the settings and see all of
the other settings that we can use
change font size use a signature we can
change the cap the attachment cache
asked before deleting body portrait
preview so really a killer fast
customisable mail app here on the HTC
Sensation five stars for
male experience taking advantage of the
full qHD resolution and the calendar has
also been revamped to be very very nice
and so has the app tray which we'll go
over in a sec just want to jump into the
calendar real quick so here's the
calendar and so now it's just looks a
lot better than it did before
so we've got these buttons along the
bottom and we can toggle between the the
the day view we could go to the week
view just looks really slick on the
screen and then we have of course this
this agenda view which most people would
probably use and finally invitation
screen and all of this works gloriously
is that a word gloriously
in landscape too so really beautiful
calendar display now you just got a
little preview of the new application
tray on the HTC Sensation so we've got
three sliders along the bottom finally
HTC has done something with sliders
there they're sort of very intelligent
interface paradigm in the application
tray and now when you flick through the
applications they kind of go notch by
notch instead of all at one time sort of
freely scrolling and what we can do here
is change how they're sorted so we can
change the sorting order from date and
Ottis which you could do in previous HTC
phones but now if we slide to the right
we have frequent apps which is something
that people will probably keep this on
at all times and over to the right we've
downloaded apps so you can see all of
your third-party apps in one screen it's
really fantastic and if you land on one
of them and you close it and go back in
it brings you back to that same area so
this is probably where most people will
want to land on their frequently used
applications because a lot of these
things people don't use in here
especially the built in carrier apps
that you cannot remove okay so let's
talk about web browsing experience I
know this video is starting to run a
little bit long but there's just so much
to talk about in the HTC Sensation so
here we're loading Google and of course
we've got this cool tab view where we
can open up a new tab let's jump into
pocketnow.com
we're going to do comparisons a lot of
comparisons with this device so you can
see how fast it is with the dual-core
processor let's slow the desktop view
we're over why
right now see how long this taste takes
sensation has fantastic web browsing
performance as a little bit of a preview
it's not as fast as the Galaxy s2 but it
is much faster than the Desire HD then
the Nexus S you name it
the sensation pretty much beats it and
so here we have pocket now and you can
see the address bar is very skinny
because of the qHD resolution and it
disappears when you start scrolling of
course
so when scroll down the page we get no
checkerboards we can do a little pinch
to zoom action extremely smooth very
fluid the colors on the screen are
fantastic we're running super LCD panel
it's not Super AMOLED plus but it is
darn good so let's jump into Engadget
here because that's a really long
webpage especially when we load the
desktop version so let's do the checker
board test let's load the desktop
version and while it's loading we're
going to try to flip down the page to
see if you get checker boards no checker
boards fantastic performance on the the
sensation we can flick back and forth
this is still a little bit choppy this
was always choppy in previous HTC
devices still choppy now but not too bad
we can go into there and flick down we
can double tap on a column it will
resize it beautifully text is super
sharp super clear awesome marks for web
browsing and of course we've got a bunch
of settings another thing that's great
that HTC is always done is adjust the
the size of text within the whole
operating system so text is really small
here allowing you to see all of the menu
options without having to scroll which
is always nice so standard options in
terms of web browsing it's always nice
to leave plugins set to ask which is
somewhere around here or on demand so
that you don't have the Flash content
loading slowing down your pages even
though this does have a dual core
processor flash does doe slow down
devices okay real quick let's dive into
the included applications to see if
there's anything interesting here 360
shop 360 updates that's for a Vodafone
this is actually a Vodafone device we've
got dice which is an HTC thing we have
HTC hub which is great which
you to extend the use of your phone to
download new scenes this does still have
scenes by the way what I like the most
here is the skins so you can download
the skin to change the entire look and
feel of your phone these are two new
ones purple passion and painting the
world this one's kind of cool music
lover so you download that and in the
notification shade you'll see that it's
downloading you can tap on that and then
apply it somehow oh that's a new one
Burgundy okay these are the built-in
ones that we just came to I'm just gonna
go to Burgundy that looks pretty cool so
click apply and so what this is gonna do
is revamp all of the screens and if you
go back to the to the HTC homescreen
it's gonna have to refresh things are
gonna be burgundy so that's always a fun
little thing to patisserie and with and
there you go there's the burgundy woohoo
okay so let's jump into settings real
quick and see if there's anything useful
there and if we go to display we can
change the notification flash so this
has an LED notification which you can
turn on for email MMS missed calls that
kind of thing
auto rotate screen is obviously always
turned on there not much other things
have been added here if we go to sdcard
and storage total space available is of
course seven point three eight gigabytes
available about five the eight gigabyte
card out of the box will probably give
you about six gigabytes of space plus an
available of one gigabyte in your add
about seven gigabytes of space out of
the box of course you can add a 32 gig
microSD card we go to a bat phone we can
see that there's software here to
software we are running on android 2.3.3
since version 3.0 so this is running the
latest version of sense the latest
version of Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
