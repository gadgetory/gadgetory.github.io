give us to Samsung Galaxy Note ends
instead of one no kid just released the
X 71 which is a very impressive Minh
Ranger and Apple it is apparently
working on making either larger or
smaller iPhones and now in India I'm
Jaime Rivera and definitely Tuesday's
which I was about to say Wednesday which
I actually thought was Thursday I need
coffee
this is marking out daily official loose
today begin with deals fear in the
market for an Apple watch series for
which is actually the only one that I
recommend you buy currently $50 off with
both Apple and be an agent for those of
you to buy at B&amp;amp;H you'd actually get a
tax discount depending it's not for
everybody but you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about Huawei
as the company's CEO has been making
some very interesting claims lately one
is for example that phone should all be
foldable according to what we covered
yesterday but now he's also claiming
that they're on track to be the number
one smartphone maker in the world by
next year and bear in mind this is a
company that's not selling phones in the
United States or at least not with the
potential that other companies are like
Samsung for example according to them
they will take the crown
let us know in the comments if you
believe that to be true now let's talk
about Apple iPhones and their future as
we hear two very interesting news here
the first one is that apparently
production of the higher-end iPhones
might move to India and we know that has
a lot to do with everything that's going
on between the US and China so that
makes sense but the other is that
apparently iPhones are going to be
changing in size that the regular
variant which is the smaller one is
going to get even smaller than five
point eight inches that the mid-tier
equivalent to the 10r is gonna actually
get a little smaller as well and that
the max variant is gonna get a little
taller
even though displays will be the same at
ola tolet and LCD that's rather
interesting that iphones might change in
size probably they want to cater to a
market like the s10 II now it's one of
the spotlight over the nokia and their
new X 71 smartphone that just got
announced for Taiwan and the reason why
this phone is hot as we rarely cover mid
ranges but I mean sure qualcomm
snapdragon 616 and then the
specification is just keep getting
better the most important part is that
you get a 48 megapixel camera that you
get a punch hole design on the display
and
all this is priced for 390 bucks man I
mean Nokia is really killing it with
their prices
yeah expect our Nokia 9 review soon
we're actually waiting for a software
update to get that to you
and finally the hottest adjusted I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
and the changes that are coming which
apparently are not gonna be much for the
base variant yes I said variant because
apparently we're getting 2 phones to
Galaxy Note ends one of them of the size
of the s10 of 5g which we already
covered obviously with the s-pen and
everything but then apparently Samsung
has had success with their s10 a variant
up to the point where we might get a
smaller galaxy note it wouldn't be the
first time Samsung many years ago
launched a light variant but the s10 II
is no light version of the s10 so and
today's question let us know I mean
would you be interested in a smaller
galaxy note n cuz in my case honestly I
would I personally would but that would
be me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion wrens again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us I'm talking about common script to
both our channels English and Spanish
more videos like this one you'd follow
me on Twitter hi manager squad we get on
Instagram but hey Matt leave it out
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw
I'm Jaime Miller thanks so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
