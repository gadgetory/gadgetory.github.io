pocketnow.com
if you've ever wanted to have a Facebook
tab in HTC sense of touch float 3d now
you can thanks to XD a user meltwater
let me show you what it looks like and
I'll also post a link on pocketnow.com
on how to get it it's a little bit
complicated to get working but hopefully
they'll come out with a cab as soon so
you'll be able to install it very quick
and easy so I'm gonna zoom in a little
bit on the screen and what we have here
is a link to me and I get to see how
many unread messages I have or how many
friend invites that I have but if you
tap on either of these things it will
actually launch your internet browser so
it's more like a viewer than it is
something you can actually action on
right there and then so let's go back
and we can see all of our friend updates
here and a nice long list and it's still
updating so that's why it's thinking and
we can scroll down and move around and
if you tap on a contact like Dan Webster
here from pocket now it'll show you his
update integrated into the touchflo 3d
people interface so if I slide to the
left
I'll see any emails that I've had with
Dan Webster slide to the left I'll see
any text messages I've had Ben Webster
and of course it'll go to the left again
it will show me his contact information
his phone number his address anything
that I have stored on my device so it
integrates very very well with the
already existing people
touchflo 3d sent screen that integrates
all of the different communication that
you have with somebody and from there
that's pretty much all you can do you
can tap here to go to the Facebook app
if you have it installed or you can go
to Facebook online and also there are
some settings you can determine when to
download data and things like that so
overall it's basically a Facebook viewer
but if you use Facebook a lot it's a
quick and easier way to see what's going
on on Facebook again I'll post only
about pocketnow.com on how to get this
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
