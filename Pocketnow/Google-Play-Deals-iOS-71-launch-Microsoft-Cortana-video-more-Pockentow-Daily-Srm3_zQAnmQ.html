anniversary with deals Microsoft's core
tenet gets demoed on video though kind
of odd and Apple Bailey preparing to
launch Iowa 7.1 very soon I'm hi Mary
that I and whatever happened to those
times when we got free devices as part
of a celebration this is walking out
daily the sources they offered some
official news as Google has just
announced two years of celebration for
their google play store and they are
giving out deals in books movies and
hopefully apps though what's even more
interesting is the fact that even though
the celebration is apparently now we
can't access the link for some reason
that we don't really understand
hopefully the link will be available by
the time this video goes up and please
let us know what deals you get in if
they're interesting to you in the
comments down below even though we
talked about Microsoft's Court Anna
voiced assistant yesterday we show you
the screenshots we probably get the
first video of Crete Anna and yeah I
mean even though the video is muted of
this is really interesting as for
example it does assist you but there is
no voice response to whatever you're
asking and obviously this is pre
production software we still don't know
if that's going to be the final build of
Cortana though yeah it's great to see
that Microsoft's bringing something but
it kind of looks like what we already
have now let's talk about Samsung as you
remember those infamous benchmark
results that we saw with the galaxy s4
in the galaxy note 3 as the company was
using extra code to tamper with the
results of benchmarks to make the phone
look a lot better than it really was new
reports have it that apparently the
company is removing this code from the
Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy s4 s update to
KitKat android 4.4 point2 and these
updates are now being pushed to devices
like apparently as of yesterday so it's
really interesting to see that this has
finally happened though sadly benchmarks
are kind of losing credibility already
now let's talk about Apple in iOS 7.1 as
we've seen five betas rolling we haven't
seen a gold master candidate but John
goober from daring fireball believes
that it will be launched in the next
coming days and the reason why is
because apparently there is this new
South by Southwest application that has
to do with the itunes festival that
Apple's planning
and apparently it does not work without
iOS 7.1 and obviously South by Southwest
is just a couple of days away so really
interesting hopefully we will be getting
7.1 even though the update is kind of
minor and finally for the sort of
hilarious news of the day nokia has just
to publish this video where they're
demoing their progress and kinetic
energy for recharging batteries and they
have this girl dancing around all day
trying to recharge the battery of her
smartphone which is a Lumia and even
though we know that when those phones
are very efficient when it comes to
battery life she pretty much danced all
day and pin to lift the battery
percentage up to more than twenty-five
percent so obviously this technology is
still in pampers we still don't know how
long we'll have to wait to actually see
it but it's great to see progress in
this direction but that leads you to the
question of the day do you really
believe that kinetic energy would be the
smartest way to fix our battery issues
because in my particular case I'd say
yes I'd say that movement should be part
of the way you've recharge your phone
aside from solar power and any other
means to keep your phone on but then
again because smartphones are so
powerful and because this technology is
so new you kind of don't really dent
your usage so these are comment down
below would you like this feature in
your next smartphone or not because I
would I just wish it were better I'm hi
never been i and whatever happened to
those times when we got free phones when
people went crazy celebrating
doorbell pretty that I and instead of
deals whatever happened to what the hell
how was that yeah shut up Matt still
recording yeah Bluebird tonight friends

the news earlier before this video was
filmed she follow us on a pocketnow.com
