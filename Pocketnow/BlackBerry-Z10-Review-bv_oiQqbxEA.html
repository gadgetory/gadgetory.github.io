Windows Phone competition and spent
almost two weeks getting to know it now
it's time to find out if the new
BlackBerry is everything it's maker
desperately needs it to be I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
full review of the BlackBerry z10 so
taking a first look at the Z tens build
you can see why comparisons to the
iPhone 5 design may be inevitable but in
person the new BlackBerry is very much
its own device with its own identity it
sits nicely in the hand with the
machined stainless-steel volume buttons
resting right under the thumb along with
the handy mute and voice control key in
the middle the feel in hand is good
combining with the 9 millimeter
thickness and the stippled rubber of the
battery cover for a feel that's substr d
but not brick like our unit came with a
nice blackberry case - which did a good
job of stroking our nostalgia the 4.2
inch display is more prone to
fingerprints than other screens we've
tested recently but it delivers a sharp
looking picture at 356 PPI underneath it
all is a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor backed up by two gigs of RAM
and 16 gigs of storage expandable to an
additional 64 gigs via micro sd and the
radio load includes LTE which we always
appreciate in all we're looking at a
fairly typical hardware portfolio in a
package that feels very nice in the hand
the new BlackBerry 10 user interface is
kind of a mashup of traditional
paradigms like the app lists and newer
ideas like the active frames in the
homescreen these cards depict recently
used apps that are running in the
background and they can almost serve as
pseudo widgets if the developer has
enabled that functionality if not
they're just minimized app icons they
change position depending on what's been
accessed most recently which makes sense
but they're constantly moving as a
result which not everyone will
appreciate another loved it or hated
feature of bb10 is its gesture based
interface necessary on a device that
doesn't feature a back or a home button
it also lets you do things like unlock
the screen without using the power
standby key up top which is a nice touch
the new BlackBerry keyboard benefits
from the new emphasis on sliding letting
you flick words into place with very
smart predictive software though it's
more useful in one hand
than two-handed use gestures are
probably most useful in terms of the
peak functionality which lets you
quickly check your inbox to see what
kind of a notification you've received
and if you want to deal with it without
having to leave the app you're currently
in if you do decide to answer
notification you enter probably the best
asset blackberry 10 has to offer the hub
this is where all notifications go from
alarms to emails to texts to third-party
app alerts like Facebook IMS and Google
chats it's the same aggregated inbox
that Blackberry became famous for
dressed up for modern times it's really
nice and probably our favorite aspect of
this new platform finally there's the
app conversation which is just loaded
with butts the new BlackBerry launched
with 70,000 apps but not a lot of
big-name titles like Netflix and Skype
but they're coming soon but are you
willing to wait that's the most
important question in the app discussion
and the answer will help tell you
whether you want the z10 or not the z10
is a fairly middle-of-the-road
smartphone when it comes to the
fundamentals voice calling is average
with quality good on our end over both
speaker and earpiece but colors said we
sounded a little fluffy like we were
talking through a thin blanket reception
in Toronto Ontario on bail and in the
Greater Boston area on AT&amp;amp;T was good
from HSPA to LTE with good data speeds -
in terms of the interface the z10 runs
smoothly with almost no stuttering or
lag the browser performs well on
benchmarks and in normal use it's fine
we like that it still features flash
which isn't quite dead yet but it's not
without its quirks our test unit also
has some basic bugs like auto-rotate
being too sensitive or GPS being slow to
lock on and we didn't appreciate that
turn-by-turn navigation locking up on us
while driving but like it or not these
are the kind of bugs you have to expect
with any brand new platform so no one
should be surprised we should also note
that some of the issues we were
experiencing may have been the result of
a defective review unit which Blackberry
promptly swapped for us for the full
story on that please see the full
written review at pocketnow.com the 8
megapixel camera is another
middle-of-the-road attribute of the z10
in normal lighting it's not bad
though its results are a little on the
soft side and we wish its field of view
or wider like a lot of smartphones if
you take the light away it does pretty
poorly there's a small array of features
in the viewfinder and BlackBerry's time
shift mode is a cute gimmick video is
sharp in 1080p but a little bouncy even
with stabilization turned on in all it's
neither awful nor outstanding it's just
an average smartphone shooter
sadly the stock 1800 milliamp hour
battery isn't quite up to all this
stress it gets us through most days with
moderate use but any kind of prolonged
heavy use sends endurance plummeting
you're gonna want to invest in spare
batteries if you're a power user there's
a lot of excitement about the new
BlackBerry and if you're cynical it's
not easy to see why the new platform is
lacking a lot of apps its software is
not quite fully cooked and the z10
hardware is pretty average but it's also
a collection of very good ideas in terms
of the interface married to the
messaging excellence that's made
blackberry a household name and mixed
with some impressive momentum right out
the gate the new BlackBerry isn't
perfect and it'll have a hard time
gluing those already invested in more
mature platforms like Android iOS and
Windows Phone but if you're upgrading
from an old Blackberry or feature phone
you value a solid messaging experience
and a fluid UI and you're willing to
wait possibly a long time for some major
applications you could definitely do
worse than the BlackBerry z10 we give it
a 7 out of 10 folks I hope you enjoyed
