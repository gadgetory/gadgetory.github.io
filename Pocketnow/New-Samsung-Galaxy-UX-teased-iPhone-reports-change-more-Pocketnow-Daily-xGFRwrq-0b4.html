their developer conference this time
with their new UX Apple isn't giving out
their sales numbers anymore for iPhones
and we're already scratching our heads
over the reason and a very trusted
source just called a Penta lens Nokia 9
official provided some you know really
credible leaks I'm Jaime Mata Rivera and
because I haven't really stopped working
all through that the weekend this feels
like Thursday you know where I'm going
with this so this is bogging out daily
sponsored by Tang the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for iPads I would highly
recommend you visit either Costco or B&amp;amp;H
as a the case of Costco the regular size
nine point seven inch iPad which is not
a pro or anything it's currently 350
bucks which is pretty much $100 off and
then B&amp;amp;H has got other deals for the
iPad as well you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
Google pixels late as a pre-orders I've
just begun with a launch coming very
soon for those of you that want you to
get your hands on one
I know it's 800 bucks and it's a
Chromebook it's definitely probably one
of the best Chromebooks that I've ever
seen I do love the pixel book don't get
me wrong but the price tag on this thing
for me is just baffling you can learn
more about it in the description if
you're interested I want to give it a
try but I'm not sure if I can totally be
like yeah I'm a Chromebook guy now let's
talk about Nokia as we've got some on
leaked renders of the Nokia 9 Penta lens
camera phone we thought it wasn't real
we thought it was photoshopped and then
one thing once things get into on leaks
it's very hard for these not to happen
so yeah we've got the Penta lens array
which looks like if there are more
lenses but there's a flash and there's
probably another sensor on the other end
it looks sleek it apparently will bring
back that peer view branding that was
lost with a Microsoft I'm looking
forward to it let's see what we get now
let's talk about Apple as a the company
has a sort of made it official that
there won't be any more details on the
amount of phones that the company sells
usually whenever they reach quarter
results they provide they sold these
amount of millions of iPhones
and that rendered this amount of revenue
and stuff like that but apparently if I
got this right they won't be providing
numbers as to how many iPhones are sold
and that's weird as a they're not
obligated to provide the numbers but it
actually has made them look good and it
could just be that it's not making them
look good the last time that Apple had
record-breaking sales was in 2014 and
sure the iPhone 10 sold more than
expected but not as much as Apple would
have wanted so just bear in mind this
might happen for the next quarter
results and finally the most interesting
news today have to do with the Samsung
developer conference that's about to
happen and the fact that the company
continues teasing more we saw the
Samsung branding being folded so yes we
have a foldable product but then the
other thing is that it seems that there
will be a developer beta for Android 9pi
that brings the whole new UX so yeah
there's a reason why it's been delayed
and it seems that the new UX will be
more simplistic according to leaks
obviously this is just a teaser I can't
wait to see what we get particularly
because uh it's not that I'm I don't
like the Samsung UI at just unnecessary
in certain things so let us know in the
comments what do you think have you
grown into the Samsung UI or is it one
of those things that makes you drift
away from it leave us a comment down
below as for me I like it but I would
love changes and at the same time I'd
like to ask you to stay until the end
for a message of or sponsor that allows
this video to be possible and before we
end this video let me tell you about our
sponsor ting ting does mobile phone
service differently there are no startup
fees no contracts no plans best of all
