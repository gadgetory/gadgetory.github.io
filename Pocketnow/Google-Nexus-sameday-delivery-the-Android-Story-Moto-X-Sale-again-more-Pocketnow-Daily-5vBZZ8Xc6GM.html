service for Nexus devices specs of the
first Android and firefox smartphone
emerged and it seems Motorola listens
the one hundred fifty dollar savings on
the Moto X return I'm high memory that I
and how about if you carry the whole
Friday joke for next week I'll
definitely take a look this is parking
out daily let's search the off with some
official news as believe it or not
Google is now offering same-day delivery
service for certain Nexus devices and
yeah of course there is a catch this is
not available in the whole United States
only in the San Francisco Bay Area as a
test number one and number two it's only
available for certain nexus 7 models and
Nexus tens aside from the chromecast so
if you're interested in these and you
are in the Bay Area should definitely
give it a try for the price tag but we
are hopeful that this will come to other
cities eventually and if you do not
remember anything about the geek phone
don't worry you're not alone we talked
about this phone almost a year ago and
it hasn't happened yet this is the first
phone to be running Android and Firefox
OS at the same time or obviously dual
booting but the problem is that now that
we look at the specification links down
below for details it's sadly a very
affordable phone so I don't think it's
gonna make much fanfare and if you
thought that Samsung had enough names on
their products you're wrong they have
more in store according to some rumors
as apparently the company will now be
adopting the names light and throw into
their products in the future so you
could be seeing a samsung galaxy note
10.1 light and a samsung galaxy note
10.1 pro coming eventually and we could
probably add some more names by the year
2015 so stay tuned as this is going to
be a very hilarious 2014 and yes it does
seem that motorola listens to the
complaints of people as the company is
now bringing back their deals which are
one hundred fifty dollars off and unlock
moto x or fifty percent off the contract
price of a moto x which could mean that
either the deals weren't great or the
deals were so good to be true that they
want to do them again now there is a
catch this deal is only available for
the viewers of the Today Show so even if
you do not view that they show links
down below it has the full procedure on
how to get that moto x of that price and
take advantage I know I will and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
a christmas album which was one of the
primary engineers of android back in the
early days is just come on record with a
little story of how the whole iphone
launched in 2007 came to change
everything that they had worked on when
it came to android you know these people
came from danger and then they
eventually started the whole project of
android and apparently this was going to
be more of a blackberry sort of device
there's actually a link in the
description for the video where we see
sergey brin showing us that phone which
was made by HTC back then and obviously
once the iphone launched in early two
thousand seven everything changed they
pretty much changed absolutely their
whole strategy into the t-mobile g1 that
we eventually saw an Android where you
see it now but that leads you to the
question of the day back then you know
in 2007 what phone were you using and
which platform that you want iOS or
Android in my particular case i was
using a motorola q 9h i believe which
was one of my favorite phones of all
time and I didn't really care about the
iphone i wanted to stick to windows
mobile but leave us a comment down below
what was your case and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
