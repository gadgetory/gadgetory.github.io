embedded in them the messages most cars
send us are unintelligible and that's
what one company hopes to change I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is our floor view of automatic I rather
enjoy driving my car it isn't the
biggest baddest machine on the road but
it's immensely fun to drive and raises a
few eyebrows the inside however is drab
and the instrument panel is bare stoic
it doesn't have much to say and for that
matter neither does any reasonably
priced car from the last decade or so as
the creator of automatic says cars have
had powerful computers inside them for
years but that hasn't improved the way
that we drive them and he's right we sit
in the driver's seat
each morning buckle up start the car and
press the gas pedal without regard to
how much money each start and stop is
costing us there's a language barrier
between cars and their drivers
instrument panel send us cryptic
messages scarce of useful information
and that's where automatic steps in to
health the automatic link a module would
supports most cars released in the u.s.
since 1996 plugs into the obd2 data port
on your car typically located beneath
the steering wheel it communicates to
your phone via bluetooth low energy
feeding it all sorts of information
directly from the brain of your car gas
mileage velocity and even engine codes
its goal is to make you more
conscientious of your driving how each
take off and stop affects your wallet or
how pushing the speed limit is costing
you more overtime installation is
incredibly simple download the free
application to your iPhone create an
account enter the automatic link
security pin into the app plug the link
into your car's obd2 port and start the
engine from there you drive and it
immediately begins tracking your driving
hit the gas a little too hard when
taking off in the automatic link will
chirp to let you know you're using more
fuel and in return spending more money
it will also chirp when you brake too
hard or exceed 70 miles per hour using
GPS it tracks your routes and calculates
based on real time local gas prices and
your fuel efficiency how much each trip
costs you no matter how long or short it
does this by dividing the distance of
your trip by your average fuel
efficiency and multiplying it by the
current price of gasoline in the area
double checking the math of the
estimates with the local gas prices
we've confirmed the automatic link is
incredibly accurate if you use regular
gasoline however our car requires 91
octane or higher premium gasoline the
fuel prices automatic uses our regular
grade gasoline not premium meaning the
cost estimates of each drive are
actually incorrect for us that's only a
small issue though one automatic tell
assess that choosing premium gas will be
available in the future and the effect
is still the same we're more aware of
how we're driving and the money we're
spending even if the price is displayed
are not 100% accurate
for instance we took a drive to a local
coffee shop this morning with all the
audio feedback for the link turned off
the result our fuel economy went down
and the cost of the short trip went up a
seven point seven mile trip this morning
cost us 87 cents other trips to the same
coffee shop with the link audio feedback
turned on only cost us around 50 cents
within the iPhone app you can look
through all of your driving history
separated by week you can see exactly
how many times and where you accelerated
or break too hard and where and how long
you drove over 70 miles per hour it
provides the start and end point for
each trip with timestamps for both you
can tap to expand each trip summary
which displays a miniature map of the
route as well as the cost average fuel
efficiency and distance of the trip the
top summary is an overview of the entire
week showing exactly how long you spent
driving how much that driving cost you
overall fuel efficiency travel distance
and your score judging by how many times
the link has chirped at you and your
fuel efficiency the automatic iPhone app
provides you with a score out of 100
it's an arbitrary number which doesn't
really translate directly to anything in
the real world other than the closer
your score to 100 the better your
driving and the more money you're saving
this isn't all automatic does however
each time you get out of your car it
also records
GPS location so you never forget where
you parked being plugged into the obd2
port comes with some advantages it has a
direct connection to your engine when
your check engine light comes on for any
reason the application displays what's
going on under the hood with an engine
code in a short description of what's
happening it gives you a shortcut to all
the local mechanic shops as well and the
ability to clear the code right then and
there another ability of automatic we
were not able to test is the crash alert
system which is still in beta automatic
can detect when a traffic accident
occurs using the accelerometer inside in
the event of a crash automatic will
report the accident to the local
authorities and send text messages to up
to three preset contacts with your
location and will also tell them that
help is on the way
overall automatic is a simple yet
compelling piece of equipment if you
care anything about saving money while
driving it will force you to pay more
attention to how heavy your foot is on
the pedals and it pays off in the end at
100 dollars the device isn't cheap
but it could very well pay for itself
over a matter of months who knows maybe
it could save your life and that's why
we give automatic a nine out of ten
that's gonna do it for this time if you

it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
