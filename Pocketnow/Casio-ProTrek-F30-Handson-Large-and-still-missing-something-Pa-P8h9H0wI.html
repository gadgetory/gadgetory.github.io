opportunity to check out the caste of
protract watch at Aoife and I had the
opportunity also to check out the latest
version of ware or West that was
announced at the same time this is TK
and this is PocketNow on XDA the
protract definitely has a very unique
design it comes in three colors and the
main benefit that we get here is the
milspec 810g
certification that we have on the
SmartWatch and it capability we're
actually going down up to 50 meters
below water you're going to be getting
the best experience on a SmartWatch
using where OS to date as Google
announced the latest version of where OS
at the same time as this watch although
this watch will not be available till
early next year and hopefully with an
updated CPU what we promise at this
point is a very good unique experience
the water rating that we have on this
watch is very nice we have a proprietary
adapter that's magnetically connecting
to the actual watch on the side in but
the entire watch is waterproof and water
sealed it's intended to be in the
outdoors we're talking also the
capability of actually having offline
maps into a watch that you can carry
with you so that's some really big
functionality cashiers claiming up to 30
days of battery life on this watch and
it's capable of doing this by using the
monochrome display to this place that we
have here essentially is a monochrome
display any color display and if you
stick to those monochrome display with
limited functionality it can actually go
up to 30 days general usage is gonna be
about 1.5 days and mix usage between
that and the monochrome in the display
you're able to code up to 3 to 4 days on
a single charge the lack of a heart rate
monitor may not be for everybody but the
fact is that this watch is intended to
be a beast you can take it outdoors use
it for any type of sport it is sealed
and it has a very high milspec rating on
it it feels great in the hand I had the
opportunity to play with it while
walking around Aoife and I want to say
that it's definitely one of the next
watches I would love to be able to check
out the latest version of where OS will
be coming to this watch and it was
definitely demoed on one of the units we
had on the show floor transitions were
very nice very smooth very fluid we had
the assistant in a own kind of like at
Google now similar to that on the left
side and as well as the a better
notification access from the bottom up
and more toggles from the top
overall a lot of good optimization is
done on a really good built watch that
is intended to be outdoors you have
offline maps a really good application
support as you can expect the only thing
that I noticed about this watch that was
missing was a heart rate sensor so if
that's something that was really a need
for you you may want to consider looking
at this watch and consider all the
positives and see if that actually ends
up being a good fit for you
availability for the watch is going to
be in early 2019 as far as pricing we
weren't able to get a direct price from
them but overall I'm really excited
about this new project watch from Casio
and the new features that we're getting
with the way are OS update that's coming
down let me know in the comments below
what do you guys think of the protract
watch from casio I'm personally very
excited I like the color options we have
a blue and orange and a black one and of
course I would have wish for this to be
available a lot sooner than January of
2019 this is TK I want to say thank you
very much for the support I could
subscribe as usual keep it here with us
from Aoife for all the coverage that
we're providing to you guys check out my
channel and I'll see you guys in the
near future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
