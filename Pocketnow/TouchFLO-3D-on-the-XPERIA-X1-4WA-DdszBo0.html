pocketnow.com and the xperia x1 just got
a little bit cooler the guys over at XDA
developers have found a way to port the
touch hds touchflo 3d to the xperia x1
and it works perfectly it actually shows
up as one of the panels here now the
standard today panel up here in the
upper left corner let's take a look and
here it is and it works just like it
does on any other HTC device we have the
stocks tab which is new so you can flick
through different stock charts and see
how all of your investments stand
although they seem to be all down today
we can go back to the beginning and you
know we get the standard flick to see
more appointments we can go two favorite
people we can read messages flick
through email and everything works
everything works even the even the links
so if I man in the internet tab I can
click on a launch browser it will launch
opera photos and video worked it
searched my device in my storage card
for pictures so that that works well
same thing with music it immediately
looked into my device and found all the
music that was there whether works great
and now we get that forecast right on
the screen rather than in another panel
or not panel another pain i should say
in other HTC devices and over in
settings we have some slightly different
settings we have customized tabs which
there goes and we can actually think we
can rearrange these let's see take the
stylus yeah we can actually rearrange
the tabs you couldn't do that before and
of course over to the right we have
programs and from here you can tap on a
plus and add you know any old program
and there you have it i'll post a
download link on pocketnow.com on on how
to get this for the xperia x1 and don't
forget to follow us on twitter at
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets to
find out about these videos before
anyone else does that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
