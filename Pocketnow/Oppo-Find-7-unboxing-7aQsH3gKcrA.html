announced two phones the find 7a which
was the first to the market which we
have already reviewed and the find 7
which is the higher and version actually
the find 7 which we have right here is
the first 2k display phone announced but
not the first one to the market we have
it in our labs we're gonna unbox it and
start our coverage so stay tuned
much like the box of the Oppo find 7 a
this is the box of the Oppo find 7 of
course this is not the box itself it is
just a carton packaging with this flap
here to chew up quickly and easily open
it and once we do that we get to the
main box itself and I don't have to give
it to Oppo we have mentioned this in our
Opel find 7a review as well the
packaging is very premium like it
reminds us of how Apple packages its
gadgets let's go ahead and the ripoff
this plastic right here and for that we
have the you know obligatory scissors
and we'll probably just speed up this
entire part of the video because you're
interested in the contents of the box
itself and here we go this is either a
very thick carton or plastic but we
don't care about that we have defined 7
right up front a little bit to the side
exactly the way the find 7a shipped and
let's take a look at other contents of
the box we have a typical charger which
is a European plug because this is the
European version because we are in
Europe and we have some headphones right
here once we get the focus to work
headphones with additional gels so that
you can not have your perfect fit in
your ear and we have the USB cable for
syncing because the charger has a non
detachable cable the battery is right
here with the documentation itself which
we never read but we advise you to do so
and once we get the focus on we have the
3000 milliamp hour battery which is a
tad larger than the battery on the find
7a let's put everything to the side and
focus on what's important the phone
which is right here and this is the
midnight version it will be a very good
thing that we have two different colored
opals because we have the find 7a on the
left it's the white one and the find 7
on
right it is the midnight color let's go
ahead and peel off the screen protector
silence please I'm not sure the camera
caught that but else this is the find
seven and it is exactly the same as the
find 7a on the outside running down the
specs just a little bit and quickly we
have a 5.5 inch 2k quad HD screen 2560
by 1440 and underneath the screen and
let's take this opportunity to compare
the two just real quick
we have a Snapdragon 801 processor on
both 2.5 gigahertz undefined seven here
the midnight 12.3 gigahertz I believe on
the find 7a we have three gigs of ram on
the find seven two gigs of ram on the
find 7a the battery is 3000 milliamp
hours versus 2800 on the find 7a of
course 16 gigabytes of storage on the 7a
32 gigabytes on the 7 both of them are
expandable we'll get more in depth on
these specifications and just taking
around the device look quickly we have
the earpiece up top
we have a factory applied screen
protector if you can see that right
there we have the webcam some proximity
sensors this is where the probably
coolest notification LED on the market
is today it is pulsing you'll see that
in our full review we have buttons for
volume up and volume down we have
additional microphone 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack power button and around
the back we have the 13 megapixel camera
with dual LED flash and the Oppo logo
let's pop open the back cover so we can
insert the battery and this is always
tricky with find devices but once we get
your nail fingernail in there it should
be easier there we go and let's insert
the battery and a SIM card and with
those in let's go for a first boot and
while the phone boots
we'll just laid on the table and thank
