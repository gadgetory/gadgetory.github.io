displays on phones there I said it and
I'm not just talking about VR
applications either I genuinely want all
phone screens to have a high enough
pixel density that no living human being
on the planet could ever discern
individual pixels from their phone
screens no matter what the distance of
the phone from their face is in many of
our reviews you probably her to say that
1080p resolution at arm's length is fine
it's fine totally fine and it is fine
but fine isn't better fine isn't great
fine isn't progress progress is progress
there's the common knowledge idea out
there somewhere around apples Retina
Display a pixel density of about 326
pixels per inch when viewed at a
distance of around 11 inches from the
face that a human with 2020 eyesight can
no longer discern individual dots I'm
really nervous I'm gonna poke myself in
the eye with this thing okay and that's
actually accurate we can back that up
with science but having 2020 vision
doesn't mean you have perfect eyesight
just that you've got acceptable visual
acuity for a human being who lives on
this planet when it comes to interacting
with things like walking around or
driving a car there's little reason to
test beyond this 2020 standard if you've
ever had your eyes checked and you've
been able to read lines of text below
where your optometrist stopped then
chances are pretty good that you have
better than twenty twenty eyesight also
at no other time in history have so many
people who were born with less than
ideal eyesight been able to so easily
correct their eyesight either through
corrective lenses or through laser
surgeries and this is definitely a more
anecdotal point but I think a number of
people would agree that they don't often
consistently hold their phone exactly 11
inches or more away from their face if
I'm reading reddit in bed for example
chances are pretty good that I'm going
to try and have my phone occupy as much
of my field of view as I can if there
are a number of people who have better
than 20 20 eyesight and we can
acknowledge that there will be times
where we hold our phones closer to our
faces then 11 inches away why are we
quibbling about the minimum possible
resolution needed to satisfy normal
eyesight ok to nerd out on a little
math and assuming a human being with the
best possible eyesight and assuming that
the closest minimum focusing distance
away from the human faces around 4
inches that hypothetical human would be
able to discern individual dots on a
screen with a resolution somewhere
around two thousand pixels per inch if
an individual with that visual acuity
actually exists they would be extremely
uncommon and yet reading through the
comments on a number of our videos i
would estimate that around thirty
percent of our audience has even better
eyesight than that true story if we
scale back that I site to normal 2020
but maintain that minimum focusing
distance of around 4 inches we get over
800 ppi okay yeah that that is pretty
close 800 ppi which on a 5.5 inch screen
would roughly work out to somewhere
around a you HD resolution the Sony
Xperia z5 premium with a 4k display for
example at a pixel density of around
eight hundred and six pixels per inch
that's it folks that's the absolute
maximum for almost all of us now quad HD
resolution screens 2560 x 1440 will
largely address all of these pixel
density issues for folks who care about
such things the galaxy s7 screen is
pretty dense 577 pixels per inch in I
can't see any dots even with the pentile
display and for many out there even quad
HD is going to represent diminishing
returns but instead of these incremental
baby steps or sliding back and forth
between good and very good why don't we
just jump to the theoretical maximum
more resolution doesn't hurt anyone who
can't actually perceive it and there may
be some folks out there experiencing
phantom eye strain that they can't quite
pin down from looking at lower
resolution screens while trying to read
text or look at fine details I have
somewhere around 2020 eyesight and
reading text on my tablet and then
moving to a phone feels like a
revelation it feels like a dirty screen
protector has been pulled off of the
world and we're likely moving into a
future where we use more virtual and
augmented reality applications which
might push our phone screens closer to
our eyes naturally or require the use of
magnifique
patient yeah I want this folks you HD
screens on phones I think it's time I
think we're ready and now I patiently
await all of the politely and
respectfully worded comments we're sure
to receive telling us just how wrong you
think I am as always folks thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe

for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos pagnell you can chat me up on
Twitter and Instagram as some gadget guy
and I will catch you all on the next
video more resolution doesn't hurt
anyone who can't actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
