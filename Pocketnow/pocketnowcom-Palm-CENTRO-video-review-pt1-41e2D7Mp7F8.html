and this is
one of the video review for the UK sim
free palm centro now pick this device up
about a week or so ago at the UK launch
and i've been using it ever since i must
admit i am really impressed with the
phone it's small it's a nice for fight
so the refer to it as a candy bar
because it is not much bigger than a
mars bar if it's nicely in your hand if
it's nicely in your pocket i even carry
this in my shirt pocket and and it's not
as if it weighs it down or anything it's
great now let me run around the device
and i will show you some of the hardware
features that it's got in part one and
that will probably give you some idea as
to why i like it so much starting with
the top there's a switch which is common
to quite a lot of palm devices and it's
a mutant vibrate switch and you switch
it from one side to the other and amuse
the device and switch the inter vibrate
mode now that's brilliant why more
phones don't have that i have no idea
when you're in a meeting and your phone
goes off you slip your hand in your
pocket you flick it across and that's it
that's all you need do you don't need to
take it out your addy pocket with my
with my titan if it goes off and I've
forgotten to mute at first I have to
fiddle around switch it on I have to
have to tap the icon and and mute the
device and switch it off and with this
it's it's as simple as putting my hand
in my pocket it's great really really
common sense device that on the side
here they've got the infrared saw
adapter the infrared socket which again
I said I don't know what thinking is
behind putting this on here because I
don't really know anybody that uses it's
much much more and more phones now are
phasing out the infrared in favor of
Bluetooth too and I wonder if they'd
have lost this could there spend that
money that in the cost on upgrading from
bluetooth one point to which this is to
a Bluetooth to chip which would have
given things like a2dp but they
obviously had their own reasons just
below there we have the microSD socket
now they've limited this to four
gigabytes which again is I think a
little bit strange considering the fact
that this is aimed at a younger market
where they're used to having media on
their phone be it movies music photos
videos that kind of thing i find that
four gigabytes runs out very quickly
especially
if you're on the move as well i mean i
watch movies and things on the train
when i'm traveling to work and having it
reduced to four gigabytes from one used
to in my tight and eight gigabytes is is
a bit of a backward step for me but
anyway it said still it's still fogging
still sufficient from first for most
people's general usage now you can see
I've got some thumbnail but getting this
thing out is actually quite difficult
and it's a little bit fiddly you have to
poke your thumbnail in there and then
and then pull the flap down and then you
can just see inside there is the socket
now trying to get that out on a train
station is to switch it for another four
gig one with music or something else on
is is not the easiest thing to do and
you liable to you lose it so the easiest
thing to do is just slip the back off
there and then you can see you can
access much more easily and it just
clicks in once got the back off there
you can see the battery it's 1150
milliamp hour battery and just below
that is the sim card ok just put the
back on here so just moving on to the
back of the device here you can see the
camera lens there which is a 1.3
megapixel camera which does still photos
and video and as you've seen in the
example that I put in my review it's a
fairly good quality picture with the two
times digital zoom next of that is the
speaker which is used for media playback
and for speaker phone which is it's a
really good quality speaker it's it's
clear and its sound is fairly loud too
in the top corner on the back there we
have the stylus its full length plastic
stylus which just slots in the corner
there because this is a 320 x 320
touchscreen as I've said and I must
admit I haven't used the stylus very
much because the configuration of the
keyboard and the keys is so well well
laid out well thought out that I times
even forgotten needs it's a touchscreen
phone and I've relied on the touchscreen
very little which is says a lot about my
time because i use the titans
touchscreen an awful lot and perhaps
that's because the d-pad being at the
bottom makes it difficult to use and
then constantly switching around to flip
the keyboard this is is is great the
bottom of the device is the one thing i
don't really like there's a series of
proprietary connectors as you can see
that's a standard connector that's 2.5
millimeter jack club which will take
stereo headphones or the motto headphone
the supplied next to it though there's a
proprietary charge and sync in line
connector now there are enough
manufacturers out there at the moment
that I've managed to figure out how to
make a phone use a mini USB socket which
will both charge and sync from the same
thing so why on earth other
manufacturers can't do it I don't know
come on lets you know stop doing this
everyone's got loads of USB sockets
lying around the house and they might as
well all be standard and the only reason
I can think of doing it is laziness or
perhaps there's plenty of profit in
selling on cables next to there you can
see the power connector which is for the
wall socket which again is a proprietary
connector it seats not something I've
ever seen before it's a square bizarre
configuration and I've got nothing like
it around the house now there's no
reason to have that it could be
integrated as one as one piece is he
just takes a bit of thought I know if I
can just switch it on and I'll show you
the keyboard in action and I'll give you
some idea then as to as to as to how it
does actually work in practice so if i
switch it on and i'm in the memo is
there so just try it type a quick
message here and i'm going to see how
well i can do it
and what if I typed it says terry says
hi to all our readers now there's no
spell checker on there there's nothing i
just typed that straight away now I felt
my thumb hit a couple of keys equal of
times but it's still accurate enough to
pick up exactly what I wanted to say and
I'm really impressed with that is great
for typing text messages or for jotting
notes just like this really good well
thought out well it very usable so
that's part one in part to what I want
to do is show you the media capabilities
of the phone but this is the end of the
first part of the video review for the
UK sim free palm centro thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
