video of the day we are here with this
product which you will most likely want
to have in your bag we are talking about
the mobile Wi-Fi 57 86 let's take a look
at what it does according to who Ave
this is the fastest Wi-Fi router on the
planet which uses a sim card in order to
transform the cat6 LTE signal to Wi-Fi
signals to which your gadgets phones
tablets laptops or desktops can't
connect it's got a proprietary as you
can see we have been exiting the sleep
mode insert sim it's very proprietary
user interface that also has a QR code
which you can scan with your smartphone
and tablet in order to pair or to
connect so you no longer have to
remember pins or passwords and of course
you can download the applications
straight to your phone or your tablet
you can see exactly how much data you
have consumed and the battery life left
on this mobile Wi-Fi e-50 786 it's
battery is rated for 10 hours of
continuous Wi-Fi signal that is
transforming LTE cat6 signal into Wi-Fi
and as you can see we're taking a look
at the general aspect of it's very Babel
like with a rounded shape with a power
adapter on the bottom where you can
charge it this part is glossy and as you
can tell it will collect fingerprints
like a champion but hopefully you won't
have to touch it that much that's the
button which tells you to insert the SIM
it's not a touchscreen it's an OLED
screen
flipping it to the side there's this
there's a menu button actually right
here on the top and this is the way you
operate it pushing the same button takes
you down the menu and pushing the power
button will bring you back from the menu
so device info we got all the S Society
information and the IP information here
and getting back we have the Wi-Fi band
selection option we have the data
roaming option the WLAN option and so on
fast-food all the things which we will
probably not cover as a review and even
though this product is not within our
scope there's an adjacent product
because it's very useful for instance if
you're in Barcelona and you need to
tether from your GS for one it's in your
laptop
this has been an antenna behind the
camera Bob a once again cheat sheet
mobile Wi-Fi in 57 86 thank you very
much for watching stay tuned for more
