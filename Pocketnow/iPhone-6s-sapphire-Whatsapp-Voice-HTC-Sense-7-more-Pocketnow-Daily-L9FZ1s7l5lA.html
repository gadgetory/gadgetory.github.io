back-up plan for it's a fire needs
whatsapp League show us that will soon
be able to make phone calls through it
and we learn new details on HTC Sense
seven for existing one smartphones I'm
high-net iveta and yeah if I'm working
today is because we really love you guys
this is parking out daily Merry
Christmas t wall let's begin today with
what's official as we learn more details
of Apple pay but not necessarily good
ones Apple has just finally updated
their website to say that there are
certain retailers that are coming soon
no longer coming later this year as the
website said and you know Apple hasn't
provided any specifics coming soon could
mean so many things it could mean and
the next year could be you know probably
earlier we don't really know but it does
seem that Apple is a having some success
in one point and not so much success in
others let's see how that goes and
speaking of Apple if you thought the
company have lost its hopes for sapphire
on an iPhone after the whole GT advanced
fiasco think again we did hear that
Bart's Khan was using its subsidiary in
a Luke's to build a 3.2 billion dollar
facility in China in order to have a
display factory for Apple nothing
confirmed but we have some very credible
sources from the guy that pretty much
leaked everything from the iphone 6 this
year and the guy is claiming that yeah
vakhtang is going to build sapphire and
at the next generation iphone will have
sapphire let's see how that goes let's
talk about the company that had too many
flops this year amazon the company's
fire phone was terrible and sales at
least and its kindle tablets pretty much
went under the radar whenever they were
updated but the company is trying to
make things right they are offering 40
applications on their android app store
for free a value of two hundred and
twenty dollars and yeah if you don't
have the amazon appstore just get it
right now so i load the applications
figure it out because these are some
really good applications at least most
of them now let's move the spotlight
over to HTC as we hear about HTC Sense 7
we thought that was going to be part of
the lollipop law on to the next few
weeks but the reports claim that that
will still be sent six or a new version
of it but still send six in essence and
apparently the company is already
working on bringing sense 7 to the
market and will be available
in May for existing one smartphones and
pretty much every other smartphone that
HTC launched this year which is very
interesting as we are expecting the next
HTC One to be available somewhere around
April meaning that yeah April will be
the launch for the new phone and that
will bring the new version of sense and
then you can get it on the old
smartphones and make cool and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
one of the most popular messaging
services in the world what's happening
working on some very interesting updates
in its Android application notice i only
say android apparently the company is
bringing phone call capabilities for
android users which is very interesting
as yeah you currently can do voice
messaging you can curly chat and so many
other things and yeah there's a reason
why facebook page so many million
dollars for this application but
apparently it's going to take things to
a next step which is cool but it does
lead me to the question of the day we've
been able to make phone calls and
facebook blackberry messenger and other
messengers for the longest time but the
question is do you use this feature
because in my particular case by stick
to skype i think skype does at best and
i don't really trust these other
services but leave us a comment down
below prove me wrong friends you know
