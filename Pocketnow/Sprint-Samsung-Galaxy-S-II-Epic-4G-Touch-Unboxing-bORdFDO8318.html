pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
special look at the sprint samsung
galaxy s2 Epic 4G Touch so sit back
relax and enjoy the show
now the galaxy s2 Epic 4G Touch or let's
just call it the epic touch for sake of
time is the first galaxy s2 phone in the
United States's this bonus must come out
September 16th
it's a highly sought after or a thought
after device based upon what the reviews
have been saying about the galaxy s2 by
itself so let's go ahead and open up the
box take a look we find
standard sprint box here and here's the
device itself just set that aside we'll
come back to in a second take off the
cover here we've got our paperwork
manuals guides and a little plastic
baggie to send back your now sad phone
that doesn't live up to this phone and a
USB charging cable sync cable and the
wall warts now the Epic 4G Touch has a
4.5 2 inch screen it's WVGA 800 by 480
pixels it's got 4 capacitive touch
buttons on the front front facing camera
you all know what that is I hope volume
rocker on the side with a little lanyard
hole over here on the back we've got an
8 megapixel camera with a flash
speakerphone port power button and then
if we pop the back off here top here we
can see the headphone jack the battery
is 50 to 800 I'm sorry 1800 milliamp
hour battery of 800 million better we've
kind of worthless micro SD card slot but
no included micro SD card so you can't
expanded the memory but nothing is
included by default
the back cover is kind of is got a bit
of a textured feel to it slides into
place here step back back on it's a
little slick and kind of shiny but the
textured feel or look is kind of nice
it's got a little bit of a bump back
here just go ahead and turn this device
on and we'll take a look at what's
inside there you'll see DMA only phone
with a WiMAX 4G obviously dual core
Exynos twelve hundred megahertz
processor it's got a gig of ram slide
that open here we can see this nice
screen it moves very very smoothly the
screen is nice and bright from what I
can see so far launch the applications
here keyboard is nice and big which
would be nice for not having the
keyboard as a slide-out let's take a
look at the settings here so it's
running Android 2.3.4 which we expected
and as far as available memory now that
device is already started up as you can
see there's no SD card in there again
total space it says is 11.5 gigs and
that's would be the available space as
well looks to be a very solid device it
feels very lightweight in the hands in
fact the weight of this device it clocks
in at about 129 grams or 4.55 ounces the
device dimensions is 5 by 2 point 7 by
0.3 8 is one of the smallest phones on
the market today compared to say the
Droid 3
you can see that this device is just a
tad longer obviously just a little bit
wider and considerably thinner
especially it's about the size of the
keyboard of the Droid 3 as far as
thickness goes so the Epic 4G Touch is
supposed to be available on Sprint on
the 16th of September 2011 for $1.99 on
a two-year contract there are other
sites that have been announcing some
very similar pricing and some with a
little bit cheaper but really an overall
good price for this newer device that's
just coming out the one thing I didn't
forget to mention is that the a
megapixel camera can do 1080p video
recording which we'll try out in the
full review so that wraps up our
unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy test to
Epic 4G Touch from Sprint man is going
to take a lot to say that every time if
you have any questions or comments or
would like to see something specific
about the hardware or software on this
device leave a message below and we'll
try to cover those items specifically
