pre-orders as well so new Nexus rumors
points were refreshed to the existing
Nexus 6p and the Galaxy s7 deals into a
better option for going unlocked I'm
high Meadow iveta and thanks a lot guys
we did read the comments yes the pagano
daily recap will return very soon this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with Samsung those of you
interested in the galaxy s7 and getting
a better deal it's currently on ebay for
five hundred and sixty dollars but this
options rather interesting as this is
the X and O's variant that you won't
find in the United States easily the
drawback here is that it won't work on
verizon or sprint but for those of you
they wanted to text es knows this is the
way to go other official news come from
Motorola it seems that the company is a
planning an event to happen a new delhi
india on May seventeenth a lot of
companies are making a big deal out of
India and it makes all the sense in the
world there is a gigantic market of
people that are very enthusiastic about
technology so I do get why Motorola's
doing this hopefully it reveals
something that we could also care about
in the United States and for those of
you to travel constantly to Europe yeah
that's most of our cases as well it
seems that the European Union is
starting its new deal on reducing
roaming charges starting today for those
of you that didn't know about this this
is actually a plan that's happening over
the next few months that will eventually
end up on cheaper charges to happen on
2017 for those of you interested in the
specific rates and all the conditions
you can follow more information in the
links of the description and in rather
interesting development we've got some
very interesting benchmarks of a nexus
6p which should be no story but it's
running a Snapdragon 820 processor we've
been covering news of the HTC nexus
devices coming soon but it could just be
that Google might be testing a refresh
to the Nexus 6p and that would be
awesome but then it would render my
beloved Nexus 6p obsolete we'll keep you
posted and finally the very hot news
that they have to do with the HTC 10 if
you like what you saw in our review the
device is now available for pre
on Verizon and Sprint Verizon is cutting
you a very interesting deal you get a
hundred dollars off and even though
sprint doesn't cut you that same deal
it's a cheaper price tag overall this is
one of the hottest smartphones of the
year one of our most beloved in our
review process sadly AT&amp;amp;T is apparently
not going to carry the smartphone but it
does lead me to the question of today
are you interested in getting the HTC 10
is that the smartphone you're getting it
if not which one in my case I cannot
wait for Juan to ship it back to me yes
one you're listening to me I did really
like that phone leave us a comment down
