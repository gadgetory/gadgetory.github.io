professional cameras at this point
largely surface area where DSLRs have
much larger image sensors those sensors
take up a lot more space and as sensor
size increases so does lens size we just
don't have this much room on our phones
we have flirted with larger sensors as
many in our audience might remember the
Lumia 1020 and it's Oreo disk back this
phone sensor is roughly three times
larger than the sensor in the iPhone 7
but compared to an entry-level DSLR it's
1/7 the size those larger sensors allow
proper cameras to use larger pixels and
soak up more light to create more
photographic images DSLR is also benefit
from the ability to swap lenses
customizing the camera for specific
photo situations so how can we get
around these space limitations on our
phones the newest camera trend for 2016
is including multiple camera sensors but
not all systems are created equal the
three examples we'll focus on for this
video are the iPhone 7 plus the huawei
mate 9 and the LG v 20 what are the
differences which might be the best fit
for you let's dig in two of the phones
in our comparison utilize second sensors
to change the field of view simulating a
zoom this makes the V 20 and the iPhone
7 plus more flexible performers changing
the focal length of the lens's onboard
means we can get closer or farther away
from our subject without moving our feet
Apple's approach on the seven-plus is to
zoom in the second sensor acts like a 2x
Hardware zoom doubling the focal length
of the standard sensor which can then be
cropped in further using software
because it's not too dramatically
different from the iPhone standard
sensor these two cameras can be used in
tandem for apples portrait mode a
setting which uses information from both
cameras to create a soft blur to the
background of your photo LG went in the
opposite direction literally using the
second sensors on the g5 and v-22
deliver an ultra wide view it's a
dramatic look at the world which almost
captures a panorama with one shutter
press it's so wide however that the two
cameras can't really be used in tandem
LG has a mode two layer one photo on top
of the other but it's more of a collage
than a true merge
both images when you need to take a step
back from your subject though or capture
more of the scene in front of you
this is a bold solution both Apple and
LG suffer in low-light conditions though
the wide-angle and zoom lenses need
extra space so to compensate the
secondary sensors on both phones use
smaller sensors and smaller apertures to
incorporate smaller lenses and this
means with each exposure on the ultra
wide and the zoom cameras you're
capturing less light but what if we
could use the surface area on the second
sensor to improve capturing light flow
ways approach on the honor 8 p9 and mate
9 is quite different than what LG and
Apple produced this year instead of
using different sensors with different
zoom lenses while ways dual camera
phones use the same sensor size and the
same focal length for both cameras the
main difference for huawei one camera
captures color information while the
other camera captures a black and white
image for light and clarity the exposure
is primarily generated from the color
sensor then contrasts in details from
the monochrome sensor are applied to
improve the final output the results are
unlike any other phone camera we've
reviewed this year improving the dynamic
range of finished JPEGs and preserving
content which might have been lost in
clipped highlights Huawei uses slightly
smaller sensors in apertures than what
we might find on a single camera phone
like a pixel or a galaxy s7 but drawing
data from both sensors for each shot
largely makes up any deficit for
low-light photography since both lenses
are the same the phone is also more
accurate at sensing depth information
where Apple's portrait mode can only be
used in good light at a certain distance
from your subject Huawei's wide aperture
mode can be used in any conditions at
any distances and users can adjust the
amount of blur they want after the shot
has been saved if we don't want thicker
phones or larger camera bulges Huawei
solution is a novel approach for
improving the core photography
experience on a smartphone and this
trend is likely to continue into the
future all three manufacturers here have
found success with their respective fan
bases using this approach companies like
HTC experimented with dual sensor and 3d
cameras in the past rumours point to a
galaxy phone in 2017 trying something
similar and the future of augmented
reality
services will require multiple cameras
as well we hope this primer helped
explain some of the differences and the
pros and cons to each approach so which
system looks like it would be the right
