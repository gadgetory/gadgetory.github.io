incremental improvements that make up
HTC 2015 flagship the one m9 well you're
not alone a shortly after the company
quietly released a bigger better variant
the main asked question why it was in
this year's flagship to begin with and
we've had our hands on it for a little
over 24 hours I'm high on to Houston
with PocketNow reporting my first
impressions of the HTC One m9 plus say
what you will about HTC but they
certainly know how to design a phone the
m9 plus is an amalgamation of all of
HTC's recent efforts combining the
refined design of the m9 with the one I
made dual sensor layout it's the
slightest bit larger than the regular m9
moving it from five inches to five point
two inches and bumping out that display
from 1080p the q HD matching the likes
of the galaxy s6 and the LG g4 it's a
beautiful display full of sharp detail
and true to life colors and it
complements the Sense 7 interface over
lollipop quite nicely the fingerprint
scanner on the front is one of HTC's
features unique to the m9 plus and upon
first setting it up it seems very
responsive it works to unlock the phone
even with the display off and you can
even use it as a home button while
operating the phone if you so choose and
yes the fingerprint sensor sits right in
between the bottom speaker grille but
rest assured boom sound is still alive
and well firing up the camera yielded
some pretty promising first results
colors look better than on other HTC
phones we've used in the past and the 20
megapixel f-22 lens does an admirable
job outdoors taking reasonably well
saturated photos and full resolution
just so long as you don't try to take a
close-up shot
it's not the fastest camera so it's
prone to motion blur and too many bright
colors or conflicting light sources can
seem to confuse it but an out-of-the-box
software update we receive it addresses
just that
so we'll install it and report back soon
speaking of installing things I've
already run into a major roadblock
thanks to the phone's Chinese origins
there's no Google Play services there's
not even a Play Store instead the
download apps you have to either use the
proprietary pre-installed app store or
manually download the apk is online
though even then most Google apps won't
run without Play services so you can
forget about hangouts or Gmail you also
might have noticed that everything in
the app store is in Chinese despite
having the software set to English a lot
of Chinese text still spills out into
the UI including elements like blinkfeed
and it makes the process of downloading
apps without the Play Store even more
daunting and tedious we still have yet
to get a full grasp on the battery
performance of bm9 plus but so far it's
holding it pretty well especially
considering that it's got the same non
removable 28 40 milliamp hour battery
found on the m9 proper we'll have more
word on the battery life performance
call quality and more in our comparison
video against the m9 coming soon so be
sure to subscribe to the channel so you
won't miss it and visit us at
pocketnow.com this one m9 review unit
came to its courtesy of D brand so stop
by their site to at D brand calm and
tell them we sent you this has been hi
out to Houston with PocketNow and thanks
for watching keep being awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
