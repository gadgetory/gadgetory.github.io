with a cellular radio and we're going
wrist on with its substantial hardware
I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now and
this is a first look at the LG watch
urbane second generation right up front
will tell you it we couldn't look at the
software here folks
LG wasn't showing off the special
version of Android wear that makes this
watch tick so we'll have to wait for a
future video on that fortunately there's
plenty to talk about on the hardware
side which sort of bridges the gulf
between the first generation LG watch
urbane and its counterpart the urbane
LTE besides the obvious 4G radio to go
with its Bluetooth Wi-Fi and GPS the
second generation urbane is also a big
honkin wristwatch with large secondary
buttons flanking the power standby crown
we've grown used to by default one of
these will open the recent contacts list
and the other will shoot you into LG's
new health suite which uses the heart
rate sensor and custom coaching software
to provide a pretty elaborate fitness
solution it's powered by a Snapdragon
400 backed up by 768 Meg's of RAM so it
seems to have plenty of power to juggle
even a heavy software add-on like LG
health and don't worry about sweating on
it during those workouts either this
device is ready to ip67 for dust and
water resistance those shortcut buttons
are mirrored on the other side of the
stainless steel casing by a speakerphone
port which lets you make and take calls
using the removable nano SIM located
under the back cover so you can leave
your phone at home and still stay
connected LG isn't saying which US
carriers it's working with to
accommodate this device but competitor
Samsung's first gear s already blazed a
path in this area last year we wouldn't
be surprised to see this device pop up
on at least America's 2 GSM carriers the
added functionality calls for a bigger
battery of course and this watch
features that hexagonal power pack we
reported on a while back LG says it's
570 milliamp hours should get you
through a day of use and there's a power
saving mode available if that 480 by 480
display turns out to be a big power
drain
the LG watch urbane 2nd generation will
come in 4 available colors when it
launches in the US and Korea likely
sometime in November because they
incorporate integrated antennas the
watchbands are not swappable you'll have
to pick a color before you buy and stick
with it
as for the elastomer material itself it
feels fine nothing fancy certainly and a
little rigid but the band's do seem
durable like the watch itself which is a
tank and with its 4 gigs of storage
sharp display and more wireless radios
and sensors than we've seen on almost
any other wearable this is one
drool-worthy piece of kit for a certain
kind of customer whether it's worth it's
indeterminate price tag and the cost of
an additional monthly rate plan remains
to be seen and I can't wait to strap one
on and start figuring it out stay tuned
for our full review of the LG watch
urbane 2nd generation and be sure to
check out our other big hands-on from
today the dual display super camcorder
phone the LG v10 also follow pocket now
on social media and follow me at captain
2 phones until next time this has been

for watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
