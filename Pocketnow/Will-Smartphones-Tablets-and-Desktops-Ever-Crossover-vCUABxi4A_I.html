a smartphone that's a tablet the thing
behind me that's a computer are they
ever going to cross over and if so how
that's our topic for this week's episode
of the android guy weekly so what a
couple of previous episodes we've talked
about how smartphones and tablets are
getting multiple cores extra processors
lots of RAM video processors cool stuff
all built in to do well stuff that used
to be just computer based in the past
what are we doing with them well right
now let's face it that's pretty much
still a smartphone it does phone stuff
it does basic web stuff PIM stuff that's
personal information management just for
those of you keeping track on the
acronym tally sheet 1.4 PIM but it's
still just a smartphone the apps are
somewhat limited and i'm showing you
android devices but the same is true for
iphones and for windows phones as well
it's still a phone and the apps are well
they're really dumbed down and i don't
mean they're dumb because they're cool
they do neat things but they're
simplistic so let's move over here to
tablets and yes this is the android guy
podcast so i'm showing you another
android-powered device if you want to
watch apple stuff we've got hi bata bata
and he's got all kinds of cool apple
stuff but back to android because we
love android so tablets even on the
apple side of things tablets are
basically just big smartphones at least
when it comes to apps sure you've got a
much bigger battery some cases you've
got radios in them for like LTE or hspa+
or you know some kind of data
connectivity not too much of the voice
connectivity even though this has a
speaker you know right there and you
could technically use it as a phone one
hello can you see somebody on a subway
or a bus talking on their phone like
that Wow that'd be any hidden video
little funny video if you guys want to
do that
send it on in we get a chuckle out of
that but back on topic it's still a
simplistic operating system or a
simplistic environment the operating see
this system is really kind of you know
complex its robust it's linux for
goodness sake you can run linux on one
of those things behind me you can run
linux on a web server and serve up
hundreds if not thousands of web pages
running linux and it's lighter weight
and it's arguably more configurable and
blah blah blah definitely cheaper than
microsoft solutions even though i run
microsoft based technologies at my day
job but we've simplified it here for
this form factor and really that's
starting to limit us so take a look
behind me I can't run Android well good
but not realistically on my computer
back there and even if I could where's
all my video editing stuff where's my
audio editing stuff where's my you know
high-end games ah but that's kind of the
crossover app games you can get really
good high definition playable games on
this and even better on this and it's
kind of almost to the point where it's
the same realism and the same experience
that you'd have on a desktop computer
but here on a desktop I'm going to have
a mouse so there's my little mousey
pointing device but I have to have in
one hand going like this clicky clicky
scrolling scrolling in this hand on wa's
D and the pain this guy I want to turn I
turn on turn I turn I want to go forward
I go forward I want to go back and go
back look at that ok so the controls are
really there and they're a lot better
the sensors that everything is built-in
while its built-in I've even got
front-facing cameras on these two
devices but I don't even have that on my
desktop computer behind me but I'm
getting way off topic hey we've seen a
few manufacturers try and bridge the gap
from phone and even tablet it's a
computer you can have desktop docks that
have hdmi that
have you can have bluetooth keyboards
and mice and whatnot that hook up to it
and essentially gives you a desktop
experience from your smartphone or from
your tablet now there are a couple ways
to do that the first way to do that is
through some kind of a virtual desktop
environment now when I say that I mean
you're kind of like running in a web
based OS where you just have a web
browser that has your web apps installed
on it and yes web apps especially with
html5 are becoming much much more robust
they're becoming really really well good
for lack of a better word but still look
at Google Docs look at Microsoft Word
look at Google Docs look at Microsoft
Excel there's still a lot of growing to
do well you don't have those microsoft
like experiences on turn your tablet
with a desktop experience that you have
on a desktop with a desktop experience
the same thing goes with Mac based stuff
you know I want to use iMovie to make a
movie great I have to have that on my
Mac I can't really do that very well
over on my tablet or on my smartphone
even when it's docked up to a big screen
TV so there's another way to do it after
we've talked about just kind of
virtualizing the in experience kind of
Chrome OS if you will then you've got an
actual real remote desktop okay that's
kind of cool and it has some advantages
and some big disadvantages I've got an
app that I run I like it a lot called
jump desktop my iphone guys new friends
out there that run the the Apple
products they've got the app too in fact
I think it started on that side of the
fence but who's keeping track with that
you can rdp let's remote desktop
protocol into your computer at work into
a computer at home at school wherever
you've got it configured so long as you
know the address and the ports are open
on the firewall lah blah blah technical
mumbo-jumbo here but you can do it and
once you've got it set up its really
kind of easy at that point as long as
I've got an internet connection I can
connect to my computer my desktop
computer then I can remote into it now
that
computer doesn't have to be here it
could be at work it could be halfway
around the world it could be at some
data center somewhere post it as just
kind of virtual environment that I RDP
into and I do that every day I RDP into
computers all over the place and it gets
really annoying and frustrating
sometimes because there are so many of
them but if you had one computer that
was hosted somewhere else and they took
care of all the updates and all the apps
and all that everything and you remoted
to it from wherever you wanted with a
thin just a very thin computer and all
it needed was hookups to a monitor
keyboard mouse speakers network
connection and then you log in it goes
across the network to your server if you
will their terminal session there you go
great well now you can do that on this
because you know what this is more
powerful than most thin computers out
there and it's a phone all you needs a
bigger screen well that's a piece of
cake alright so that's the second way
the third way is kind of confusing kind
of cool which is why we're talking about
it in this week's episode so that topic
is kind of dual booting or hybrid
booting and I know that's kind of
confusing but hey look I've got two
cores in here to them two CPUs why not
split them so one processor runs Android
and another processor runs linux it's
being done now this is for like the uber
geeks uber geek so the uber geeks are
looking up to even geekier people and
that but it can be done which is the
cool part but then we got dual booting
so hybrid stuff we're just going to
leave that for another episode wait for
it to mature a little bit high or dual
booting rather i turn my phone off i
turn it back on i get a boot menu and it
says what do you want to boot into well
I'd like to boot into linux today thank
you very much here's my ubuntu or here's
my red hat or here's my and this is
where it gets really funny somebody
thought that android this version plus
one we're assuming it's going to be
android five and we assume it's going to
be called jelly bean but there were some
rumors flying around that Microsoft was
kind of getting
bed with Google or vice versa which
doesn't make a lot of sense because they
really don't like each other that much
but what you do is you'd be able to boot
into whatever operating system you
wanted to so if your tablet you know
you're you're done with it being an
android-based tablet great reboot it and
now you're in a Windows 8 tablet whoo
sounds kind of weird but technically
possible all you got to do is basically
boot to another mount point so instead
of pointing to one section of your hard
drive we used to call them your volume
so what linux likes to column you know
you just switch one or the other now the
downside to it is generally speaking
you've got to reboot but once you do
that chances are you can have access to
that same volume so you have access to
the same files stuff that you work on on
one side can work on the other side and
vice versa as far as files go now apps
that's a different story so three
different ways and the hybrid kind of
weird way to do it what's going to
happen well I don't know that's why
we're talking about it on the android
guy weekly because I want to know what
you think too so go ahead pause the show
type your comments in okay cuz i'm going
to bias you with my opinion at this
point in time my opinion we're going to
see something like what Motorola has
been doing with their devices where well
you can plug them into a monitor and you
can have a what's called a web top
experience where you have more desktop
like applications you don't really have
desktop applications but their desktop
like takes advantages of keyboards mice
the bigger screens now you kind of give
up some of your touchscreen stuff and
your your sensors and whatnot but in any
event you have that experience so here's
what I think ok Google has something
else going for them they've got their
Chrome OS and their Chromebooks ok why
not do that on these guys so I've got
android and I've got chrome and then run
side by side and I can switch between
them and you know make that experience
as seamless as possible so I don't even
know that I'm
touching between them so there's one
possibility and I think that would be
more logical than sending like Spock
from Star Trek here live long and
prosper it would make more sense for
Google to go with a Google platform for
their a desktop or notebook type
experience on tablets if they go that
way at all is that how I want to see
things go new no it's not what I want to
see happen is I want to see the android
OS the way it is now continue to grow
and develop I want to see it flourish I
want to see Chrome OS die I want to see
Chromebooks go away or you know what
let's keep them around because we're
going to run android I don't know six
key lime pie about that you like that
okay great we're going to run key lime
pie on them key lime pie is essentially
Android but screen dependent so we've
got a bigger side of the screen well
we're doing that already you know things
look different on you know smartphones
is they doing tablets as I do on google
TV so we've got the three screen sizes
right now well let's introduce to
another that has a built-in mouse or
pointer interface built in keyboard ah
you know what though that's going to
require apps it's going to require
really good robust apps it's going to
require apps that are built to work on a
variety of screens it's going to require
the development community to adopt that
and run with it and make it succeed and
that puts the control outside of the
hands of Google or does it there's one
little bit that Google has control over
of course they've got the SDK they've
got the whole operating system thing
like that's really important that
sarcasm guys okay thanks what they've
got is google apps or gaps as they call
it now gaps that's your market that's
your gmail calendar contacts that's all
of that all packaged together it's your
core pim stuff now it's coming with
google music it's coming with your maps
and navigation all of that stuff that's
your gaps that is what Google has
control over and if Google goes and may
those things work really really work on
you know the current three screens
smartphone size tablet size TV sighs and
then they bring in you know like a 12 or
a 14 inch size something that's more
tablet or desktop style something
that'll work just like a desktop
computer will that's their foot in the
door and then I think the apps will
follow unfortunately it's still going to
take some time for all the developers
out there to get their apps to work with
it now Google has made some strides with
fragments not to be confused with
fragmentation that everybody's you know
crying about oh no fragmentation
fragmentation the world's going to end
hey look that's not going to happen
until the end of the year okay and look
at that I've got off my screen already
so the Mayan say we got like at least
another seven eight months don't worry
about the world ending it'll be okay
fragments are good fragmentation is just
something to sell newspapers but I
digress so that's what I think we're
going that's what I think is going to be
in key lime pie it's real real early to
be making predictions like that so who
knows if they'll come true or not that's
why I'm going on the record right now so
you can come back when key lime pie has
been announced they've shown it off and
you can say holy crap that Joe the
android guy he's a genius or you know
reality which is just I'm some guy with
the camera and you're a whole bunch of
people who know a lot more than me so
now it's your turn go down in the
comments write what you think we've
covered a lot of stuff so make sure that
you're clear with you know what part
you're talking about whether it's
remoting whether it's dual booting
whether it's hybriding whether it's
webtop whether it's chroma whatever let
us know and let us know why you think
your idea is better than my idea which
it probably is but I want to know why
and so does everybody else who's
watching so go and do that now well
before you do that thumbs up big thumbs
up for the video so I you know let your
friends know about it head on over to
pocketnow.com so we can all share from
the news and the other views that are
out there because I'm not the only guy
on
it ok now you can go and comment Thanks
do that down below for pocket now i'm
joe the android guy and this has been
another episode of the android guy
weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
