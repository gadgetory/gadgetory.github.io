now calm and we've got the t mobile
vibrant on the left and the t-mobile
galaxy s 4g on the right pretty much the
same phone except this one as hspa+ 4g
speeds and this one has only 3g so we're
going to do a speed test this is
happening in New York so your results
may vary and let's see if I can do them
both the same time
download test in progress see at the top
there's the 4g icon and there's the 3g
icon
and the screen on and here we go that's
0.26 on the 3g and 0.2 to download and
exactly the same upload speeds so a 4g
at least in my current location has
practically no speed increase we will
continue these tests and some different
locations okay so I've been driving
around a little and I've parked my car
right in front of a antenna so I should
be able to get 4G speeds here on the
samsung galaxy s 4g i was going to try
and do a speedtest comparison with the
3g samsung vibrant but today it doesn't
want to do anything so all I'm getting
is errors on this one and so you're just
going to get to see the galaxy s 4g and
we're going to get some pretty good
speeds here so here's our test 3.78 meg
download
let's try that again
okay force close the email program it's
one more time there we go six something
so that previous tests obviously we
didn't have our good 4G speeds or 3G
speeds it was pretty much the same even
though the icon says 4G over here and 3g
over there but let's show you some of
the results I normally have so these
last few okay email last few have been
sitting here in front of the antenna so
you see some pretty big numbers here 7.3
28 point 0 1 i've gotten over here so we
got some pretty awesome speeds there's
eight point 06 and sometimes we have
some really bad speeds okay since the
vibrant didn't work here's a 3g HT 7 and
we'll just do a quick test
so the 4G got two point four seven
megabits per second and the 3g HD 7 gal
1.65
this time the hd7 got one point two
seven to nine and the 4g got 2.83 so
pretty good difference and that's our 3g
comparison in the same location that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
