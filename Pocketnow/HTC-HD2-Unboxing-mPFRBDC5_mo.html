pocketnow.com and we are thrilled to
bring you the unboxing of the HTC hd2
this is undoubtedly one of the hottest
devices of 2009 and it's coming to the
u.s. in 2010 so it's going to be hot
next year to this device is the largest
screen of any smartphone on the market
right now 4.3 inches it also has a
capacitive display which is a first for
windows mobile finally it has a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor which we
know from the acer neo touch will make
it extremely fast for a smartphone so we
can't wait to see it let's take a look
at the unbox
it looks like it has the same box as the
HTC hero Wow all right that's showing
HTC's new slogan quietly brilliant this
is actually the size of the device it's
going to be a big device I'm wondering
exactly how big it will be in the pocket
they even said this is big in both
dimensions so they're kind of warning
you on the front let's take a look
around the device so windows mobile 6.5
pro we know that it's only 11
millimeters thick which is extremely
thin even though it has a massive 4.3
inch display beautiful all right well
let's cut through this all right there
we go and let's slide out wow this looks
even more beautiful in person than it
does in pictures so we're going to take
a look at the device in a second
beautiful and let's see what comes in
the package okay great they included a
case and I'm sure this is leather yes it
past the smell test this is genuine
leather very nice talk to to protect the
very large screen on the HTC hd2 so you
see what else we have inside so manuals
copilot live free trial okay we have a
little micro SD card two gigabytes and
also an adapter for the two gigabyte
card not the standard plugs we've got
the sinking cable and this device
actually has micro USB which is quite
different than what HTC has had on all
of its devices it says used their
proprietary EXT USB and now it's micro
USB and here are some headphones we've
seen that before it's time to look at
the gorgeous HD two okay so here it is
it is large in hand let's take off this
plastic wrap to really get a feel for
the device Wow absolutely gorgeous it's
just one massive huge screen let's take
a look around the device Wow look at
this brushed metal on the back I bet
this is real metal nice rubbery coating
down here too
a better grip extremely thin although it
looks big it's this is probably going to
be very pocketable despite having such a
big width well let's compare it to other
devices that's really important to see
exactly how big the device is so let's
take a look at the iphone so next to the
iphone there a reason to believe the
same size actually if you take the width
they're pretty close the hd2 is a little
bit taller and it just has more screen
on the front with just a small area down
here dedicated for the buttons let's
take a look at its predecessor the HTC
hd2 or the touch HD as it was known this
device had a 3.8 inch display which at
the time was large but now we have a 4.3
inch display and I'm trying to get a
sense if this is glass or plastic it
feels like glass and it very well should
be considering it's a capacitive display
let's take a look at thickness the hd2
is definitely thinner than the HD ok
let's look next to the acer neo touch
which is the only other device out there
right now that has a snapdragon 1
gigahertz CPU this has a 3.8 inch
display nothing comes close to the hd2
in terms of screen size it just goes
edge to edge top to bottom and of course
the hd2 is is thinner than pretty much
any device that i'm going to pull out
let's look at the AT&amp;amp;T HTC pure looks
puny compared we're not even going to
look at that and let's look next to the
touch pro 2 in this case this is the
AT&amp;amp;T version and of course it's much
much thinner because the hd2 has an
on-screen keyboard which probably worked
very very well with such a large area to
type in so we have a ton of videos and
reviews coming up on the HTC hd2 we're
going to compare it to all sorts of
devices in terms of Internet experience
speed size and much much more be sure to
follow us on Twitter to know right when
the videos hit twitter.com slash pocket
nail tweets and if you want to buy an
hd2 of your own they're now shipping at
clove co uk and they ship worldwide
we'll be back soon with a lot more on
the hd2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
