old for sitting on it leaks of the HTC
ma proved that there are some dramatic
camera improvements and it seems that
the iWatch will do more just track your
sleep and fitness I'm hi Mary that I and
that's actually a great deal i do need
something that helps me sleep that's not
alcohol this is pocket out daily let's
just say offensive official news as
samsung has just announced more faux
leather galaxy s4 variants and this time
they're being launched in south korea
but get a couple of colors including the
rose gold variants which is really
interesting but what even makes this
more interesting is that these are
actually better than the black edition
phones that were launched in russia
because these ones do have out the
advance which does mean that there is a
snapdragon 800 processor on these so
let's just hope that we do get these
phones although we are expecting the
galaxy s5 to be launched the next couple
of days now let's talk about Sony is one
of the phones that really caught our eye
at CES 2014 was the Sony Xperia z1
compact and I wish those names were
smaller but as it turns out even though
the company figured out how to squash
flagship specifications on a smaller
phone customers are complaining about
some bleeding the flash one taking
photographs at night so obviously
haven't been able to verify this please
leave us a comment down below of the you
are experiencing these issues as Sony
hasn't really told us anything about it
yet and speaking of smartphone issues
let's talk about Apple as an iphone 5c
just left second-degree burns on a
teenager in the state of Maine in the
United States and the reason why was not
because she was using a fake cable or
because she replaced the battery this
was a two month old iphone 5c n all she
remembers doing is sitting on the phone
while it was in her pant pocket so it
turns out that apparently she snapped
the battery when that happened and a
couple of minutes later it ignited so
obviously there is an investigation
there will most probably be a lawsuit so
while that happens and while we figure
out why this happened put your iPhone on
your front pocket just in case now let's
talk about the HTC m8 as we've got three
different pieces of news that are kind
of conflicting first of all we get a
leaked photo of the phone with dual
cameras which is interesting it also has
a dual flash but it's the same HTC one
only
with new cameras we also have some other
leaks that say that the phone is
including a high-resolution camera at
the front which is great something that
we're expecting an HTC has been doing a
lot with that you know with the
wide-angle cameras at the front and
everything but even more interesting is
an HTC executive from Europe saying that
somebody has been photoshopping things
on Twitter or wait he said on Twitter
that somebody's been photoshopping
things so obviously it could be that
these photos are fakes so stay tuned
we'll see let's hope that the HTC One +
RM made or whatever it's going to be
called looks a little better than the
HTC One if that's even possible and
finally for the hot news of the day
Apple has just hired a guy named ray
Raymond from Philips research and this
guy is not just a sleep expert he's also
an expert in sensors that help people
sleep through his therapy without the
need of medication which is extremely
interesting and we're expecting for that
to happen for the iWatch and aside from
that we also get some interesting rumors
that Apple is going to be using the LG
g2 step battery technology for the first
generation i watch in order to make it
have a great battery because the g2 does
have a great battery so we're seeing
that the iWatch is not just going to be
one of these fitness and sleep tracking
watches but also something that could
probably help you sleep and obviously be
available to you while you sleep without
the need for you to be charging it
because that would have to be the
purpose but anyways that leaves you to
the question of the day what would you
like this i watch to do the current
watches or fitbit's can't do because in
my particular case yes if I would have
an assistant for my sleeping and
assistant for my fitness it would be a
really compelling gadget but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video with snow machine follow was on
pocketnow.com it's a script IQ channel
as well you'll also follow me on Twitter
Jaime underscore iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high never let up thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
