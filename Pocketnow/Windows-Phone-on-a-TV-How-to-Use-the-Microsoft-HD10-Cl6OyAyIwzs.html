is a pretty sizable canvas but what if
you could add say 30 inches to that i'm
michael fisher with pocket now and i'm
going to show you how to use the new HD
10 to put your windows phone on your TV
screen the HD 10 comes packaged much
like any other Microsoft accessory and
here's what's inside just the HD 10
itself along with a micro USB wall
charger and some very light
instructional literature to get you off
the ground the device requires an HDMI
cable which unfortunately does not come
included and the heart of the accessory
is actually a two-part affair the puck
itself contains all the guts to make the
system work and the NFC plate a topit is
removable so you can put it where you
want here's why that's important you'll
want to put the NFC plate somewhere
convenient like the coffee table but you
want the puck itself to sit near your TV
or at least within range of the HDMI
cable plugged into your TV you pop in
the HDMI cable followed by the powerline
and the single LED comes to life on the
front switch your TV to the right input
and boom you've got a setup screen to
walk you through the pairing process the
screen also gives instructions on
setting up windows tablets and the puck
also works with miracast certified
devices of all kinds but we're just
doing Lumia phones today I need to
stress the lumia part of that while our
HTC One m8 for Windows can see the HD 10
on our network and should be able to
pair with it all it does is throw an
error message so for maximum
compatibility
you'll want a Lumia phone with device
hub version 3.5 or higher yay
fragmentation anyway once you make sure
NFC and Wi-Fi are both enabled on your
Lumia pairing with the HD 10 is as
simple as tapping the NFC plate which
again you put wherever you want that
takes you to the project my screen menu
where you can select the screen sharing
device from the list and once it
connects you're in business
by default the mirroring arrangement
doesn't compensate for the screen
differences here so your portrait phone
will appear heavily pillar boxed on your
landscape TV but selecting advanced
settings in your device hub you can
change or mirror the orientation if
you're broadcasting to a TV that's
sideways or upside down
also you can turn on the indicator dot
and select its color if you want people
to be able to see or touch inputs if
your TV is cutting off the extremities
of the frame like ours is you need to
adjust the canvas size manually using
your TV's controls there's no provision
in the HD 10 software for that now the
portrait centric display mode is cool
but it's obviously not ideal for media
in some apps like my tube even rotating
the phone doesn't fix this which is a
bummer thankfully the default Windows
Phone media player works much better
meaning you can play full screen videos
directly from youtube.com and even more
importantly the Netflix app works just
fine in full-screen to that's fine in
relative terms any way to stream video
from phone to TV you need to set the
display on your phone to never time out
because you'll lose the connection if
the screen turns off also the framerate
of the broadcast isn't terribly high and
I ran into a few occasions where the
audio skipped or errored out or the
phone was just slow to connect and
speaking of slow yes you can play full
screen games on your TV using this
device but even the slight latency of
the connection makes fast paced action
much much harder to deal with I'm a much
better pilot than this
believe me the HD 10 is better put to
use as a presentation tool for sharing
things like photo slideshows which
really is just as simple as shuffling
through your gallery picks or your
PowerPoint presentation or whatever it's
also great for tossing up quick YouTube
videos or even sharing a webpage with
your friends in a hurry and if you don't
have a Bluetooth speaker but you really
want to crank that house music you can
even use your TV as a surrogate speaker
for something like Spotify once you're
connected the potential applications of
a huge screen for your Lumia are limited
only by your imagination and how
reliable your connection is the HD 10 is
available at Microsoft comm in black and
white for
$69.99 we've got a lot more on Windows
Phone folks including a review of the
Lumia 830 a review of the Lumia 930 and
a live podcast full of live tiles click
