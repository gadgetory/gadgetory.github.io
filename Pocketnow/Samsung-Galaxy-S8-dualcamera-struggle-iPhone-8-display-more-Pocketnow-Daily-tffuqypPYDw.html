Galaxy s8 missed out on dual cameras was
more for aesthetics I have a rumours
point to the amount of variants and
their differences in technology and we
get leaked images of the HTC Ocean in
the fresh I'm Jaime Rivera and I
apologize for the weird times this is
going to be one crazy week just putting
it out there this is parking out daily
the official lives today begin with
deals to a certain degree as ZTE has
just announced its Exxon 7s and know the
deal is not that one we get an X on
seven with a newer design in addition to
a Snapdragon 820 one processor another
improve specifications but the cool part
is that it actually drops the price of
the exon seven and major retailers right
now we're talking $329 you can learn
more out of description now so the
spotlight over to the Huawei watch 2 as
the devices now become official and
retailers like Best Buy for $300 now
bear in mind the watch 2 is the sporty
variant that's probably not the best
design in the world but the Huawei fit
application in conjunction with this
watch is probably one of the most
complete software options that I've seen
for fitness and Android wear obviously
we will do an extensive review on what
it's capable of doing but if you want to
learn more about this product and the
classic as well you can learn more in
the description as well now how about if
we talk about the HTC ocean and you know
I wonder exactly why HTC gave it this
name given the fact that the new ultra
was more like an ocean in its size we've
got some leaked images and well it looks
like a u ultra and pretty much every
weight the only difference is obviously
it's a smaller phone so this could be
the successor to the HTC 10 which is not
exactly sure when we're getting it but
we can't wait
as we spotlight over to the next
generation iPhones as we've got some
trusted sources claiming number one that
the OLED rumors are true to a certain
degree the reason why is because
apparently only the third variant the no
holds bar next generation iPhone
whatever that's going to be called
iPhone X or iPhone 8 will be getting the
OLED display in addition to a major
redesign and so many other things
apparently we are still
getting the iPhone 7s and 7s plus these
are gonna retain the IPS LCD and pretty
much everything we already know about
the iPhone 7 only you know with beefed
up specification so yeah it seems that
that's what we're getting we're just not
sure if it's gonna happen in
september/october or women and finally a
very interesting news that I have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy s8 that we just
begun reviewing mainly because for those
of you wondering exactly why this phone
doesn't have a dual camera apparently it
had everything to do with aesthetics
why because synaptics had confirmed that
it was going to build that fingerprint
scanner on the display it wasn't able to
meet the deadline that it had and so
therefore the company had to put the
fingerprint scanner at the back but
because Samsung wanted to retain the
aesthetics of the design
apparently the dual camera was going to
be too tall and this wasn't going to
really match with the design and I just
don't know exactly what Samsung was
thinking because the current design of
where the fingerprint scanner is placed
is horrible I mean my hands already
hurts just trying to reach it on day one
on the regular size variant I haven't
even started playing much with the
larger one yet but anyways it leads me
to the question of the day do you think
that this was a smart move to place the
fingerprint scanner where it is and not
add the dual cameras in my case I think
it wasn't dual cameras are the way to go
this year
but hey our review is just beginning so
anyways leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
