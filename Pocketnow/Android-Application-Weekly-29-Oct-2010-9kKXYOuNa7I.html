pakka calm and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called Evernote and is
free on the android market what it
allows you to do is to save pictures
files text notes and audio notes
directly to your free Evernote account
so though I can view my previous notes
just by going to the menu button and you
notes and now you can see all of the
other notes that I've saved in the past
with my Evernote account so i can go
back let's say i wanted to upload a note
i like to do is click on text note type
my note save it to whichever folder i
want and then save got to do is a free
task managing application available in
the android market it has many different
categories that you can add certain
tasks to so let's say i wanted to add
something to someday and I'll have to
just click here and add we're going to
say go to Europe and hit okay and I can
set the priority if I want in set the
time and add a note and on it to do is
go back and go back again and now my
task is saved in my inbox so it can view
all my other tasks here let's say I went
to the vet yesterday so I can click on
there that was complete I picked up some
milk saudia pick on my costume seesmic
as a free Twitter and Google Buzz
application available in the android
market allows you to view all of your
current Twitter feeds of course and you
can also get google buzz information in
your proximity to your location so let's
say I want to do view my replies I can
go here I can also view my personal
messages and view my profile and I can
go back to my timeline and I can do all
the great twitter stuff i need to do i
can reply retweet or direct message
reply so i can just go back and do the
rest of my feeds on the twitter timeline
winamp is a free music player available
on the android market in my opinion i
think it's a little bit better than the
google music application that comes
standard on most Android devices you can
get your artist album songs all these
great features to search through your
songs and you can also get history so
you can view these songs and list of the
ones that you previous
listen to so let's say on to look for a
song I'll just go to albums and have one
song right here I'm gonna play it and
play that and the song plays rather well
through the speakers or through the
wired headset xda-developers is a free
application available on the android
market and this application ties
directly into the XDA developers website
and forum so you can view your latest
posts and if you have an XDA account you
can sign in and be your private messages
as well as go to form searches let's say
when to find android software
development click on there it logs into
the server and I can view all these
various topics stickies announcements
and all that other great stuff is
available on the XDA developers website
