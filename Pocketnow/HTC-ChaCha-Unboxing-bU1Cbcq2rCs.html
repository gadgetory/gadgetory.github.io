pocket now calm the HTC ChaCha
and the HTC Salsa R to Facebook phones
from HTC which the manufacturer
introduced in February with the occasion
of this year's Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona when we say Facebook phone we
don't really mean Facebook phone because
the company and the webpage Facebook
doesn't have anything to do really with
the with these two smartphones but the
whole blogosphere and internet call them
Facebook phones because their unique
capability of quickly sharing and
posting an update to your Facebook using
the dedicated f as in Facebook button
which you will find on both the cha-cha
and the salsa we've got the HTC ChaCha
here which we're going to be unboxing in
this first video of our review so let's
get to it
we've got the obligatory scissors as
usual to crack open the box and the
packaging bag in a bag so we'll take the
scissors again and another bag too much
plastic but it's for the good the better
you protect the smartphone the safer it
gets to its destination
and here we have it the HTC ChaCha let
me just try to zoom in a little bit on
the box you might notice that these days
all the boxes seem to be following the
same design small box with the
smartphone on top of the picture says
HTC ChaCha we've got a nice picture of
the phone and here is the Facebook
button which I was telling you about
nothing on the side and let's take a
look at the specs we've got a 800
megahertz processor and this is a
strange one because when initially HTC
announced the job they were announcing
it with a 600 megahertz processor but
along the way they somehow bump the
specs to 800 megahertz it's running the
Android which is 2.3 Gingerbread with
HTC Sense it's got the 512 megabytes of
ROM and the same amount of RAM it's got
a two point six inch touchscreen it's
got GPS and everything else which you
might expect from an HTC smartphone
including a 5 megapixel color camera
with autofocus
so let's crack open the box and see
what's inside okay and we will need the
scissors just one more time just like
this and here we go here's the cha-cha
which we will put to the side let's see
what else is in the box that's some
stickers as usual some literature a
QuickStart guide we've got a battery and
thankfully this is removable let's see
what battery it is it's a twelve hundred
and fifteen million powers as you can
see wonder how long that will last some
safety and regulatory guide warranty
statement blah blah blah some even more
stickers and let's see what we've got
here let's try to open this up nicely
we got a pair of headphones with a small
microphone and what looks to be possibly
a cold start CO and button with a clip
to use on your shirt and the rubber the
next comes the USB cable used for
syncing and charging which is of course
a micro USB cable or at least it should
be yes it is indeed a micro USB cable
and we've got the charger itself which
comes with a UK side wall plug because
this smartphone comes from the UK this
is where you plug in the USB part of the
cable and this is the wall charger plug
which plugs in just like or at least it
should just like this and you rotate and
that's it
HTC is using this design since the HTC
Desire if I would go well ok let's put
everything to the side and let's take a
look at the smartphone itself let's see
what we got here this is the HTC ChaCha
feels very very very light but that's
because maybe we got the battery outside
we got the four Android buttons right
below the screen we've got a call start
: button and this little fella here is
your dedicated Facebook button which we
will see exactly what it does and how it
does it the keyboard is rubbish feels
very very nice at the back there's a
camera but we will take a deeper further
look at the hardware on the HTC ChaCha
with the occasion of our hardware tour
this was anton denied from pocketnow.com

ChaCha unboxing stay tuned for more on
pocket now
