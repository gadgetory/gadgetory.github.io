packing.com and today i'm going to show
you a new game called slider on windows
mobile marketplace this application does
cost 99 cents but it is pretty fun and
i'll show you how to play so all you
have to do is actually slide these brown
blocks and move this blue cursor or they
actually change colors to the designated
line to the side so if i move this one
down all I have to just slide it over
here and it activates that level and
then it moves on to the next level so
for this one let's see here I just move
this down mais across now as you can see
the blue line is over here again so I
can slide this blue block all the way
over here and it does become more
challenging and there are a hundred
levels and there's always levels being
added as well so let's see here hmm so
it looks a little more challenging and
there we go you move this one let's see
so each level does of course become
increasingly more difficult as you can
see and if we're finished playing all we
have to do is tap on this little level
button right here it will actually blame
bring us to our level select so if you
want to we can select a higher level and
as you can see I've ever done some of
these let's see I think I've done up to
level nine see I don't know if you can
go past the level you've continued I
guess you can so you can select that as
you if you want if you want to skip a
level if you get stuck on it hit okay
and you can move on to the next level
and at any time if you want this game
will actually save where your progress
was left off so that's pretty neat so
this is slider and the program does cost
99 cents on windows mobile marketplace
so this is another marketplace take
where you pick some fun and challenging
games on windows mobile marketplace
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
