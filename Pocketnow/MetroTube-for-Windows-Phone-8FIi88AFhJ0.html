calm and we're going to take a look at a
new app called metro tube is remember
lazy tube this is from the same
developer and it's a really nice upgrade
to that so let's check it out first off
we noticed metro tube is conforming to
my theme we got the green we get the
white and we have some really great
graphics here the titles are overlaying
over a thumbnail image really good
looking so this is starts off with my
subscriptions you can see a menu over
here there's a most viewed listing
featured listing and categories of
course and the search so you can do any
kind of search there and let's look at
favorites of course it syncs if you log
in and we can play in a video here and
we'll play just like that and if you
tilt it goes full screen and of course
we have comments you can tap that show
description thumbs up thumbs down all
the normal features you've why and it's
really really nice looking here we have
a you can unfavorite you can pin it
that's going to go right on my Start
screen really nice feature of course you
can pivot over here author related under
subscriptions we can see everything at
once we can also filter choose the ones
that you're subscribed to say you're in
a specific channel you can also pin this
I just on pinned it now I'm going to pin
it again and that's going to go right on
your Start screen too so we have easy
access to that and it's a really look
good looking live tile too so there's
lots of cool features here it's really
really nice youtube app there's your
video streaming quality settings so
about the only thing really missing from
this YouTube app is upload straight to
youtube but everything else is really
really nicely done so that's quick look
at Metro tube very nice YouTube app for
windows phone mango give us a thumbs up
if you liked this video and that's it
for now
