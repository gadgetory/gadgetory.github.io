into a new load of user complaints
rumors claimed that the launch dates for
the LGV 20 and the new batch of Galaxy
Note 7s come soon and the google play
store might be ready for a new useful
pair of updates I'm hi I'm Adam iveta
and usually I prefer Batman to win but
I'm sure that the Joker will bring a
better finish him this is parking out
daily the official deuce today begin
with some very interesting and much
needed updates for those of you to join
us and not understanding why twitter has
been stuck 240 characters for so many
years the company finally got the memo
now they're removing that restriction of
your uploading gifts or gifs videos
images and just about a couple of other
things like for example polls you can
learn more details on what limitations
have been removed them link in the
description meaning 140 characters are
for your text and then the rest is for
Twitter and for those of you that are
bored of Google Hangouts like I am
Google is apparently going to debut a
low very soon according to famous
tipster ever leaks or Evan blasts you
can expect it to launch on September
21st so set your calendars apparently
within the next two days Google is going
to launch the new messaging platform
that we might not care about again and
speaking of Google for those of you that
have been frustrated whenever there's
this application that needs an update
and it tells you that it's not going to
be able to because it needs Wi-Fi
apparently there is this new beta where
google is testing Wi-Fi for later in a
certain degree meaning whenever it
detects that you are within Wi-Fi it'll
start downloading the app pretty much
leading it on cue it's a very smart move
though currently in beta stay tuned it
takes a while for it to deploy oz move
the spotlight over to both LG and
Samsung for those of you that have been
wondering when you can get your hands on
the lgb 20 famous tipster Evan blast
came at it again this time claiming
October 21st and for those of you new
customers listen new customers not
people looking for replacement that are
looking for a galaxy note 7 apparently
retail will begin again on that exact
date stay tuned and finally the very hot
needs today have to
do with the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus and
his skate because this would not be an
iphone launch without something going
wrong parently the case with the iphone
7 is that if you listen to it closely
from the back you can hear hissing noise
we don't understand exactly what that
hissing noises for or what is causing it
obviously we're waiting for Apple to
chime in on that and that's going to be
rather interesting what could cause a
phone to his usually I don't know I hear
hissing sound from my computer because
of its span i hear hissing sound from
wireless chargers over the fans what
could be causing this on an iPhone we
can not wait to hear but it leads me to
the question of the day aren't you
annoyed by now that every single launch
of an iphone has something wrong with it
because I am that's the curse of the
early adopter leave us a comment down
below we love to know your opinion
