good what if you could strap a lens to
your smartphone and make it better
Michael Fisher this is pocket now this
is the qx100 and its sibling the qx10
from sony let's check them out and see
how they improve the smartphone cameras
of today so this demo unit doesn't have
a battery in it so we're just going to
take you on a on a hardware tour here
unfortunately Tony only has a couple of
these on display so we have to make do
the basic conceit is that this latches
on if you can see over here this latches
on to your smartphone doesn't have to be
a sunny smartphone it can be any iOS or
Android device running reasonably modern
software and they replace the camera on
your device this is where the battery
would live right here let's just take a
spin around then like I said this is a
qx100 the higher end of the two models
you can see the tripod mount down below
you can mount this on a tripod it does
not need to be strapped to the phone to
function this is the NFC connection
point and on/off power button right
there microphones on top Titan wide zoom
slider here and a shutter release and
find this door NC connection point for
the micro SD at scooting up my christy
this is a sony memory stick and micro
USB connection point let's have a look
at the software see if we can learn
something here we have the qx10 next to
the qx100 we've just been told by a very
friendly sony rep that there's a quite a
bit of difference here we have 10 times
optical zoom on the lower end qx10 but
four times only four times optical zoom
on the higher end qx100 both of them
though incorporate sensor size is larger
than 1 inch which is pretty incredible
pretty awesome low-light performance as
well and the resolution difference
between these two is only 2 megapixels
2020 and then some and 18 and then some
on this device over here you can see
this one is powered on and we are paired
to this smartphone here you can see the
build is quite similar to the model we
just took a look at there a couple
differences but nothing really we've got
a tripod there so nothing really major
in terms of the the feel one is a little
heavier than the other but yes I mean
they both are going to make your phone a
little bit more cumbersome to carry this
is a
one and as you can see we are paired
currently so we can track up here and
just take a shot and we're not going to
examine the image quality right here
we're just kind of showing you how the
app works obviously we're going to get a
review unit here and waiting for the
processing good let's see if we're going
to hop on over
the hell do you give it all right there
we go when you open to the gallery of a
choice of which gallery you want to
check out obviously we can happen to the
album here and there we go there's a
shot we just took with this image do a
little zoom action like I say well check
out the image later but this app will
function on any Android device it is
called the the play memories app and one
of the nice things is because you will
forget if you're not careful there we go
see we're connecting is a little bit of
a lag time as it connects and but then
finally we are back to
finally we're connected there okay that
takes a second a little bit longer than
even the Lumia 1020 takes to boot up its
camera we pop that off I probably did
that improperly and you can see the
connection mechanism here these doors
fold up and as you can see hopefully if
I did this right the camera is
completely independent of the phone so
you can put this on a tripod you can put
it somewhere else you can just remotely
control the camera with the phone it
doesn't need to be connected to the
device itself although that does provide
a much more stable shooting platform
anyway this is a quick look at the qx10
and qx100 a very interesting product
definitely something we're not afraid to
geek out about not really sure what our
total thoughts on it are we're just
happy to have gotten some hands-on time
I'm Michael with pocket now that's Tony
behind the camera we're going to talk
about a whole lot more here at Eva it is
only the first day so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
