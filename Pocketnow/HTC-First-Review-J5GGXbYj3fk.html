ages but little did we know that
Facebook's plans were much larger than a
single phone instead the company
launched a home replacement for Android
Facebook home and HTC was the first to
jump on that bandwagon I'm Taylor Martin
this is pocket now and this is our full
review of the HTC first the first thing
you will notice about the HTC first is
that the hardware and design are
extremely minimal the sides and back are
made of soft touch plastic as or the
power button and the volume rocker and
at 126 millimeters tall 65 millimeters
wide 8.9 millimeters thick and 123 point
9 grams it is much smaller and more
lightweight than most other android
phones today it's a mid-range phone by
design but the feel and level of finish
on the first are more reminiscent of a
premium phone it's solid in the hand and
has a nice grippy feel to it and its
modest 4.3 inch display is much more
manageable than the horde of larger
Android phones there is only one aspect
of the hardware and design that we
didn't like however the microUSB port is
located just above the center point on
the right side making it awkward to
charge and use the phone at the same
time for mid-tier device the HTC first
specifications are fairly impressive it
packs a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon 400 chipset one gigabyte of
ram 16 gigabytes of pic storage a 5
megapixel camera with a 1.6 megapixel
camera around front a 2,000 milliamp
hour battery and AT&amp;amp;T LTE connectivity
of all of its specifications the display
is easily the most notable feature it
measures only 4.3 inches diagonally but
it bears a resolution of 720p for a
density of 342 pixels per inch of the
super LCD type it boasts vibrant yet
still fairly accurate colors wide
viewing angles and decent visibility and
bright sunlight the contrast is passable
but the blacks are still a little grey
overall we have very few complaints as
far as Hardware goes the HTC first is
the first phone to come with facebook
home pre-installed so when you first
power the phone on and login to your
facebook account your newsfeed will
appear as your home screen the photos
your friends share to facebook or
cover photos if a status doesn't include
a picture will serve as a temporary
wallpaper you can continue to scroll
through your newsfeed by swiping left or
right and you can easily interact with
each status double tapping anywhere on
the home screen will like the current
status jumping back to the application
drawer is quick and simple to tap a
blank area on the home screen and drag
your profile photo over the apps icon or
simply press the home button from there
you can quickly open any application or
check in two places or even share status
or photo what sets Facebook home on the
HTC first apart from any other device
with facebook home installed our
notifications and the Google search bar
at the top the application drawer on the
downloadable version of facebook home
the notifications displayed on the
lockscreen are only facebook
notifications on the HTC first all
system notifications meaning anything
displayed in the notification shade
appear in the facebook home
notifications for avid facebook fans
facebook home is easily the best and
most visually pleasing way to consume
your facebook news feed but it's a quick
way to suffer from a Facebook overload
and it has its drawbacks it's also worth
mentioning that facebook home is still
quite new and there are quite a few bugs
that have yet to be ironed out
fortunately there's a silver lining
facebook home can be completely disabled
and beneath it the HTC first runs an
otherwise stock version of Android for
12 with snapdragons mid-tier chipset on
board the performance on the HTC first
certainly isn't mind-blowing but it
definitely warrants some praise All
Things Considered it scored quite well
in synthetic benchmarks and in
day-to-day performance it holds up quite
well we must note however that there was
noticeable lag and performance hiccups
with facebook home enabled running the
stock interface made the device run much
more smoothly call quality on the HTC
first was great the earpiece speaker is
plenty loud even in noisy environments
and the quality of audio was crisp we
had no complaints from people on the
other end having trouble hearing us also
the loudspeaker for speakerphone was
extremely loud and clear the first also
runs on AT&amp;amp;T LTE network and it featured
some of the fastest speeds we've seen to
date we found battery life on the first
to be decent likely thanks to a more
efficient processor and a smaller
display in normal usage a full day
without a supplementary charge was
possible but in head
the battery managed to drain much more
quickly in other words the battery life
isn't necessarily bad but it could be
better lastly the camera on the first is
probably its worst feature the sensor is
only 5 megapixels and pictures tend to
lack sufficient detail it was quick to
blow out whites and many images like
proper contrast giving the effect of a
milky photo when the camera was on point
though we were able to take some very
impressive photos with the first and
color reproduction was spot-on however
the times it was great or few and far
between the HTC first although a
mid-range device is a diamond in the
rough the performance is better than
we've seen out of any other mid-range
phone the build quality is fantastic the
display is gorgeous and it comes with
software options either full on facebook
home or the stock Android experience
there are some compromises with the
first however the camera isn't great the
storage is quite limited and some might
find the display to be too small others
of course might find the smaller display
just right we give the HTC first and 8
out of 10 that about does it so if you
liked the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe and follow us in
all of the normal places google+ twitter

i'm taylor martin and i will see you
next time the company instead launched a
home blur the company instead released a
facebook subscribe and stay tuned for
more each tribe stay tuned for more HTC
first coverage in the few</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
