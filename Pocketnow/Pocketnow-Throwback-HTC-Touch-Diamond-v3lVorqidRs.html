the touch diamond was a very important
phone not only for HTC and Verizon and
the other carriers involved plus
Microsoft to provided the software but
for the entire smartphone industry in
general the iPhone came out in June 2007
and with it brought a a kind of change
in in the way people think about smart
phones to touch friendly interfaces
characterized by capacitive screens
well Windows Mobile devices previously
to the iPhone have been all driven by a
stylus small interface elements that
make it a little bit difficult to use
your finger on the screen HTC comes in
to the scene about a year after the
iPhone started to hit store shelves and
introduced touchflo 3d which really
changed the way people used non-smart
none I phone devices like Windows Mobile
devices and really started to excel
innovation in the smartphone area so
before we talk about the software and
touchflo 3d let's talk about the
hardware of the touch diamond of course
this is the verizon version as you can
see here it had a two-point inch
diagonal touchscreen VGA resolution if
you calculate the pixel density it's 285
ppi which in today's age is still pretty
good as some some context here the
iPhone 4 has a ppi of 326 and certain
other smartphones like the Atrix 4G are
around the high 200s so to be already in
the high 200s back in 2008 or 2009 when
this particular verizon unit came out
that was pretty good and in comparison
to the iPhone of the day which still
didn't have the Retina display this was
a big jump the iPhone of of before the
iPhone 4 the 3GS the 3G and the original
iPhone had a PPI pixel density of about
165 so the screen looked a lot better
here on the HTC touch diamond2 is
resistive and you can always tell a
resistive screen if you tilt it just
right and you press on the screen you
can see it sink in a little bit so
resistive screens aren't very sensitive
you have to put a little bit of pressure
on them
HTC tried their best to op the
is the hardware where you can only push
a resistive screen so far so let's talk
about the other buttons here we have a
lot of hardware buttons which is good
because some of them are programmable
home back a d-pad Center will select
call start and call end a lot of people
liked having those buttons available
today the trend on the newest devices is
for fewer buttons in fact a device like
the Incredible S looks like it has no
buttons when it's turned off when in
fact it has four when you turn it on
over here on the side we've got a volume
rocker on the back we've got this really
cool diamond faceting that's where the
touch diamond name comes into play
really picked up on a lot of finger
prints this phone came out before the
days when they started to use that soft
touch plastic which which is a really
nice way to to give a good texture to
the back of the phone have a 3.2
megapixel camera with no flash kind of
is outlined by an awesome little
triangle popping off the back battery
cover we have a 1400 or about 1300
milliamp hour battery here which is
pretty big for that day a micro SD card
slot and on the bottom you can see HTC's
EXT USB this is their proprietary jack
that they went away from shortly after
the touch of diamond in favor of micro
USB and then one day HTC came out and
said we're going to have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on every phone
from now on they've made good of that
promise which is great because on these
older devices like the touch diamond you
would actually need an adapter to use
headphones with this weird jack here
going over to the side nothing there a
power standby button on the top now
inside we've got a Qualcomm 528
megahertz processor in comparison today
we're seeing dual-core 1 gigahertz
processors or Evis the Qualcomm
Snapdragon single core 1 gigahertz
processor so this was running at about
half the clock or even a quarter of the
clock of current devices of today it has
192 megabytes of RAM HTC's newest phones
have 768 megabytes of RAM which is kind
of crazy if you think about it your
desktop computer of you know 2002-2004
might have had 512 megabytes of
and these new HTC phones are actually
coming out with more RAM than old
desktop computers
that's just how technology evolves and
we've got 256 megabytes of ROM so not
much to word you gotta get it you have
to get a microSD card with this device
if you want to store any media at all
now we've got a really cool magnetic
stylus here which will actually turn on
the screen when you remove it so if I
remove it that goes on and because it's
magnetic when you get to the bottom here
it sucks it in which was a really cool
innovative feature back in 2008-2009
okay now let's talk about the actual
software that is running here we've got
windows mobile 6.1 so we're talking no
app store no built in kinetic scrolling
I mean things are a little bit rugged
here in the HTC touch diamond2 just get
ready for that so I'm going to zoom in
and some of the time moment is a style
is some of the time I'm going to use my
finger there are still screen elements
in this device that just do not work
with your finger because they're so
small so of course we have touchflo 3d
here which is comprised of these little
tabs along the bottom HD still HTC still
uses this interface paradigm in HTC
Sense the interfaces that they have on
Evo and on the inspire 4G and the legend
on all of their newer phones they
brought this forth through throughout
all of their products but they've just
renamed it to cents the idea with cents
is to bring information forward or in
the case of touchflo 3d it brings
information out of programs that you
would typically have to dig to get to so
for example instead of going to contacts
you slide over to favorites you flip
through your favorites instead of going
to text messages you have the the panel
here
music makes it easy to flip through your
different album art without having to
dig into the the actual music
application you get this really cool 3d
view this was cool stuff for 2008-2009
and there is no landscape support in
touch flow 3d although later they
introduced it with the touch HD
we've got email accounts we've got the
web and we'll talk about the web browser
here and how that is in a few minutes
here if you've got photos and video and
this was one of the coolest parts so you
could flick through this
beautiful visual display this was
something you could really use to
impress your friends the iPhone wasn't
even doing really cool fancy graphic
stuff like this it's a little bit choppy
but it was quite nice and because the
HTC touch diamond2 touchscreen meaning
you can't do multi-touch HTC came up
with this really innovative way to zoom
you'd make a little circle around the
area you wanted to zoom in on and boom
it zooms pretty cool very innovative
because this has a resistive touch
screen you may find that as I move
around here the phone's not going to
respond because I'm very used to using a
capacitive screen and I don't press very
hard you don't have to these days on the
touch diamond you got to give it a
little bit of pressure so here we have
your favorite applications of course you
can add your own we've got weather with
the beautiful weather animations which
hdçç still uses on their newer devices
we can flick through to see different
locations and finally we end up on
settings so let's dive into the Start
menu as they called it back in windows
mobile 6.1 this was still the old style
Start menu where your recent programs
were listed here on the top and then
your other entries were down below
what's interesting is that HTC's newer
devices like the Desire HD puts recently
used programs in the notification shade
it's kind of funny to think that they
brought forward a UI element that was
present in old Windows Mobile just
something that's interesting so here's
an example of where you can't really use
your finger you can but it's very
difficult I'm going to try to land on
programs and there we go now Windows
Mobile didn't have kinetic scrolling
built in until 6.5 this is six point one
but HTC figured it out and this was a
really big deal because previous to this
device you had to grab these skinny
scroll bars to move around but now you
could use your finger making it a lot
easier to get around the interface so
let's talk about the built-in
applications here on the HTC touch
diamond2 a bubble breaker solitaire par
for the course on Windows Mobile and
then the introduced teeter which was
really an awesome application to take
advantage of the accelerometer and this
was before Apple had its App Store we
first saw this and we hadn't really seen
many third-party games
come to smart phones so the fact that
HTC included this awesome accelerometer
driven game was pretty amazing back in
the day they still use this game teeter
in their newer devices very popular
device or very popular game will press
okay there and we're back office mobile
of course lets you view your OneNote at
one mobile files PowerPoint and you
could edit Word and Excel all this stuff
is standard for Windows Mobile active
sync of course people love that people
hated it it's active sync adobe reader
to look at pdfs album which HTC kind of
spruced up a little bit with a touch
flow-3d like interface you can use the
d-pad to highlight pictures as you go
along
it took pretty good photos for a device
of 2008-2009 audio booster calendar i
mean that's sort of built-in stuff
communications manager now this device
actually came with opera mobile to make
web browsing better because the built in
browser Internet Explorer was horrible
so here is the built-in browser I've
already loaded the full version of
Engadget it doesn't seem to be loading
images here let's see if it is checked
off but it's not showing up and there
was no accelerometer support and
Internet Explorer here and this is what
it looks like to browse a web page
you've got scroll bars and scroll bars
and scroll bars and that's really it
it's very cumbersome to use so it's no
wonder that HTC and Verizon and everyone
else decided to include Opera Mobile
which is a far superior way to view web
pages so here it is Opera Mobile really
helped to extend the life of Windows
Mobile and so did Skyfire by bringing
actually a decent browsing experience to
the table so let's try to go to a
website and by the way here is the
on-screen keyboard it's very small yet
very usable HTC did a great job to
optimize this just to give you an idea
here is my finger it covers up about
four letters quite a different story
from the 4.3 inch displays of today so
I'm going to go to pocketnow.com here
and let's see what happens now this did
have accelerometer support which is
great after a while this device is not
very responsive as you can see you know
when
when the Snapdragon processor came into
the scene with some newer windows mobile
phones and then the Android phones and
the Windows Phone 7 devices different
story that produced a huge leap in the
ability of these phones to browse the
web so here we're loading it seems to be
a little bit slow but it's getting it
done so here we have desktop class
browsing on this older device to sort of
bring it up to par with the iPhone it's
not loading all the images for some
reason of course we don't have
multi-touch but we can double tap to
zoom in maybe there we go and so
browsing was ok I mean it worked pretty
well here thanks to Opera Mobile and
then there were many new versions of
Opera Mobile that took advantage of
server-side rendering and all that we
also have a YouTube application and
there's an example of where I didn't
press hard enough to actually make the
phone respond and it seems to be being a
little pesky there we go ok so if we go
into the Start menu we can go into the
dedicated YouTube application here's the
HTC task manager by the way so the
iPhone got YouTube application and it
was awesome to be able to bring around
YouTube's library of millions of videos
wherever you go and high quality was
great
so HTC got to work they made this
application if we go up to settings we
can change the quality and there it is
it was very finger friendly it looked
and felt a lot like the iPhone version
whose head kinetic scrolling it looked
great it was a really a revolution
outside of iPhone to have this YouTube
application come to the table for the
touch diamond and later for the touch
pro and all of the subsequent touch
devices so again the touch diamond was a
big innovation although it didn't have
an app store didn't have a capacitive
screen didn't have a super-fast
processor in 2008-2009 it was actually a
device that could go head-to-head with
the iPhone
HTC really innovated a lot with touchflo
3d to bring information out in front of
you and best of all they made it
beautiful something that Windows Mobile
really lacked at the time and even other
smartphone operating systems like
blackberry and Symbian really lacked at
the
so they brought forth just a lot of
innovation really holding to their their
their slogan of HTC innovation which has
since been changed to HTC quietly
brilliant so a really cool device a
blast from the past I hope you enjoyed
this throwback video of the HTC touch
diamond2 have a device that you want us
to do a throwback with let us know and
we'll try to get one and bring it in and
do a throwback video for you thanks for
watching and please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
