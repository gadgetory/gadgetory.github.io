kind of looking at him hi mom iveta is
how it's pronounced man sheriff you got
a name thumbs up if you want Hyneman
vlogging and you didn't get any thumbs
up but I wonder what do you want me to
blog about that's right it's that time
of the weekend they've I've taken too
long it's because I've got this massive
cold right now but anyways I'm high
memory betta this is pocket now and this
is our pocket out daily recap for last
week so that's when they asked you if
you were holding out for the ipad 5 or
the ipad mini 2 and the reason why is
because the news were about some rumored
dates for possible launch and as it
turns out we have 460 comments out of
which for example shahzad which is a
very frequent pocketnow visitor says I'm
happy with my nexus 7 but I'm curious to
see what Apple brings proc which has
always appreciated and yeah a lot of
people are happy with their Nexus 7 and
specifically the new variant if you
currently hold the nexus 7 that's kind
of a no-brainer to keep it and forget
about the ipad but let's see what Apple
brings then Xavier cristata says if the
ipad mini does not bring a retina i am
getting the ipad 5 and that is exactly
my particular point i prefer the form
factor of the ipad mini that's the
reason why i have it but i hate this
tablet because it doesn't have rent of
this plate now the rumors have it that
it won't bring it right at this place oh
I'll most likely go for the ipad 5 and
then you sue says microsoft comes out
with a new surface pro and you know what
buddy both these products don't even
compete against each other is a full
computer against a tablet with an
art-based processor so i don't think a
lot of people really care especially
with the price point of the service pro
then on tuesday i asked you if you were
ordering the iphone 5s in which color
and why the news were about the fact
that there were gonna be shortages of
the iphone 5s in gold which ended up
happening and we have 443 comments out
of which 148 bro says i want the gold
and i'm a guy and yeah I said that I
didn't want to get the gold phone
because it was a girl's best friend and
I kind of rest my case on that one and
caitlin wilson says space grey because i
think it blends better and honestly i
ordered the space grey as well I feel
that it looks a lot like the first
generation iphone and since it doesn't
have fingerprint issues and hopefully no
scuff gate issues that's really the
reason why I went for it
more unique than the other photos and
the Courtney bro Xia says I'm getting
the white 5s in February can't wait and
if you can't wait why are you waiting
until februari then on Wednesday I asked
you if touch ID was enough for you to
consider an iphone 5s or an ipad 5 the
rumors were of the ipad 5 and probably
the ipad mini getting touch ID which is
pretty much confirmed now and we have
516 comments out of which james bearing
says apple can do much better than touch
ID alone such a disappointment I was
expecting a better invasion invasion I
think that's the word and you know
you're right James honestly I do feel
the touch ID is not enough but still
it's a cool feature I just yeah i agree
with you apple should have done more and
Cheryl 729 says I wouldn't buy the
iphone or ipad with touch ID because of
security reasons someone only needs to
hack apples database and steal as many
ideas as necessary I don't know how it
works in your country but in my country
the whole government has my fingerprints
ever since I was born then Timothy
authority says that's too gimmicky and
I'm sorry buddy I am NOT gonna agree
with him this is the same home button
with extra functionality you're still
gonna have to press the home button so I
really don't understand what the Dimmick
is here then on Thursday I asked you if
you were holding out for the nexus 5 the
rumors are that it will be launched some
time with in October and we have 652
comments out of which dive in USA 7 says
Nexus 5 for the win and I'm currently
reviewing the LG g2 and if the Nexus 5
is based off of this phone this is gonna
be a hot product and mr. fenham 555 says
I'm holding my breath until Nexus 5
comes out and can somebody please call
911 and Randall Richardson says the
Nexus 5 is clearly being released on
Thursday October thirty-first 2013 hip
cat equals candy NN Halloween means give
out candy and you know that's a really
good theory and then on Friday I asked
you if you would pay for a cyanogenmod
phone the rumors world with the oppo and
one being announced with cyanogenmod
event turned out to be true so we have
409 comments out of which one says
hydrogen mod is so unstable I'd rather
have touch crap of Samsung and buddy if
you're saying that you've never used
cyanogenmod series and another commoner
says I love sign
bought an HTC but if it comes with it
out of the box where's all the fun with
routing modding and booting and honestly
the percentage of people that actually
love rooting is very small I would love
for cyanogenmod to be available for the
masses you know I see in my case I would
love sad engine modern more than one
phone if they were easier to load and
that's not just because I I can root a
phone I just don't like the hassle of
you know risky bringing my device and
then Luis Robles says he has I will pay
for a phone cyanogenmod why not it you
know why not you're right cyanogenmod is
an awesome awesome version of the
operating system the only problem is
that right now you can get it for free
so that's mainly the question why why
would you pay for something that you can
currently get for free on your current
device you wouldn't even have to buy
another phone so let's see how it goes
honestly I feel that that's really the
Prophet they're gonna have and selling
that elbow and one at least here but
let's see how it goes for them thats it
