Paco calm and this is another episode of
the android application weekly and which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called camera 360 and
there are two versions available a free
version and a paid version which costs
three dollars and ninety-nine cents so
the camera is pretty advanced on this
application you can get many different
styles you can get HDR which is like the
advanced camera mode on the iphone 4 you
can also get all these other
enhancements you can change various
effects and settings you can go down
here and you can change the photography
mode funny thing I could just take a
photo here and we'll just wait for it to
focus and now it makes a funny image
hungry shark too is a fun game in which
you must navigate your shark through the
Seas and eat various sea creatures and
now I need to use my accelerometer to
move my shark around and eat various
objects before my health ones out if I
tap the screen I can boost my shark to
attack other creatures let's see here we
have the jellyfish slices ethos oh no
apparently I got stung by the jellyfish
so you can just go down and it says that
I'm starving because I got hit by the
jellyfish like it he's some of these
other fish there are two versions
available a free version and a paid
version which cost about 97 7 min jump
is a free game available in the android
market the object of the game is to move
your ninja from side to side of these
buildings and to attack various enemies
and to avoid obstacles so here I have a
bird so I want to slice across and try
to get the bird before the bird attacks
me and then a fox I'll try to avoid
those and i do want to avoid the little
people throwing ninja stars that decided
and so the game continues on like this
the object of the game is to get as high
up as you possibly can before you run
into an enemy sketchbook mobile is a
paper application the cost 99 cents on
the android market this utility has many
different tools that you can use to draw
as well as different settings what's
that i want to change this to a mirrored
image i can click on here and i can
select any one of these tools let's try
this marker down here it's not going to
get drawing and it makes any
image I can go back to my tools here and
I can select the various color and
select any color so I'll just click this
one here I can select the size of my
tools I can change the size and many
other options tripadvisor is a free
application available on the android
market it will help you stay in the know
when you visit an unfamiliar city so
let's say that anyone was to visit
orlando florida or whatnot and i want to
find something to do i'll just click on
things to do type in my city and now i
can just view my attraction type so
let's choose sightseeing click there and
i can find my attractions and it will
also show me ratings of so it'll site
thornton park as a four and a half a
circle filled in on that attraction so i
can also go back i can view hotels
