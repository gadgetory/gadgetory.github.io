Paco calm and this is another episode of
the android application weekly and which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this

there are two versions available a free
version and a paid version which costs
three dollars and ninety-nine cents so
the camera is pretty advanced on this
application you can get many different
styles you can get HDR which is like the
advanced camera mode on the iphone 4 you
can also get all these other
enhancements you can change various
effects and settings you can go down
here and you can change the photography
mode funny thing I could just take a
photo here and we'll just wait for it to
focus and now it makes a funny image
hungry shark too is a fun game in which
you must navigate your shark through the
Seas and eat various sea creatures and
now I need to use my accelerometer to
move my shark around and eat various
objects before my health ones out if I
tap the screen I can boost my shark to
attack other creatures let's see here we
have the jellyfish slices ethos oh no

I'm starving because I got hit by the
jellyfish like it he's some of these
other fish there are two versions

market the object of the game is to move
your ninja from side to side of these
buildings and to attack various enemies
and to avoid obstacles so here I have a
bird so I want to slice across and try
to get the bird before the bird attacks
me and then a fox I'll try to avoid
those and i do want to avoid the little
