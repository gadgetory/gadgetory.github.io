pocket calm and today we're excited
because we're going to unbox the brand
new LG Optimus 7 Windows Phone 7 handset
now with Microsoft setting of so strict
hardware requirements for windows phone
7 it's a little bit difficult for
manufacturers to produce a handset that
will differentiate from the other ones
it all comes down at the end of the day
of build quality materials used and
software included so without further ado
let's get to the unboxing of the LG
optimus 70 so here we are with the LG
optimus 7 just came in 10 minutes ago
Wow a small box says the LG logo looks
like this version is a Vodafone version
lge 900 windows phones logo says
bluetooth on the back it says something
in German and I think this is a version
which would go to Vodafone Germany so no
text as you can see on either sides of
the box so let's open the package Wow
nice here we have the device will put
this aside let's see what else is in the
box with that a battery which looks to
be one of 1,500 milliamp hours let's see
what the label is yes that's fifteen
hundred million powers we've got a
charger European one with a USB cable
port we've got a pair of headsets and it
looks to me like these are actually
noise cancelling buds and we have a
small disappoint of clickable yes it's
flickable button on the cable with also
replacement buds for your side we have
something which looks to be a manual
it's in German with a quick start guide
also in German so we're going to read
that and we got the USB cable which
is both used to charge your device and
since the device yeah micro USB cable
which plugs into the device and the
normal USB connector for pc and for the
charger and that's pretty much it not
too much in the box Noah pouch or
anything and here's the device itself
it's looking good stay tuned for our
hardware tour of the LG optimus 7 and
