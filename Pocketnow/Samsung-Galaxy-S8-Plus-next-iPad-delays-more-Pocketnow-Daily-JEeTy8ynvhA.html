plus with an S Pen early 2017 iPad might
not happen given some processor delays
and TCL vows that the legacy of the
BlackBerry will continue I'm Jaime
Rivera and from all of us in market now
to all of you Merry Christmas thank you
for keeping us company and watching our
videos
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you had
not picked up the memo that Verizon and
Motorola want to get rid of those Moto Z
droids think again Best Buy is currently
offering the phone for five dollars a
month and installment plans obviously
you have to get the phone with the whole
contract thing and everything but five
dollars on installment plans pretty much
makes this phone cost 120 bucks that's
insane that's crazy I do recommend it
even though it's not our favorite phone
that price is just insane other official
news have to do with TCL and blackberry
some people are skeptical over the fact
that TCL's gonna be doing the hardware I
am NOT I am a big fan of the idol 4s I
love that design the fact that it was
brought to the detect lineup is great
and dzl has just vowed publicly that the
company will continue the BlackBerry
legacy going forward I was a big fan of
blackberry design and according to TCL
there will be smartphones for all we
will keep you posted now as well the
spotlight over to some very interesting
and kind of hilarious news from uber
many consumers have been complaining
about the fact that after they finished
the ride the application is still
tracking them for hours and sometimes
even days according to an uber
spokesperson well apparently that will
continue because it's not Oberst fault
it's Apple's fault for the way it tracks
you and it's just hilarious mainly
because you don't have that problem with
other applications I just highly suggest
you close down the uber application once
you're done and speaking of Apple we've
got some very interesting reports coming
from tsmc this company has disrupted
with its ten nanometer chip and
apparently Apple's next iPads will be
powered by this chip but according to
some trusted sources the company is
having yield issues up to the point
where it can't mass-produce these ten
nanometer chips in time
to be able to make the next generation
of iPads that we heard would happen some
around March so yeah for those of you
that are in the market for an I've had
it seems you'll have to wait and given
the whole pro moniker it could be the
case anyways Apple takes a long time
with its pros and finally the very hot
moose today have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy s8 plus yes apparently there are
rumors that Samsung wants to give a hit
to the plus and this phone is going to
have a couple of characteristics number
one apparently it brings the stylus it
brings an S Pen so it revives whatever
didn't happen with the note seven that's
great
number two apparently the display is
going to grow into a six inch display
and think about it it makes a lot of
sense
what did Samsung do years ago in order
to be able to build a beefier battery
into the Galaxy Note it brought in a
humongous display back in the day so it
makes a lot of sense in the world for us
to get a niche display that makes the
phone feel smaller then grow it a little
in order to be able to add a larger
battery and fix the whole issues that it
had with the note 7 but it leads me to
the question of the day when you trust
Samsung with the Samsung Galaxy S 8 plus
in my case I definitely would I miss my
note 7 leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion
