8 plus with an S Pen early 2017 iPads
might not happen given some processor
delays and TCL vows that the legacy of
the blackberry will continue I'm hi Mary
vera and from all of us in parking now
to all of you Merry Christmas thank you
for keeping us company and watching our
videos this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you had not picked up the memo that
verizon and motorola want to get rid of
those moto z droids think again best buy
is currently offering the phone for five
dollars a month and installment plans
obviously you have to get the phone with
the whole contract thing and then
everything but five dollars on
installment plans pretty much makes this
phone cost 120 bucks that's insane
that's crazy I do recommend it even
though it's not our favorite phone that
price is just insane other official news
have to do with TCL and blackberry some
people are skeptical over the fact that
TC l's going to be doing the hardware I
am NOT I am a big fan of the idol 4s I
love that design the fact that it was
brought to the detect light up is great
and dzl has just vowed publicly that the
company will continue the blackberry
legacy going forward I was a big fan of
blackberry design and according to TCL
there will be smart phones poral we will
keep you posted now as will the
spotlight over to some very interesting
and kind of hilarious news from uber
many consumers have been complaining
about the fact that after they finished
the ride the application is still
tracking them for hours and sometimes
even days according to an uber
spokesperson well apparently that will
continue because it's not ubers fault
it's apple's fault for the way it tracks
you and it's just hilarious mainly
because you don't have that problem with
other applications I just highly suggest
you close down the uber application once
you're done and speaking of Apple we've
got some very interesting reports coming
from TSMC this company has disrupted
with its 10 nanometer chip and
apparently apple's next iPads will be
powered by this chip but according to
some trusted sources the company is
having yield issues up to the point
where it can't mass-produce these 10
nanometer chips in time
to be able to make the next generation
of iPads that we heard would happen some
around March up so yeah for those of you
that are in the market for an I've had
it seems you'll have to wait and given
the whole Pro moniker it could be the
case anyways apple takes a long time
with its pros and finally the very hot
moose today have to do with the samsung
galaxy s 8 plus yes apparently there are
rumors that samsung wants to give a hit
to the plus and this phone is going to
have a couple of characteristics number
one apparently it brings the stylus it
brings an S Pen so it revives whatever
didn't happen with a note 7 that's great
number two apparently the display is
going to grow into a six inch display
and think about it it makes a lot of
sense what did Samsung do years ago in
order to be able to build a beefier
battery into the Galaxy Note it brought
in a humongous display back in the day
so it makes a lot of sense in the world
for us to get an itch display that makes
the phone feel smaller then grow it a
little in order to be able to add a
larger battery and fix the whole issues
that it had with the note 7 but it leads
me to the question of the day when you
trust Samsung with the samsung galaxy s
8 plus in my case I definitely would i
miss my note 7 leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
