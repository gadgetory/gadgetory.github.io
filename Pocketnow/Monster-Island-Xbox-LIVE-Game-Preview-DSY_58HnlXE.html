and we're going to take a quick look at
this week's new xbox live game for
windows phone let's check it out this
week's xbox live game windows phone from
miniclip com and it's called Monster
Island here we are let's go right into
play and we have a bunch of these
islands you can go to the fast ones
coming soon so there's five of those and
then we have a ton of different levels
within each island so let's go to the
this one and see if we can do it there's
about 200 puzzles in all now you see
this it is very familiar it looks a lot
like fragger also from mini clips calm
and what we do we have some mini
monsters so I'm throwing that's that's
the sticky guy and then going to throw
this guy and that one explodes so you
have a you have a bunch of different
types of monsters some of them explode
on impact some of them explode after
they stopped moving some of them are
sticky some of them are just knock
things over so it's a pretty interesting
that way I haven't seen this one before
let's see what happens
upton to that one very well oh okay see
we got to do this we gotta use that one
there we go
so it takes some and that one didn't
work all right well you get the idea
let's come back and show you some other
features this one also has a store kind
of like the previous mini clips com game
over the snowboarding I stun too and as
you progress in the game you win coins
and in the store you can buy stuff with
those pretend coins so I can unlock more
monsters I can unlock worlds for eight
thousand coins I can just go ahead and
unlock the whole world the whole island
without playing it you can also buy
solutions so this will tell you how to
beat the level skips if you want to just
skip it and go to the next one and you
can also buy coins so if you really want
to cheat you can just buy nine thousand
coins for 248 microsoft points and make
it much easier for you of course there's
achievements good ones there and the
leaderboards down there and what's in
the options you can choose to change the
control a little bit tap the throw or
release to throw music basic stuff so
that's Monster Island a lot of puzzles
and I've been having a lot of fun with
this so I highly recommend you download
the free trial once it becomes available
on Wednesday of this week so be sure to
check for that so that's it for our
quick look at the new xbox live game
Monster Island for windows phone I'm
sure to give us a thumbs up like this
video and that's it for now
