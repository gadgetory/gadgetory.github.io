might be released earlier than usual we
get new rumors of the LG G 7 and it may
include some sort of a digital assistant
button Isla Bixby and Apple apparently
is having display problems yet again I'm
Jaime Rivera and can somebody please
explain to New York that in April it is
not supposed to snow this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals as well Best Buy now has the new
iPad the one that now supports the Apple
pencil and as it turns out it also has
trade-in deals in the case of you have
older iPads and we're talking as old as
the iPad Mini 2 so if you're in the
market right now apparently you can get
up to $125 in a gift card which pretty
much makes that new iPad 50% off is it
worth it I do believe it is if you're in
the market for a tablet now let's talk
about Apple as it seems the company is
now struggling to be able to get enough
displays for whatever products we're
gonna get in the future apparently Japan
display which was going to supply a ton
of LCD displays NEETs like 500 million
dollars to figure out some production
issues that it has and it seems that
whatever orders it received from Apple
haven't been enough for I don't know
what kind of deal they have there but
Cupertino might be struggling once again
I'm really tired of you know these news
about Apple and I know these news is not
the way to say it this news about Apple
it's just these because it's always
happening it's always the constant
struggle for Cupertino to figure out
production now let's talk about Motorola
I didn't expect to cover this but it
seems that we will still be getting moto
smartphones there are cat images of a
moto XIII play which obviously is the
watered down version of whatever XIII
will getting it supports moto mods
Snapdragon 66 processor in addition to
some decent specifications
we've always I don't know we praised
this play lineup because great battery
life with the great design for moto but
yeah we'll see if we end up getting it
or not now let's move the spotlight over
to the LG G 7
q according to heaven blasts that is
going to be the final name for this
product and well it seems that we might
be getting it at some point in the next
couple of weeks we hear the typical
snapdragon 845 processor finally an LG
flagship that launches with the latest
SOC in addition 60 gigabytes of RAM
storage etc everything seems fine but
the most interesting part about the
rendered video is that we might be
getting some button for I don't know
just like we get with the big sweet
button on samsung devices we might get
the option for some sort of another
digital assistant from LG I don't know
if there's enough space for another one
with how good the Google assistant is
but we'll see
and finally the most interesting news is
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 it seems that the company is
really rushed to launch its latest note
before the latest iPhone
apparently we might be getting this
device as soon as the summer which
usually is not the case we get it until
the fall but it seems that Samsung wants
to rush it out and you know I don't
blame them as the earlier it launches
the more damage it can do galaxy notes
have always been great but we wonder
exactly what is going to change and we
hear they're already production
prototypes out there that's great but in
today's question let us know are you
looking forward to the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 now that we've seen with the
Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus are in my case I
do but I hope they bring something more
than just the Ness 9 plus with a stylus
that's my opinion leave us a comment
