flagship we covered last month in New
York but have you seen the axon elite
for Europe and Asia
i'm michael fisher with pocket now here
at you've had 2015 in Berlin let's take
a quick look in terms of hardware the
axon elite is very similar to the axon
Pro we already know metal casing 5.5
inch display Snapdragon 810 three gigs
of ram and curious a dual camera
arrangement dedicated audio chip the
whole Shaboom where the elite differs is
first in minor cosmetic touches ZTE
changed to the end caps on the backside
from plastic to a softer pleather like
material which will either pleased you
or it won't for what it's worth I think
we've been here before and maybe it's
time to move on other changes include
the substitution of the American
versions lightweight UI for the full
blast skinning of ZTE s me favored
interface or my favored interface which
provides in many more customization
options the cool stuff is in security
the Oksana lead can be trained to
recognize up to three different
biometric keys meaning you can unlock
the phone with a fingerprint a voice
print or a via the new eye scanning
feature the fingerprint scanner works as
well as most of them do these days and
it was too loud to test the voice print
unlock in the booth but really we've
seen those before and I was dying to let
a smartphone scan my eyeballs teaching
it was pretty straightforward you
basically stare into the front-facing
camera so the phone can measure the
shape of your eyeballs no retina
scanning here and after you've gotten
acquainted you can unlock the phone just
by looking at it well no actually you
can unlock the phone by waking it up and
dragging down on the lock screen holding
it up pretty close to your face and then
looking at it for a few seconds straight
that could get pretty annoying pretty
quickly it's obvious that this tech is
in an embryonic state but not too long
ago fingerprint scanners were awkward
swipe sensors that didn't work too well
either if the eye scanner a few more
generations and
hey you never know the axonal lead will
go on sale in a handful of European
countries starting at September 24th
with wider availability in Europe and
Asia
following their after price 420 euros
we've gotten hands on with many more
smartphones and wearables a tee for 2015
in Berlin folks check out our videos
here on YouTube and head over to pocket
calm for up-to-the-minute updates until
next time this has been michael fisher
with pocket now captain to phones on
twitter thanks for watching see you next
