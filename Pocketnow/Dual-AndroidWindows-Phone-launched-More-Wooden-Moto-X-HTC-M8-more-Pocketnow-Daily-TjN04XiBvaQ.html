becomes a reality aside from a pricing
surprise the HTC I'm a compact a larger
screen and dual camera sensors and a
dual-mode Android and Windows Phone is
finally a reality sort of I'm high
memory that I and after a crazy week
trust me i am going to celebrate this
weekend like there's no tomorrow this is
parking out daily let's say off with
some official news as those of you
dreaming about a dual-mode android
windows phone can finally find one sort
of the reason why is because Boober this
korean company has just built the phone
that runs android and it runs Windows
Embedded 8 handheld it's not really
Windows Phone 8 but it looks like
Windows Phone 8 it works like Windows
Phone 8 and I don't know it pretty much
you can say it is the problem is that
this is really oriented for businesses
for some particular reason that we don't
really understand just yet so stay tuned
hopefully this phone will not see the
light of day and we'll probably see this
happen and more OEMs that are probably
more popular now start about LG as those
of you dreaming of getting an LG g3 at
mwc 2014 are kind of in for a surprise
as some Korean sources and very trusted
one say that apparently it is too early
for another phone which we agree with
the LG G Flex's their grand flagship and
they do want to push that model as much
as they can so apparently we will be
getting the g3 in May along the galaxy
s5 which there is a rumor out there that
it will happen on May so probably may
will be the Korean month stay tuned now
for about Sony as we get this very
interesting leak of a backplate for an
Xperia is not really for the z1
according to rumors it looks like a z1
replacement back wait for those of you
that shattered the glass or something
but apparently this does belong to the
z2 and given the fact that the spec
difference between the z2 and the z1 is
really not that significant some of us
are believing this is just a minor
upgraded an option like for example when
the Z and the ZL were announced pretty
much the same phone only different
designs well apparently the z2 will be
something like this so stay tuned mwc
could be the day now let's talk about
HTC as we get some interesting rumors of
the m8 first of all
we aren't getting apparently some dual
lenses according to some case
manufacturer and when we talk about dual
lenses apparently we will have two
sensors and the question is exactly what
HTC plans to do with these dual sensors
as we have seen them do it for 3d video
in the past obviously that flopped but
this is really interesting to see happen
and aside from that apparently HTC will
also invest on making the phone bigger
we're going to display around five
inches which is great but the bad news
is that apparently the company is not
going to be launching the start of the
EC apparently it'll happen in march
along with the other rumors of the
galaxy s5 so let's see how that goes and
finally for the very hot news of the day
those of you that are still interested
in getting a wooden moto expo the
company has just come to their senses
first of all they have other three
wooden options that are really
interesting which is great so you get
those options there but aside from that
you're not going to have to pay a
hundred dollars for this they've come to
their senses and now the price is just
25 bucks for the wooden option which is
just common sense i don't understand who
is willing to pay a hundred dollars
probably you were but that much is the
question of the day exactly with this
new price tag of just 25 bucks would you
still be willing to get a moto x and
what an option because i don't know in
my particular case even though the
prices doesn't make sense now I still
don't find wood to be cool on a phone
but please prove me wrong in the
comments down below leave us a comment
