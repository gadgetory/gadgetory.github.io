tony behind the camera still at MWC 2013
in barcelona checking out ZTE s newest
phablet offering the grand memo let's
see what it's got so just taking a spin
around the hardware real quick this is a
5.7 inch HD display at 1280 by 720 so
it's not the 1080p monsters that the
other guys are shipping it supports 16
million colors oh and we'll look at that
a little bit more in a second our review
units been handled quite a lot anyway
Android keys down at the bottom here you
have a front firing camera here that's
kind of hop around back this is the big
camera there's a 13 megapixel camera
obviously with autofocus there's an LED
flash right there the ZTE branding
around the back and some rather familiar
brush pattern on the on the battery here
the battery underneath is a 3200
milliamp hour unit weren't able to
determine if this cover is removable or
not SIM card and microSD slots over here
16 Meg's of onboard memory there is one
gig of ram behind the processor which is
a Qualcomm processor running at 1.7
gigahertz
power on the device and we're greeted
with ZTE s custom UI called my favor or
me favor
there's our unlock screen that we
remember from the Grand s and we have a
low battery warning there sorry about
that but here is the the custom UI
running on top of Android 4.1 you can
see it's not a whole lot different from
a lot of other custom skins around but
this is the non 3d variant of the
launcher so we have these kind of
bubbled out icons and the and the kind
of stuff but we can hop on over here to
our alternate unit which is running the
3d version of the my favor UI and you
have all these kind of fun little
elements it you know depending on your
point of view it'll remind you the old
days of HTC Sense when it was just
everything was overblown or it will shut
down on you in the in the middle of a
demo anyway we have some low power here
because these have obviously been played
with quite a bit but this is where it's
just a quick look so it's alright let's
just check the last thing we'll just
check side view ability here
not too shabby we have brightness
cranked all the way up this is a pretty
bright demo area but obviously some
really brilliant colors being produced
by this display even though it is only
720p so just a quick look at the ZTE
grand memo no stylus I should point out
so whether this is a true phablet or not
will depend on your definition of the
term but we're going to have a look at
this again this won't be our last time
with the hands on to this unit michael
fisher with pocket now tony back there
MWC barcelona 2013 stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
