or have pending legislation that will
permit wait for it self-driving cars yes
it's real it's not fake it's not science
fiction it's here today and who is the
company that's driving this awesome tech
it's google yes not only do they want to
be able to index everything they also
want to drive you down the road to get
that gallon of milk or maybe some more
lofty stuff it's actually pretty cool
with a self-driving car you can do all
kinds of stuff you can reduce driver
distraction unless maybe you're playing
a game on your Android that's driving
your car but we're not going to go there
you can also improve fuel efficiency by
knowing terrain by knowing speed limits
by knowing road conditions by knowing
that the condition of your tires if
they're full if they're not you can do
all kinds of stuff you can also compress
the cars on a given stretch of road so
that you don't have to have as much
following distance because a computer
with a high-speed camera can anticipate
distances a lot faster than the human
brain and human eyes can I'm not making
this stuff up lots of cool reasons why
you'd want to do that I don't have a
self-driving car I'd love to take you
out there and show you in my Prius or
whatever I mean my Ferrari that it can
drive itself but I don't have that but
what do I have I've got an android
galaxy nexus and an app that'll make my
driving just a little bit safer and it
kind of gets us an insight into what
Google is doing with their self driving
cars why don't we go take a look
so we fired up the app the first thing
that we've got here is how to mount our
phone we need to make sure that we are
mounted at 90 degrees this way and 90
degrees this way and I think I've gotten
that as close as I can go ahead and say
next now it's showing us some safety
indications and alerts some information
that we've got here so our headway
monitor simply shows us how much
distance in seconds we have between us
and the vehicle in front of us and
anywhere from red being bad to green
being you're just fine we have collision
alerts again just to tell us hey this is
your fallen to close this is dangerous
and then if you're staying on your road
or going off the road or out of your
lane quick settings we can use this 24 7
and what that does is it is essentially
runs a service in the background where
it looks at your GPS to see how fast
you're going and if you're traveling at
speed it'll automatically launch the app
so you don't have to kind of cool you
can direct calls to the speaker in the
device so essentially turn on the phone
the speakerphone that's nice I on road
narrator reads incoming notifications
and text messages you can set that speed
limit can let you know when you're
speeding I'm in the US so we measure
that in miles per hour in Utah we have a
couple 80 mile-an-hour zones so I'm
going to go ahead and leave that right
there at 85 miles an hour if I go faster
than that it will warn me now big
disclaimers all over the place it says
this does not replace safe driving
habits it's not responsible for yada
yada yada it's not that automated
driving system that we were talking
about earlier so now this is our car
interface you remember way back when we
have those car interfaces on our phones
well here it is again searching for GPS
right now we've got big buttons to go
into phone into navigation playing music
I don't know why you'd want your photo
gallery here while you're driving I
don't think that's a good idea of course
we've got our compass it's got a GPS fix
now and it knows that I'm not going
anywhere i'm sitting in the driveway so
let's go ahead and hit this big go
I've button so here we go it's my
evening commute and you can see I've got
this green stripe in front of me that
kind of is shaped like a trapezoid now
that stripe is just telling me where the
lane is you can see it's kind of trying
to guess where the edge of the road is
and it goes over and it looks at where
the amber stripe is down in the middle
of the road that helps me know when I'm
drifting in and out of my lane of course
if I'm looking at the display on my
phone to do that which I'm not so it has
alerts and alarms that will tell me when
I'm when I'm drifting out of my lane now
what you also saw there was a little
pop-up that said something like 1.3
seconds it's seen the car ahead of me
and it knows based on my current gps
based speed how close I am to to that
car in front of me and it's giving me a
notification to let me know how close I
am so there you go a first-hand look at
what augmented driving with an android
app looks like really on the road what
it can do to kind of help out and some
of its limitations now the app name if
you didn't catch that before is called I
on road spelled the letter I on road all
smooshed together there's a white
version which is free so you can try it
and see if you like it the version that
we showed you today was the paid version
it's 499 us at least it was at the time
we filmed this video so you can go ahead
and grab that a couple things you're
going to want to know you will need a
car dock there's just no ifs ands or
buts about that if you don't have one
this isn't going to work your car dock
is going to have to allow your phone to
see down the road that means the away
facing camera has to have a clear view
of the road in front of you some docs
have the little suction cup mount in the
way some docs cover that up because
who's taken pictures when you're driving
honestly except us okay you're also
going to need a doc that is adjustable
so that you can have it plumb and level
the front of the phone has to be
perfectly plump and the top of the phone
has to be
perfectly level that's how it gauges its
distances and whatnot if you get those
off a little bit it's not going to work
it's going to miss measure things and
trust me that's a bigger step than it
sounds okay last but not least you're
going to have to point your phone
straight down the road that sounds
simple enough but by doing that you're
kind of tilting away from you the driver
so you might need to reposition the doc
just a little bit to make it more
visible to you especially when you've
got light and glare coming in the last
item of note there are some states and
some localities that do not let you put
stuff on your windshield I'm not making
this up suction cups aren't allowed lcds
aren't allowed California so instead you
get a kind of a dash doc and you put the
phone on the dash which is right in
front of the windshield and somehow
that's legal but putting it on the
windshield isn't anybody out there a
politician come on guys really anyway so
what do you think of this cool not cool
would you go out and buy this and get
the whole set up and drive off with it
all the time maybe you'd like to do this
with say a teenager who's just starting
to drive so that they can have a little
bit more help making sure they don't run
into that Mercedes in front of them I
want to know now's your chance head over
to pocketnow.com follow the link right
down there if you're watching this on
the YouTube video if you're already on
pocketnow.com thank you very much big
thumbs up for you so everybody hit the
big thumbs up button down there okay
leave us comments over at pocketnow.com
about if this is something that you're
interested in would you do this would
you not why wouldn't you do this would
you do this for teenagers who are just
learning how to drive if you're a parent
or maybe you're another teenager who
doesn't like your friends driving I
don't know let us know over the comments
cool I think so 4-pocket now I'm Joe
Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
