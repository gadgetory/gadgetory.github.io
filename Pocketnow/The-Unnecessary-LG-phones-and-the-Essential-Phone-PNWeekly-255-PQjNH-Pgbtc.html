high demand for the key one modal gets
ready to drop new modular phones and
accessories on the market and mr. Chris
Davies from SlashGear drops by to chat
all the essentials on the essential
phone these stories and more so make
sure you're charged and ready for
episode two five five of the pocket now
weekly record a June first at noon
pacific time this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid in the coolest v around
was a 12 engine i'm juan carlos bag now
senior editor pocketnow.com blasting the
signal from sunny Southern California
joined this week as always by plucky
podcast producer Jules Wong how's it
going out there on the east coast would
you appreciate a 34 cylinder engine if
you could have one I wonder you know
because each one would have such a like
a like a tiny volume and the compression
on that would be insane I just want to
know what that would sound like you
sound like some like just little Hornet
a little bit you know like something
totally gnarly was the v12 has such a
nice like snarl to it I mean you know
you do reply that to 1.3 liters and you
still get so good all those curvy 34 key
cylinders like that's all you get to
them well you need the power sport phone
and by the way I should apologize for my
voice this week as I'm trying to get out
of this fever that I'm recovering from
and apparently no apology necessary
well I'm sure what I have listed is
without a nominally absurd conversation
of the three Oh with your dreams like
well your sweats nightmares it's going
to be insulting I mean like having
Hellraiser
Hellraiser flash biodiesel
the salty phlegm that Heather I have to
freaking the extra it's like Dead Sea
salty anyway yes yeah you're a little
salty about post-nasal drip going on mmm
nothing bad this way like typical
allergies that have not been affecting
me as much so the post nasal okay is it
out of a bad hay fever II situation - we
mean it was it was pretty nice but one
thing one thing about you on the sea but
other comes in so eventually your your
toddler will bring back 15 more disease
yeah you two stay here right now so I'm
sure she's gonna bring back some new
plague for me to contend with this
afternoon so while we're all getting
sick over and over again you might be
getting sick of us talking you might
want to send in some questions so you
can do so at podcast at pocketnow.com we
would love to hear from you about your
opinions on mobile tech and the
uncertainties that you have regarding
your personal situation or anything else
that might just be in the news also you
can spread the joy the show and
everything that is around us
hashtag P and weekly wherever hashtags
are appreciated
trillium they're not appreciated where
you're at then you know you should
probably move somewhere else really it's
like yeah I mean who wants to live
somewhere where hashtags aren't saying
that people can click on because that
would be terrible
no no you can the kid he would tap on
them that's just a night that would be
the worst and and you've got people that
are saying pound as if it's like unlike
a telephone from the 1980s come on
Cooper and so don't you don't want any
of that it's a hashtag now I think we've
all we've all made that trig vision here
up book but Before we jump into any more
tech tomfoolery as we let the rambling
tale are we are we greater life are we
going into more tick-tock foolery well
no we
even started really and so before we
actually get to the stuff that people
are downloading the show to listen to we
should take a moment to thank this
week's sponsor and that is hello fresh
hello fresh is a farm to box and couch
to kitchen meal delivery service which
aims to make cooking more fun so you can
focus on the whole experience not just
that finished plate you're going to
Instagram later each week hellofresh
delivers delicious new recipes with step
by step cooking instructions each meal
designed to take around 30 minutes to
prepare and even for the kitchen novices
who might be short on time that's that's
not a difficult proposition sourcing the
freshest ingredients measured to the
exact quantities needed helps reduce
food waste and I personally have to
throw a shout out here because their
packaging is excellent more recyclable
materials and in instead of just getting
a big clumsy bag full of food all of the
ingredients for each meal are packed in
their own individual containers which
really helps streamline the amount of
prep per meal less than $10 per serving
you can select between a classic plan
vegetarian options and a family box if
you need to feed more people hello fresh
employees to full-time dietitians to
ensure each meal is nutritionally
balanced now offering late spring meals
and they've just added breakfast options
you know get you started right for that
most important meal of the day it's it's
a phenomenal service we actually did try
it out let's see we did sesame beef
tacos shrimp saganaki with olive tomato
sauce over couscous and pistachio
crusted chicken with a cucumber
jalapeño salad this was definitely the
winner of the three but all three meals
were were phenomenal just very well put
together very unique flavors and the
process for putting them together again
I'm going to hold this up for the web
camera and my exposure is going to be a
little wonky here but when they say
step-by-step instructions again it's
very easily laid out very well diagram
full-color photos for what you should be
seeing as your
that meal together and it's just a very
well considered service for making sure
you have all the pieces to to get this
done I mean again if you just have sort
of a bunch of ingredients and you're
trying to get a meal on a plate in under
half an hour the extra little bit of
hand-holding from from hellofresh really
does kind of help make the difference
delicious ingredients you'll love to eat
simple recipes you'll love to cook hello
fresh has a special offer for p-n weekly
listeners get $30 off your first week of
deliveries when you use the promo code
pocket now 30 that's 3 free meals when
you sign up at hellofresh comm with the
promo code pocket now 30 and we thank
them for supporting the pocket now
weekly and I didn't need to be hungry
after after and the carrot even eats
without it hurting the back of my foot
oh yeah because your fever stuff you
know one of the things that I actually
really dig I'm sorry I'm going to keep
like talking about oh yeah about food
while you're still starving umm wheat
for the cool thing about the meal
delivery services in general and
hellofresh
specifically is when you go through and
you see like the quantities and stuff it
makes it really easy to just hold this
card we actually have a folder now that
we keep by the fridge and if you like a
recipe you can pretty easily recreate it
without having to like go through like
another mailing all the food to you so
it's nice to kind of catalog these
things because they're are so nice bases
to build off of
so like when we're looking at something
like a cucumber jalapeño salad I'm from
New Mexico I actually like green chili
better than jalapeno and it you know we
can swap out ingredients and play with
different recipes and kind of create our
own unique twists on them it's it's this
has actually turned out to be a really
cool service to kind of help just expand
our repertoire of meals in the kitchen
mmm the the corrector if there's
Christmas yes you know it's touristy the
people will probably make fun of you for
ordering Christmas but green and red
combined that is delicious yeah and if
you're not from Colorado maybe
the eastern Arizona or New Mexico you
probably don't have any idea what we're
talking ya know the dragon Nogales
shadows to you yo Duke city represent
505 stomping that's how you smother a
burrito do you have to have both colors
well I love it I prefer I actually do
prefer keeping them separate just so
that I get the taste and then if I you
know coming down to the middle that's
where ya happens in this well because
red is just I think red has just that
more robust flavor and green gets a
little more citrusy and you can kind of
swap back and forth and s is great yes
exactly now the higher you got the
salivating here just yeah alright my
home cuisine you're you're you're you're
definitely not helping me out here so
I'm gonna let's get you something to
help myself here and talk about the news
of the week and we start off with the
Moto Z to play just coming out today as
of this recording and it's just a
upgraded note of Z play we don't have a
row to Z or Moto G Force upgrade at this
point but so this was just a out of the
blue with kind of a deal Snapdragon 66
which is supposedly going to be the
upgrade to the 65 that everyone's been a
big fan of 3000 milliamp hour battery
which is a downgrade from a bigger one
under the original Z play although there
is four gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of storage and yes just gonna
be uh it's going to be what 499 Wow okay
so yeah it's $50 more than last time
around okay that's not bad and there are
also a bunch of refreshed Moto Z
excuse me moto bond for them to be high
enough that you can buy a plank now like
the JBL sound groups turbo power pack
and spousal before I was charging to so
look forward to that
also keypad now if that were a switch
pad somehow I would be fans that but
unfortunately most Motorola Nintendo are
not coming together like that any time
soon anyways let's talk about Nubia
please leave VTES sub-brand
is the chakra not pretty cool loud and
good deal with the Nubian z17 it comes
with up to 8 gigabytes of RAM which is
something that we still haven't been
able to say for any phone real way dr.
King 8:35 it's all top shelf and it's
also water resistance to just the boot
everything and you gotta have a
Cristiano Ronaldo's plug if you want to
promote a film you have to because it is
such a such a beautiful man and a plant
yeah yeah dual camera and it 23 and 12
megapixel sensors and the very big up to
2 times optical zoom and 10 times
quote-unquote dynamics and potato so
that this should be of interesting for
$100 phone if it were $400 but we're
talking about China so you know what
that sounds just done right for that
market anyways shipping starts June 6 so
that's a pretty quick turnover really
let's talk about the BlackBerry key one
at this point
TCL really been promoting this lovely
lovely deal it's talked about lodges
wireless up in Canada garnering the most
pre-orders for BlackBerry device ever
and also just
it has spread on board for the late
summer but between now and then it has
seen extremely high turnover and issues
with stock outs so and that was just in
the first day I was a veil ability and
it was available best buy block other
places it can all the carriers in Canada
and a couple of others in the US as well
so definitely something that's you need
to get your mind over your head wrapped
into because blackberry is apparently
back all right
let's talk about something that is a
little confusing to me get me LG's
wising confusing to all of us that yeah
so um there's gonna be a g6 plus and a
g6 bro
coming soon part of me as I blow my nose
I can't blow my nose because that was
unsuccessful and I was talking while I
was doing that anyways the LGG sixth row
is going to be as late there's the plus
and there's the pro you would think that
the pro would be the better SPECT one
that would be real now it's 32 gigabytes
of storage and basically the rest of the
spreadsheet is the same and 30 days
that's half to 64 on the standard g6 LD
g 6 plus that has 128 gigabytes of a
storage plus wireless charging and those
two are going to be sold in Korea for
the time being within the bus and
possibly globally coming soon at least
before the V 30 might be coming out so
definitely some confusion some
interesting stuff going on there and
it left me speechless as to what was
really what we're really dealing with
LGD 30 staggered off I mean that's uh
well it's a fantasy if it's privet as I
keep calling it um you want to slide out
keyboard how about slide out screen so
it just in sets a second screen that you
can you know pull out to have it become
a bigger second string is apparently
being envisioned for the view theory now
and blast told us that this this vision
might not be still in the development
right now but you know just the thoughts
of that those hearts working together
it's questionable I mean you could have
50 some great uses keyboard for one
thing and other instant responses Google
whatnot but these renders and leaks are
are kind of questionable at this point
specially because of the patents that we
had tracks which sorta like indicated
some sort of essential phone type of
thing going on with this selfie cam has
lodged in between like the edge of this
profited of the screen so and this was
before this was at least a year that the
patent was filed a year before the
essential phone came out so definitely
some and to continue to look for the T
in terms of the v3 which is especially
to come out late August and finally
Galaxy s8
your experience with it in the US has
not been complete for the past while and
that is because Pixley voice support is
still not here and it won't be here
apparently for at least another few
weeks according to The Wall Street
Journal
learned that the voices distant which
apparently I believe was a coded first
in Korean is still having trouble trying
to figure out English in terms of
grammar and syntax so this this is this
III mean that that's what not going why
the follies of its when the follies of
going your own way as a Korean tech
company it and oh yeah we have this huge
audience to serve in many many countries
with this flagship product that we want
to work properly and supports and you
know when you fall flat on your face
there is room I think they haven't I
think I think the you know if we mu a
mind jumping into some discussion here I
think they're falling flat on their face
I think they're trying to prevent
falling on their face which is why
they're being so conservative in
releasing this well I bet we mentioned
our okay if they only make one mistake
then people are going to give up on big
speed before they've ever had a chance
to see what it can really do and you
know I think it's it's it there are two
things here's that is there room to fall
and you know and make mistakes still or
has the elevator gone up from the ground
floor because if you know if Bixby
doesn't have a speaker in the next year
like sayonara for them or what sorry
the Korean for goodbye um yeah
you're asking the wrong guy there I have
no idea but but but not mean that that
points well-taken to if there is the
fear of being sold on a service a piece
of software that was supposed to be
included in the price of our phone and
if it takes a year before it's released
then that would be very upsetting I
don't think it will
I think market pressure on Samsung will
force them to move unfortunately I think
it'll force them to move before their
developers and their engineers are
really completely satisfied
translating the experience from a Korean
audience to a North American one but
that's also the the nice edge or the
tightrope I should say that the balance
game that you need to play in if this
thing doesn't do what Samsung said it
could do the first time someone fires it
up and they get information or a result
or a search or you know they scan a
photo and it doesn't really do anything
cool for them that consumer is
exceedingly less likely to go back and
revisit Bixby in the future so I get why
I get why they're soul playing it but
this is also the big frustration is it
really feels like all of these companies
are kind of duplicating the same level
of experience that we've had for a long
time now between Google Voice Search and
Siri and Cortana and I'm still waiting
to see what company can really help push
us into the next phase of a true digital
assistant experience and get developers
on board because I think a major part a
problem of this is there are so many
things that I do on my phone that have
very little to do with the actual phone
like have very little to do with Google
and so if I can't interact with Twitter
or Facebook or Yelp or any other number
of services that I'm you know driving
service you know ride-sharing services
you know book travel I I posted I'm
trying to set up some international
travel and I would love for a voice
assistant to help me organize flights by
the time that I'm trying to that by the
time that I'm going to be landing in the
various destinations that I'm going to
but anything that I search for is just
going to be well what time do you want
to depart you're like I don't care what
time I depart but I know when I need to
be on the ground can you help me or that
flight that way instead of me guessing
what departure time I want and then sort
of backwards organizing flights by
arrival time that's a terrible way for
me to do this search you know and that's
the perfect I mean for me would be a
perfect benefit to a digital Butler
coming in and saying
oh well here we've organized this info
and this matches up with your calendar
because we know where you need to be
when you're on the ground and when you
need to be there so here's a flight that
would get you in with plenty of time you
know that would be awesome I would like
I don't know how it feels for you
but just the way we receive time you
know it feels like we've been talking
about actions on Google and you know
those third-party links for Alexa and
all that for a while now and we had you
know it's been slow to get to the
services that we want and we desire and
in the way that we would like them to be
in fact you know you think it's going to
take years and years before yeah we get
that kind of standardization so-called
but you know it's didn't in terms of
that time scale we're still dealing with
I think was nine percent in terms of an
open market research survey about
digital assistant awareness and usage
half of the people surveyed and said
that they had no interest or the award
aware of it yeah and who knows what the
other 41% said thank you Wall Street
Journal for that but you know it's
either I don't know where the room is
but perceived pressures are going to
come down the line here Apple might
announce a couple of it will announce a
chip AI chip coming up at WWC DC it is
believed can you speak like this and
there is also arm also announced AI
Indiana chips too so you find more of
these as you know speakers and all these
players coming on it with just all their
sports at once
Samsung well as I also think that there
is a notion because I'm happy to hear
that Apple is taking the sort of
hardware and the hardware extra
abstraction layer of this seriously
because what I would hope for us to
eventually get to is an interface which
can also be more discrete
you know if you're talking to your phone
to command your phone to do things I
would love to have like so you know like
when you see in like I'm like SWAT you
know and they've got that like that
throughout communicator so they can
whisper and the microphones are right on
there their Adam's apple and that's how
they're gonna like you know storm this
house with a no-knock warrant um one of
the problems that I think a lot of
people have is they have to sort of
express out to a gadget a search query
or a command a reminder calendar entry
and that takes longer and often is is
you know the phone gets it wrong more
often than if you just went to your
calendar app and punched in a calendar
entry using text and so I think one of
the things that would help is can we
make this more discreet can we make it
more private so that then also when
something doesn't work you know I've
seen people in public like hey Siri hey
Siri Siri and you're like Siri
apparently isn't listening after the
third try you know maybe you should just
go to doing this manually but the second
a consumer has that one experience where
Google now or Siri or Cortana or Amazon
Alexa doesn't quite get it right they're
probably never going to ask that speaker
that assistant that query ever again so
then when Google or Amazon or Apple
update these services and add new
commands your consumer is far less
likely to go looking for what new things
that voice assistant can do the garbha
means to get some successive base hits
at the you know right from the starts in
order to have any room for a stripe Oh
totally well in the not so it's not
overselling it to I mean I think that
was part of the death the early death of
smartwatches was making it look like you
were going to have this amazing computer
computing experience on your wrist and
it was really a notification delivery
platform with some other little extra
bells and whistles and I think it
completely misrepresented when we're
talking about digital assistants and
you know Google now in Siri and it's
going to be like the computer on Star
Trek and it's going to understand you
and it's going to do all these things
and then when you really try it you're
like this is kind of the same thing
we've been playing with for a long time
now on other platforms and other
services it's it's hard not to be
somewhat let down by that when we can
also see some of the really cool work
being done by other companies that just
don't seem to have any interest in
moving those products to a consumer
facing industry yeah yeah
I'm tired of using my human intelligence
to talk about artificial intelligence
let's uh right yeah yeah look you are
talking about the LG a little bit oh we
got to talk about the v3 all right oh
that that's mandatory no because I am
very concerned if if this turns out to
be a V Series phone so--even blast is
saying that this is called Project Joan
and just to sort of you know kind of
revisit what you brought up in the news
piece is that this is going to be a
screen which slides up to reveal another
screen underneath and that can be your
keyboard or it can be a customized
interface for other apps and services
and I really like the idea of LG
experimenting again not with a mainline
phone I don't think they should ever
screw with the G Series or with the V
Series ever again I think those need to
be platforms stable targeting specific
demographics for content creation for
you know a flagship phone design in the
G series but I miss the LG that would
put out phones like the Flex so if this
were a standalone experimental limited
run design phone I would say awesome go
for it I want to see what you can do but
if you call this a V series then I
expect um best-in-class durability I'm
hoping they'll add water resistance it
needs to be an amazing content creation
platform that you know the best high-end
multimedia consumption experience and I
think things like making the phone over
engineering the phone to add a slider
mechanism
is going to make it more fragile it's
going to complicate the software
something I don't want to have to deal
with or mess with when I'm when I'm
trying to like fire up the camera or use
the audio recorder or just listen to
music I don't want other things getting
in my way and so that's where I'm super
concerned I really hope that this was
just an experimental mock-up something
that they were kind of playing with or
that it's in the some kind of line of
v-series phones maybe that's okay too
but I absolutely want to have a
standalone regular slate v30 which just
refines what we liked about last year's
monster beast of a phone and we can show
progress there because this will be the
third year of v-series phones this would
be the year that I think consumers would
start taking the V more seriously as its
own unique platform of phones it got a
little bit more visibility following the
note 7 we've had people like me
preaching about how great the the camera
and the audio and the microphones are on
this phone this next model year would be
a really good year to nail that down
deliver for consumers don't mess with
expectations but deliver something
that's going to be a monster performer
for what they focused on in the past and
I don't see that in a slider
well the variant they really need to pad
out with a g6 or g6 Pro Plus like look
like they're going that does just that
was room for that's confusing
well Donnie there is there's room and
because I don't think that there's they
say creators of autonomous or MLG says
that it's working are diversifying its
portfolio just serve more if it's a very
to consumer categories but I mean
because it tries that little of v30
concept out then instead I mean if you
were banking on stable releases you
already had them but you decided hey
let's let's a put lipstick on well it
wasn't really a pig but you know it's
the t6 is in a pig the t6 is a fine but
you know this way but you like you're
putting lips
Taiana on you know degraded you know
thing I don't know what well the things
the things that LG I think is is going
to face the ire of LG fans and this I
actually I can kind of appreciate why
people might be upset by a move like
this is the launch of the g6 was still a
bit clumsy for the different variants
that went to different regions and so
you know if you were in Europe you
didn't get the high quality DAC or the
wireless charging in North America you
got wireless charging and a very capable
back but not the high-end DAC and then
in South Korea you got the quad DAC very
similar performer to what we saw on the
V 20 but you didn't get wireless
charging and I can appreciate their
market research they focused on the
features that they thought would be most
applicable to the region's they were
shipping but it always leaves someone
feeling like they got an incomplete
product and now in other words the
literally but refresh on the G well yeah
ultimate modular phone but you can't
change the configuration okay this is
you kid that is LG can and that PI has
been baked for you some can't unbaked
that pies no this is um but this is
going I think to add to that sentiment
when you get a refresh you know so now
if you kind of bit let's say let's say
you're in Europe and you went ahead and
you bit the bullet and you needed a new
phone you got the g6 and you you
eventually made peace with the fact that
it didn't have wireless charging or the
quad DAC and then these new variants
come out several months after this to me
sets up an expectation that you should
never jump on an LG product and that
you'll always play the wait-and-see game
with them or you'll eventually just move
to another manufacturer so like should I
buy the V 30 or should I wait and see if
there's a V 30 + or V 30 Pro or you know
V 30 slider you know it's going to it's
going to create a barrier a mental block
some ill will
where the consumer feels like they're
not really getting everything that they
could have or they're not really getting
the best bang for their buck and that
the company reinforces that when they
then spruce the product up a couple
months after its launch
that's dangerous psychological territory
for any manufacturer to be in and I
don't think many companies whether that
well to my memory over the last year I
think oneplus handled it as best they
could going from the 1+3 to the 3t and
it didn't really seem to leave too much
of a bad taste in anyone's mouth that
this was getting a refresh but then
again we were also talking about a phone
that's still sold for at least $200 less
than what LG is charging for the g6 so
expectations should be about 50% higher
I mean yeah quite like a mid-range er
solution is going to honor there's also
that but I mean the spec Chicot you know
just from first glance the spec changes
seem to be in memory and in which in one
case yeah it's a dig it's a downgrade 32
gigabytes and then there was always well
wine with the freaking wireless charging
which was the Polaris and that is the
cloud on g6 that's got to go up in price
well no but the g6 was I mean there were
some people who were disappointed that
that the only option that I think most
regions had was just the 32 gig model we
knew more phones were going to be coming
out with 64 gigabytes of built-in
storage so this to me feels a lot like
some of the strategy that we've seen
from Chinese manufacturers where the
base model has four gigabytes of RAM and
32 gigabytes of storage and then when
you increase that's where you jump both
RAM and storage and so that that looks
like what LG could be trying to do here
where I still think it's going to be
somewhat region specific I'll be very
surprised if they jump on a g6 refresh
here in the United States because of the
way that carrier carrier packaging deals
have to be sorted out like 18t is not
going to want to buy a new stock of G
sixes and when they probably still have
G sixes in inventory
so if we get an unlocked model of that
great but we've all seen how major
players even struggle with unlocked
sails here in the United States yeah
kind of a token effort but you know at
least it's not like the minion max
efforts or the all the freaking oh yeah
no no this is definitely still better
than than those sort of ugly days of
like probably a couple of years called a
galaxy s4 but it's the Galaxy s4 mini in
it look good person a terrible expires
we just cut a thousand quarters no I
mean no you're absolutely right there
and and ultimately this this really does
play into the emotional side of of our
gadget ownership where you know as soon
as we buy something we're kinda on the
lookout to see did we get the right
thing did we buy the right thing and
within a couple weeks of whatever
purchase you make someone's going to
come out with a better product and we're
going to think oh no I should have
waited um from what I see here having
the extra storage would have been nice
in fear in a region which didn't get
wireless charging but then you get this
Plus that would also be nice but I'm
happy to see that they're not really
screwing with the core functionality of
the phone it doesn't seem like the quad
DAC is going to be making any
appearances in markets where it wasn't
sold originally it doesn't seem like
there's they're doing a processor
refresh because I think that would have
been very frustrating
to be on board early with the g6 on an
821 a couple months later then they ship
it with the 835 um that I think could
have been a bigger deal you know a
bigger psychological hurdle for people
to feel upset about and then the rest of
the phone seems to be very much in
keeping with what LG originally
delivered so thankfully I don't think
they're wrecking what they did with the
g6 to try and appeal to new customers
but I can still totally appreciate why
some people might be frustrated if they
were on board early with the g6 and then
maybe a few other nice little perks
delivering that horn Carlos always
fighting for the small person little
that little guy
well yeah I'm only five eight so it's
that's it comfortably in the backseat of
most Japanese car you're already kind of
a thing going there I guess
the mine Napoleonic complex of playing
we got to fight for all of us to know us
a little bit alright um how do you feel
how do you how do you how do you um how
do you do how I do what I do know I you
know it's it's the this was an
interesting week for news especially in
light of a something which I'm hoping
will be progressive and disruptive and
an exciting transition in the state of
mobile technology we've been dancing
around the topic you know talking about
assistance and software and smartphones
and cool design and I think the new
cycle this week was absolutely occupied
by Andy Rubens new venture essential
with the essential phone and the
essential home speaker system that he's
looking to create and so I feel we
should probably bring on a guest
commentator to help us unpack what what
this might mean for the future of the
mobile industry but before we do that
you can search for these stories in full
detail at pocketnow.com hit the podcast
section and look for this shows rundown
you can also check out Jaime Rivera on
the PocketNow daily on our youtube
channel
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls I am
very happy to introduce mr. Chris Davies
from SlashGear going to help us expand
on the conversation surrounding the
essential phone Chris thank you so much
for dropping by the PocketNow weekly no
thank you for having me
I always like talking so that's really
useful well and that's why we wanted to
have you on is because we like people
who like to talk and that's a nice
little bit of synergy for this as it's
supposed to be something of a
conversation everything has come
together so beautifully we should almost
end it here now so as to just avoid it
going downhill terribly well before who
this completely jumps the tracks let's
jump right in because I don't want to
keep you too long
and there's a lot to unpack here is
we're talking about the father of the
Android operating system a person with
impeccable credentials in the mobile
industry and he's finally taken the
wraps off of the essential phone and
just to jump in because I think people
on our channel have heard me you know
sort of blather on enough about
essential phone I was hoping to get what
your sort of initial impressions were
when we finally got all the details
directly from Andy Rubin all of the
rumors were sort of put to rest how did
you feel about the way this product was
launched and what it is that mr. Rubin
is trying to offer in the premium
smartphone category I mean it's clearly
fascinating I mean any people who love
Android phones and high-end flagship
phones are obviously going crazy about
this phone and I'm no different it's
it's very very interesting on a kind of
a geeky level my concern as I think a
lot of people have concern to it is
whether that will it ever translate to
sales or translate to enough sales to
make it worth their while and make this
a legitimate product in comparison to
something like your Samsung's and your
LG's and whatever I think it's really
fun I think it's fascinating I don't
know if it's going to tip the scales in
any meaningful direction but maybe
that's me being cynical and British well
no I I think a lot of us are sort of
slow playing what our notion of I think
so smartphones are mission critical
devices now all right we we depend on
these things we rely on these things
that's why you know tablets are a little
bit of a different market than what we
do with our smart phones and so I think
for general consumers I don't think it's
wrong to expect some bit of caution
right you don't want to take a risk with
that one gadget that's sort of you know
the most important part of your daily
communication lifestyle so I I really
appreciated the fact that you know there
was all this talk about him creating a
new operating system but that the phone
really isn't going to be using the new
operating system he's creating ambient
for other accessories and home devices
and things like that whereas essential
phone is going to be an a stock Android
device so we don't
to go down that rabbit hole of will it
get updates will get support will
developers come forward will it have abs
can I use Google etc etc etc but I did
want to just hit real quick because you
mentioned something about sales and I
thought there was a really insightful
interview you know Andy Rubin sat down
with Walt Mossberg and they had a recode
chat and that was brought up he he was
pretty straightforward
I felt about the notion that they would
need to build from a certain point that
this wasn't just like oh well if this
doesn't outsell an LG g6 in its first
year then it's going to be deemed a
failure but he seems pretty reasonable
about his expectations for how you could
break into this market yeah and I think
it clearly helps when you're Andy Rubin
and people trust you and venture
capitalists are willing to funnel large
numbers into your bank accounts on the
invitation that what you're going to be
making is something that really takes
the pressure off it so clearly yes I
mean any venture capitalists that would
like to send funnel huge amounts of
money into my pocket would would
definitely take some pressures off I
think that I don't think there's any
doubt that this phone is going to work I
think that it probably will feel
incredible I think it's probably going
to perform very well the spec sheet
certainly holds up to that I think it's
an Android device in isolation it's
going to be great I guess if I'm
skeptical at all it's whether how that
then translates to something very right
I saw some discussion of them saying
well you know we don't want it to sell
enormous quantities because if we went
mass-market and mainstream we wouldn't
be able to literally build enough of the
phones to kind of meet that round
there's this kind of idea that it's
going to be a somewhat exclusive device
which is great and also a really good
excuse for not selling very many of them
and there are going to be some people
who will spend a premium for a premium
phone you know look at the ver no you
know they for how many years were they
selling a Symbian device and and selling
just enough of them I guess to to keep
them in fine career alien marbled and
leather and whatever in sapphire lots of
SAP and sapphire beautiful beautiful
sapphire yes then think like my eyes on
the Sun I just I do I do wonder whether
you know what's the long-term play here
I and I'm assuming he has one Lauren
from the verge was saying the other day
that you know he was talking about this
being you know the the beyond mobile
world and then he announced a mobile
device so there's clearly some long game
here which I think the smart home agent
thing will play into as well which is if
anything slightly more interesting than
the phone itself but I'm just I'm very
curious to see what that long game is
now you know because again you you were
saying that this is you know it's a it's
a premium Android device but it's an
Android device and it's not like
anything on this phone is really sort of
rocking the market in terms of the other
experiments we've seen from various
other manufacturers but the the design
of this phone does seem to be just a
little bit polarizing I think
specifically that front facing webcam
the selfie camera sort of interrupting
part of the screen what what did you
think about just like the overall look
the aesthetic and whether or not you
think that's going to have an impact on
sort of consumer appeal because I think
a part of this is like this could very
well fit in the same experiment that
oneplus started way back in the day
there was like a lottery system to even
have the potential to maybe consider the
eventualities of pre-ordering the phone
and it seems like Andy slow playing that
and trying to get as much feedback as
you can before he actually pushes the
button on everyone can buy it now so I
think it's very handsome as phones go I
I think my flight's obsessive-compulsive
disorder would find that cutout for the
camera just incredibly frustrating after
a while I think just that even if it
doesn't block anything I think just the
knowledge of it being there and staring
at me I do wonder whether that is the I
think it shows off the wonderful benefit
of you know being able to cut a display
around the camera but how whether that's
something that people wanted I I don't
know I think you know they've put a lot
of effort into making the material
choices nice to make you know this idea
of it being a device which will last and
I think the modularity plays into that
as well though that obviously is an
unproven area for them to I think yeah
like I say I mean I think the rope
they're not going to struggle to find
people buying it I think they're not
clearly not going to and don't want to
sell as many as Samsung or sell Galaxy
s8 or LG will sell g6
but it's that where does it go from
there
you know what is that what's the
long-term plan after that well in
another white gloss with that do we need
another one plus well you know I feel
like every market benefits from
competition like for example we just
recently kind of revisited the axon 7
right another one of those $400 phones
from 2016 which really helped illustrate
what we could do at you know sort of
smaller price points and that to me is
like a good segue into talking about you
were mentioning the the modularity of
this phone one of the things I felt was
most interesting during that recode
interview was their discussion on this
protocol that it's a wireless usb and
that the pins are basically there to
guide magnetize and power the device but
it's not doing any of the data
transmission and that this is Andy's
first step in trying to illustrate how
we could maybe start I'm putting a lot
of preface in on this and how we could
move to like a truly Wireless smartphone
design and that I thought was really
interesting because you know we just
recently talked about the Moto Z play
you know the new Z play that's coming
out Motorola is doubling down on moto
mods but that's still a very you know
sort of pin pin connector interface
which transfers all of the information
back and forth if he open sources a
wireless USB that works on contact does
that increase the longevity of a device
are we really worried about the hardware
side keeping pace because I feel like
one of the biggest problems with Android
is the software side yeah I don't think
that there is I think there have been an
awful lot of interesting hardware
experiments in Android and we do seem to
just keep coming back to a big slab with
a big touchscreen on one side and a
decent camera on the back and Motorola
obviously has you know is pushing the
motor mods thing which I'm really
pleased that they're doing and sticking
with you know we've seen other people
try it give up on it very quickly
whether or not they launch or not right
high frenzy of lip service to this being
the future of the designs I'm looking at
you LG g5 and Valley anyone who buys all
of these wonderful accessories and
stocks up on the movie with the
expectation that they begin
be able to use them moving forward
generation to generation doesn't get to
and you know it's kind of it's a great
idea but people have very short term
plans I think I think you know if
there's a possibility it's this idea
that he has raised enough money to to
look at that long term and to make a
plan that will last more than just one
generation of sales and not have
shareholders to say well hang on no we
need you to to make something which
makes us a lot of money every quarter
and yeah I think the idea of an
open-source wireless USB standard is
really interesting I just wonder how
does he still have the cachet in the
industry I guess and does this device
that have the kind of be out of the gate
cachet for big companies like Motorola
or LG or whoever to say option yeah this
is something that we could get on board
with - and for all the peripheral device
makers to do that and jump in even
though it's an unproven market and again
I sound very cynical and I do love the
idea I love the idea of modular phones
but from a really geeky perspective from
a consumer perspective I'm kind of not
so convinced and I think there are other
issues there about you know how long do
we expect on mobile devices to last how
long are they built to last the
inclusion of things like sealed
batteries and that kind thoughts that
are disappearing and kind of being
replaced by one do it all poor typing
again yeah it's really interesting as a
geek as someone going out and spending
however many hundreds of dollars on a
phone I don't know if that's something
that I'm convinced that other people
will stand behind long enough no I'm
definitely in agreement there I think
we've all been sort of discussing
ecosystem you know if you're buying into
a platform or if you're buying into a
set of accessories and expectation like
I think the g5 was one of the most
spectacular failures for that idea where
it became very clear about halfway
through that phones first year that this
was likely not going to be an experiment
that LG was going to continue on so you
ended up you know where it's not my
favorite phone but you ended up spending
money on stuff in that phone that is now
end-of-life and you know we see very
clearly from the g6 that their that
their focus has moved on from that
III guess I just find it curious that we
still haven't fully maximized or fully
utilized the benefits of usb-otg on our
mobile devices I love this notion of a
wireless USB 360 degree camera but I've
also recently been playing with USB see
360 degree cameras that this is
universal you know every Android phone I
think running running lollipop on maybe
marshmallow on I can't remember but a
significant chunk of the Android
ecosystem I can plug this directly into
a phone and be instantly streaming 360
degree video and it will move to another
phone and I don't have to worry about
compatibility and so that to me also
becomes one of the biggest questions is
to sort of expand on your idea there's
Andy Rubin has the the cred anymore to
drive a significant chunk of market
towards adopting something that radical
I wonder whether we need it you know I I
can't you know I think I think it's
really interesting I think like you say
you know this idea of being able to plug
in devices into Android phones and
expand them in lots of interesting ways
you know it's been around for a while
and it maybe it hasn't been as elegant
as a magnetically connected wirelessly
SB thing very very secular it is
absolutely rather than cables going
everywhere but I do I wonder whether
it's hard enough finding people who
actually want to carry a 360-degree
camera in their pocket and that's a
standalone thing or something that you
plug in just how Laden down like pack
horses are we going to be you know do we
really need to take everything with us I
think if you could guarantee that when
you went to an office that they would
save you our hot-desking and you could
plug your phone into something and and
it would have your big screen and I
guess that would be interesting again I
just don't know if there's the market
therefore I don't know if this is
something that people people want or
need or have been asking for even I
think it's something that would be
interesting if you're trying to sell
people more accessories but we condense
down all of the things that we were
carrying mp3 player and the camera and
the Filofax and show me you know all of
those things we put into one phone and
now I'm saying
hang on why don't you then try and
expand it out from that again and plug
in more things I don't know if the mass
market certainly wants that I'm not
entirely sure if the geeky market at
which I come to us both once that either
well you know III think there is a
desire for it I I think one of the
biggest issues is the the scenario you
just described there's no infrastructure
for it you know like I look at the
concept of something like Samsung decks
and I think that is stinking cool I
thought it was cool when Microsoft tried
it on the Lumia 950 um using that
continuum but then the notion that I'm
gonna go somewhere and plug my phone
into what to do this work still doesn't
make me happy around the lap dog yeah if
you having to carry around the dock with
you and all of the accessories with you
it you kind of have to ask yourself well
why you know why am i bothering why i
bothering i think i think there is a
really interesting potential play here
in that you know you have situations
kind of in the wider world beyond phones
which apparently exists you know things
like laptop travel bans and people i
have people who travel a lot saying to
me well you know what am i going to do
if I need to go internationally and I
can't take my laptop on the plane or I
had to check it I don't want to check a
bag or am i coming to on my laptop
separately through yeah I'm going to
Amazon Prime myself one overnight to the
hotel in Rome or something and and again
Andy Rubin has the money to do that but
and we most of us don't and I think that
it would be very interesting to see a
forward-facing hotel chain saying well
ok we're going to put a lap you know a
dock for your phone into the hotel room
so that you don't have to worry about
bringing a laptop you just dock your
incredibly powerful smartphone into this
and just like we've been giving you
speakers that will play music you know
now we're going to give you the ability
to turn into a PC and kind of do
whatever you might need to do work on
the road and not have to worry about
bringing a laptop but again like you say
it's that ecosystem and that kind of
harmonization of that ecosystem and you
can't expect people to put in a Samsung
dec stock and also a doctor works at LG
phones and Wi-Fi and it's even funnier
in a climate where like the last
business grade hotel that I stayed in
had a Bose
Aker alarm clock that's not the iPhone
30-pin connector on it
so think about the hotel industry
actually being bleeding edge here I mean
even IKEA had problems trying to move
Wireless desk chargers for her phones it
does seem to be something where I think
the industry needs to drive the consumer
interest to a point where it makes sense
to invest in this stuff but then we have
that chicken and the egg problem of
who's really the early adopter on this
can they now motivate purchases and I
and I really I've been sort of saying
this for a while that I think the the
the leverage that we geeks used to
exercise over the industry is sort of
waning as more of this tech becomes
lifestyle oriented like there's a little
less reason to listen to us for some of
these more out there bleeding edge
discussions until somehow a technology
comes full around where consumers are
the ones motivating the discussions not
those of us at the bleeding edge we were
very powerful for a while and then we
lost our power when it was realized that
other people would buy things and spend
a lot of our money on it and it was
easier to make mass-market devices than
sell to some really really loud
complaining geeks like us so well it got
a little a lot of smaller companies like
we see them go after the enthusiasts and
then a couple years later they're making
five or six different versions of selfie
foam which we need we need more selfie
which people call if people can't see my
face and what's the point I'm upset if I
don't have at least four cameras
pointing at my face with when I have to
use both hands to to operate my dick
this is why this is why I need drones
that's why I'm looking forward to the
you know the first ground that doesn't
need me to ride I want to just be I want
to be followed around and constantly
stared at and potentially put that on
the internet and make some money but
yeah you need to find people with niche
interests for that and yeah so real
quick I just want to put this on
passwords again Jules just an instant
message need to ask it were you
recording on your end the audio yes okay
good okay good so um let's uh all right
let's shift gears I also have you
brought up the the new home device that
Andy Rubin also showed off to
yeah this one so I have been old man
crotchety about the notion of more
listening devices in our homes being
quasi assistance but kind of only good
for a limited set of questions or
commands and then listening to Andy
Rubin describe what essential home was
going to be and how they were trying to
develop partnerships with Google with
Siri with Cortana with Amazon I I'm a
little I'm actually a little more
concerned on this arm of the strategy if
this is the post mobile world I don't
think we're getting to that cool
computer Star Trek future that nerds
like me have always wanted no I think
we're getting to a situation where you
have a chorus of not very intelligent I
can ask for for a poor answer so you get
to decide you know do you do you want to
ask a lexer for a bad answer would you
like to do resistance to confuse you a
little bit or do you want a Siri to
misunderstand you and tell you about the
weather and they race it there are yeah
I think you're absolutely right I think
there's under this umbrella idea of
giving consumers choice it's kind of
ignore the fact that what consumers
actually want is a friendly robot helper
who doesn't need to be trained or
doesn't need to be educated doesn't need
to go away and think about it or have
you know obtained levels of reworking in
the background they just want something
that they can ask a question and get an
answer that isn't nonsensical and yeah
right now none of them can do that
really you know that the rest there are
some things that maybe a lecture is
better at than Google is and it's
serious battle now okay maybe the Google
is better than the lecture is but you
know it's not great it's not it's not
meaningful choice if you just get to
choose between mediocre products in one
game factor so now I sound like a
crotchety old man yeah yeah well but
this is another thing like I feel so
much of what we're being sold as
progress is being built on this notion
of cool which companies have yet to be
able to deliver I mean we just got
another news report recent
need that you know Bixby was going to be
delayed even further
the full Bixby experience was going to
be delayed on Galaxy s8 and so obviously
doing an assistant speech you know
speech interaction type of software
search or software app integration is
very difficult but I still don't think
that we've gone beyond much beyond I can
point my camera at something and then
Amazon can give me a link to buy it or I
can ask what the weather is or I can set
a reminder and these are all things that
we've we've been able to do fairly well
I mean I remember using Vlingo
on blackberries and being able to do
some very similar things a long time ago
and it seems like we keep kind of coming
around the same like well now the the
voice assistant has a higher quality
voice while I'm looking at IBM Watson
commercials and you know IBM Watson is
coming up with recipes for food trucks
and like I would like to eat a recipe
that was designed by an AI system but
Bixby can't even scan the stuff on my
toy shelf back there and give me a
meaningful visual search result I think
I think part of the problem from my
perspective you know and I was you know
we unlike you we try all of these
different home assistants and have
different virtual agents the return I
just don't want to have to ask for it I
want something that's more proactive I
want something which will roam I don't
know maybe which will look at my
calendar and look at or you know where I
am and look at who I've been speaking to
and kind of you know if I'm going to
give over all of this personal
information I want to get something
really really worthwhile back for it I
don't want to have to go and say so well
you know what time is it back home in
the UK you know I wanted to know that
you know if I if I call my parents for
that you know weekly gilt phone call
it's going to tell me it's going to
remind me to do it it's going to it's
going to set the call up it's going to
nudge me to not forget so that you know
when Christmas comes around they they
still love me so I just I feel like
there are lots of things to ask
questions of but I just have no real
motivation to ask those questions
I want something which will say okay
we've got this Gris we're going to go
away we're going to do this in the
background
could all of these wonderful things
whether they be food truck recipes or
ways to make my life more streamlined or
shows or books that I might be
interested in based on what it knows
about me I don't think there's any kind
of shortage of information as I'm
willingly putting out right about what I
like and what I'm interested in what's
important to me I just no one actually
acting on it well and I think a lot of
us can remember that excitement the
first time on an Android phone where I
mean if you had to commute to go to work
and the phone would give you that alert
saying hey you might want to leave five
minutes earlier and we've looked at
traffic in your area but we still
haven't like done anything much more
exciting than that the world of
proactive information dissemination
bizarre yeah I mean I've been say my
example that I've been using and this is
how depressing it is I've been using it
for the past you know six seven years is
that I'm someone who likes coffee I like
I don't mind spending a little bit more
for an independent coffee place rather
than a Starbucks or the P tray whatever
and if I'm walking along somewhere and
my phone knows that there is a highly
rated independent coffee shop around the
corner why isn't it telling me there's a
highly rated independent coffee shop
around the corner Cris you know one
you've got a few minutes and you said yo
why don't you head on over and have an
espresso or something and I mean we've
seen sort of maybe I'm cutting you maybe
HCC assistant which is just kind of top
of my line because it was reviewing the
u11 recently and that kind of you know
starts to say well maybe we could do a
little bit like that and suggest
restaurants when it's lunchtime but it
doesn't seem very personal to me you
know it's not there's nothing saying
well okay this is what Chris likes to do
and here's what his assistant is going
to help him to do I don't know well and
I feel like by the time we get to that
point we're all going to be programmed
to ignore those types of popups like I
can't tell you the number for that
because yeah from all the different
phones that I have to set up every
single time I go to a target and my
phone goes hey this is a great
opportunity for photos and you're like
no it's not it's a target I'm not going
to share photos publicly give me body
things like you know a deodorant at
Target
that's not animating your audience but
but em but ya know I mean and and you're
absolutely right there's this kind of it
gets it wrong and then people don't use
it anymore because it gets it wrong
right and then the flip side of that is
companies are very cautious arousing I
think when the HCC sensor system came
out you know on the you ultra and it a
lot of the time it just didn't give you
any suggestions and people said well HTC
why is this why is this assistant so
quiet we wouldn't pay a human assistant
to be this quiet and they said well you
know we don't want to get it wrong we
don't want to put people off using it in
future because we've given you incorrect
suggestions so I think I guess it's a
tough one because if they give you too
much and it doesn't fit with what you
want it's the target situation you might
won't hang on now I'm not going to let
you look into my calendar because you're
getting me really really bad suggestions
right media where I am because I'm not
getting any value from this and if they
go on the other end and play it safe
then we complain because we don't hear
from the assistant at all so I think
we're in that really really tricky place
where the AI is getting smarter and the
voice assistant sounds better like you
say but what they're actually delivering
to us just hasn't kind of tipped over to
I don't know much more than a book of
coupons well in even then it's a book of
coupons for often for products that I
don't care to use I'm to circle this
back to - Andy Rubin into essential I
got the the the concern that essential
home was starting to sound like my
absolute favorite xkcd comic where it's
someone sitting down and going there are
13 different ways to do this someone
should just come up with one way and
make it the standard and then there's
another panel that says six months later
and two different people are sitting
down saying there are 14 different ways
to tooth if someone should create a new
way to do this it just becomes a
standard but Jules has the copy of it
magalie I've referenced this so many
times Jules you're awesome I wouldn't go
that far
good maybe yeah but but that that was
the fear I was starting to get when Andy
Rubin was describing what their ideal
was for essential home that this was
something that could rise above
all of these other assistants or these
other products interoperability synergy
paradigm buzzword buzzword buzzword and
so you you had mentioned that this was
potentially something that you found I
don't mean to put you on the spot or
make you defensive but something that
you found might have been a more
interesting move that this was the
companion product I guess for releasing
a phone in this in this market and then
getting us out of if we're really going
to achieve the the the post smartphone
world is this the product class that we
should be turning to is this going to
become another thing like smartwatches
you know we kind of peaked on on
wearables as they currently exist in
that you know Bluetooth headsets things
like that what what were your some of
your feelings is to like where this
might go and what this might indicate
for the future of rubens company well I
do feel they put on the spot and
defensive but I'm going to try and work
through no I think that's why it's why I
like you you're a pro yeah I'm crying
inside and I've had a lot of surgery
outside to make it ever look different
them it's literally just the way I'm
standing and I think I think I'm
interested by it because it's not just
another Android phone with a snapdragon
835 and a decent camera and you know
classy construction I don't know if it's
going to be the one that will take us
into this brave new world of a eyes I
kind of doubt it and I think like you
say this idea of it being an umbrella
for lots of other different assistants
when what I really want is just one
really good assistant doesn't bode that
well I guess my interest in it is that I
think that this proactive kind of
collaborative idea of a smart phone not
just being a device I should say this
you know not just being a phone that I
pick out and take on my pocket lookout
when I want something and I put it back
in my pocket and go away this more kind
of persistent
all-embracing kind of that kind of agent
that cookies going through life with us
rather than something that we consult
periodically I find that more
fascinating I don't know if what Andy
Rubin is doing and attention is doing is
going to be the one that will deliver
that but I
the idea of what he's talking about of
it being something why I have to think
less about what question are they going
to ask right well in what question do I
want to ask and how do I need to phrase
that question to get a meaningful
response and how do I keyword that and
how come when I ask a question I can't
put something in quotes I'm just going
to type it okay I mean clearly this is
this is why a lexer is getting a camera
so that we can we can do air quotes at
the same time and she will know what
we're talking about and also to love a
kid well but but also I mean this this
this to me it feels like we keep
reinventing the wheel because I I I
think back to the conversations when um
because my wife works for a video game
video game publisher and when the newest
generation the current generation of
consoles were coming out we had like
some really long conversations about
whether or not we were going to go Xbox
or Playstation and one of the things
that was a major vote against the Xbox
for her was Kinect cameras and
microphones in our home always listening
who has our bucket of data how is it
protected we were going through like
celebrity hacks on on Apple's cloud
storage and and it really shot her down
like know what I I think we're going to
get a Playstation all because she did
not want you know this sort of spy in
our living room was sort of the idea
that she just couldn't shake and I have
problems you know under that same
talking what you're saying the
philosophy of where do we go next from a
momentary interaction which dedicates
all of our visual mental and tactile
attention to operating this thing
blocking out the world around us is
where do we go from there and and if
part of this is the persistent fog of
digital butler's then I feel like the
the response that we get has to be
exceedingly better than the interaction
I can have by typing something quickly
into a search box
I think you're right I think the Butler
mention is interesting because I think
you know it's the parallels there of
pretty clear you know you wouldn't allow
a butler
into your house to kind of help set out
your clothes and dress you in the
morning and serve you if he was
accidentally ripping your shirts and
spilling soup I see all the time so it
comes down to value you know am I
getting enough out of whatever this
virtual Butler is for me to be okay with
this idea of interesting some big
company or a small company whoever gets
it right - with all of my personal data
and the knowledge of where I am and what
I'm doing and who I'm talking to and
what I'm wearing well and also is there
also a notion of trying to make this
interaction just more intimate the thing
I was really hoping to see from Samsung
especially following their Bigsby
announcement and from other companies -
I mean we've been flirting with the
wireless earbuds um of getting to
something kind of like yeah I'm in that
like the movie her you know just to kind
of harp on something that I think geeks
really enjoyed the depiction of that
kind of interface where if I'm gonna
have conversations or ask questions or
get relevant information through some
sort of audio interface I'm kind of
surprised that the main focus has been
on a home speaker which stays in one
room that I then have to I mean I live
in a two-story condo so do I keep the
Google home in my office where I spend a
good chunk of my day or do I put it
downstairs where you know my daughter is
constantly babbling and you know running
around to show you a little toddler by
4:00 with the both three of the little
like where do these things live and then
also if I'm going to use other features
to like music streaming or media
consumption podcasting things like that
my phone follows me throughout my day
even in my home but that's something my
Google home can't do without like you
were saying without having a network of
these speaker things kind of always all
around me
and I kind of see the being a
differentiation there between what would
be an incredibly personal device like
like a here kind of hair even to this
idea that this whispering technical
friend in our in Aria who kind of just
gives us little hints and keeps us going
through the day and makes our lives more
productive and rewarding or whatever and
this idea of a home that would be a
component of that experience almost like
you know you would you have your
chauffeur during the day and then you
get home and you hand it over to the
butler and the responsibilities for
looking after you and your family or
whoever you live with kind of are shared
between the different devices and it
picks and chooses the the most
appropriate way of communicating that
data with you depending on what that
data is you know there are some things
that I I don't mind being shouted out
you know it's in the you know in the
middle of dinner you know through a home
speaker and there are going to be other
things which I would just like to have
carefully whispered into my ear so that
you know it doesn't distract other
people other people down here or you
know this is just there's different
layers of privacy and kind of
involvement there and so I think there
is a place for both but I think the
experience on either front is it's not
there yet but I the people I hear saying
that they love products like Google
Amazon echo and Google home and that
kind of thing most are people with
families with children and the kids love
to talk to them and I don't have
children I don't really believe in them
but I guess that that is a good I mean
you know I mean when you say you don't
believe in them I mean you acknowledge
as they exist it's just you don't I'm
not even sure I'd go that far beyond
experience but I mean I have seen
smaller people and well it could be tiny
Apple to the distance that's if you if
you ever if you ever need you know just
that little extra bit of evidence you
come and come and visit and when my
daughter gets home from daycare she will
inflate and infect you with the plague
because that's what toddlers do and you
will have a better understanding of the
existence of of these tiny little
individuals so yeah that's so I mean
it's it could just be an adult a lot
further away I don't think but I think I
think that you know that's a really and
just as an interesting niche were you
know the
some words of people are finding that
yes you know young people do enjoy just
talking something and having answers
parroted back by something that doesn't
get bored if they ask the same question
over and over again
and if you run these cases there but at
the same time I don't necessarily want
that device to and that young person to
also be able to accidentally order
things or check my work calendar or put
daddy must go to the park for three
hours on my module tomorrow so you know
there is it comes back a guess to these
different layers of what I expect
different devices that I interact with
on a daily basis to do and to know about
me and what kind of intrusiveness levels
that I'm willing to put it with yeah and
that's definitely been another
conversation we've been having a lot in
our home too where I think my my less
than two year old daughter's idea of
what technology is she understands
cameras so she likes seeing people take
pictures and she likes seeing pictures
of herself and then she also understands
video calls so so whenever we pull out
like my laptop she'll come running over
and say nonny nonny because she wants to
call my mom she wants to talk to Grandma
so you know we're trying very hard not
to let this just be like hey here's
where you can watch Sesame Street and
just sit and consume and you know you
know just be of a lazy
slub it's communication and she's
starting you know as much as a toddler
can because you know she's starting to
figure out crayons and cameras and all
this stuff is creation like she can she
can make things in a very rudimentary
sense so I like we're trying to figure
than this Delta isn't good I mean
because that seems again I don't know
huge amount about children but I feel
like you're supposed to just praise them
no matter what they do and much higher
voltages um yeah well you know she's
she's my daughter and I love her like
crazy but um you know I'm not that
parent who's going to try and trick
people into thinking that this is some
new exciting modern art look it's a lost
Basquiat you could make a lot of money
for that with like a ninny cently
sold for like a hundred million dollars
or something like that and you look at
you go do that yeah I like hey we've got
College some kind of paid for excellent
[Laughter]
well Chris I really want to thank you
for for for jumping and I've kept you a
little bit longer than I think we meant
to but it was a great conversation I
really appreciate you taking the time to
help us unpack some of this info this is
this is all really um is a robe like
really curious but I just think there's
there's the notion of competition which
is really exciting here too and from
someone who has such a celebrated
history you know from working with Carl
Zeiss to Apple to creating danger to
inventing Android before Google bought
it out that if anyone deserves some bit
of coverage then it's definitely Andy
Rubin I know a lot of us are having some
some of those like hesitation first
generation this is something early we
don't we want to keep our expectations
in check but I am you know I'd live I'd
be lying if I said I weren't a little
sort of giddy to try something that this
guy does I think if anyone can do it
it's probably going to be him so I guess
no pressure Andy but everything
literally everything the future of
innovation in the smartphone space is
resting on your shoulders so and beedis
it up yeah you know just it's cool but
yeah but you know the week ever ever
think about it take it take a day have a
bit of you today I thought some coffee
