pocket now calm we just gave you a tour
of Internet Explorer on Windows Phone 7
series through the emulator well we
found some other things that we want to
talk about starting actually going back
into internet explorer we're going to
show you how screen rotations work so
I'm going to tap the screen rotation
button here to go into landscape you can
see the really cool screen animation
that they created for windows phone 7
series and that goes to the other
direction or the other orientation in
landscape something else I want to show
you is how the application bar expands
when you're in landscape because in
portrait let me try to get back in a
portrait here we go in portrait quite
simply you tap on those three dots and
you get all the other information the
more extended menu commands but in
landscape how does that work well quite
simply the way it works is that they
just take up the left side of the screen
so that's very simple very easy it makes
a lot of sense how they did this so
let's go back to the home screen you're
going to see that you can't have the
home screen I should call it a start
screen in the horizontal orientation so
we're going to go back to the vertical
portrait orientation so that we can see
it the right way now a few things to
note here we can swipe to the right to
get our full application list this isn't
the full emulator so you don't get
everything another way that you can get
the full application list it's by
tapping on this right-facing arrow now
Microsoft isn't sure if they're keeping
this visual design for the full
application list they may have it in a
grid or in some other sort of way but
right now it's just a standard list so
let's go into settings there are a few
things that we can change in here we've
been really hoping to see the settings
of Windows Phone 7 series and really
it's very very simple it brings through
that Metro interface so we can swipe to
the right and right now we can only
access a couple of settings because
again this isn't the full emulator so we
can change the color scheme which is
pretty cool so we can change the
background color to be either light and
this will work well for a backlit LED
screen or dark which would work better
for an AMOLED screen we can also change
the accent color I'm going to go back to
light for the rest of this demonstration
when change the accent color to those
four different
colors that we've seen in screenshots of
Windows Phone 7 series so let's go to
say green and you can see the accent
color change there and if I go back to
the home screen the color surrounding
this icon here is green so let's go back
to the settings menu and go back in here
and again we can change it several
different times in different colors and
now it's blue I think I like that better
back to the start screen and yep there's
blue that's kind of what we've seen is
the default let's go back into settings
one more time and see the other things
that we can change here we can change
the regional settings and this screen is
obviously not complete it's very ugly
right now and we can't do anything
except swipe up and swipe down we can
change the language only to English
right now we can change the region to a
variety of different places we can go to
the left here again and change the date
format very nice-looking interface super
simple super clean we can change the
first day of the weeks for your calendar
settings it's interesting that the
calendar settings are sort of outside of
the calendar and in the main device
settings we'll probably see a lot more
of that and of course we can change the
browser language and some other things
let's go back one more here and we can
change the date and the time some very
simple toggle switches here and again
he's probably aren't final because
they're super ugly and I think we got
everything there and again swiping to
the right you don't get anything for
applications so that was just a quick
look at some other things that we found
on the Windows Phone 7 series emulator
again keep it to pocket now calm for the
latest in Windows Phone 7 series videos
