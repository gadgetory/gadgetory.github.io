impressive budget smartphones we've ever
seen and last week Maral announced a
brand new Moto G the Moto G so which is
the better phone and how do they compare
I'm sailor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is the new Moto G versus the old
moto G
ask your motorola blindsided us all by
creating an entry-level smartphone that
was not only surprisingly great but also
extremely affordable we'd seen this done
before on other platforms like Windows
Phone with the Lumia 520 but very few
Android smartphones before the Moto G
were both affordable and worth buying
last week Motorola upgraded the Moto G
with newer hardware while keeping the
same low price what's new what's
different and most importantly what's
better let's find out at a glance it's
possible to mistake the 1st and 2nd
generation Moto G's for one another
you're close to the same size have all
the same button import placements and
even have the same camera layout with a
much love dimple around back but there
are two major hardware differences that
are a dead giveaway one the speaker's
the new Moto G has front firing audio
while last year's does not it emits
sound out of its single rear speaker
which flanks the image sensor to
physical footprint yes the two are
relatively close in size but the Moto G
is noticeably bigger it's eleven point
six millimeters taller 4.8 millimeters
wider and weighs six grams more but it's
0.6 millimeters thinner most of the
differences between these two phones are
under the hood and even those are slight
both come with one gigabyte of RAM 8 or
16 gigabytes of fixed storage a
Snapdragon 400 SOC and the same 20 70
milliamp hour battery the only
differences are the cameras from 5 to 8
megapixels on the back and 1.3 to 2
megapixels upfront a micro SD card slot
on the new Moto G and the display the
old Moto G came with a 4.5 inch 720p IPS
LCD the new Moto G's display is 0.5
inches larger diagonally with the same
resolution the old Moto G's display may
be a hair brighter more vibrant and more
balanced and it's marginally more crisp
but they both look great for the price
both also come with a swath of
interchangeable back covers if you felt
the original Moto G was too small the
new one is exactly what you need it's
sort of the same story with software as
well the original Moto G was quickly
updated to KitKat after its launch now
it's running Android 4.4.3
the new Moto G ships with Android 4.4.4
and the differences are marginal at best
the launcher on the new Moto G looks a
lot like the Google now launcher sans
Google now integration the o Moto G
still runs a legacy launcher
the differences you'll notice are the
shortcuts to the app drawer and how the
app doors look the opener G has a solid
black background and the legacy tab for
widgets the new Moto G's background is
translucent and to add widgets you'll
need to long press on a blank space on
the home screen other than that the
software is practically identical even
including Motorola's add-ons like moto
assist or migrate as you would expect
performance is almost identical as well
opening apps task-switching scrolling
zooming and the like all happen at
virtually the same time after all with
the exception of size and a few odds and
ends
these are practically the same phones
likewise benchmark scores are almost
identical these phones are by no means
powerhouses they aren't meant to be
their budget phones and they perform
accordingly you can play some games
without a problem but you can also push
them to their limits quite easily
especially with just one gigabyte of RAM
what isn't clear is how much the
additional screen real estate will
affect battery life we haven't had the
new Moto G long enough to attest to its
stamina but before we were moderately
pleased with the stamina on the original
Moto G we have a feeling the display
might cut some time off the battery life
but for the full take on performance and
battery life you'll have to check out
the full review of the new Moto G in the
coming weeks call quality and networks
peaks will be roughly the same as well
considering they have the same radio
support though the u.s. model the new
Moto G has support for the 900 band on
HSDPA one of the most welcomed overall
improvements is the camera don't get us
wrong you can't expect too much out of
this sub $200 phone but it is a market
improvement over the original in our
short testing it's more reliable and
consistent its pictures appear more true
to life it has higher dynamic range out
of the box it isn't as quick to
overexpose and it has a wider field of
view the old moto G's picture seemed
cold and Stark the newer Moto G has more
resolution to work with and manages to
take pretty impressive photos by
comparison unless we forget those dual
front-facing speakers on the new model
don't get too jazzed about them yeah
we're happy that their front firing and
that makes some difference but they're
not all that much better than the single
speaker on the old model they're not
much louder but the sound is definitely
more full and doesn't distort as much at
full volume and best of all you can
change the launch phrase to anything you
want
hello computer and best of all you can
change the launch phrase to anything you
want hello computer it's nice to have
two speakers blasting sounds straight at
your face but this is no boom sound
folks that's for sure
frankly we were really impressed with
the original moto G it was a killer deal
for a phone that wasn't half bad for
anyone looking to not break the bank for
a no-contract smartphone the Moto G was
the obvious choice but now with the new
Moto G were only more certain of that
recommendation
it's bigger has a better camera
expandable storage and newer software
the build feels more premium and the
phone looks nicer and has front firing
audio if you are pleased with the
original and are looking to upgrade to
something new the Moto G is a fantastic
Buy once more but even if you feel the
newer Moto G is a little too large you
can probably still find an older Moto G
for a killer price so keep your eyes out
for that as well
