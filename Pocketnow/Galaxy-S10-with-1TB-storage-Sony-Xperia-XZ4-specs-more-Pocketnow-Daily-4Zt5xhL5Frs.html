terabyte storage ship at the same time
that is started producing the Galaxy S
10 what a coincidence
the specs of the Sony Xperia XE forward
just leaked and it sounds a very
compelling device and Facebook was using
one of their apps to research your
personal data and breaching many
guidelines one more time I'm Jaime
Rivera and I think that this is probably
the last drop to get me to cancel my
Facebook I mean like man this is daily
the official news today began with
Apple's quarter results which were
definitely not good for Cupertino
revenue is down five percent but at an
interesting time when iPads finally grew
one more time 17% even the Mac was up
nine percent we have to remember that
these are small chunks of apples
business the big one is the iPhone which
is down 15% and Cupertino didn't tell us
how many units they sold all they said
was that there were 900 million iPhones
active like if that's an indication of
any sort of success now let's talk about
the feature of Android those of you that
thought that feature was gonna take over
this year it seems that it's gonna take
a little longer as we've got already
some firmware leak information that
confirms the next version of Android is
going to be called Android 10 and
obviously the letter designator is going
to be q what kind of pastry are they
gonna name after that is the biggest
question let us know what you think in
the comments now let's talk about
Facebook and probably another one of the
worst practices of this company this
company was paying $10 a month to
teenagers ages 13 and up for them to be
willing to install an app called
Facebook research that would pretty much
provide Facebook everything from private
messaging to photography um I know it I
get it there was consent in Facebook was
paying I don't know if there was consent
from parents obviously this was just
recently discovered and it was
discovered by Apple because they've
figured out that they were violating
their guidelines by using install
profiles to be able to give Facebook
access to what their iPhones were
pulling it's just it's crazy let us know
what you think in the comments cuz
really I I want to cancel Facebook's so
badly now let's talk about the sony
xperia x z4 as
we finally get some leagues on
specifications and it seems that this
phone is going to be no previous year
smartphone it seems that the screen is
growing larger we're finally getting six
gigs of RAM a larger than a four
thousand milliamp hour battery Qualcomm
Snapdragon in 55 and everything and
apparently we might be able to see it at
MWC which I hope happens we'll keep you
posted
and finally the hottest news today
happened from Samsung as well we heard
today that production of the galaxy s 10
had begun and on the other end we hear
that Samsung is announcing their new one
terabyte chip for mobile phones so we
heard some crazy price tags for the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 and we now wonder if
this has to do with both is it that
we're getting a one terabyte Samsung
Galaxy S 10 as an option and today's
question let us know I mean would you be
willing to pay for one terabyte spark
phone because in my case not necessarily
for a phone I probably do it for a
tablet or a computer I mean I had my
computers with terabytes but my god like
or what would you be willing to pay if
anything cuz again for me it's just too
much money but the thing is it's hard to
I don't think there is an SD card that
has a micro SD card that supports one
terabyte so leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on pocket note on
descriptive of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one
and follow me on twitter hi man just
gotta get on instagram at high metal
data please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm high
memory that I thanks so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
