twenty point seven megapixel camera
which is the largest to date on an
Android phone and we had the Samsung
Galaxy s4 one of the best selling phones
Samsung has ever made how do they
compare let's check it out in this
comparison right now waterproof
dustproof and the largest camera sensor
on an Android phone
aside from powerhouse specs that's what
the Sony 2013 flagship is the Xperia z1
it's a natural evolution for the Xperia
Z earlier this year and it has a lot of
bragging rights at least on paper to
make it one of the most desirable phones
out there running Android the galaxy s4
needs no introduction it is among the
best selling phones out there at the
moment despite the fact that it's rather
old in tech years we've seen at age
pretty well in our latest episode of
after the buzz the Galaxy s4 is still a
phone with recommend to anyone simply
but it's Samsung's best phone yet yes we
know about the note 3 but at the time of
this recording the note 3 is not
available yet so it's just feared as we
kick off our Xperia Z comparison series
with the galaxy s4 face off and we're
looking at hardware software and user
experience as well as the camera build
materials and quality is something where
these two phones couldn't be any more
different
while the Sony Xperia z1 is built
completely out of aluminium and glass
the Samsung Galaxy s4 continues the
company's tradition in terms of design
as well as hyper glazed plastic which
some of you love others loath we are
just tired of it
glass versus plastic is not the only
differentiator when it comes to the
hardware of the two the Xperia z1 is
also waterproof and dustproof something
which the Galaxy s4 is not but the
Galaxy s4 active is still the z1 is
better than even the s4 active with its
IP 57 and IP 58 ratings which allows
submersion beyond 1.5 meters an aluminum
and glass construction has its downsides
though we're pretty sure the z1 wouldn't
survive a healthy drop something which
won't destroy the s4 also the Sony phone
is 40 grams heavier than the Samsung at
170 grams it is also significantly
larger despite the same screen size at
144 millimeter
versus one 36.6 another category in
which the xperia z1 wins though we're
sure Sony wouldn't want to brag about
this is the bezels as you can see
they're quite thick especially on the
top and the bottom if you look under the
hood these do you have rather similar
specs the Xperia z1 is powered by two
points you gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor the galaxy s4
already has a variety are by the same
CPU but additional flavors are available
at one point on you hurts in the case of
the Snapdragon 600 and the Exynos 5 octa
flavor dual quad core which is this unit
we are using right here ram is a tie at
2 gigabytes on both devices but the
internal storage battle goes to Samsung
for having 16 32 and 64 gigabyte options
all expandable via microSD in contrast
to the Xperia z1 16 gigabyte put
expansion options both screens are 5
inch panels at Full HD 1920 by 1080
resolution and a PPI rating of 441 the
difference is still fundamental when
comparing screen technology Super AMOLED
on the s4 vs. TFT on the z1 sadly deep
blacks and vibrant colors are not the
only difference between the screens and
these two the s4 has an exceptional side
viewing angle something which is
severely lacking on the z1 no it's not a
feature furthermore if you don't look at
the z1 screen that centre you will start
seeing colors wash off and they're not
really that vibrant to start with the s4
is the clear winner here though the z1
offers somewhat better outdoor
visibility the 20.7 megapixel stabilized
camera and the z1 Trump's the 13
megapixel shooter on the s4 at least on
paper and at least when comparing raw
numbers we'll see how they actually
compare later in this video
the 3000 milliamp hour battery under z1
perform slightly better than the 2600
milliamp hour unit on the s4 Samsung's
unit being accessible while Sony needed
to keep things tied up for its water and
dust breathing construction Android
4.2.2 jelly bean operates on both of
these devices and both platforms have
their custom user interfaces on top of
them we'd say the playground is level
but still there are many differences
talking about these as we are now
looking at software and user experience
we can tell you this much
neither of the two is inferior which is
just normal we have thankfully reached a
moment in time when both hardware
high-end devices that they are real
powerhouses and software deliver fluid
snappy performance there is no real need
to compare app launch time side-by-side
but we did it anyways and found out that
while both are extremely snappy they go
back and forth sometimes a z1 sometimes
the s4 is faster a hair faster which is
negligible anyways there is a
fundamental difference though between
these two phones while Samsung back all
the features you ever want to use and
some more which you'll probably never
use in the Galaxy s4 like airView air
gesture smart stay smart scroll smart
pause as health and so on the Xperia z1
has none of those so if you're a fan of
all the features on the s4 you've
probably made your decision by now the
Xperia z1 has small apps functionality
though meaning there are a couple of
applications and widgets which you can
float on top of others browser
calculator calendar notes recorder and a
few others that aside it's your typical
Android phone without the bells and
whistles for an in-depth look at the
galaxy s4 features make sure to check
out our dedicated tour of everything
present on the device Sony on the other
hand has loaded the z1 much like Samsung
did with TouchWiz will its own custom UI
within that you can choose a theme among
the existing eight which will not only
change the wallpapers but it will also
affect the overall accent of the phone
if your household has several Sony
products it will be very easy for you to
mirror the screen of the z1 the keyboard
is also something you can customize to
your own liking
including the layout as well as the
theme the album application has Picasa
Flickr Facebook and Sony PlayMemories
integration while the Walkman
application will handle all your
streaming and local music playback needs
if you want to tweak your photos there's
an Autodesk application pre-installed
called Pixlr Express which you can use
to fan safai or awesome eyes your stills
and talking about Stills let's take a
look at camera performance will play the
samples for human the background while
will tell you that choosing between the
two is tricky they both have their
strong and weak points they're not bad
shooters we need to tell you that
straight from the
the Xperia z1 has better low-light
sensitivity but it just so happens that
it also introduces much more noise and
images than the s4 not all the time just
at times when the lighting is not
perfect and that's what we're interested
in one thing to note here before we
proceed we noticed on our z1 that the
far right of every image tends to be
washed out this might be specific to our
particular review unit or it might be
model specific issue details tend to
wash out in the far right order of the
image under certain scenarios which will
try to reproduce in time for our full
review that being said colors are
different in the output images the z1
generates cooler tones the s4 is warmer
needless to say they're both wrong with
reality probably being an average of the
two in bright sunny outdoors they both
deliver good results with yes for
producing slightly sharper images take
away from the light and the z1 will
start to Trump the s4 at the expense of
detail its low-light images look like
old paintings with any fine detail and
sharpness missing go indoors and kill
the flash and you'll have to live with a
lot of noise sometimes even with the
flash on in terms of video the z1 is
focusing faster than the s4 of course
the color tones are different like in
the case of pictures and the z1
stabilized camera really helps while
shooting video however the output of the
s4 is somewhat sharper but let's play
the two samples so you can judge for
yourself hi everyone this is Tony from
pocket now and we are here in Oradea
city and our usual park trying to
capture the differences between the
camera capabilities of the Sony Xperia
z1 and we're comparing it today with the
Samsung Galaxy s4
it is a bright sunny day I'm really
curious to see how these two fare
against each other because on the screen
of these devices there is a huge
difference and now we're going to go
against the Sun just to see how they
cope with everything let's move in for a
close-up on the leaves here
now the focus is on we'll just stay here
for a second and see how they cope and
then pan around back that's moving for
another close-up this flower here stay
there just for autofocus to do its thing
and then of course circle back thank you
very much for watching this was Anton
from pocket now stay tuned for a lot
more on the Sony Xperia z1 hey everyone
this is Tony from pocket now and we are
here in hora de city in our usual park
trying to capture the differences
between the camera capabilities of the
Sony Xperia z1 and we're comparing it
today with the Samsung Galaxy s4
it is a bright sunny day I'm really
curious to see how these two fare
against each other because on the screen
of these devices there is a huge
difference now we're going to go against
the Sun just to see how they cope with
everything when it's moving for a
close-up on the leaves here autofocus is
on we'll just stay here for a second and
see how they cope and then pan around
back let's move in for another close-up
this flower here
think they're just for autofocus to do
its thing and then of course circle back
thank you very much for watching this
was anton from pocket now stay tuned for
a lot more on the sony xperia z1 at the
end of the day we're looking at a one
two week old phone compared to a six
month old device even if a flagship then
however does not translate into palpable
differences which one of the two should
you choose if you're often finding
yourself in places where a water and
dustproof phone is what you need Lissie
one is for you the s4 has a lot of
features sometimes more than what you
even consider using if that's your cup
of tea the s4 is for you is the z1
better in terms of specs yes on paper no
in day-to-day usage is the camera on
does he want better on paper yes not in
your everyday scenario unless you often
shoot your subjects in close to zero
lighting that's when you'll have to go
with the z1 but settle for no details
and painting like output do materials
matter it's glass versus plastic so
you'll be the judge of it we're looking
at two of the top five Android devices
of the moment and any one of these will
not make you regret your investment

been the Sony Xperia z1 vs samsung
