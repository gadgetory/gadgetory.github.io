the spy I'd like to take advantage of
that - is that Batman on your t-shirt
I'm not the one wearing hockey pants
this show isn't all about rumors it's
about high metal Iveta saying his name
three times you want to get a fourth one
that's right it's that time of the week
I am High Metairie that of this is
PocketNow and this is the pocket now
daily recap your comments for last week
so because we didn't do a video on
Monday and Tuesday here's the clip of a
cat to keep you entertained while we
jump to Wednesday and the sounded very
jerry-rigged everything
and yes the topic of that particular
Wednesday was I was twelve point one
point two I recommend that you don't
update I actually haven't done so on my
phone um I asked you I mean what do you
think have you been having issues
because this was apples way to avoid
legal battles with Qualcomm we had seven
hundred sixty-two comments Apple
disappoints me more and more than I do
my parents when they ask about college
please say dude
yes facing the same issues with iOS
twelve point one point two on my iPhone
s II the Wi-Fi is not getting connected
automatically you have to go to settings
and have to do it and sometimes
automatic Wi-Fi is getting disconnected
again I haven't experienced it thank you
for sharing definitely I don't know what
Apple plans to do like right now
everything is raining against them yes
my iPhone 10 Wi-Fi signal is weak
getting slower internet access LTE feels
like 3G and battery drains faster I
regret enough updating Apple I
understand your issues going for the
love of God say control your quality
management this is what happens when you
rush and I think I read it correctly I
think I did but the thing is I don't
think this was a rush thing I think this
was I mean why not just pay the
royalties which is the reason why
they're getting sued of their using
another company's technology and then on
Thursday we got a little political we
talked about the whole Trump probably
banning Huawei and ZTE devices as a
national emergency thingy
we had 795 comments as I asked you what
do you think about all this I still have
in China so I know a bit about how they
handle privacy and monitoring of people
I think the US government is making a
smart choice I wouldn't trust Chinese
electronic equipment you know the
problem is dude that so many products
get made in China lately I don't even
know who to trust now but I get your
point definitely Wow Trump's banning
Chinese phones while most phones are
made in China even Apple lmao exactly
exactly that's the thing I mean who can
we really trust here would anyone be
able to afford a phone made in the
United States phone prices could triple
that is also a really good question I
mean what exactly would happen to the
industry of something like this happened
I think they would probably start
actually costing what Apple is charging
for an iPhone
and then finally on Friday the topic was
uh I think it's time a flight or flight
something a Sony technology being built
that Apple is going to use that's gonna
help but produce better 3d sensing for
its primary camera and also improved
face ID I asked you how much actually do
you use AR we have 350 comments AR is
going to be big on navigation
application you know that would be
actually awesome but it would also be
awesome if we had heads-up displays that
didn't require us to lift our phones
particularly when driving a vehicle for
example a R equals gimmick it's
something most of us can live without
true that we can't live without it but I
gotta admit I use it a lot whenever I
buy furniture from Ikea it's useful so
it's great to have I use a art to
measure things all the time but probably
in ways Apple didn't mean for it to be
used Oh interesting how about a view
provides some insight on that in the
comments dude that's it for the market
now a daily recap thank you so much for
watching if you want your comments to be
featured keep them short stick to the
point and try to get something thumbs up
it also spot them a lot easier you'd
also follow us on social media
