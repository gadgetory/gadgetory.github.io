names for their upcoming foldable
smartphones if your Galaxy Note 9s
camera is freezing don't worry there's a
fix coming soon and we get some new
screen protectors leaked for the nearly
bezel this Galaxy S 10 I'm high emitter
Yvette our happy Thanksgiving everyone I
am thankful for I'm thankful for my
amazing editor who happens to be my son
of course wrote this portion of the
script but it's so true this is fog it
out daily sponsored by swap the official
news today begin with deals up you know
Black Friday by the time you watch this
video is gonna be crazy
meaning that definitely I mean Google's
got deals a t-mobile Metro by t-mobile
including t-mobile we've got Samsung
also listing a ton of things Best Buy's
got a crazy listing as well Apple is
going to announce them pretty much on
Black Friday so we can't give you the
skinny right now anyways I know it's
gonna be crazy stay safe out there it's
not the end of the world but I know
you're gonna probably get some really
good deals now let's talk about
Instagram as well
it's the only property that Facebook
hadn't really killed or I don't know
turned into trash but apparently there's
their plans for that to happen the
company has just sees that there's a new
user interface obviously the company's
co-ceos of both left so I'm really
already skeptical I hate hate the
Facebook user interface so uh I'm hoping
according to them they want to Instagram
to feel closer I don't know I I'm not
saying that I'm reluctant to change I
just I know that Facebook is Facebook's
approach is not the answer sadly now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10
or at least one of the variants as there
are suddenly cases and you know once
case makers grab their hands on
something we I'm not saying we should
trust it but we notice that there are
very little bezels on this display there
is a small little cutout for the ears
piece yes definitely there seems to be a
minor chin point being is one of these
galaxies is going to have pretty much no
bezels we're hoping it's across the
board now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 you know
I thought that I was the only guy that
was having issues with my note 9 where
it froze as I was taking a photo or
making an Instagram story recording a
video and that's ever since I got the
unit but apparently that's becoming a
common thing for everyone and apparently
it's a thing more for the snapdragon
very anthem for the Exynos if you're
having these issues apparently Samsung
is working on a fix I'm glad it's only
taking them a few months to notice that
that's a problem even if I pointed at I
pointed it out in my weekend video with
the no 9 I'm like I don't want to do the
review yet because mine is buggy but ok
now I realize I'm not alone and finally
the hot news today I have to do with the
weirdest names you could ever trademark
for a foldable product made F is
understandable mate flicks is OK alright
I get it
made flexi uh these are the trademarks
that Huawei has just submitted for their
upcoming foldable product which is
apparently going to launch close to
whenever we get the Samsung Galaxy F
which is also rumored to be called the
Samsung Galaxy flex or like I don't know
tell me something in the comments I mean
do you really think that we should call
this thing flex uh can't we come up with
like folio or I don't know notepad or
things that fold there I get it there
skeuomorphic but the point being is do
we really need to call it flex because
it's biggest attribute is not
necessarily it it's gonna flex with the
fact that you're gonna be able to use it
in a more natural way because it does
leave us a comment down below we'd love

sponsor swapper for making this video
