the hardware is capable of galaxy s7 FCC
certification documents reveal some
major battery improvements and some new
deals in to the hardware that's coming
for a refresh I'm hi I'm Adam iveta and
boy did I picked the perfect time to
come to this winter wonderland this is
pocket out daily the official lists
today begin with deals and we will start
trying to make it about deals as much as
possible and with the Refresh of devices
that it's coming a lot of devices are
going to be on discount right now sorry
with HTC forty percent off for the next
season nine and you actually even get a
free keyboard for Valentine's Day which
is awesome but if you're also in the
market for a g4 and I would highly
recommend the g for three hundred and
thirty bucks on ebay link to the
description for more details now this is
rather interesting even though you'll
usually see Johnny I've talked about the
amazing design of the iphone and the
fact that you will only need that when
you buy your phone well it seems that
the company has now come in you know
partnership with belkin if you want to
buy a screen protector for your iphone
there's actually this really cool
machine that'll do it for you if you buy
that screen protector at the apple store
we're not exactly sure what the price
tag is we do expect some very neat apple
tax to be included but hey you want a
screen protector it's probably the best
way to go let's move this folly over to
samsung one of the things we complained
about a lot with the galaxy s6 with its
battery life and it seems that the
company wants to do something about it
FCC documentation shows that the galaxy
s7 is getting a 3,000 milliamp hour
battery which is a major boost and then
in the case of the edge variant which is
a little larger 3,600 milliamp hours now
let's just hope that the processor and
the software do the rest of their job
right and speaking of samsung for those
of you that are bored of the fact that
the Galaxy Note hasn't really changed in
form factor in years and the a lot of
people don't care about the s-pen
samsang apparently wants to do something
about it with a galaxy note 6 at least
we see a new pen filing where the S Pen
is now being used as a kickstand as well
and even though the last time I remember
a kickstand on a phone had had an HTC
brand on it it was really a long time
ago would it be cool if we got that let
us know in the comments down below
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the LG g5 the company
continues to tease what to expect with
the hardware and LG wants to go all out
the company is teasing and always on
mode with a display and even though many
of you could say that you probably don't
care about this the cool thing is that
well we've usually been used to IPS LCD
has not really been able to do this so
it could be that we're getting a move to
peel that which would be amazing or it
seems that the quantum dot display just
got a lot better whatever the case may
be it would be great for this to be a
feature of the g5 it's being part of the
teasers but we'd love to know in the
comments down below for the question of
today do you care about always on this
plays with your phones in my case I
don't mind them I love to see them but I
definitely want them on a SmartWatch but
yeah on a smartphone why not leave us a
