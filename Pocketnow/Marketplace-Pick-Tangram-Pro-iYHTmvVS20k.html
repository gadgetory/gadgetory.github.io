packing.com and today I'm going to show
you one of the oldest games probably
known to man and this is tangram pro of
course this is a new version on the
windows mobile device but this game has
been around for over 3,000 years and
this particular version of it called
tangram pro like i said is on windows
mobile marketplace and it has over 200
different puzzles so i can go through
here real quick and you can see we have
many different puzzles i think there's
like 219 or something like that so if i
want to solve one of these tangrams or
attempt to solve them all I've do is
click on one of these images let's see
we'll try this looks like a duck flying
okay so now i have my pieces down here
on the bottom there are seven pieces to
the tangram game and all you have to do
is move them up and if i want to move
them around all i have to do i can
rotate them either clockwise or
counterclockwise i can also change the
position so i can flip them and that
will flip them over as you see i can eat
you chain what use these arrows to flip
them back and forth and now all i have
to do is line up my tan grande pieces so
let's see it looks like that one might
go there who knows let's try this piece
okay so let's say we've played for a
while but we are still stuck so all i
have to do is go down here and solve and
it's going to ask me are you sure you
really want to solve this tangram and
i'm going to say yes and now I have the
solution to the puzzle the cool thing
about this though is I can go cancel and
now if I want to attempt it again later
I can just go back and all the pieces
are of course are not on the tangram
anymore so we can go cancel again
another cool feature of this game is
that we can actually change the skin as
you see I have a wooden pattern in the
background and go down here to menu and
then skin and I can change two marble
metal plastic or stone so it gives you a
little bit of variety if you like to
play on different surfaces
so this is another marketplace pick and
the prayer is called tangram pro and
it's only 99 cents on windows mobile
marketplace which in my opinion is quite
the steal because you get countless
hours of gameplay thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
