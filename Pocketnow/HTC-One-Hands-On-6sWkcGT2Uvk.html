pocketnow.com here at the HTC launch
event for the HTC one previously known
as the m7 this is the hotness this is
what we've been waiting for we're gonna
take a look at the hardware the software
right now so let's check it out so let's
start off with the hardware this is an
all aluminum foam which is pretty
amazing because all the other phones out
there that have aluminum have plastic
parts because the antenna reception
needs to come through but HTC has found
a way to have an entirely aluminum phone
and it's extremely than four millimeters
at the edge like the Droid DNA gets
thicker so it's kind of an illusion but
when you hold it in your hand
it really feels really thin and over on
the back we've got this ultra pixel
camera a camera which is really two four
megapixel camera sensors in one we've
got two microphones HTC claims they have
double membrane microphones so you can
actually record at a concert really
slick aluminum on the top and the bottom
we've got this interesting thing we're
calling the g-string here just this
little line that goes down to the camera
and we've got these white accents will
be available in white or black this is
just a handsome phone you've got the
volume rocker on the side and an
interesting design cue here we've got
the power button in a different location
the upper left corner now let's talk
about the software here we've got the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 here which is
really the s4 pro plus so this is the s4
pro quad core chip and what we have here
is called the blinkfeed and then HTC has
done something kind of innovative here
so this idea that you always have
content that you want at your fingertips
through various sources you just flick
around on your blinkfeed you click on
these various stories it comes up in
this little in this little application
here and you can actually configure this
and then
interesting notice that the clock stays
at the top and you kind of pull it down
you tap on those three lines got topics
and services here's all the stuff that
you can add it's a wide variety of items
we can add you can also tap into apps
like your calendar like your Facebook
this thing called Zoe which we're going
to talk about in a sec it's five to the
right you can enable and disable all of
these different things oh of course this
device has a 1080p screen at 4.7 inches
which means the pixel density is really
really sweet and beyond the blink you've
got a traditional HTC home screen setup
here with widgets and so forth but it
looks just so good on this screen HTC
Sense is changed I'd say that the
headline here is minimal
everything is minimal the icons the
colors the temperatures are flattened
out aligned we get a little bit of a
shine on the top down here but that's
pretty much it if we bring up the
keyboard look at this keyboard very flat
keyboard no shine doing it off it feels
really nice hello
this is a test I'm not even looking not
bad right and here's something very
interesting HTC is gone with the two
button design so we've got a home button
and a back button how do you get to the
multitask UI glad you asked you double
tap the home button an entirely new UI
for the multi test HTC listen to
customers thank goodness did away with
that 3d UI and this is really a very
efficient way to multitask double tap
and watch this you can close apps by
just clicking them off the screen kind
of guess webOS style a little bit right
Fisher a little a little bit now if you
tap and hold the home button you would
think that it would launch the multi
test but it brings up Google now let's
stick around take a look around some
more we've got our notifications it's
running on jelly bean so we've got rich
notifications and of course you might
have notes
you might have notice that this device
has two front-facing stereo speakers
which are pretty loud you probably can't
tell but let's try anyway
and watch this a new visualization
feature for the music app which brings
up lyrics this is pretty cool isn't it
I think most people who use music
through other third-party services but
for those of you that load your music
onto your device you can take advantage
of some cloud services that pulls in the
lyrics that is super cool now let's stop
the music and move around some more when
you go to the app training now back to
the home screen after has been
redesigned it's minimal it keeps your
time and the weather up here if you tap
there you get to the weather of course
and you can scroll down and you can like
on the blank field you pull down a
little bit here you can change whether
it's alphabetical custom our most recent
you can change the grid size you can
hide apps which is really cool now how
about performance we've got the two
gigabytes of RAM and as mentioned the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 let's go to the
web here so here we're on pocket now
check screen rotation speed it feels
like the DNA but faster in fact this
whole device kind of feels like the DNA
but better a lot better so let's zoom in
see how long text takes clear I'm pretty
fast there let's go back to the home
page here we're over a Wi-Fi connection
with like 50 million people so it might
not come up that best but actually
that's pretty good let's check for
checkerboards
but not to bet that's that's really good
that's to a pinch-to-zoom looking really
good there's no doubt that this has
extremely good performance with bouncing
between apps there's so much to talk
about here we're going to the camera now
because there are some cool camera
features that they used to talk about
that so for example flipping between
front and rear cameras as easy as doing
that right which makes a lot of sense
hey are you doing this behind the camera
and it's really interesting ways to
apply effects we've got a variety
effects here that you sees before HTC's
introducing this thing called Zowie
which what it does is it takes pictures
and then it adds a video to it so then
it can kind of create this storyboard
and we're gonna probably do another
video shortly demo demonstrates
demonstrating that but that seems to be
a really cool feature overall we are
darn impressed with the HTC ones we
should say that it it has some design
cues from the iPhones this chamfered
edge and hopefully this chamfered edge
doesn't look destroyed like the one on
the iphone check the durability report
for that but this is a thicker a chamfer
edge it is just hotness it looks like
jewelr yeah I hate to say that because
we said that about the iPhone 5 but it
is just supreme looking here now this
thing feels like a million
when I tell you that there's a lot of
features we're gonna have more videos of
course we're going to review the heck
out of this phone but for now first look
kind of a long ago here that the HTC one
that's it we're now searching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
