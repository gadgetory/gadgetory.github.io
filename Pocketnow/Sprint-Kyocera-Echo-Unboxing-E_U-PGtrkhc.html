pocket now calm the kyocera echo is not
only a really important device for
Sprint's not only a really important
device for kyocera but it's a very
important device for the entire
smartphone industry it is the first dual
screen phone made commercially available
it's running Android and we gotta wonder
is this a novelty or does two screens on
Android really make sense and increase
productivity you better believe we're
going to find that out for you and let's
get to the unboxing of the kyocera echo
alrighty let's get this open and thanks
to sprint for sending us a unit to
review let's see what we have inside now
kyocera isn't exactly known for
smartphones in fact this is one of their
first smartphones and the kind of really
hitting the ground running with a dual
screened android phone quite a big deal
for their first phone they didn't go to
a standard slate they just went to
something a lot bigger than that so
let's pull out all of this stuff Wow
look at this box probably can't see it
yet but you will in a second okay so so
far very impressive this nice box
exclusively on sprint Wow look at the
corners with these metal details usually
we don't see such a such a fanfare with
boxes we just get a standard cardboard
box but it's always nice to have
something that's actually fun to take
out of the packaging so moving around
the box here and let's open up the lid
oh wow this is awesome we've got a USB
key they're probably the user manual on
this it says 2g made in China I don't
know if that means is two gigabytes
probably does wants to look at that
later and let's see what we have once we
lift off this foam insert so the echo
comes with another battery because when
you're driving two screens you're going
to use a lot of battery power so they
solve the problem not really with any
battery innovation just by giving you a
second battery which is kind of funny so
here is the second battery or may
this is the first but see how big this
is going to be it's going to be Third
thirteen hundred and seventy milliamp
hours so a respectable size and if
you've got two batteries that should
definitely last you throughout the whole
day if not much more than that we've got
what appears to be hmm it looks to be
almost a case but I hope not because it
looks like a business card holder and a
little chamois to keep your screen clean
again cues are really outfitting the
user and a lot of different accessories
here we have a getting started guide
lots of different papers and then we've
got of course a micro SD adapter
assuming that this comes with a micro SD
card and we've got a standard micro-usb
charger okay so let's slide all of this
out of the way okay so here we go I'm
going to pop this out by the way this is
a 3g phone not a 4g phone just a little
bit surprising but the fact that this
has two screens kind of makes up for the
fact that it doesn't have the sprint 4g
connectivity now what we have here are
two 3.5 inch diagonal displays both of
which are 4 480 resolution by 800 so if
you put that together what you get is a
pretty large 4.7 inch display you do the
math it's a resolution of 480 we're
actually 800 x 960 it's a kind of a
strange number there and some apps will
scale to both screens some apps will
work independently on one or the other
kind of a really cool concept there's a
lot of use case scenarios will have to
talk about we've got a super thin bezel
here to allow the two screens kind of to
mesh together to create one screen let's
see how we fold this there we go okay so
that will take a little bit of practice
to get used to let's find the power
button here and turn it on just to get a
first look at it a very thick device it
looks like there's actually no battery
inside so we pop it off like so okay
there is a battery to make sure there is
no sort of piece of cellophane okay and
here it's coming on right now actually
had to put on the other battery because
it probably shipped turned on and it was
waiting for me so it kind of lost the
battery battery life there so looking
for the microSD
a lot to see how much memory this packs
right on board so we've got a card
already inserted this will cost you a
hundred and ninety-nine dollars for the
two-year contract we've kind of kind of
a strange-looking eight gigabyte to
class 2 micro SD card so good bit of
space there I want to talk about specs
in another video but to give you a
preview it's got a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor ok here we go so
something's happening so we open up the
two screens this is really weird to get
used to we haven't seen anything like
this before so they will snap in place
and again I got a really ok there we go
so now we're sort of in tablet mode
right so we've got the ability to swipe
from home screen to home screen you get
a lot of resolution here you can fit a
lot of icons on the screen at one time
but then if you sort of close the
screens and slide it like so you're
going to be taken into just a standard
android home screen with the just the
480 x 800 resolution time in the
settings real quick and take a look at
what we have there we're getting full
bars of 3g which is fantastic will go to
about phone and software and we'll see
already and software will see that we're
running on froyo not the newest version
of android 2.3 but certainly at least
were on froyo it's going to remove this
widget so let's look around the device
and compare this to other devices will
turn off the screen probably picked up
some fingerprints by now so again we
have these 2 3.5 inch screens we've got
three android buttons here and three
android buttons here making for a total
of six android buttons again it is thick
let's compare it to the very thick HTC
Thunderbolt it's thicker than the
Thunderbolt and if we compare it to the
AT&amp;amp;T focus of course it's going to be
thicker than that but of course those
devices don't have two screens so around
the back we've got a camera with a flash
kind of plastic all over it feels high
quality probably because it's got a lot
of weight to it I mean it's really a
hefty device so we can see the hinge on
the back and then
the bottom it says Qualcomm 3 3g cdma
very good and of course we've got the
charger a little under a little flap for
syncing and charging plus a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which is
always nice to have volume rocker and
the power standby switch on the left
side of device so a lot more to talk
about the kyocera echo we're gonna have
a lot of videos talking about when two
screens make sense when it's kind of
silly and perhaps maybe it's not maybe
it's always a good idea and how this
device works as a daily driver whether
it makes you more productive whether it
makes you do more with your phone
because really that's the purpose with a
kyocera echo to be able to simulcast as
they call so check your email on one
screen while browsing the web on another
it's a really cool prospect something we
have not seen before in the world of
Android or the world of smartphones so
we're extremely excited to really get
down and dirty with this device if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now
