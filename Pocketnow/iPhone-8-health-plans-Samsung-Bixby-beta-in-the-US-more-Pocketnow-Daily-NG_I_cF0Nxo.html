dramatic push in health information for
its products we get leaked information
on video of the future Galaxy Note arts
and this is about that time to get some
really good deals for your favorite
flagship I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and
according to my kids I had to dress in
yellow for today's Father's Day
celebration and you look so ugly yep
really this is PocketNow bailey the
official loose today start with deals if
you're in the market for an LG g6
and you're on Sprint or want to try
sprint they currently have it on Best
Buy for one hundred and twenty dollars
I'm not kidding it's $5 a month of you
register the only catch is you have to
get a new phone line but I would just
get a new phone line and figure out what
to do with the other one and speaking of
other deals for the LG G six and you can
also add a Galaxy s8 in addition to the
LG be 20 t-mobile is bringing back their
buy one get one free deals and the catch
is actually not so bad compared to the
previous buy one get one free again
learn more in our description and how
about we talk about the Galaxy Note 8 we
haven't really seen much about this
phone when it comes to the leaks and
that makes a lot of sense because we
don't expect it to be very much
different to the galaxy s 8 plus that's
at the point where there's a video today
that came up on YouTube that shows an
alleged part of this phone a display I
think it's a screen protector and well
if you look at it it looks pretty much
like if you're holding a galaxy as a
screen protector you know what I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
let's just hope they come up with other
better colors and speak you have Samsung
for those of you to join us in mocking
the company for how long it's taken
Bixby to launch in the United States you
can actually start using Bixby voice in
beta though there are a couple of
hurdles you will have to play like for
example provide feedback there is
limited functionality as well but again
it's a beta and I'm not going to hold it
on to Samsung for this mainly because
Siri remained the beta for iOS for years
so yes
try Bixby out see how it goes and
finally the very hottest they have to do
with Apple and a new project that
apparently the company has been working
on for years we heard the claims that
Steve Jobs really wanted the Apple watch
to be held centric
and apparently Ewa wants to do that we
are expecting the next generation Apple
watch to do something about it but
apparently the company wants to use your
iPhone as that one-stop location for all
your health information and apparently
the company wants to push in a big way
and it kind of makes a lot of sense
because if you look at Apple health
there is a lot of information being logs
on your phone currently it's so much so
that I don't even find sense in the way
the application works I don't find any
value to it other than the fact that
it's just collecting data and collecting
data but it leads me to the question of
the day do you think that it's a good
idea for your smartphone to be your
one-stop shop for health information
because in my case I think it is I mean
it's really hard for you to have an
accident in a particular country and
your information not to be there
particularly for me that I travel a lot
but leave us a comment down below we
left in on your opinion friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video was filmed
buh buh buh zanpakutou calm and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you also follow me
