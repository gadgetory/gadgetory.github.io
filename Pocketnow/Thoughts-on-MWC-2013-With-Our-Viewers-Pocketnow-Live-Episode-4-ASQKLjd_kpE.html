years in a row I've never been to Spain
before so this is pretty awesome we are
broadcasting from the same room we
broadcast the weekly from last night
which was a lot of fun we are having
some was different the setup was a tad
different yeah we were like one foot
over and still drinking same stuff but
no it's been great we've we've had the
opportunity to take some sightseeing
excursions today and and yesterday a
little bit today we finally filmed our
first video which was our predictions
for mwc 22 yup I know it is in front of
the what Sagrada Familia that in front
of that a gouty church which is always
being built apparently and that was
really awesome and so we moved when I
got some work done between last night
and today and we're just really amped
for the start of the show and we're glad
for the local internet from the sausage
guy yes i'ma guard you gotta listen to
the podcast if you want to hear that but
you I in that reference so the show
starts you're on the floor when the show
starts on the twenty-fifth we are on the
show floor on the twenty-third we're
invited to a couple of events on
saturday and sunday so we're hopefully
going to bring you some live coverage on
those days prior to the show sorry
alright and if there is a windows phone
with the real PureView Tony are you
going to sell your kidney and you know
I'm going to grab one and I'm going to
get back home and you just reach over to
CNN and if you see some crazy ass guy
running with the whatever already
managed to steal on the highway then
yeah that's me getting a purely on
windows so you know some z's crazy like
tour buses Romanian still managed to our
oceans all right well that's uh let's
talk to some peeps in just a few
reminders when you are done answering
your question please pop off so other
people
can answer and try to keep yourself
muted until we we say hi so Andrew you
know where else you're gonna give the
kick them out yeah or else I will kick
them out Andrew hi hi how you doing oh
we finally have not a backlight but a
front light yeah I actually felt webcam
that I haven't used in like three years
looking good oh yeah that's a three year
old webcam that's a good picture nice
yeah well i paid like a hundred bucks
for it so it better be looks like a
little bit Morgan so you are you excited
for from a World Congress anything you
want to see you excited what do you
thinks gonna happen oh I'm really hoping
so Niall announced when they're bringing
the Xperia Z to the States because I
know they have it about available in
Australia I think they're somewhere but
I haven't seen it in america yet so you
know xperia z instead of HTC one ya know
I the thing that bothers me about the
whole HTC one's thing is it's sort of
like two camera sensors or something so
if you have like a custom rom for
example I don't think it will be able to
fully utilize that whole town or
something that's a new thing usually
custom roms use all the drivers which
are available so in this case you were
talking red sometimes they're hard to
get ahold of surgery oh um Michael did
you read up on that the PDF you sent us
know on no I got up on that and it's
basically the information from from the
website so if you go to HTC's website
you can find the same information and a
little mad opinion why did you ask no no
I was gonna say I didn't think it was
two sensors I said it was at first and I
don't think it is like what is it i
think it's just one sensor 14 megapixel
sensor with larger pixels because they
capture more light but you output at
eight megapixel no you don't put out at
eight megapixels you put it out it
forward yeah sorry yeah we had prior to
the event was that
the camera was 8 megapixels comprised of
24 megapixel sensors but it turned out
to be one sensor forming up it's so
large and it generates maximum for
megapixel images right ya know that that
is a massive revelation to me i'm
looking at the document right now so on
your note and you give a problem with
the with with for evening for megapixels
is enough or do you think the photo
quality Huawei um well it depends you
know HTC's never been known for like
outstanding photo quality or video work
yes yes I HTC One like the original 1x
that was just terrible yeah I didn't
read more like I remember getting I was
so excited to finally have it and a call
my friends drove to the lake and I was
like I'm gonna use my new phone that
take some pictures of this car and I was
like oh what the heck is this my friend
who like hates photography's like man
nothing sucks it wouldn't be so bad if
they didn't hype it up so much I mean
the slogan was amazing camera authentic
sound I still go with that tool you can
walk in into an AT&amp;amp;T store and it still
has that plastered all over the place
randomly it's not that they're not
misleading I mean I remember the first
time when when I held the HTC One X and
i took a picture I was like flu amazing
so what well no I think I think the
marketing does it a real disservice
because when I reviewed the HTC One X
480 I did not I was not really aware
overly aware of amazing found incredible
quality whatever the so I was like
whatever this camera takes pretty good
shots in regular light and it wasn't
until I actually zoom down on the shot
Rose like oh this is making a lot
there's a lot of artifacts in here or
whatever I think I think it's it's hard
that the terrible quality is a little
overstated but I agree that it's not a
great camera I mean I think it's alright
as a camera if they wouldn't have hyped
it up so much that's the problem the
problem with what Brandon was asking the
problem with 4 megapixels is when you
have a device like this the nexus 10
which has an insanely high resolution
display full 4 megapixels is going to be
yeah
what it's already there it's already
four megapixel he can't go you guys
don't even have to go that far i mean
the HTC One has a full HD screen that's
1920 x 1080 if you are taking a 4
megapixel image displaying that image on
the screen will be ok but once you
double tap that then that it will be it
will become super jacked because you can
even double the zoom on it so because
doubling the zoom would be more than 4
megapixels and this is what we talked
about a little bit last night in the
podcast like I mean it's like it really
is going to depend on how often you zoom
in on your photos and how much you value
the ability to dissent yeah what for
what ninety percent of the people who
take pictures for their phones are going
to use it for it's going to be perfect
if the image quality is great as far as
sharing the facebook or something like
that google+ even full resolution upload
so look fine and i can definitely agree
to this i'm using a the three megapixel
setting on the Nokia 808 PureView and
that's just awesome so if that three or
four megapixel image image is perfect I
have nothing against it but if that for
megapixel image will be jag or I don't
know then it sucks Andrew thank you very
much for joining us we're gonna say
goodbye and and move on to someone else
but thanks my dear mmm all right Randy
you can see you picking somebody because
we're far away from the screen okay hi
Otto did I say that right hey yeah and
his girlfriend who actually happened to
be the first the first lady on this
vodka on this hang up ever and she's old
she's all at the same time the second
lady to join us hi guys weapons gone so
what kind of phones floral do you use um
got my nexus for an extent tip nexus
4nexus 10 180 if she see wouldn't be
that's it yes what kind of cases that
it's just a cheap hard case because I
drop a lot because I'm very klutzy so I
hadn't have a case we have some
colleagues to do also that my girlfriend
is as well so yeah now bumpers are a
good idea yeah what uh so what are you
guys thinking about mobile with Congress
what are you excited about uh you got
anything I'll you're the one that reads
RSS feeds and looks at pages okay okay
are you are you guys excited about the
new HTC One very very i'm debating
getting it on the dumb free features you
love on those Tony's like you go with
top to top two features yeah uh I'm
interested in the camera and definitely
that definitely that aluminum body is
really nice can I be a little bit mean
go for it why the camera since you
haven't seen any any camera action on it
that's his people buzzing marketing
that's why I'm interested but I I don't
know how to feel about it but I'm at
least interested in seeing what the
whole ultra pixel thing does mm-hmm are
you worried about the resolution being 4
megapixels or is that not really
consideration for you and it doesn't
really bother me if I if I need a I need
a huge picture she's a photographer so
we we can take care of that but for for
a phone camera I don't really need a
huge 8-megapixel question uh because the
camera has been talked about a lot and
and the build quality has not yet
considering at least fifty percent of
you on the screen or klutzy people if
with the with the aluminum body of the
HTC One prevent you like with that allow
you to go caseless would you go naked
like in public with that with that
device no I want to yeah i yeah yeah all
right I love my case this from
cruzerlite so I would probably pick one
of those up for that the one it's so
frustrating cuz the nicer the phone is
the more you want to keep it naked but
then the more fragile it is the more you
want to protect it yeah
it's you know it's kind of like you know
black blackberry you know as it right
with their ugly yet possibly rugged you
know nothing ugly about City you do you
think that the the HTC One is designed
based on a phone that you might have
seen before from a company in it fruit
that's 350 trollin we've been debating
that and the whole I mean I guess the
question is with the HTC One have that
chamfered edge design that aluminum
design if the iphone 5 didn't have it
and I guess there's no way of telling
but it's a it's an interesting thought
yeah I don't know i mean it's I guess
it's uh is it definitely was probably
inspired by the iphone to a point but i
like i like that it's got enough of a
unique design you know it's it doesn't
look entirely like it but it's got
similar is like the chamfered edges it
all up I have a question for you it's
going to be the last question from me
what do you guys think Samsung has to
bring to the table with the galaxy s4
HTC one uh I really don't know I mean
1080p would be nice but nothing that mud
nice that's a must oh yeah I'm being
made fun of on the other side of the
camera I apologize damn cameramen yeah
it's always easy to be on the other side
of the lens in yeah they threaten to
command flash you guys from behind me
mate they can do that as long as we keep
our intact so why'd you say here the
video heavily weekends maybe I'm glad it
for us but what did you say do what now
oh I said as long as we edit it but you
can put in anything more exciting than
it would have said anything oh that's uh
that's that's a good point that I think
that 1080p is absolutely absolutely a
possibility and so so I am this will be
my last question on this on the HTC One
given the HTC One the blackberry z10 and
the iphone 5 talking about hardware only
if you had all three of them in a box
and you can only take one home which
would you take home and why Fritz
hardware on that you can run any OS on
and this is for our guest whose names I
don't remember because it's going on hey
Aldo and the lady that's the what I said
Devon Devon yeah okay so i had to end of
him um based on hardware I I can't say
because I've only held the iphone I
haven't I haven't actually seen as a 10
or a 1 in person so that's I I guess
that would be my only viable option but
i i i don't know i mean from what i've
seen everybody says the one feels really
nice and I I like the hardware from what
I've seen on that cool and I'm dad and
the other half of team drops a lot um a
based off of Hartford it's the same as
if he had the iphones wine for a while
but i am a fan of HTC so i would
probably just out of being a fan of it
go with the one that's just how i feel
like getting the impression from the
street thank you very much because it's
something that's a comparison and i
would like to do actually very good I
ought to on Devon thank you very much
and Devon thanks for being the first
female on Pocket alive I'm glad to be hi
nice to meet you guys thank you bye bye
guys thanks guys alright well Taylor big
somebody I was just gonna say a tailor's
like either between moving is my
conclusion he's not gonna raise dealers
anyway handle and handle it like yours
all tomorrow yeah Taylor I was gonna
think I thought Brandon was gonna kick
me off here but uh oh really let's make
it another 10 minutes you know another
10 minutes for five point seven minutes
ads your turn it's my turn in the wheel
oh gosh um I was expecting to get kicked
off I'm not ready for this let's go with
Lois I curiel I don't know if that's
right Lewis is over where's this no mu
his microphone yeah yeah I think he's
still muted yes point at the camera
Michael just right there i cants right
there what do you just a matter we have
no audio Lewis there's an icon on the
top right corner of your screen with a
it should be red but if you click on it
it should be great we're in for the
great state or yeah we can't hear you or
you have some other setting problems
this is good to hang on till now
crosstalk is it all as a full-duplex yum
did it is really well until until he
sources problems out being somebody else
and that will return okay um Taylor
right in the middle I would pick the guy
with audio issues no offense Lois um so
we'll circle back to you Thomas huffed
master this is an awesome last name I
don't know why but it is your name hi
hey I see I'm recruit a friend yeah
alright so Mobile World Congress
predictions give us your top two
predictions yeah that was me come on
what's going on I'm not thinking three
that's a bad number that's right well I
know my number ones probably gonna be
the Nokia EOS that's I really want to
see something better with preview come
out because after everything that
happened with the Lumia 920 gang out how
it's not real perv you going to Tony
especially I'm really excited to see
something exactly you want you to see oh
yeah
I think that's what do I keep going that
phone I would have gotten that phone if
it wasn't symbian I mean I just I don't
know I haven't experienced in you know
yeah this thing's gonna android phone
because of the camera yeah you get it
because the camera is but as long as
you're don't need to run any apps
libyans an evil necessary sale michael
is is is tony is Tony campus does he
compare everything to the PureView like
you eat a good amber eating no not as
good as beautiful yeah we got some
turkish food that didn't measure up last
night you know left review would have
been a much better to sandwich so I just
want to drop in just for one second
everybody seems to and legitimately
think that the nokia eos will be Oreos
will be probably the thing that will
steal the show what if that doesn't
happen will that be the biggest
disappointment of mwc hmm it's it's hard
to tell like it's it's hard to tell what
else is really going to be announced er
I mean HTC just had their big events &amp;amp;
Sons holding off till after mwc so it's
it's really hard to tell yeah I will be
for me I will ask you personally I mean
it would be for me because I think the
Nokia EOS is the highest end kind of
release that we are expecting with
reasonable certainty to occur I just
that doesn't happen if no he just comes
out the game was like oh here's the
Lumia 400 and 450 emerging markets I'm
gonna be like I'm not afraid that we
will have another moment like the iphone
4s when we were expecting guy from five
the expectations were high the buzz was
5am participated and then we were like
oh yeah i remember when i remember that
turning moment to when i'm watching the
event and someone whoever his live blog
i was found at the time was like doesn't
seem like they'd be spending a lot this
much time on the forest yeah there was
something else yeah it was like yeah
mm-hmm no no what's your number two
number two I really want to see a lot
more from this you bun to us
we someone else who says it's you bun
too yes you bug to that's that's how
I've always said it eight it's like me
for my bro it's a boon to like Ubuntu
all right ah I say it wrong to you dude
I said okiya I said nokia even the
stephen elop was on stage and said nokia
it's nakia but he said nokia end of
story one thing we definitely did learn
definitively recently was that route
wacom it's not that it's wacom which is
a way cool wow yeah come on yeah but
yeah I was gonna go I was gonna come
home and see about trying to get this
that you bunch of preview for my nexus 7
but after just seeing what happened with
all the screenshots think I might wait
until screenshots hey hey like i watch
the tablet video go and i really liked
what they did with like the UH the thing
on the side where you'd have like the
phone version of crap on the side age
yes I'd say side stage I like that
Taylor is that usable can you show the
side stage yeah I'll get it up and
running once it it's a little laggy but
uh what you want to do you know what
they're talking about oh oh I was just
wondering if Tony yoga the hell hey guys
are talking about a feature on ubuntu I
know that much I just didn't know inside
stateroom you dare all right maybe we're
happy we're about you know about to but
there are so many problems with this
uncle dinner silent I was about to ask
you something what do you think will
happen on the tablet side I mean who are
the key players or what are you
expecting from the tablet manufacturers
was it gonna be a via android tablets or
who we also see some windows 8 pro and
Windows RT tablets I'm sure we'll see
some windows RT windows 8 pro tablets
I'm looking forward to see the note 8 I
really want to see something like that
I'm kind of regretting it in my nexus 7
I probably should have waited for that
because i love what Samsung's doing with
the s pen and the no brand so I mean I'm
excited to see that I think that's going
to be the main thing for tablets if that
gets announced and did we just find the
one person
first person to say is excited about
nota yeah i wanna i want to see it i
mean ya know right beside stages all
right let's look at this stage all right
random click on taylor these keys click
click a fiber well right here no he's
awkward okay now these plane all right
this is really hard to do but uh so you
have your browser and just swipe over
from the side of the screen and you pull
up calculator the screenshot camera or
calculator app right now yeah it doesn't
do anything it's a screenshot um
something usable there like something
that actually functions those settings
no tools oh yeah oh that would be
actually really handy yeah like you did
so yeah these notes while you're in the
browser and so it's like a love child of
multi screen on samsung devices and with
multitasking as aren't dingoes phone or
windows yeah yeah i was excited to see
that but now that I hear there's so many
boats with it i think i might hold off
until more stable versions are released
or there's uh you know later on i'm not
sure if you guys heard it I was just
asking Michael how are you as a company
able to release something which is in
that stage I mean on the national stage
don't you have beta testers don't yeah
that exactly i probably should have been
a beta and they should have waited to
relay some more stable version to the
public i don't know i think they wanted
to show that they have something that
they're working on something and there's
something you could use it to make calls
and text messages and browse the web and
you know they really want to be a big
player and safe just I mean how many
companies have talked about getting
something out but they just don't do it
in like two years ago by so these are on
tues just here's something yeah it's
it's just a developer preview that's all
it is and it's not even intended for
people like us to Z yeah we care a lot
about this up who are we to say no we
can't there right now we shouldn't be
treating it like we should be treating
blackberry 10 which is actually released
to market right what was their label
attached that this is a beta and this is
broadly none functional favor um not
really so that's why we're judge mmm
yeah I mean it was just just said you
know this is a preview and that was
pretty much it
here's how to install it that's it but
it said this is a preview uh yeah
there's a page where you can download
and it well they're gonna elaborate yeah
so so then yeah then I take it better
yet if you're seeing the independent
film for free you don't get to complain
that it's a POS and and if you have to
go through an alleyway through a
corridor and down several flights of
stairs to see the independent film you
should like definitely having done much
theatre in the space you're talking
about Brendan that is entirely true yeah
allow me to beam een let us move on guys
yeah let us move on Thank You Thomas
very much joy forever me see you later
thank you thank you all right Louis do
you have audio hello yeah I'm in you're
in in it to win it where are you from

ever take like I'm like a weekend drive
just to like just to go into an LT you
ever have all the time I got 40 you take
a picture of yourself next to a 4g
indicator on your phone like this is the
best moment my life what nope so what
kind of phone you using I have three
phones from t-mobile and 1 i'll show you
might as well t mobile phone mytouch 4G
all right George classic mini mini
scratches many battles for Galaxy Nexus
everybody that is the Galaxy Nexus yes
yes the old with the real one not the
verizon one great one gsm no lover eyes
that i'm glad you weren't wrong by the
same vixen i was good and i'm probably
gonna get a lot of hate for this one x
no no no no that's a perfect phone
actually i'm right and you completely
forget about it the rest is a good phone
yeah actually i'm very happy with this
now cuz have you ever been following
development recently it just got ass off
nice so now i can just flash kernels
normally like the nexus or my own light
touch so what current what kernel and
rom are you running I'm going to stop
wrong I don't want to eat but I'm
running a bit finally somebody who is a
real man so little of me it's 120
minutes I think of a man oh hi hello
listen to the story listen to like
seriously 22 oh here we go alright god
but for the episode started Tonio's tony
is like he's sitting there with his
galaxy note 2 frustrated beyond belief
that he can't flash a different you know
rom to it or like to just get the
carrier customizations officer it can
use it effectively and I'm like yeah why
don't you just like take Brandon's
advice be a man and route that sucker
times like no because it takes more
courage to run stock yeah you put up
with that crap everybody can't move
everybody can flash know you live with
the way it does it to be emm group that
you can have there's funny i'm running a
stock asian wrong jellybean good that
kernel is custom kernels custom this
makes enough elements of X I have a
question for you leaving the fun part
aside what would you prefer would you
prefer a unstable very fast internet
connection mobile connection or a slower
but stable any connection and I'm not
saying GPRS or something like that i'm
just saying a 3g stable versus LTE
unstable it's good question interested
section from my day-to-day usage here
depends honestly here's play from from
your point of view from your personal
perspective slowly stable be honest yeah
mmm again the LTE doesn't ready to go
that fast in the Houston area hmm I get
12 I can go up to 12 but no you know oh
man OMG amazing speeds yeah I like
they're gonna have I have unstable LTE
here and Charlotte well the I'm in the
northern part of charlotte i'm in
concord and sometimes i get 50 down 30
up and sometimes I get you know three
down and two other family yeah it's only
words the worst of them all you have I'm
stable and slow not moving here and
Louis Thank You Louie sir louis Louise
we sleep tight oh you got my last thing
right it is elegant sweet i got the
first name wrong but i got your last
name right yes thank you for joining us
sir no problem all right hey I'll get it
before I tell are you about to say
you're leaving yes I was gonna say I'm
ducking out what's up right I tell me to
say that the well before we close the
speed conversation going to the next
color the very first experience I had
with LTE was on the HTC One X 480 and I
was doing speed tests on and on my way
back to Boston and I sent Brandon my my
speed test report and I was like I can't
believe the speeds I'm getting on this
thing and I at one point I was getting
like 29 down and some ridiculous number
up and Brandon was like i'm pretty sure
that result was an error was insulting
him with a brand-new and he was entirely
writing i completely agree with it but
it turns out no it's just that LTE was
that awesome back before nobody was on
it and talking about those days like
when I'm an old man y'all remember back
in my days when I was young before I
moved to the south and picked up this
ridiculous accent I i had the
Thunderbolt so I had the original LTE
device yes and speedtest.net the app
wasn't
updated for LTE speeds yet download was
fine I did tests and it was up to 50
megabits per second which is awesome
here in Charlotte the LT if I move south
LT is perfect but where I am it's really
spotty and I was in the heart of
Charlotte I was in uptown and I ran a
speedtest and it was about 40 down and
it was 88 up like what no way but it was
I don't get those bees it was a it was a
an error on speed test false here I was
like 88 of what yeah all right on that
note I'm gonna duck out I will catch you
guys later Billy shoot some awesome
videos man there and don't cry what I'm
going don't cry buddy get on I'm gonna
I'm gonna I'm already doing so cool
shall we go to nab you later let me be
mad let me be flex pick the first person
on the left you have to hover your mouse
to see his name cuz your left might be
different than I love you let's fig i
need to get even closer i'm a bum or a
numb bum or I don't know got it on the
first try I'm about ass yes where are
you from I'm from Canada your Canada and
is I'm upon what kind of name is dead
and a French is nothing brie in English
Indian Indian that is good what part of
Canada if you don't mind me asking
please ah Ontario cool are you uh huh
yeah so i would like to I'd like do you
have anything you want to ask us because
if you don't I'm gonna ask you something
ask me something okay what I'm thinking
is what do you think that this year
huawei and ZTE will show off at mwc will
there be a sea of mid-range or low end
android phones or will it be probably
one or two who will stack up with the
competition at the equivalent level to
me like Huawei would be I would presume
they would toss out a lot more mid-range
and low-end phones and mobile or
Congress because when looking at one CES
and their high end
it didn't look that big with that what
was that 6.83 wallet essence yeah yeah
yeah yeah nothing was a monster yeah you
telling me he was a lemon is what it was
mm-hmm look out like right leg i love i
love how pleased brandon was nervous but
I if I was in reach of the computer I
would have here's the effect why doesn't
the soundboard I'm thanks for
entertaining me got side we know it was
I I would I also liked your joke where's
our reserve someone here all you need
you guys are good at that alobam let us
move back to you one little expect on
the on the tablet side now this is a
tricky one tablet side I did I want to
see if Samsung even gonna bring the
Galaxy Note eating through but right
second person who's excited yeah and
then I mean they are i mean that's
that's been confirmed i think this far
back bleh general i am a die-hard Sam
something are you yeah i'm stuck with in
here not waving drive I'm still with you
um I have a question go ahead and random
sir I was gonna see what say you
probably the galaxy s i'm gonna guess
galaxy s2 yeah good guess I kick yeah
cuz you start to say I'm stuck with then
you say you're a samsung fan and the
best phone you could be stuck with from
Samsung Scout six I am stuck with this
one and it's still on four point one
point one so I am I one to a four point
one point two it's about you getting
update ya ghali be opting for my carrier
well for 14 12 is to that is yes
brothers yeah I have a question related
to Samsung because this is actually
related specifically to touch with and I
was at a meeting with some Samsung folks
recently and I kind of was talking about
something else
and I let it slip that was like yeah you
know because TouchWiz definitely needs a
refresh I mean not that the TouchWiz
needs a refresh necessarily but it
doesn't so do you share the same the
same opinion coming from a like a
samsung diehard standpoint space samsung
looks fine right now big when I had an
Ice Cream Sandwich and gingerbread when
I first bought this this the the touch
which overlay was so bad usually crash
my phone and how to reboot it just to
keep it working but now I have the new
update everything looks feels more fluid
with the project butter that Google
implemented with it yeah pretty happy
with it right now you know is it
incorporating the nature UX elements
that are also in the galaxy s3 in the
note 2 like we did like the ripple water
unlock and all that kind of stuff yeah
it's pretty much it yet that's a lot of
it's in there yet when you up put the
odds updated software let me ask you a
tricky question it's going to be my last
question would a windows phone 8
PureView phone from a certain finish
finish manufacturing nokia be enough for
you to switch to Windows Phone 8 oh that
is a tricky one I know it's a good way i
know that's a really good question to me
the camera wouldn't be my thing it to me
it would be like more media conception
so i'll stick to my android phones right
now okay thanks for those phone is to me
is like all ill try to work its way up
have you considered this will be my last
question on this have you considered
this samsung 80s at all because i know
it is on sale in your country let's be
get me and looks good but commenting you
guys like i'm not a fan of windows 8 but
if not what if that was an android phone
i would be first in line to get it it is
its cool the s free well thank you for
joining us a new pond I really broke
hate it and we'll see you next time yeah
a nice to talk to you tomm thank you you
know we're in victimless guys guys first
of all i should point out that al bundy
is with us which is fantastic we'll get
to him in a min
second of all when it hey whoa echo it
happens all the time people refer to
Windows Phone 8 as Windows or Windows 8
does that bother you guys I think that's
exactly what Microsoft wanted and I
think that that's the breath the uber of
brand recognition they want to unify and
I think Microsoft happy now and I think
that if they hadn't wanted to do that if
they hadn't wanted to play on their
perceived strength of the windows brand
they would have indeed called windows
from seven Metro UI or something that
didn't carry the you know the windows
for anything with Windows brand yeah and
I guess it doesn't harm the brand
because your phone sitting on a bar and
you say oh it's running windows and
everyone knows windows and if you go to
a store and say I want the phone that
runs windows they know exactly what to
bring you because everyone says that I'm
that's exactly one says that that's
exactly what they wished for when they
came up with a name that the brand
recognition and the 90 something percent
market share the window species would
have a positive influence on on mobile
platforms and on the surface and Windows
RT / windows 8 bada-bing let's move on
to wool j did i say that right
impossible after i cannot i cannot the
see you but i cannot hear you either so
either unmute your microphone spelled
his name random w why am i spelling
because you might have pronounced it
differently and he doesn't know we're
talking about i think he knows we're
talking about him because he's trying to
find he's over there all the way on the
right there oh he's the one yeah well
that's well well i guess is it to sort
it out me I hope we can talk to him
peace I think he's um I can see a
chinese calendar behind him or something
and what about the gentleman right next
to brandon with the the dramatic
backlighting and the circular pattern on
his shirt it's very interesting being 12
feet away from the computer are you free
to you Gary sure hello hey Gary hi how
you doing where are you from Gary I'm
from dull Custer in the UK Ricky
gentlemen you worried you are also not
to call you out but you have a your
occupation has to do with cards yes it
doesn't date yes yes yes yes Gary's been
a frequent youtube commenter of ours hey
welcome to the 10 alive hi hi Michael I
brothers right Tony hi you have so i
clumb whatsapp I know but I've just like
my first time in the in the Hangout so
welcome if you're the first time here
then we have a rule either you ask us
something or we ask you something uh I
think if also not something I'm am they
thought of anything to ask but it what
would you think Sony will do anything to
be home safe we were just talking about
this we were just talking on this before
the live actually and you know they had
a big big coming-out party at CES for 13
on the Xperia Z in the CL and so forth
so I made audio we still got sugar you
have yeah Oh started with somebody else
so I think that yeah they've they've
really all right just a second the PSA
please everybody who are not in the
current conversation with us please meet
your microphones thank you very much
back to you um so I think they've
already drop their their big bomb for
the year you know and I think if if they
do release anything here it will
probably be less I'm not sure they will
because they placed approximately
everything they had on their first card
which was CES and i still have
unfortunately the same feeling about HTC
well they gotta do their tablet right
that that z tablet the the one that will
have a design language leads me that
might happen in May at ctia might happen
in August at key fob what I hope it
happens here speaking of xperia z why
would you get an xperia z over an HTC
One Gary what do you think um well not
being somebody who's very sort of
knowledgeable knowledgeable about sort
of phones and tech because it's
something I've come to fairly recently I
have to say to be honest largely
you guys a pocket now you know I've been
watching for just under a year and I've
learned a lot in that time and
incidentally Michael I can get it to
work one of my best to see here I've got
over now man i'm gonna sweep looking
windows phone devices is it is that
alone I can't know that it's a Lumia 920
yeah there's a smell that the nokia
smile yes it is yes so good to meet
another 9 20 09 there's the small I have
to say I've been a bit of a wolf I've
put a case on it you know what your
ability report I was gonna say well no I
mean to be honest I mean it's a funny
thing with with I know it's kind of gone
complete tangent but all of the added a
lot of kind of watching reviews and your
reviews and other reviews as well and
what watching the drop tests which are
hilarious some of them I mean have you
seen the one where they run a car over
it yeah yeah I think that was featured
by Nadia's official Facebook account and
put her account yeah yeah and it's just
crazy you can't destroy it even if you
try which is probably good for me
because I can be a bit clumsy but as I
say with me not being very sort of
knowledge of knowledgeable about these
things I think largely with me does come
down to a little bit of brand loyalty
and I would probably go with the sony
for the simple reason that I'm I think
this is one of the comments I made
actually on the pocket now website that
I'm a sort of chubby a version of
Captain two phones in the sense that i
have two phones and the other one ah
this is cognize that it is it's the away
xperia what this is the tea yeah so
which I got just before they release the
Z of course which is slightly irritating
but it's a funny thing because I
actually don't like the sort of flat
slab design of the teeth of the Z quite
so much are you you know what I mean
yeah that's that's one thing I didn't
like about I mean it's not only flat on
the top and the bottom but it's flat on
every single side it's like a it's like
a sliver of and it's got so many covers
it's unreal it doesn't have a lot of
flaps on it doesn't
yeah you were complaining about that at
CES like Tootsie to look at to look at
the stream look at the spring you
basically have to remove a flap I think
a three day yeah the Brennan light was
on the CL is everybody but I like I'd
like to ask you a question do you have
any tablets and if yes are they selling
tablet I don't know but again this is
something I'm thinking about I mean I
have a laptop a very old to love acer
laptop it's only I'm sorry out well no
physically give you a cake no um I mean
tablets are something I've been thinking
about I would really really like Nokia
to bring a tablet out and I think one of
the comments I made actually was there a
bit like the Gypsy Rose Lee of the phone
world in that so much they're not about
you yeah yeah yeah they'll kind of like
well we'll show you a bit then we're not
yes we'll know won't and I wish to just
get on with it to be honest you know cuz
i think i think everyone who likes not
yet new lights windows phone has been
calling out for it you'll give us a
tablet it's coming can you know but I
kind of hope that they'll surprise
everybody and having completely shot the
rumors to pieces they bring one to mwc
mmm and maybe not to this one maybe two
next one and I think that Nokia's
playing it safe and it's playing it safe
on other people's money and Microsoft's
money I think they're playing the
waiting game I they're leaning back and
seeing how much money Microsoft loses or
wins on the Windows RT / windows 8 game
and if Windows RT and windows 8 will
pick up market share this year next year
not cable release Windows RT / Windows 8
tablet if not then nakia said we had no
plans we had no official announcements
we didn't think about this yeah do you
think though that in some ways that's a
bit of a negative way of looking at it
if they actually said hey we're on board
with us too you know we believe in it
and if all the companies that actually
were had invested something in Windows 8
samsung for example with your teeth line
actually said hey you know we believe in
this enough two pots for hardware out
there that that would actually help
market
the question that the answer is within
your question I don't think that Nokia
believes mmm what in windows 8 neon
artinya so that's why they're waiting
they are waiting to see whether if it's
worth it to invest money which they
don't apparently they already have to I
think two huge buildings the HQ and
another building which has been sold so
they don't want to invest anymore unless
it pays off quickly and Nokia would be
the one to ask about that because they
invested as much as you could possibly
invest in Windows Phone and they have
the most experience and company with
absolutely no stakes and anything else
just windows phone the other on so Gary
thank you very much for joining us
you're welcome and thank you for
commenting so much we really appreciate
it come back next week about I'll try
guys definitely that's totally scary
nice talk to you do did you guys hear
the news which one there is now an
emulator on XDA that allows you to run
x86 apps in windows RT I heard and I got
excited because I thought it was I
thought it was something like bluestacks
for Windows RT where you could run
android apps on it once I figured out
that you could just run full windows
apps on RT I kind of fell right asleep
the ship should I not have shouldn't cuz
i want to know this is brendan you know
more about this night it and if you just
came to the Hangout welcome and please
mute your mic Brendan tell us why this
is important for the surface RT and
other devices running under Turkey well
Windows RT is generally terrible because
it really has no purpose for being right
here it is charged to do two things at
this is review it tries to be this
tablet touch-friendly operating system
that has no apps and then it tries to be
like a productive environment with like
a lite version of office but then this
productive version can't run Spotify or
Photoshop or premier you know you know
despite the apps that you like to run on
the desktop so if you can run those
on Windows RT makes it much better hmm
yeah okay so we have we determined
whether they can run effectively or not
really I don't know that much about it
but if i add a surface RT i would try it
out random there's a person who has no
image but an avatar who hasn't muted
Kenny please mute him first um yeah and
what well Brennan is searching for you
please if you have not muted your mic
please do so because it is exciting to
hear you brush your microphone against a
foreign object but not that exciting hey
so we're gonna go back to woo j cuz i
think hello there is hello hey how you
doing I'm good thanks hey got your money
we wish I'd early see you yeah well I
can see him just fine he's moving this
fine yeah yeah we cannot we have an
avatar yo it's just a little okay that's
sad well maybe it's us for you so where
you from Rana unliving in England notin
but unfroze south korea nice and you're
already having the British accent oh yes
you haven't so so do you have a devotion
to HTC being from oh wow that's colonies
yeah I understand rather yeah enough
again nah either other LG or Samsung yea
though I'm country using original
Samsung Galaxy S which is this one
classic well we can't see you Brandon
what is he showing the original guy he's
showing a banana phone it's very strange
it to banana bay Scott yeah this is
original Galaxy S with San Jose are more
10 running on it nice original Galaxy S
yeah yeah giving it life how's it
runners Adam hunt that's devotion that's
cool man
that's a real man there yeah I had loads
of trouble with this with stock one
could he be it's kept crashing it no
reason so I really had to put another
rom on it I had no choice don't you guys
believe that it is not exciting is
amazing that a phone which is like three
years old now the galaxy s is capable of
running a platform which has been
released this year / a couple of months
ago I don't know because like you can
take your old penny in one computer and
you could put you know windows 8 on it
if you well no you couldn't you can take
your pentium to and put windows 8 on it
and it would work and mr. Ballmer will
be happy to tell you that that's why
they designed it that way yeah oh there
we go oh yeah we have image yep that
video all right hatia show if your
banana phoning I want them to see ya Oh
Tennessee guy yeah we can in that
cyanogen montaigne yep is being updated
last night with 204 point to point to so
I want to know I was I want to know what
kind of fluidity that this like three
year old hardware is able to deliver
with this build on it I mean is it
amazing i said its greatest mood and
when you're running like say your say
you're really doing a stress test on it
and you know you're going through your
day and you've got like seven amateurs
lazy because your buddies it's like 18
hours about time and crazy use it like
is it all right well a lots a bit but
it's not it's better than the one they
used to have to stop one to touch base
sorry i think yeah probably so is it
safe to assume that a three year old
phone is acting better than a phone
which is a mid-range phone announced
yesterday haha i don't think it does cuz
i mean what about you say this is 30 of
phonies three year old hardware so i
think there are some limitation to that
sure it is still rather impressive
see it just it is just running and
rejects the question why don't
manufacturers update hardware yeah yeah
really there yeah well I need money
don't they yeah this was and well said
yes what's what's the next phone you one
with Jay uh my upgrade is jus let two
months later so probably goes to know to
is good why don't you wait until Aoife
in August to get the galaxy note 3
that's out of their money all right wait
wait and what about in a similar kind of
vain yes were why not go for the GS 40 a
man sir no actually I won't catch note
because it is screen because I have
really bad eyesight like I have really
really bad eyesight so I really can't
see anything well I don't want to
disappoint you but the the text on the
galaxy note 2 isn't that big I mean just
because the screen is huge it doesn't
mean that you will see a huge difference
in and but you don't have any of the
accessibility options Turner tray to let
Scotty true true yeah also i think i
might just root it and get one of this
wrong way change the DPI sitting mm-hmm
I think that's good idea yeah no problem
okay I'm gonna let you guys guess what
do you guys think this is any holding a
little bit higher this is fun let us all
get next to the nexus 7 wait hold on I
know it's got wide radius corners on it
Brandon click on him so that the camera
this is quick oh gosh I succeed oh I can
see you Brennan wouldn't watch kiss
clintus to travel he's click my brand
I'm guess then I well I gotta ask you
this question is it a is it a samsung
HTC Sony something common or is it like
a 30-year brand like Kobe is the main
string roll okay why then this is if
that's a touchpad go I'm coming over I
was gonna say say like the galaxy tab 2
or something you're correct it doesn't
got stood up to 70
thank you sadly I'm not running any
custom roms on a but oh well do you know
why I saw one of those today I saw sore
today I should have been able to cloud
come on this would say thank you very
much we are going to give someone else a
turn and okay thank you thanks for
coming by but see ya all right do you

lacking love it yeah I review that was a
great fun yeah yeah and before that I
have the qtek the 8310 or something that
was once all but not now that was when
phones had really cool names you know
not no one or like galaxy you know like
dinner Chewie I made 34 SPM 54 you know
we've seen your old phone what is your
your daily driver what do you have
ideally I have an s3 and ice cream yeah
that's good what what will you upgrade
to the s4 I don't really know I'm
waiting to see how it turns out what we
does it take for samsung to have on the
s4 so that Samsung has your money so
that you can upgrade I think they should
continue with the same strategy like
throw everything at it like I want to
removable battery I don't really use it
but I want to know that I have an option
mm-hmm I want an SD card for sure for
sure because i have all my music on it
and i don't know about the screen I hope
it's not that bigger but much bigger
than yesterday yeah me too last question
me ok I would like to ask would you buy
the hats for if it would follow the same
design language as the S free it looked
almost the same yeah well I'm not really
much of a designer guy I wouldn't care
months ok thank you
power user thank you yeah this so it has
a power user now I have a related
question would you buy the s4 if it did
not feature removable memory but it came
standard at 64 gigs of on-board storage
hmm well sure yeah if it's six before
out a reasonable price why not that's it
that's very interesting down here's the
point right because I yeah we've been
looking at HTC and then they're like
their big thing that everyone hates is
that they never offer removal battery or
expandable storage but the new HTC One
has 64 gigs on board so I'm wondering
how that's going to be received because
I think 64 games would be enough for me
and as a soldier sir how are you sir
it's nice to hear that that 64 gigs is
still enough right now you don't have
fun yet I've actually got the 16gb
version with the 32 you guys the guard
of it that's 48 nice yeah that's that's
perfect minus whatever user and Joshua
yeah then uh brother can I ask you a
question at least the one let us know
I've read your article on the the
ultrapixels and could you care to make a
comment could you guys care to make a
comment what do you think about
ultrapixels and they're a species like
an inordinately you want us to answer I
think you might even Brandon first are
are 4 megapixels enough for your walk
through pixels I mean even if even if
the camera takes really really good
pictures 4 megapixels is not enough
because as I said in the article like
this the screen of the nexus 10 is 4
megapixels so you see the picture if you
just take in and you cannot zoom in
literally there's no more there's no
more data it's just 4 megapixels is not
enough aight aight good enough a little
bit higher better but for is just not
none of what did you say green you think
four is enough no I don't think I also
commented and I don't think for us
enough I think for us to be blue I would
say that forum would be definitely
enough for me if those 4 megapixels
would be the perfect for megapixels I
mean
pureview like 4 megapixels sharp good
balance good color good light dinner and
I could live with it so we have the two
extremes of the answer and somewhere in
between I will sit and I will take the
less courageous answer and say I need to
see the results for myself first it's a
little safe one it would I mean maybe
it's a maybe it's mind-blowing Lee good
and you know maybe I don't know well we
move them we need to wrap it up
everybody um you're gonna be seeing a
lot a lot more of Tony and Michael you
