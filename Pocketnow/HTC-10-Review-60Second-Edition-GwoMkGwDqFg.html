but the HTC 10 delivers a new camera and
a new set of boomsound speakers is this
the HTC revival we've all been waiting
for you'll get the answer to that
question and more in 60 seconds or less
so what's hot almost everything the
shell is familiar but accents like these
large edge chamfers help the design feel
fresh the camera is the best we've ever
used on an HTC performances top-notch
thanks to a competitive processor from
Qualcomm and this year's cents launcher
is wonderfully refined streamlined with
a minimum of bloat and duplicated apps
we can always count on class-leading
headphone audio and the 10-1 best phone
speakers in a recent viewer poll so
what's not hot the camera is greatly
improved but it's still a work in
progress low-light performance still
lags behind some competitors and video
options are a bit lacking also for
having a quad HD screen we wish we had
the option to change the grid size on
home screens and for including a
fantastic headphone amp at this price a
decent pair of earbuds would have helped
show off that audio prowess we're kind
of reaching on those last two criticisms
this is an incredible effort from HTC
and the 10 represents one of the most
well-rounded flagship phones from any
manufacturer this year after using this
phone we can't wait to see what HTC
might have in store for us on a future
Nexus 4 10 more minutes on the HTC 10
