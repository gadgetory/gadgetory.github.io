everybody this is puckett now live
episode number 12 and I am Anton denied
managing editor of pocketnow.com and I
am right now joined by Jill Levi senior
editor hello Joe hello how's everybody
doing everybody is awesome and also by
mr. Taylor Martin senior editor hello
are you doing how are you I'm great
everybody is great and we don't want to
take too much time let's run jump right
into it Joe please choose somebody to
talk to so the rules for the podcast
were for the live hangout rather where
we're trying to get people who haven't
been on the show before so if I
recognize you I'm probably gonna skip
over you for right now so I'm gonna go
with eeny meeny miny I don't think i
have seen subodh eesh before supper each
welcome unmute your microphone say hello
and tell us how big the battery in New
York zone is hello um i'm sorry i'm
using a galaxy s2 and you know it's just
1650 milliampere and it doesn't come for
the day so I've seen even the galaxy s3
and I feel that you know they have made
the batteries of the same shape and same
same like an oak rectangular shape but
in a galaxy s4 they made it wider but
it's not I know long enough I mean the
body is so big but its source like I
feel the batteries become very small um
though it sells for the day I don't know
whether it's good enough for the today's
smartphone technology alright so you
said your battery doesn't get you all
the way through the day would you
consider yourself to be an average user
a light user or a heavy user I'm heavy
user heavy users what do you do most
with your phone um I do everything on my
form email games um what's a internet
browsing music everything
so how much of the how much ours is it
getting through the day like you have to
recharge at lunchtime or whatnot and how
much of that time do you have spent with
the screen on um actually both are 16 oz
and it goes dead and do you spend about
half of that with with the screen on or
less or more or um no it's like most of
the time I play and sometimes it spends
a lot on background syncing background
singers who else has a problem with
backgrounds thank you so he does over
the house email Twitter Facebook yeah I
got too much stuff to sync with image
uploads yeah I'm I got some questions
over here and I want to know you know
like they're on a no batteries available
you know past for the past few years and
each of them very small four of them
could no power even a torchlight so it's
it's a word technology it's quite a word
technology for now why aren't they yet
implemented you know for mobile phone
technologies they know we need some
juice that's a really good question and
that leads us right into the the topic
that were discussing today what about
battery technologies Tony Taylor do you
guys have any advice any suggestions on
why these nanotechnologies aren't
available for us today and when we might
see them well I have 11 all little thing
I want to say i wrote a piece on micro
batteries and i'm thinking that they are
not quite ready yet for mine clean
because once you develop the technology
you have to patent that here to test it
and he had then you have to get it on
the market at the moment i don't think
they are ready right now and you have to
come up overcome the biggest problem
which is producing it on a large-scale
manufacturing process is the hardest of
any of that you can chemical the battery
technology I've reported on I don't know
probably 20 battery breakthroughs over
the years and the problem is that all we
found this great new technology when you
can use it
batteries and it's great until like oh
how do we make a cuticle hard you know
to make one that you know the size of a
dime and it powers an LED for 20 minutes
how do you make one mix you know large
enough to power a phone on you know a
huge scale on tens of millions of them
that's the problem um now micro and nano
batteries these are great but the
technology that I wrote about a few
weeks ago is graphene or graphite space
batteries which is on you I'm getting a
lot a few guys echo I'm trying to move a
rock now actually I'm trying to meet
everybody except for you the problem is
that actually there is no problem with
these they've already got a
manufacturing process they're really
easy and cheap to make and what it is is
it changes the way that batteries are
charged so right now they charge from
okay I've got this little battery pack
they charge from the center to the outer
most sales and what that does is it
creates you know two or three hour
charge times and when you use this
graphene the way it charges is they all
charge all the cells in the battery
charge simultaneously so it charges an
entire battery three thousand million
powers in oh ten seconds so it turns out
inspiration was the one with the echo so
whenever you want to talk just that me
Trisha yeah ok then i'm ok so they say
as you said it yeah I understood the
facts I understood but ok so what about
cleaning down the present batteries you
know they are the same thickness you
know you see for my galaxy s tone the
galaxy s the thickness of the battery is
still the same so if they reduce the
thickness so you can you know put more
juice into it right you can make a
thinner phone more battery power you win
I win everyone wins that's actually yeah
this is a this is tiny if you look at
I've got the HTC One X just sitting here
this thing is two thousand million hours
and it's smaller than you know most you
know sixteen hundred million power
batteries and it's a charger
so I agree they could be smaller yeah
let me show you something this is the
battery of the stock AT&amp;amp;T or
international Galaxy Note 2 and this is
an extended battery for the same phone
how many times is that bigger miles I
think okay so okay no you know it's
coming to s4 on 18 these big little
technology you know not just batteries
they said the big little technology can
actually you know reduce your battery
consumption about seventy percent on a
normal usage so do you think that's
gonna help I'll take that one um here's
the really really in-depth deep
technical explanation you ready for this
no it's nothing big little is a great
concept um it's it's the natural
evolution I believe of where not only
mobile processors but processors in
general are going to go for those of you
who aren't familiar with the concept
essentially you have some really
high-end big fat processors that do a
lot of heavy lifting and they take up
quite a bit of energy to do it
relatively speaking that's not a ton of
power because we're getting more and
more efficient but when your phone is
sitting there idle or your smartphone
your set-top box your car whatever it
may be that's using this processor it
doesn't need to be running those really
big strong powerful processors so big
little says let's also team up some
low-power slower processors that don't
do as much and don't do it as fast but
it's plenty fast to do background tasks
like the syncing that we just talked
about and it hands that off when your
screen is off or when you've been idle
for a while is it going to give you a
seventy percent improvement in battery
life no no no no it's never going to do
that and that's something that these
announcements don't like to tell you
about yeah just video nvidia did it too
with the companion core in the Tegra 3
and
you didn't see any major improvements
there if anything no way out of a
ramp-up period that you wouldn't see on
a normal yeah it takes time to do the
handoff but what you do see is you're
not losing much if any battery life off
of that new faster better technology
we're maintaining the speed and getting
a boost in performance so that's where
that that power savings comes into play
when you see all that i'm going to call
it propaganda when you see the
propaganda the marketing from these
these processor manufacturers that's
where you're recovering all of that
extra power savings is in its a faster
processor you're not losing any battery
life so any other questions comments
you'd like to wrap up with the gracious
i have not muted I'm you Jason yeah I
want to ask Tony yes please uh what do
you think about the s4 launch in Romania
well the s4 isn't is not yet available
in Romania we don't have a exact date
the increasingly the carrier here which
has a fruity name I'm not gonna say his
name has it already on pre-order but and
interestingly they have it on stock so
it could be order now they could deliver
it to you right now but they are not
going to deliver it to you until May
five so we don't have any official way
of getting the s4 in Romania right now
okay and um you guys really do great
thing man I I really like it you know I
always suggest my friends to check Tupac
enough for anything because everyone
says this happens that happens you guys
say how it happens and how it how it
does and that's really great thanks a
lot either thank you that's yeah i'm
gonna lock my camera on you unless you
have any other final thoughts or
questions to anyone on the team that's
where you can follow them that's nirvana
Tony KL STRs we have separation any
other students Crichton thoughts no
nothing more thank you thank you very
much for joining us and
next week sure here bye-bye and with
this I'm gonna hand it over to Taylor
please all right um I'm gonna have to go
with I think I've seen everyone else
spoken with them before except for I
guess it is it whoa whoa Louis calm down
I headphones are going crazy is
everybody out seeing that he's like
joining and leaving really quickly I'm
looking at the chat right now and he is
just flying run long i'm coming us yeah
I was gonna say is it Bogdan Bogdan I
don't know how to pronounce that but uh
if you could unmute yourself awesome how
are you doing today book that I'm
hearing myself and his mic or speakers
but no it's not him he Bob that he had
to unmute your microphone from the top
right corner he is from my country okay
he's getting some audio feedback but I
don't see we can't hear you okay choose
somebody else will go come back to the
bugga all right is it a is it on you on
you I don't know how to pronounce it
either I'm terrible with names we go
over this every state yeah hi how are
you doing I'm very fine sanction so I
guess stars this um what phone do you
have and what size battery doesn't have
i have an HTC One X and it's just got
the standard 800 million up baby on
power battery right and how does that
last of the last you all day half the
day or what it slows me about half a day
before I stick on the charger yeah okay
oh now let me ask you this because the
way I do things is when I think my phone
is going to die before the end of the
day I charge it when it's around maybe
fifty percent or something when you say
that you have to charge it about half
the day is that completely dead or is it
maybe a 20-30 consumers well I'll
consider charging it at about two
percent so yeah I let it dry completely
had two percent that's impressive yeah
so I guess the question we had in this
the whole thing was would you prefer a
thicker phone with a larger battery or a
phone like George right now but last
maybe have sorte with you know half the
day on a single charge but that's way to
put it put it well much for first
battery life of a sickness to be honest
okay well I guess mmm well we're asking
i guess is the opposite of that um would
you put up with a pick a phone provider
battery battery life uh yes city would
okay yeah um the funny thing about 1 x
is when I had it I had problems of my
battery like and AT&amp;amp;T rep rip or not a
replica customer service I was in the
home of them they tried to send me a
spare battery for my one x I tried to
explain to them three or four times yeah
I'm echoing people's different speakers
we good another than that coach gun was
gonna group those people without head on
it home so maybe we could turn on your
speakers maybe a little I just get a
nice awesome that work too and yeah I
tried to explain to them three or four
times that they the One X doesn't have a
removal battery it's it's integrated my
guys like i'll send you a removable for
a spare battery in the mail uh it was
kind of funny but yeah um you have any
questions for us or Tony and Joe yeah
got some questions on I'm thinking of
buying the HTC One and I just want to
ask how good the battery life is I think
we're gonna have to leave that one to
Tony I haven't had it yet I haven't even
had a chance to hold it my hand yet
neither still far I'm gonna tell you
this much your day-to-day usage probably
is different than my day-to-day usage
but the way I use my phone whether if
it's the iphone the galaxy s3 be no to
orally
TC 1 is the same usage so using the
phone as I normally would on the HTC One
I'm getting approximately two two and a
half days of battery life without a
charge that means the usual stuff email
social networking browsing the Internet
listening to music and so on but this
again could vary depending on your usage
so stop it up I'm pretty Brittany how
should I say that satisfied yeah that's
the word what the HTC one's battery life
yeah it's it's tough to judge battery
life because there are so many different
factors do you connect to Wi-Fi ninety
percent of the time how fast you have
things updating twitter facebook what
brightness level there are so many
different things that come into play
when you're judging battery life so it's
how many social networks do you have it
connected to how many emails do you send
everything that's huge so that that's
why it's so difficult to judge battery
life especially with like when we're
posting a review and we've only had it
for a week it's hour battery life that
we've had and not necessarily a broad
scope it's very limited because we use
our phones very differently we email
like crazy and and just all sorts of
different things and through that time
through these review periods we're
shooting photos shooting videos playing
games that we normally wouldn't play so
it's installing a whole bunch of apps
yeah so it's very tricky it's very
tricky so do you have any more questions
for us or anything else you'd like to
say uh oh shoot was quite difficult for
the samsung galaxy s4 it comes to a 2600
milliamp hour battery right don't
believe the three yes so do you think
that if you actually get something
access for do you think you could make
it through a day on heavy usage I
probably couldn't I mean I struggle with
the galaxy note 2 to make it to a day so
freely
yeah so it just depends but probably not
I could but I it all depends on your
gear use it I probably could but Taylor
no Joe not a chance and I guess it
depends on the on the day if I'm working
a lot yet I probably good because I
probably wouldn't touch it at all but on
a standard day probably not yeah also
one last question is why do you think
that manufacturers don't put sort of
bigger batteries in their phones I mean
most 5-inch phones they don't get past
the 2700 milliamp hour mark so I just
don't get why cause I want this with you
I want this one battery size battery
life doesn't cell phones what does cell
phones for some reason marketing
departments seem to think that having
the thinnest phone or the slimmest phone
or the the sexiest phone sells better
than anything else they can put that
speck on their advertise it and make all
kinds of positive news and buzz about
their device over somebody else's it's X
percent thinner than somebody else its
life you know x % lighter batteries to
take up space and batteries are heavy so
if they put a bitter bigger battery in
there it's going to be thicker it's
going to be heavier they're going to
lose out on those really sexy terms that
they can throw out there in all of their
marketing and batteries just aren't sexy
statistics I like big batteries that in
fact i was showing the guys before the
show this is my favorite battery right
there almost dad's mar 07 amp hour at
7,000 milliamp hours if my conversion is
correct of course that just has
connectors that i have to hook up to a
bag valve or a connector but yeah but i
can do it and i can charge anything
anywhere and it's great but back to your
question it doesn't cell phones it might
sell accessories like Tony's got a way
awesome accessory but it doesn't
phones and that's what they're after
when they're putting the stock battery
in their devices yep HTC did a little
I'm sorry go ahead uh what I don't get
is if i crack open let's say God's
history there is a big space left over
from you know sim cards batteries and
microSD cards I'm sorry shall be young
enough to go no problem no problem all
right so there's that all those bereaved
questions all around those for the rest
of you I was gonna say that um HTC did a
study a while back Wow Lois's what is
this going on every time I talk Luis
it's lily's trying to join and coming
back and he doesn't like me but he
doesn't like me every time I've had a
talk anyway um HTC did a survey a while
back maybe last year i believe it was
right before the 1x came out maybe right
after or they released the findings that
people wanted thinner phones over larger
batteries now the wording that they used
in their survey was very tricky it was
something like would you prefer a
thinner phone or a larger battery now
the fact that the old motorola atrix and
I matrix droid razr maxx so not the HD
the razr maxx was just as thin as the
razor if you carried it out flat from
the camera huh so it was basically the
razor the droid razr and he fight with
his flat back like without the camera
home so it was thicker but it was the
same thickness as they were the same
thickness at the camera hop right so
you're adding a millimeter or two it's
not even that much it's not much it's
not that much at all point being you can
have high-end specifications and a 3300
milliamp hour battery and it not be a
brick that's the the thing that HTC
wasn't I guess elaborating on in that
survey and I would rush rather have a 9
millimeter thick foam than something
that's I don't know seven or six point
nine millimeters that's yeah well yeah
what is that like 14 millimeter size
that is
actually two centimeters so that's
really thick it is but um yeah I mean I
would rather have a phone that's nine or
ten millimeters thick and last me for
three or four days like my blackberry
used to on a single charge I would love
that well and if you would go back to
that survey then if that question had
been asked differently for example if it
had been asked which would you prefer a
thinner phone or a phone that lasts
longer before it needs to be recharged
ooh then you might get a little bit
different response to that because when
you say thinner phone bigger battery
you're you're taking two different
specifications it's two different things
you're saying do you want a thin phone
or do you want a fat phone that's the
implication of that question yeah it's
not a valid question and that's why
there are three kinds of lies there's
lies damn lies and statistics those
stats come from surveys that are written
to get the answer that they're looking
for it supports their marketing
department not the will of well all of
us right okay i think it is my turn and
before i do that i have a couple of
questions i am desperately trying to
monitor the comments on our youtube
channel and we have a couple of comments
right here and i'm going to read a
couple of those for instance RTE CPC
when is it good to charge a phone fully
drained or half well this is no longer a
tricky question we have lithium polymer
or lithium ion batteries in our phones
so they had no memory effect no oh they
do with they do the general idea is to
charge them whenever you can charge them
this is my answer and if Joe can can
complement perfectly so my rebuttal to
that is that has been the generally
accepted answer ever since we switched
over from nicad over to lithium both
lithium ion and lithium polymer
batteries nicad had a terrible terrible
memory effect to it essentially when you
would charge the battery up and it would
discharge
would release these microscopic bubbles
inside the battery and if you didn't
drain it all the way out then those
bubbles would be there and it would
they'd service insulators and not let
the battery charge up so you'd have to
discharge a completely recharged it
completely and that's where that whole
thing came from lithium-ion was supposed
to be getting around that and lithium
polymer is the same technology as a
lithium ion it's just in a polymer
instead of in a another substrate so
don't worry about that technicality it's
the same thing Toyota very very recently
I think just earlier this week I they
they do all kinds of cool stuff with
hybrid cars I have a Prius so I've got a
battery pack in the back of my car no
jokes about my Prius guys I got it
because I'm machine okay they found that
lithium battery technology does in fact
have a memory effect and it becomes more
and more visible the older the batteries
get in our smartphones we're not going
to see it as much because we throw them
away every one to two years so it's
they're just not as visible but it's
still there how we can address that and
how we can get around that we still
don't know the answer to that question
yet battery university is an awesome
website for learning the ins and outs of
lithium-ion lithium polymer and other
battery technologies and the way that
they explain it is basically think of it
as if you let your phone discharge to
sixty percent over and over and over
every time you charge it up plug it up
at sixty percent basically the time is
going to take for your phone to
discharge from one hundred percent to
sixty percent is going to get quicker
and when it hits sixty percent and goes
to zero percent that'll drain slower so
you get that effect over time so the
best thing to do is to not do the same
exact thing every time the battery is
going to die eventually as in lifespan
not charged but your battery will die
eventually every battery has a limited
number of times it can be charged and
that's around maybe a thousand or two
thousand times but the thing is you need
to do
charge it differently every time
otherwise you're going to wear out the
same percentage and it's going to drain
quicker to one percentage and it'll
drain slower so you indeed calculation
even if if it is good for a thousand
cycles that is two point seven years I
mean you'll have to charge your phone
twice twice a year to get through a
contract so i think that's good so one
other thing being a ham radio guy we we
talk a lot about battery technologies
thanks Taylor laughs at me when I say
I'm a ham radio guy the batteries are
really important because we have
batteries in our radios which a phone is
just a specialized radio and operates on
different frequencies and whatnot and
then you saw my really big honkin
battery all that battery's regardless of
type whether its lithium-ion nicad or
even lead acid they all follow kind of
the same rule of thumb with charge
discharge some more than others but
essentially you want to keep your
battery between twenty percent and
eighty percent now I'm not saying that
as soon as you hit twenty percent charge
your battery and only charge it up to
eighty percent I'm not saying that at
all i'm saying if you can keep your
battery between those two kind of those
two points in general use you'll have a
happier battery it will last longer and
you'll get more life more usable life
out of every charge by doing so so and
especially if you're going to put it on
the shelf make sure you you keep it
stored somewhere between 20 and 80 don't
have it fully charged don't have it
fully discharged somewhere in the middle
is is better okay guys I know you too
you can talk about this until all day
but another question from Matthew I
think I'm gonna be the only one
answering to this do you think getting
the nokia 808 in 2013 for its camera is
still a good idea well if you're going
to use your smartphone that is the 808
PureView only for its camera yes it's a
good idea if you're going to use it for
your daily driver as a smartphone no
it's not a
good idea symbian that's all i've got to
say yes but other insert yeah it's not a
phone it's a camera with phone
capability wrecked yeah and in that case
get the galaxy camera and right now in
this round the last question is for Joe
and myself it's from sul I ate he says
in one weekly podcast you had a very
interesting discussion about licenses
and if i buy a phone do I really own it
own the hardware or software can you
discuss it now this isn't worse because
if you remember Joe the two of us were
on on that podcast and I said if you buy
the hardware the harbor is yours but the
software it is not really yours because
there are certain copyrights and
licenses in place and and you tend it to
disagree at that point yes and it really
depends on the the way the question is
being asked you don't own the software
in that you don't own the source code
you do not own the the right or the
ability to change it to decompile it to
modify it so along those lines all agree
completely with Tony and you do however
in my opinion and I am NOT a lawyer so I
am not dispensing legal advice you do
however own the license to use that
software and to configure that software
to whatever use you want to now that's
where the line comes in what is
configuration and what is hacking if I
can put a wallpaper on the back of my
tablet or the back of my smartphone or
the back of my desktop computer that's
configuring it how I want arranging
icons how I want installing programs how
I want if I can going back to windows
mobile and windows days if I can go in
and make a change to my registry that
lets me use it in a different manner is
that okay or is it not I'm of the
opinion that it's my hardware
it's my device if I'm changing data on
my device I can do that but some people
will disagree and yeah he's right there
yes okay and one final shout out this is
to Nicholas veal this is a shout out a
negative 1 people say that you are
having racist jokes on youtube please
stop that we don't like those so thank
you very much and I may or may not have
been an executive there and just blocked
him so let's move on and see if Bogdan
yo nesco do you have your audio issues
sorted out can you hear us we cannot
hear you first of all there is an unmute
icon on your top right corner and if
that doesn't work you might want to
check your settings within gmail to use
your proper microphone okay we'll get
back to you no problem let us talk to
hamza llaman or jama or I've completely
mispronounced your name please unmute
your microphone it's times a jumbo is
JAMA okay I got I got it right from the
second turn how are you how is your
battery life uh my I'm good my battery
life is decent but I thought you only
been back I just got the HTC One and I'm
this I can't believe you can get two
days a half out of it finally to get a
buddy everybody's being calling me and
HTC One fanboy I kept on telling people
the HTC One is good for two days of
battery life and they were you're such
an HTC One fanboy no here's jama telling
you the same thing i'm glad you did that
I thought he was saying that he couldn't
believe it I can see I yeah that's why i
said i can't believe you got two days
and a half out of it when I really okay
then the other way around let's see Oh
howdy how do you use your phone how many
email accounts do you have how many
accounts do you have in general which
are sinking and how much
well no screen time is not allowed by
HTC so just let's see how use your from
convenient well I have a 3d mug i'm
sanna have them continue thinking of
Twitter Facebook have Instagram that's
pretty much here I use a couple of games
you usually just listen to podcast then
with music in the morning and I watch a
couple of video youtube videos about the
suffice and then throughout the day it
just eats and eats away so you know I
without the phone actually showing you
your screen on time because HTC was kind
of slimy at that and disabled it how
much do you think your screen is on like
two hours three hours four hours how
much would you say Broxson all day about
you always have about three to four
hours and I think that that's a good
better life yeah computer for hours of
screen all time is good well I special
night if that's an estimate then you
know i would i would have guessed a long
time ago that my screen all time was a
lot higher than it was but it's actually
like two hours one or two hours and this
brings me to my main question what would
you sacrifice for more battery life on
the HTC one would you sacrifice the
thickness or thinness or would you
sacrifice money would you prefer that
your HTC one would look like this thick
or would you probably have the same
thinness or thickness and may be paying
twenty five thirty dollars more for the
HTC one just for you to get through two
days or three days of better life i
would pay for I would do either I would
pay money out I know enjoy having a
thicker phone because sometimes this is
too thin and it just slips on my hand
and then if it drops and then there's
time for that you just crack scratch
like that yeah don't drop it yeah don't
ruffle Julie Taylor will tell you about
that next week oh yeah you had to ruin
it for me Tony what what I wanted to ask
about this particular like show was a
which one would you
you rather have like a quick touch time
or a high-capacity I personally was
never pro a quick charge time because
I'm an old school guy and I always
thought that you have to charge your
batteries according to the manual if
your battery is of 25 million powers
then you always have to charge it with
ten percent / its own charger so I would
always probably charge my phone with its
own charger and prefer a longer battery
life than a faster charging time I think
he may be referencing the graphene
technology that I was talking about is
that what you're talking about like the
like a 10 second charge time if you plug
your phone up and it's fully charged in
ten seconds I don't want I did I think
everybody will love it and second charge
time Athena's that's just that's just
insane but yeah why would you want that
tony but well basically if I'm not a
specialist in batteries but if you know
a little bit of chemistry and how
batteries are working you know that
there are a lot of chemistry going on
within the battery cells itself and if
if you go through that or over that
particular threshold which is the normal
physical chemical threshold of the cells
themselves and the interactions
chemically which happen while charging
the phone you know that there's there
are pros and cons when you charge your
phone quickly you will probably kill
your battery faster if you charge your
phone slower probably your battery will
last longer but then the cons are that
you are charging slower well the rate at
which the cells themselves would charge
is about the same what's happening is
right now like I was saying with this
you charge from the inside to the
outermost cells so they charge one by
one one at a time just from the inside
to the outside and with this new
technology they would all charged
simultaneously all at the same time like
all the same speed that the cells are
charging but they all charge at the
exact same time so if another way to
look at that Taylor is the the cells on
the
cells themselves are interconnected so
what you're doing first is your charging
the first cell and then the first cell
charges the cell down the road and then
it charges the one down the road and on
and on and on so the the cells that are
first in line are the ones that get the
most use and they're also promote the
ones that that we're out I mean it's
just like a physical thing if you had a
mechanical object that's the thing that
gets the most where is going to wear out
soon it's just going to break Souness
and then everything downstream is dead
the point that Tony is getting at is
kind of interesting and that puts us
into less of the realm of batteries more
into the realm of capacitors which are
designed for very very rapid charge
times and very very rapid discharge the
downside to those however is they
usually don't have very large capacities
or if they do they're ridiculously large
capacitors yeah the graphing technology
is actually considered a supercapacitor
super capacitor which I couldn't
understand but i don't know i'm not an
expert on it i just know that the
technology itself sounds amazing but
just one one thing Missy gelpi or ELP I
kept on muting you for like three or
four times either please you stay muted
or I will have to kick you out so thank
you very much back to you guys yep so
that that's all I'm gonna say i don't
know the ins and outs of it i don't know
what the lifespan of a supercapacitor
graphene battery would be but the
technology itself sounds amazing yeah I
knew I don't think you already know what
it is it yeah I would love there are 22
different types that I've found and I
don't know the interesting intricate
details but being able to just say my
phone as two percent let it charge
almost all deplete almost all the way
right before I walk out i plug it up
unplug and I'm fully charged I mean
that's mind-blowing you wouldn't need a
three thousand million power battery
you'd need you even 1000 million power
battery might even suffice because you
it would last shorter time like it
wouldn't last 20 years but you get the
point when I'm saying I guess
essentially the other possibility is you
charge something up and it lasts you for
an hour and then at that point you have
to find another place yeah charge yeah
you know it's the same thing with with
electric vehicles electric vehicles are
great I mean there were some of the
first vehicles introduced even before
the internal combustion engine way back
hundred years ago the problem is how do
you charge them how do you get them
charged and you've got to have that
charging infrastructure in place so when
you get downtown in your electric car
you have something to plug into so you
can get to the next store and eventually
get back at home with this type of
technology if you don't have a large
enough capacity in the battery or the
supercapacitor itself to get you to that
next charging point it's it's a
non-issue it's never going to work it's
a chicken in the egg you've got to have
that infrastructure and that goes back
to some of the articles that I've
written on the wireless charging
standards and how that could be used as
long as we start getting that getting it
more ubiquitous if if we start having
this wireless charging in our table at
work or in the table at the coffee shop
or in the seat on the bus and whatever
it may be once that infrastructure is in
place then we really you know we're
freed from this shackle of a battery as
long as we're inside the metropolitan
area or our homes once we get out onto
the open road or you know out in the
wilderness it's a different story and
that's when we had to have big
capacities we have a saying around here
where I live which is close to the
Hungarian border so it's either a
Hungarian saying or a Romanian saying
that we Joe Taylor and myself have
verbal diarrhea so let's let's get back
to Hamza do you have any other thoughts
or questions
handsome one question that comes to mind
um yes please why does everybody hate
you see Bing feed that is interesting
i'm not using the HTC one at the moment
because i'm using some the Frankenstein
film as my daily driver the phantom
phone if I would take out the HTC one
from the drawer I might actually do that
because it actually has fastboot on i
will show you how my HTC blinkfeed looks
so right now i'm personally power button
i'm gonna lock the camera on me it's
booting up right now and it should be up
in a couple of seconds the idea is that
i am not that social in my private life
i have a couple of friends most of them
are from pocket now this is the HTC One
loot up sound and I don't really have
that many contents stories or or
pictures or anything else I want to see
on my blinkfeed so this is my blinkfeed
that looks like a big blank screen
they're told that is indeed any big
blank screen so that's that I'm not
complaining about it it's awesome just
like Facebook home for those who live
very intensely socially but not for me
fair enough any other questions or
observations I thought I mean I live in
the UK and I can't get poking out my
dream complete do you know that why does
you have to go okay hold on I'm gonna
have to borrow a hot again you have to
go you have to go into your blinkfeed
and hold on just one second actually
there's a article on pocket which I
wrote on how to enable it well this is
fast it's already on I'm not gonna show
you my wallpaper because that's you know
guys why he has to look you know your
hold on let me lock my camera you have
to go to your blinkfeed settings and
then go into topics and services and
then you will have to go to categories
and scroll down to technology and
science and wooden technology and
science thick mobile
and once you do that I'm not sure if
yeah that's I have one last quote
smartphone just just stick mobile and
then press back and once you with Vishnu
mobile then there should be a limitation
probably according to your region which
is in the UK but right now i'm scrolling
down and i'm trying to find a story oh
here's one i'm not sure if the camera
can focus but you can clearly see the
pocket now logo right there yep so
that's that's the way you should be able
to do it and let me unlock my camera in
my face any any other questions it's not
over that's fine ok good man I will
thank you very much for joining us and
if you want to tell everybody work to
find you on Twitter or Google+ or
Facebook this is your occasion there's a
huge lag yeah oh I'm not sure he's
hearing us anymore so thank you very
much about joining us is Hg he does go
out ok repeat that because I totally
ruined it for you hey my twitter handle
with HJ ch I ll I awesome so everybody
go follow him he's an awesome guy thank
you very much for joining us and come
back next week and before I hand it over
to uh I think it's your turn I will try
to read one no I will have a
announcement to make I have read a
couple of nicholas Nicholas is comment
Nicholas you are now banned from
pocketknives youtube account thank you
very much for being whatever you are ok
then other question he says Anton do you
think getting the naki I the way this
was already answered I'd like to buy it
oh yeah an external battery
back I've seen lots of Chinese batteries
on ebay but I want to buy something high
quality what do you guys recommend i
recommend you follow pocketnow next week
and you'll see two of my reviews
regarding a battery life if any of you
Joe or Taylor have anything more to add
Phyllis i have used several several
several i don't even know how many now
my charge products and they are
fantastic the quality is great this
thing is actually enormous though it's
the my charge peak 6000 and I've got two
of them how much I love them and it's
great it's got the old 30-pin cable at
the bottom a micro USB port or cable
tucked into the side and a USB cable
here for charging and USB port so it's
packed with all kinds of stuff in it
it'll charge most phones three times
problem with that is it's not portable
and that kind of defeats the purpose of
it and go in a bag and it works it works
if you use a backpack or a purse or
something but I don't I don't carry a
purse you need to get you some tactical
pants with big pockets and then a bill
because i didn't know um c-czar says man
purse over in the conference yes and I
agree it's called a satchel assassin I
always had that on me when it's summer
so I don't have any pockets on me and
I'm not with the car so I have to have
some place where i need to put all my
gear I can't fully put this one or
myself behind this one yet is the I
guess is pronounced anchor it's on
amazon but basically this is 4,500
million powers and it is almost the
exact same size as the HTC first it's
it's small and it's 4,500 million powers
I can't really say anything about it yet
because I haven't used it I have been
slaving away behind a computer for
several days and I have left so I don't
need a battery pack right now but there
are so many of them on amazon in in
wireless retail stores you can go up to
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T Verizon they have them
all there now and they're everywhere but
this has got to be my favorite I have a
bunch of these things if you haven't
figured that
already I love battery packs and this is
my favorite you can't buy these
unfortunately I got it at a long yes you
are lucky to be at CES Wow I got this at
CES and Huawei was giving them out at
the door to their ascend mate and ascend
d2 yeah yeah yeahs at that event and
they were handed these out at the door
to the press and this is two thousand
million Bowers and it is tiny it is very
tiny this is the first again I mean it's
just it's a little itty bitty thing and
it's really thin I throw this in my
pocket every where I'm going yeah but
you only get one charge one charge well
how many am I gonna need like it depends
on how are you traveling if I'm
traveling I got a bag with me I got this
thing could happen I've I have a lot of
power bags too so see this thing lights
up yeah oh wow my phones don't die my
phones don't die yo any any observations
on this particular question or topic I
have only tried portable batteries twice
the first one was a really cheap Chinese
one and when I say really cheap Chinese
I mean cheap not that everything made in
China is cheap but this one this one
unfortunately was and I'm staring over
at the box right now given at the
stink-eye it was awful it did have a
solar panel on one side of it which made
it all kinds of cool and that solar
panel was enough to light up a little
green LED and make you think that it was
doing something but it really wasn't in
the operation for this show I just
ordered an igo charger which is only
1800 milliamp hours it's about the same
size as their double and triple a wall
charger I've got some over there that
are off camera it looks really nice I
haven't gotten it yet it costs 10 bucks
including shipping though so I figured I
couldn't pass it up the downside is it
took longer to get here than I would
have hoped so I can't show it to you but
that leads me to a question that one
looks exactly like the the like I said
the double a battery charger it looks
like it's exactly the same size
looks like it came off the same mold but
it's only 1800 milliamp hours one double
a battery is like 2600 milliamp hours
and the wall charger can hold four of
them so doing the math that's carry the
six that's a lot more than 1,800
milliamp hours so I'm just I don't know
okay we're at is that that's good or not
bragging time does anybody have a larger
battery than I do this is the this is
the 11,000 milliamp hour mugen or mugen
power battery and if you want to compare
it to okay the iphone 5 because
everybody knows the iphone 5 it is this
much thicker but it is it is not much
taller and this will actually give you
five six or seven charges depending on
your battery life and the final question
there's one interesting one here and
then I'm going to hand it over to Joe
Ahmed says 920 this spring or the 928 or
the nokia e OS my personal question is
if the Nokia EOS becomes a reality
beyond rumors I will definitely go for
the nokia eos even if i would have to
wait until autumn to get it so if you
guys have any other input on this hands
off yeah I time I'm in the same boat i
don't think i can offer an opinion yeah
I would but to be honest I haven't even
really kept track with the EOS rumors
let me know that Tony is the nokia eos
what is basically the real nokia
pureview on Windows Phone which would be
the 41-megapixel camera 19 20 Oh is
having a baby and everything within the
super awesome phone which would be my
daily driver um we have a challenger
here as it I'm afraid I'm gonna say it
wrong but donessa um she said I'm gonna
get help for this but Mike my battery is
bigger than Tony's basically solution
show me yours I'll show you mine
Tony well why don't we go ahead and turn
over 22 donessa then I know she's been
on the show before but really quick show
us your big battery and why it is better
than Tony's while she's getting that and
we're waiting a Joe I didn't I don't
know if I told you the price this anchor
one was 27 bucks free shipping so that's
when he never walks 4,500 million powers
that's why I got it I was like for
thirty bucks ah it's hard to say that
that would lose much yeah Vanessa unmute
ah you just had to come alive haha she
says it's not the same kind of battery
over in the in the chat maybe it's like
mine the 7 amp hour battery right there
my car battery is bigger than all
y'all's my I have a UPS for my TV and it
is a battery 0 into have to say that my
first hard drive which is a 10 meg
harddrive back in 1994 was bigger than
your battery yes yes there they are
large but remember guys I have a Prius
so everyone who's saying my car battery
is bigger than yours ah I gotta say that
till I get my Tesla Roadster oh dude if
you get one get to just so you can go
back up I saw one the other day on the
side of the street charging and I was
like oh I just want to drive it around
the block italy 0 all right are we ready
to move on our next person then all
right I think it's my turn Derek it
looks like you are from Canada that is
just across the border from me so go
ahead unmute pop in and tell us what
phone you have how big your battery is
and if it's big enough to get you
through the day if not how long does it
last I got the HTC One and I got three
more batteries along with it
and plus I got even this which is a
little solar panel battery oh nice how
do you like that one I don't really use
it much because it never worked till
like this year I just decided to try it
again and it actually did work I got a
couple years ago for 15 bucks it only
holds 800 2 milliamps well you know and
that's what does everyone else have
video for Derek yeah I saw video I don't
have video yeah Taylor whatever that's
all right Elvis slump over know my
corner I'll tell you a picture after
okay so that's just go off on a little
bit of attention I won't go to diarrhea
Tony so don't worry about that people
think that you know you can slap a very
small solar panel on something or even a
solar panel that's transparent on top of
a phone's display and have that thing
just run forever and ever and ever and
free yourself from the man and you never
have to plug in again on people don't
realize that solar technology especially
the you know the flexible kind that you
need to be more durable and thin the
thin film technology that you'd have to
use in these applications is not really
really efficient you have to have a
somewhat large battery in fact you know
what I'm gonna make a lot of noise here
this is my solar panel but I can see
that that is make sure i'm not lying
here this is 5 watt in direct sunlight
that's very cool it takes a long time to
charge up yo I'm not hijack this for
just a couple of seconds and I'm gonna
come I had this exact conversation with
a friend the other day why don't phone
manufacturers bring on solar charging
for smartphones and I have a question
for you guys where is your smartphone
when you do not use it which is probably
ninety percent of the time it is either
in your pockets in your purses in your
drawers on your table so outside of
direct sunlight or any other direct
light so that will probably
he'll the purpose go on theatre that is
true but solar panels would probably
change our use habits and so I mean if
your mom's good luck we'd be like this
all the time looking for the Sun like
the charge on a full charge my phone now
now that said there has been a phone
with a solar panel on the back I don't
know if it was you Joe that was on a
podcast with me or it was if it was
Hymie but it was one of you too um but
we talked about the Puma foam I can't
remember who manufactured it but several
years ago there was a phone called the
Puma foam and it was branded by Puma
those athletic sports athletic whatever
the brand of sports equipment and it had
a solar panel on the back and basically
you could flip your phone upside down
and lay it face up or I guess back up
while you were listening to music and it
would hold its charge so if you were
using the phone at all if the display
was on the solar panel in the back would
still not really do much so it was kind
of say come say Jim I don't know how to
pronounce that that's right Cesare Cesar
but yes it was a puma phone and solar
panel really didn't do much it was there
for marketing I guess if you were using
the phone it might be able to maintain
it maintain the battery but it didn't
really charge fast there are a lot of
different external alternate power
sources out there um there was a little
dongle that you could plug into your
phone's micro USB port or at the time I
think was mini USB and you could charge
your phone from the ambient unused
wireless signals so if you're in the
range of our Wi-Fi network it would pull
that energy in and just trickle charge
your phone so there are so many
different things out there but the
reason that we don't use them it's
because they're not that efficient so
then they are not efficiency even even
the the processors it's all about
efficiency making things more efficient
has been and will probably continue to
be the focus of manufacturers into the
indefinite future we just hope that
battery technology will start
catching up and make that leap and
supercapacitors uh you know
nanotechnology graphene and whatnot
that's that's interesting that's neat
will it be adopted as the next
lithium-ion or lithium polymer I sure
hope so either that or something else
and I hope it's soon I'm the report said
that they were in talks with some
manufacturers it was a university that
that discovered the technology and they
were talking to some manufacturers but
even then we might not see it for three
four or five years the university of
utah decade or two back came out with
cold fusion and it was all the rage hey
cold fusion cold fusion room temperature
fusion woohoo and then it was fake so no
but reproduce it so why is Ben not the
case here but yeah this has been outed
twice in the past six months by two
different universities mom was in Korea
and one was I some University I don't
know where somewhere in the States we
only have two or three universities in
the state's yeah right it's one of those
all right so I think we're still talking
with their pic so sorry again uh it's
chronic today let's let's turn the mic
over to you do you have questions or
comments for us either on topic off
topic that you'd like to either share
with us or have us try and answer for
you not too much you think they'll make
a big phone like a thick thick phone
that'd be tough and big battery would
actually good specs at any time um my
thought is that's going to be a niche
product yes we will have them there's
probably some of them all out there
today although I can't think of any
names off the top of my head but they're
they're designed for and marketed for
those people who need very very durable
and hardened devices whether that's
field technicians whether that soldiers
in the theater or whatnot that just have
to be durable they have to be tough and
they have to have a long battery life
because they don't have the ability to
charge or maybe they have even more
power demands
than what a normal person like you or I
would have is that going to bleed over
into normal people like you and I
probably but not not it we're not going
to see a civilian version of that device
for example it's just people are more
interested in in thin and sexy and right
now at least in the US the carrier's
drive what those specs are and people
just don't want durable that's what you
buy your big thick otterbox case for to
slap on your phone and make it look ugly
anyway so yeah that's what i do i drop
my phone probably twice a day no problem
all right Cooper I honestly don't care
like I just I treat it as I'd like to
like said I want to be watching over
every second I like to just because I
like I'm if I go fishing aboard my dad's
boat I just have to if I have to all
sudden do something I should have to
chuck it to a side I can't deal with my
home plate down nicely and then go help
someone I have to okay it phones nothing
right now yeah a little fun story a
friend of mine just came back from boot
camp he's a new marine not accustomed to
carrying a cell phone with him since he
can't carry one in boot and I told me a
story about his galaxy s3 i believe it
was i he went hot tubbing in his jeans
and forgot that he had a phone in for
about 45 minutes or an hour so it was
all kinds of crazy but it works to say
he needs a new phone all right well
thank you very much Derek why don't you
share with us how we can get a hold of
you on Twitter Facebook Google+ however
you're socially connected I would and I
can't even remember what my twitter
handle is because I don't tweet anything
I've never tweeted anything yet so not
really going to hold of Derek just uh
let us know and we'll track him down boy
hey sound good all right thank you very
much for joining us Tony do you have any
more questions or comments from us from
I have just one comment from from
YouTube it's a question he says HTC this
label screen on time and battery stats
yes that is correct you cannot show
screen on time on the HTC One stock
unless you have a specific third-party
application which monitors your exact
battery usage but HTC was slimy and you
cannot see how much time the screen took
from your battery and with this I'm
gonna hand it over a bigger yes yes how
convenient all right um I'm gonna have
to choose gosh is it Missy me see you
have to unmute yourself or just right I
want I'm in youth in for one second
before we go on the book done do you do
you happen to have sold your your audio
problems because if you have I think so
yes my dear you know how to bog down now
and we'll talk to me see and right after
this thank you thank you very um yeah I
can ask you first a question this is
more for Joe and Tyler because they have
the nexus 4 I yeah so this pattern on
the screen like very well i think is the
touchscreen but i'm not sure like a
diamond pattern under the glass yeah
that's your digitizer correct yeah you
can see it real real visibly in direct
sunlight it just kind of reflects off
its really kind of cool it's kind of
pretty if you ask me but yeah that that
is the the digitizer layer of the screen
if i understand correctly there's
there's my nexus for now oh nice you got
the the yellow of I've got the carbon
fiber yeah I was your suggestion they
sent me to just because silly apparently
the adhesive they're not happy with but
it's stuck out of the good for me yeah
mine's fine if I didn't if we get that
question answered for you yeah I think
and we saw hard to find accessories for
this one in Romania um I have a case
which is I don't like it that it makes
it thicker and horrible
as I just took off right there I carry
mine naked most the time yeah I want one
of those I have a bumper for it to which
is my bumper broke so did your original
Nexus 4 shut that hey that is currently
at LG right now and they may be fixing
it for me so nice I just realized that I
saw your pebble I'm not even wearing
mine Oh Jan I sorry diary again Tony
I'll taking imodium afterwards shooting
a new band right there about the pebble
we can understand that yeah I got a
really nice band for mine as well I
couldn't find it i read your blog post
the one to the local watch shop yeah
yeah they called me and apologized and
offered to install this band for me free
of charge as a way to make up for it but
you know not in Dixie roller yeah 3
minutes less than that but yeah you have
any more questions for us yeah I
recently when I got the mixes for uh I
was fascinated about NFC and all the
things you can do with it and I start
thinking about how could it be to have
your laptop with an area that NFC
because I stay like five or six hours a
day on my laptop and ipod my oh there's
my energy yeah but not an NFC tag like
you just put your phone may I sit it on
your computer and make my first up
through NFC well well you don't use NFC
to transfer very large files so what it
would do is that NFC would basically
only either instantiate a ad-hoc
connection between the two or a
Bluetooth connection right then it would
but the problem is that you can already
connect most computers and phones
through bluetooth and ad-hoc isn't that
difficult if you use something like
Wi-Fi file explorer pro or air droid
there are a lot of different
applications out there that allow you to
send files back and forth
through a file system i was like i'm too
lazy to search going to blow to the
devices and then connectors have weight
onto a minute I do have a question for
you though I'm you're using the nexus 4
how does it last you in battery life
since this is about battery life I think
I have a splasha eat when I get home
from school is like fifty percent I
never come home with less than 50 per se
and there's not yeah and then I play for
two hours shadow them and then Angry
Birds and then whatever can I stop doing
my homework and yeah now it's a
30-percent and I played half an hour is
mine right now it's it's not even
powered on I'm one hour 19 minutes on
battery and I'm at eighty-eight percent
but I keep mine on a one of the little
or be chargers for when I'm at work and
then here at home I'll unplug this and
show ya I've got my my energizer big
hunk o Qi charging pad Oh or chain or I
forgot how to pronounce it already cheap
yet she um yeah I don't know about my
nexus 4 i've forgotten my battery life
because i'm using this little facebook
phone here um but yeah it's okay so tell
me this would you rather the nexus 4 be
slightly thicker with say 400 more
milliamp hours 600-800 a thousand Lauren
powers or would you rather it be or
maybe even have a removable battery yeah
I like the thing with the removable
battery just because I am so scared of
dropping it that's why I have that case
which I hate it yeah be sure that when I
yeah it doesn't break oh these these
little things are great they go
necessarily protect the glass from
shattering but you don't know if the
glass is shatter do not so like I said
in before it's kind of out of sight out
of mind you don't really know well not
only that but it also protects the glass
from getting scratched which a scratched
piece of glass is much more likely to
break then an unscratched piece of glass
oh so it's going to resist breakage that
way and I got mine particularly so I'd
have a better grip on the back that back
glass is very slippery so it helps me
hold it in hand yep alright so do you
have any more questions oh go ahead yeah
I just wanted to say that you cannot
find those romania in romania I searched
for one yesterday and it was thirty
dollars on the shipping from UK wow yeah
and a question for anthem yes please
with that giant to battery power did you
have two days and I have actually not
managed to deplete it I am right now
still running on the first charge and i
will show you right now how much I have
looking like my camera on myself this is
what I have right now it is saying
forty-six percent after two days and
four hours criminy come on that is
exactly why we need removable batteries
on every device if you want to do that
you can if you don't also need any pants
I couldn't carry I would need a belt
clip well I oh I thought it was because
you got so excited about it oh whoa
we're taking it out of context there a
little bit I am carrying this one right
now because I'm testing it and after
right as this I will probably only carry
twice a year Aoife and mwc that's where
the days never seem to end okay if I
forgot about that don't need to get my
passport oh yeah do we have any more
questions bogdana no I just wanted to
show you a screenshot of my battery it's
a two days and seven hours and what is
is your screen on time I screen I'm
tired I don't know it doesn't stay in
percentages like little daughter back go
back yeah theater that's screenshot this
out the screenshot nevermind ramaya text
I make sure to check for this video it
was probably like two hours no more than
that yeah that sounds about right yeah
phones can last for days and days and
days on standby it's only when you start
you know turning the screen on it
actually using it that your battery goes
down go figure yeah finally my left home
before the nexus where I had the galaxy
gio low-end phone and after I wrote it
it and I put custom rom is that I have
two days standby and when I turn it on I
just leave the screen for half an hour
or something man any drain out
completely it was a weird whole battery
life only we have to move on really we
really have to move on and we thank you
for joining us and please come back next
week okay tell everybody when you put
our facebook google+ wherever you are
I'm not really that social but you can
find me on youtube as Max of nuts I do
some video projects and funny things
awesome or you can find him every week
here on pocketnow life thank you very
much for days and before we head over to
which is I think my turn I have one
question for for Joe and theater from
YouTube please try to answer this within
one minute the questions are art it's a
simple question rté CPC says what about
the battery life on the babble I get
three four days usually but I get a lot
of notifications so that's probably why
I'm sending a lot of stuff that you
wouldn't normally get on your pebble to
my pebble through if
just then that triggers and I'll code
all kinds of other stuff so my usage for
my pebble is really really high so I get
three to four days of battery life I'm
in the same boat i also have if this
then that via pushover that's my conduit
to get all my if 12 notifications yeah
thank you very much that by the way i
spent i don't know how many i'm probably
up to 18 20 hours on if calm setting up
rules and stuff so if you've just ruined
my life with efficiencies if nobody
knows what i'm talking about wow that
website if this then that is I ffffff
whatever calm I have TTT there you go
it's a little back to the question I'm
also a very very heavy user I will get a
notification sometimes three or four
every few minutes but I get at least
three days out of it I usually charged
up about every three days the most i've
gotten is actually the last time i had
to charge i got five days and that was
because I found out that I don't know if
it was in there before but you can turn
the notifications off now one minute
guys oh gosh oh gosh I'm only reason
that I'm getting worse battery life now
is because I've installed snake and
Tetris on that level there was a bug in
the iOS app that was causing a battery
life to be a bit lower it was between
one to three days for people connecting
to iOS they have if i read it right they
have fixed that and i think the app is
available now to put on your iphone
either that or it's awaiting approval so
if it's an iphone question about battery
life that has been fixed and you'll
either get that update now or shortly oh
my god the bucket now life just turned
into a dog dancing contest I can always
a dog though over Jesus thank you very
much if you guys have questions on
YouTube make sure to post them in all
caps so that my old eyes can spot them
within the ever-moving comments and it
is my duty to love as as much as I love
you
to join the hangout and loving the
recurring ones so right now I'm going to
hand it over to the most living things
within what a thumbnail which is hi Otto
Devon and a probably dog or cat it's
it's a small thumbnail some herbal you
it's a verbal it's a cute little thing
so please it's a Tribble look at that
Hey hi there what is that a cat a dog or
anything living thing it's a dog it's a
it's a shih tzu it's Manny it's a shih
tzu and its many and what is her daily
driver um elite collar couple colored
pebbles collar we're going to a pebble
collar and it will track how much you
walk and then do nothing okay and he
also record via GPS I don't think we can
track my gps well wherever I do is nanny
is like he loves me so so it's easier
it's easier to track hayato funny ok
guys do you want to talk about better
with life or anything else you know my
battery life why not let's talk about
better life what's your your better life
maximum your your average or what would
you like it to me well I have a hard
time getting a whole day I have very
hard time yet through a whole day on one
charge of my next this for but is that
because your usage or is that because of
the way the nexus 4 is built I I would
say this because of my usage I me I'm
I'm very very heavy on my phone so if I
tweet something he retweeted like three
seconds later so he's his screen time is
non-stop ah ok if you might have an
initial setup for that same i'm always
on Anna I'm always on either tweet
bottom I computer or Falcon on here so I
pretty much see everything so hi Otto or
hate Oh mmm what would you give up for a
better battery life would you prefer
your nexus 4 would look like this
Frankenstein thing or would you prefer
it would be slim but still deliver you
the power
need I don't know that I could have my
phone as thick as you know two years but
a little bit thicker sure a couple
couple millimeters so that will broaden
escalate into a couple of hundreds of
million powers more yeah I'm sorry Jo Jo
theatre you were about to say something
oh I was just saying it's like taking a
call with this box look at this if I
lock my camera on myself right talk on
the phone on the street look at this
thing I mean Norma's oh but the good
thing is that it has a kickstand so
whenever I need which is never to prop
it up I don't use it's ok you can prop
it up on the table and lay your head
down to it so you don't have to hold
them up because it's like what eight
pounds that is that is correct it's a
few pounded at 55 ranks which is to work
up at this time whatever you reach out
to your ear you're working out see Jaime
he'd be deliberately adding weights to
that just so he could you know his daily
workout and it's fall into a dumbbell
exactly ankle weights oh hi oh hey
though how do you say our name it's hi
Otto hi Otto would you think that the
same phone with the same battery would
last more if it was running Windows
Phone or iOS it's been a few years since
i've used iOS and I've never really had
extensive use of windows phone so I
can't really say honestly if I were to
guess I would say an iOS device would
last longer with the same size battery
as the nexus 4 yeah I would yeah mainly
because one the processor technology and
screen size and to iOS is just a little
more efficient as far as battery goes
especially in standby it doesn't have
widgets and it doesn't have all that fun
stuff that are updating on your home
screen and can do all kinds of cool
stuff on your home screen either so you
know I only have one widget though on my
phone I mean all I use is a what is this
the weather Anna I've got this weather
widget I came here which one that is a
whole lot of beautiful widgets no I in
the sky high in the sky is what the face
looks I don't like I in this guy but
yeah and I have one home screen that's
all I have so that I mean nice no I
don't have but you can that's the nice
thing about android is you can or you
don't have to right now I've got one
home screen and it's all of my friends
on Facebook I'm so ready to be done with
this facebook I want to ask you
something because us guys don't mind
carrying a huge phone because we love
our work up but what does a lady say
about a huge phone do you prefer a thin
phone with a less longer battery life or
would you prefer a thicker phone which
would last you through one what I half
maybe two days even if you're snapping a
lot of pictures which I know you are
because you're a photographer and I know
you're not snapping with your phone but
for the sake of the argument pretend
yeah I dont still take pictures with my
phone but uh back in the day for me my
dad used to give me his old nokia phones
you know no that was brought over they
were about bigger than that yeah and i
never had a problem holding those so if
i could get longer battery life out of
something that's slightly bigger than
this but maybe not as big as what you're
carrying around I feel it oh this is the
big I mean this is just let's just
compare it to the other if neither is
this this is locked my camera this is
how big it is it's just four times as
thick as the iphone also does pictures
of the smells like because mine's a 3.7
here's a cat too here's a hearing to the
cat
my battery compared to my dog love these
real life size comparisons but i also
love tell tony do you want me to go out
of the backyard and get one of my
chickens heard of the chickens I got a
snake I can beat you it's not big it's
like eight times as big as the iphone
sup big ok guys do you have any spinal
thoughts or anything you would like to
add I think I'm pretty fried after all
my animals healthy paddle uh not really
i'm just glad i could be back in here
again cuz i've been yeah I've been
working lately so it's kind of been
getting in the way of this and this and
this it's good to have you guys back and
you're officially holding the record for
for the most living creatures in one
from nail so if anybody gets up that
please do that on the pocket now line so
I'm going to switch my camera over to
you and this is where you can find the
high Otto and Devon there's their
twitter handles droid age and DV do i
always mess your twitter handle all
right but that's my Eastern European
accent so thank you very much for
joining us and we go back next week we
have to work on your your southern
accent Tony I think I can handle that
but then again i talk like granny so i
totally sounded like a southern belle
also thank you for joining us I didn't
mean to interrupt thank you guys and I
know you do come back every week and
we'll try to talk with you as much as
possible we love you and we also love
the new guys so we'll try to eat a
balanced hey care yes I would I'm gonna
throw it over to Joe not before i read a
question why does Taylor Martin wear
caps every time I'm thinking he's
referring to hats Joe can you answer
this
ah yes as hats were awesome and I feel
like I'm left I left my fedora in the
car so sorry sorry I would do it alight
you Taylor do you have any idea why you
wear hats all the time I do before I
started a pocket now I wore a hat maybe
two or three times a week and I made one
video for pocket now and I didn't wear a
hat and Brandon text me as soon as I
uploaded it is the minute I uploaded it
and he's like where's the Hat and I said
I didn't wear it he said wear the hat so
there it is but over the head it's
within your job description to where
every video or every bublik appearance
apparently and I think I'm just gonna go
find some crazy crazy hats and just
start wearing those like a chicken hat
or a Pluto hat I got those bunny hats
which also clap when whenever you you
pull the strings yeah I'll find one of
those um what are those the with a
little thin on top of our beanie hat ya
hear from the super Carolina right so
you can wear a beer hat anywhere beer
hat let us move our dude a final final
round of our kohls final call for Joe
and then final goal for for Taylor and
then I'm gonna wrap it up ah I already
talked to you denisa we love you you
know we love you but speaking of hats
let's go it I cannot even pronounce your
name but you're wearing a clown hat tell
us your name and what what phone you
have your battery life and if you would
like to trade phones with Tony so you
get 6400 milliamp hours and by the way
I'm soon getting a hold on just one
second let me check my email I am soon
getting a ninety three hundred million
power battery for the same phone so yeah
that's gonna be interesting but back to
you every or even whatever you say your
name is Bobby
abhi hub hi well then that's it that's
not what your tag says but ok have you
go and how do you say it Oh Bobby Bobby
Raj I'll be okay I love you do abhilash
okay all you guys go ahead are you
envious of Tony's phone and the
superbattery er well I actually owned a
galaxy note 2 all until a couple of
weeks ago and then I wanted a better
phone from verizon and since they're not
going to get the HTC One I put it on
craigslist for six hundred dollars and a
person gives me a brand new ipad 2 with
a fifty-dollar case and three hundred
dollar cash for my note 2 so I'm like
take take my note 2 I don't care so now
I'm rocking Galaxy Nexus which is
terrible all right do you need any
batteries oh I get four of them but it
doesn't make it through like oh four
hours of my usage so tell us about your
usage what do you do with your phone how
long do you have the screen on and why
do you think it gives you such a short
lifetime and also what Galaxy Nexus is
it is it the timer unfortunately custom
I problems because I'm I have verizon
and I'm when I'm one of those
grandfather unlimited it up people so
just to put my users into perspective um
I use an average of ten to eleven gigs
of data myself every month Wow oh yeah
so joins pretty quickly I can watch
videos can watch netflix so I was
thinking I just ordered a droid DNA from
amazon oh I don't know about the battery
life I mean that's a problem with
verizon that i can't get like one it's
like HTC One from there and so I figured
that might as well get a DNA cuz I can't
take this anymore this is like I feel
like I'm gonna get stone age with this
nexus it doesn't put up with my news
well one one of the question for it and
I know we're coming up short on time
here are you running the stock rom on it
or have you done a custom rom and if you
have have you tried franco.kernel on it
to see if you get any better battery
life oh I hope not cuz ah this is the
only form that I got on and I haven't
you did it because I wasn't sure if I
was gonna keep it because I was kind of
skeptical about the battery life because
I heard the reviews that it's not great
so this is the only phone i haven't
rooted because i'm probably gonna return
it i am trying it out it's not for me
i'm getting the DNA what are you what
are your thoughts about the battery life
in there i mean i really like the build
quality I'd like to build quality the
battery life when the DNA was not that
great for me though how's it compared to
like galaxy nexus for verizon your
opinion I never used the Galaxy Nexus on
verizon that's so it's hard to say um I
don't know the Galaxy Nexus the the GSM
Galaxy Nexus had pretty bad battery life
for me as well every home has bad batter
lips I don't know if I'm a good one to
ask well I have the several actually of
the the GSM Galaxy Nexus and in all but
I believe one of them we went with the
extended battery and that really helped
out quite a bit on mine back when it was
my daily driver I not only had the
extended battery but I also was running
franco.kernel and that really helped ah
I got probably an extra twelve to
eighteen percent battery life by
combining the two together oh yeah see
the problem i just figured out with my
DNA is that i was reading XDA and
apparently I'm not found out an update
Rockefeller nothing then you can talk
now DNA cannot be a lot now the
bootloader can be unlocked if so if I
get the phone from amazon and if it
happened if it hasn't got an update I'm
lucky but if it has then I can't with it
I can't unlock the bootloader and it's
pain in the butt to off or even the
developers to find a workaround on this
so I don't know I'm actually upgrading
or I'm just you know buying it for no
reason I
well hold out when when somebody gets an
update to patch holes that were being
exploited so that you could get root and
whatnot it's only a matter of time
before something else is found and
there's another method to route unless
you're just so which is that's
specifically why allowing people to have
superuser permission is is so important
because you you can control what apps
have superuser otherwise who knows some
apps going to come along and exploit a
hole that's there and do whatever they
want you don't have any control over it
that's how we get so yeah if you guys
have time i also had one more question
yes please well I just so as I was
saying I I traded my galaxy note 2 for
verizon for like a brand new ipad 2 and
0 this is my first Apple product um
because I have high own Nexus 10 nexus 7
galaxy note 10.1 you name it huh and the
better life when ipad 2 is extremely
amazing i mean ah I mad I had Andrew
person but iOS on tablets is actually
pretty amazing it works really well and
even with the less power on the browsing
and most of the things to do on tablets
is quite smooth now this is very tricky
because if we agree with what you say we
are automatically Apple fanboys and we
if we do not agree we are automatically
Android families so whatever you see
yeah because it's kind of better than my
nexus 10 which is pretty amazing i mean
i can hold this thing to like three days
of my usage and nexus 10 gave me like
day and a half or two days max yeah my
ipad mini i charged it about twice a
week and see when i had the the nexus 10
in house that would give me about three
to five days of battery use once I was
done with the review um I wasn't using
it as a daily driver I still had my my
phone at the time I think I was still on
a Galaxy Nexus but it gave me quite a
bit of life on it so it all comes back
to just your usage and what you're doing
with it you know how the URL never
processor yeah I think the only queer
a guy how about how about this is all
you can't like download applause so
there's like no fault system so like
support I'm in college and if I need any
document to download from my website
there is no file system so you do like
open Adobe PDF reader and get it in
there and I'm just new to the OS so it's
probably just me i don't know like work
with that like the problem i run into a
lot is i can't download zip files there
zip files i need for certain things and
that's why i can't just use iOS
exclusively as well among other things
but things among other things but yes
not having a file system is kind of
crazy for device in 2013 yeah i just
hope that key lime pie addresses like
daddy issues if they make it like more
optimized i mean if you use an Andhra
mean you you're right that end reduces a
lot of widgets ends up to it drains
battery faster but I just hope this like
they find out a way to make it more
optimized like say I was six in terms of
like efficiency well that if they go
with Thea the card based interface like
I predicted in my article little while
back we might see a dramatic shift not
only in UI but also in battery life it
could have implications one way or the
other so yeah I'm with you I want to see
it so in the interest of time go ahead
and ask one more follow-up question and
then tell us how we can get a hold of
you if you are on any social networks we
want people to know about that I sure
one last question all I just had a
question that if Motorola can poll on
putting a 2300 milliamp hour battery in
such a thin phone like why can't other
Android manufacturers I mean I really
don't care about room or battery as long
as I get a three thousand million power
battery on ping pong as the very same
question right after the razr maxx and
droid razr RAZR MAXX HD were released if
they can do it why can't anyone else and
maybe maybe they were onto something
when they said that they put so much
time and effort into the manufacturing
of the razor
you know how you remember how adamant
they were about saying you know this
thing is extremely thin at the time the
razor was a leak released it was the
thinnest of phone on the market and they
were very adamant about how they
manufactured it with the aluminum frame
and all that other stuff so maybe
there's something in the design but I
don't know that mean the closest phone
out there I think now is the galaxy note
2 with 30 100 million powers and then
there was one phone I can't remember
what it was I remember it from CES with
like a 40 200 million power battery I
can't remember what that is somebody us
no it was it was a global device I'm
going to try to look that up early so
while he's looking that up I I think it
all goes back to what people are
demanding and we need to make it clear
to the marketing departments for all of
these companies I want a bigger battery
and you need to make sure that you are
vocal about it you need to make sure
that you know that a couple extra
millimeters is and a little little more
grams in the weight is not only
acceptable but desirable and that
information has to be fed back to
marketing and to the people that are
building these devices otherwise we're
just going to keep seeing the trend of a
thinner and thinner device that you know
if a stiff wind comes along it'll break
it in half but it's up to us when we
were that were the people we can either
sit by and complain about it or we can
be proactive and go out there and tell
whoever it may be whether that's the
manufacturers the carriers or even the
people in the store say hey this is crap
I want a bigger battery and want longer
battery life if you're not going to
build that into your phone give me a
removable battery so i can do an
aftermarket super Mongo battery like
Tony on talking now didn't feel free to
drop his name because everyone knows too
yeah I mean is it on the battery packs
the same thing you say even if you don't
have a very nice i'm buying a battery
pack the same thing as buying couple of
extra batteries like the only difference
the only difference is you can't just
pop in a new battery you have to wait
for it to charge so then that's a key
difference between a replaceable battery
and something like this which will
charge your phone three four times
that's the big differences this you're
gonna have to wait two hours three hours
to charge every time the other you just
pop it in and go and you're good to go
for another eight or ten hours but
Taylor's battery pack will work on any
phone whereas that extra battery is only
going to work on the one that it's
specifically designed to work in so
there's pros and cons yes I mean I'm
thinking someone buying the HTC One
version of whenever verizon comes out
with had maybe a droid branding via HTC
One I might've because I really like to
build call you I would choose it over as
for but I'm just thinking I'm buying a
battery pack for like fifty dollars to
work around ratio like low battery I I
hate to be the bad guy here but let this
be the land I wish to please yeah yeah I
mean yeah that's all I had I mean you
can find me at on Google Plus which is 0
1 of 2 social networks i use but yep
yeah thank you for joining us sorry i
missed the beginning or yes please go on
uh I was just gonna say that I'm really
happy this is my first time on a pocket
knife like outside watching guys for
like almost in a year and you guys have
one of the best reviewers okay thank you
thank you on behalf of the entire pocket
now see no we thank you very much and
thanks for join the hangout have a good
we hope you again soon and before we go
over to our last call I would like to
ask my American friends Joe and Taylor
what is a case name what do you mean and
I have a question here on YouTube which
is Anton's case name is that the family
name the surname the first name the last
name I think they're talking about the
case on your phone oh the case oh this
is not good this is this is a battery
which is a mugen or mugen power I will
have a review of this next week on
pocket
and another question which is going on
x-files territory my friend says derek
has a samsung phone and the battery
expanded in the middle making it no
longer fit in the phone why or how did
it happen get a new battery Oh April
sense cuz that's a that's not a good
thing I'm I had a lady but we're having
when i worked at best buy mobile i had a
lady come in with a palm treo and you
know those things were thick to begin
with she came in and it was I swear to
you it was at least two inches thick and
it was because in the battery door the
battery door actually started to bow
with the battery itself in the battery
had expanded to be actually wider than
it was like tall so yeah that's not a
good thing a battery could explode if
it's gonna build up pressure like that
that sounds like gas pressure within the
battery that's exactly what it is
eventually I when it's expanding like
that you're going to run into a problem
with shorting inside the battery that's
going to lead to just like any
electrical short that's going to lead to
heat heat causes resistance resistance
causes more heat it's a vicious cycle
until eventually the battery can
literally catch fire it can burn you it
can even explode when your battery is
doing something like that take it into
your local batteries plus or local
battery store say hey this is doing this
I need a new one they should take that
battery from you free of charge and
recycle it and dispose of it properly
and sell you a new battery that isn't
going to have those problems so if you
have a swelling battery please get it
replaced as soon as you can or talk to
the carrier or manufacturer because it
might get warranty if it's still under
warranty yeah okay thank you guys last
question Samsung features multi window
does it consume more battery than not
having it on I don't use multi windows
so much on my note 2 but whenever I use
it I do not notice any battery drain
Jojo or Taylor Taylor I know you have a
note to do you have any notes on that
graphically it's going to use more
or because you're running two EPs
side-by-side Joe might want to correct
me on that but I mean logically it would
use more power because you're running
two applications letting in reality but
in reality I don't ever use it so much
like I might use it for three or four
minutes maybe 10 minutes at most I don't
use it for hours on end with two
applications side by side it's kind of a
convenience factor but you're not going
to use it just non-stop so the
differences aren't really going to be
that noticeable yo yeah i'm going to
mirror the same sentiments if you are
running to resource intensive apps at
the same time whether that's in a multi
window or if that's even just in real
multitasking where one app is behind the
other you're going to burn through your
battery faster the way android is set up
right now you're not going to notice
much of a difference but it's going to
be there I'll be it subtle Joe I have a
follow-up question how long do you have
to run those two applications at the
same time in order for you to see a
visible drain and battery it's going to
depend on the the two applications but
it's going to start happening right away
you know you are running two things at
the same time essentially in the
foreground and that's really the
difference between multitasking on
Android and running the the multiple
screens is when you're when you're doing
the traditional multitasking on any
standard ROM or stock Android the app
that's in the background gets a lower
priority so it's using less power than
when you're running them side by side it
you might notice it in a few minutes it
might take you know half an hour before
you notice significant drops in your
battery thank you very much and our last
goal for tonight goes to the tailor
Martin and he's been waiting patiently
since I chose him the first time is it
Niecy and I know you tried to correct me
but we didn't hear you you were muted
it's either Niecy or yeah how was it
pronounced yeah that's right ok you got
it right awesome that doesn't happen
often uh what's up there not much um
what phone do you have and what is your
battery life like I i had an s3 and an
iphone 5 but but he's day and a half of
my
sold them because I'm trying to buy the
HTC One alright so now i'm getting a
feature phone nice i was the battery
life on that ray doesn't know we've a
charger once a month that's how my
grandpa was he had a basic phone and he
charged it once a month wow that's
insane yeah so how was your lecture
battery life i charged it pretty to go
in the bedroom electric orders still
nice always can I be mean how much
screen on time do you have okay not much
yeah my I bet he's got snake on it
though yes I do yeah I do it I'm sorry I
second I just had to put it out there I
can access facebook from here so maybe
awful day long maybe about an hour and a
half to our screen time sounds
incredible um so how was your battery
life before hmm so I mean they then I
have max with my ass please this is ok
but also story oh yeah go ahead ok yo
tell the story I don't mean I went I
went camping and I had my three and we
went away for four days and because my
carrier is a major carry I had coverage
there too and over 35 was but four hours
away and I didn't receive any calls but
my data was all the time when I was
getting emails i was surfing youtube me
my battery lasted four days ice I wish I
could say the same for anything I've
ever had except for the ipad i went
camping a way by Yellowstone you're so
back and I had my my galaxy nexus with
me the second day I found out that my
battery only lasted about two hours it
was ridiculous and that was with hardly
any screen on time searching for signal
I found out that it was because there
were a couple cell sites that were just
close enough that it kept trying and
trying and trying to hook up to them as
as I turned it into airplane mode
everything was super happy and I lasted
the whole rest of the trip without any
without any problems without even trying
to charge it up again yeah so I'm
searching for signal candy Eve add my
blackberry I had the 8830 when I was in
high school and unlike the weekends I
didn't have to charge it all that much I
could charge it on Friday and it would
last until Monday no problem using it
all day and and then like throughout
like days if I had certain classes where
there was just no coverage and I in one
of the rooms my phone would be dead
before I got out of school that day so
it charge it up the morning or overnight
go to school and it be dead before I got
off out of school so yeah cell service
uh definitely plays a major factor turn
it off when you don't need it yeah so do
you have any questions for us are you
still there it looks frozen yes he does
and while he unfreezes himself we have a
follow-up question from Pedro on the
same idea of multi window he says if
there's more time I meant the multi
window feature on but not necessarily
using two apps at the same time that
much so I can tell you this much the
multi window feature is on whenever you
long tap on the back button and you can
see that the row of icons and if you are
not actually using two applications you
will see that there's a small rounded
thing right there which you can make
disappear by long pressing and holding
again so I think and I think I'm right
it doesn't use any battery at all but
Taylor please if you have any more
thoughts on this may be very very little
it's probably going to be minuscule to
the point that you're not going to
notice yes it's an extra app that's
running so it is going to chew a little
bit of processing time and a little bit
of battery but very very little I'm with
Taylor on this one okey and with this i
think we are way way way over 90 minute
mark so jolted there do you guys have
any final thoughts i'm not gonna sleep
tonight
haha as usual in the last three nights
cheb right I slept last night really
well oh thank you sleep under it I fell
asleep on my keyboard so I've got
homework for for everybody who is
watching this I want anybody who's got a
portable battery solution like like
we've been showing off today head over
to the article at pocketnow.com and go
down in the comments section tell us the
name and the model of that that portable
battery the battery size in milliamp
hours and just approximately how much
you paid for it and if you like it or
don't like it and why I need to get a
good one or two for myself and rather
than buying a whole bunch of them I want
to have you guys tell me what you've
seen and what your experiences been let
me know thinner um well you know which
ones i'm using Joe so I'll keep you
updated on this one the anchor is
probably biased though well I have the
dark energy reservoir that I backed on
Kickstarter that's coming in the 8000
familia power 1 i'll let you know what
that's like once i get it i might review
it and talk to anyone about it so that
but um this anchor I'll let you know how
those some turns out so there's that but
other than that um yeah I'm good totally
good okay and I think footage shot that
