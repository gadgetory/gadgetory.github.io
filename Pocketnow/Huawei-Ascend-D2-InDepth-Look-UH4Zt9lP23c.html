pocket Nakamura at CES 2013 and we
already showed you the whole huawei
ascend d2 quick hands on and now we've
got some more time to sit down or stand
up and look a little bit more closely at
the d2 and give you some more
impressions first impressions of the new
high-end flagship from huawei let's take
a look
so who always trying to kind of rebrand
themselves as a more higher-end
manufacturer to be able to compete with
HTC and Samsung and so forth and the
past they've really done mid-range and
low-end phones especially for the Asian
market so the hallway ascend d2 has a
1080p screen joining the ranks of all of
these phones they're doing to 1920 x
1080 which makes for a PP I'm about 440
this green looks pretty darn sharp we've
got the emotion UI with some new touches
as we've seen with the 6.1 inch mate
we've got the disappearing humbuckers
which which is so cool and it makes so
much sense so you go into any
application and you get the full screen
and if you want the buttons back you go
and there they are we cool feature they
actually I wish I we would see and other
devices we've got a quad-core cpu 2
gigabytes of ram this is very laggy and
and which leads me to my next point that
this device tries to be high-end but
really is it because it's pretty slow
and that was pretty fast let's flip
around we can see some dropped frames
there when you're clicking around let's
go into a game it's just there's lag it
really every turn it's possible that
this is early prototype hardware but it
feels slow looking around the device
we've got a quite slender phone here
with with sort of a metal expert on the
side of the way it feels like plastic
and then when I saw this from across the
room I thought to myself
that kind of looks familiar trying to do
a little little play on the apple thing
here but it looks cheaper it doesn't it
doesn't look as I quality as an apple
device looks like we have two
microphones here for noise cancellation
turning over to me back we've got the 8
megapixel camera with a little LED flash
there and a highly reflective
fingerprint prone backing so who all my
really trying here but all chart a few
departments we're gonna have to get this
in the labs and test it more fully but
so far we're a little bit mouths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
