to make Samsung look really bad shark
demos a new smartphone display designed
that couldn't make it to the future
iphone and verizon is yet again set to
cripple the google phone I'm hi Mary
vera and yeah I know it's late it's
probably too late to party but I will
still try this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with
announcements those of you in the market
for a new surface tablet I would highly
suggest you wait Microsoft has just sent
out press invitations for an event to
happen in New York City on October 26
and we are expecting the revamp to the
surface lineup and this is actually
going to be quite cool because we're big
fans of the surface book particularly
but it wasn't the perfect computer it
did have its flaws so let's see what we
get other official news come from
verizon and the google pixel phone for
those of you that we're considering
getting it that way it's going to be bad
for those of you that remember the days
of the Galaxy Nexus that was on verizon
that had terrible software update
experiences it seems that's going to be
the case here as verizon will be
administering the software updates for
this phone Google will only be in charge
of security even though we know that
apparently software updates on this
version of Android will happen behind
the scenes and everything we're just not
sure how timely they will be housed will
the spotlight over to sharp as the
company has just demoed a concept our
display that's completely curved just
like we see on current Galaxy
smartphones but in addition to that it's
got rounded corners and yeah if that
reminds you of a specific company that
starts with a fruit that is the case
exactly you have to remember sharp is
apparently going to be the supplier for
this place of the iphone 8 going OLED so
hey sharp corners not happening that
sounds a lot like Apple it could
probably be the case for the iphone 8
States haven't and speaking of products
that might make major changes next year
we hear three interesting things for the
galaxy s eight number one a March launch
number two apparently they're also going
for a full display on this phone great
no
or three is that apparently we are
getting dual cameras and Samsung has
really taken the cake for smartphone
image quality lately we cannot wait to
see what they're planning to do with a
dual camera and finally the very hot
news today have to also do with Samsung
of the fact that it's taken the cake in
drama and even CNN why because well the
galaxy note 7 we know that exploded on a
Southwest flight there is still an
investigation here but now all four US
carriers you're giving customers the
option to exchange their galaxy note 7
even if the return period is over so for
those of you that are not comfortable
with your note 7 so you have the option
to get anything else not just the galaxy
phone any other smartphone and yeah the
new iPhones are in the market but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day are you going to exchange your
galaxy note 7 or not in my case we're
going to try to continue using it I have
an exchange unit everything seems fine
it does not overheat at all like at all
since I've been using it which is great
but obviously you have to take your
precautions we actually want to see if
we can take it to the after the bus
period see after three months what
happens with this phone leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
what you're gonna do friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the videos filmed

subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you'd also catch
our videos on vessel vessel the comp /
