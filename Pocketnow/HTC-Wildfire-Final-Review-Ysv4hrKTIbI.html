calm and it's time to give you our final
word on the HTC Wildfire let's go ahead
and get started we're going to first
start off by telling you some of the
positive to this device some of the
things that we really enjoyed and the
first one that we want to mention is
going to be the price point at a price
but only three hundred dollars for an
unlocked device you really can't beat
what you're going to get here you're
going to get a relatively up-to-date
android 2.1 device that has also unlocks
you can use it on any carrier that uses
a sim card now well touch base a little
bit later on in this video on the
network compatibility but once again
it's an unlocked phone you don't have to
renew your contract when you buy this
phone looking at some of the devices
right now that 18 teens mobile do sell
some of them are around two hundred
dollars with a contract whereas this
device is only three hundred dollars
without that contract which when you
factor in the early termination fee for
some people might be worth it next up is
the overall design of the HTC Wildfire
many people have pointed out on the past
videos that it's almost like a cross
between a nexus one and the HTC Desire
kind of merge together it does
definitely bring some of the design
aspects of the nexus one by having the
aluminum shell as well as the teflon
painted plastic on the back overall the
device is extremely solid feels very
solid in the hand and you're not going
to hear the device creaking or flexing
as using it it's not a cheap plastic by
any means at all you really are getting
a lot here for your money on a hardware
design sense also because the device
comes with Android 2.1 pre-loaded you
can likely use a lot of the available
apps from the android market some of the
applications may not work due to the
screen resolution which I will touch on
in the next few minutes but for the most
part everything you're familiar with now
if you've already been using Android is
there for you and if this is your first
Android device you aren't really that
far behind I mean froyo is out now
however by getting on android 2.1 right
out of the gate you are almost up to
date 100 battery life on the HTC
Wildfire was phenomenal I was able to
easily make it through an entire day of
usage in almost two days in some cases
it is powered by a relatively small of
thirteen hundred million power battery a
lot of the devices now are using 1400
and up however because this device only
has a three point
2 inch screen with a lower resolution
it's not really drawing too much power
and because of that you're able to make
it through a full day no problems at all
which if you're on the phone a lot
answering emails a lot browsing playing
games this could be a good solution for
you in terms of the battery life now
getting into some of the aspects we
weren't necessarily too thrilled with
was first off the screen resolution the
3.2 inch screen is definitely easy to
use however the resolution being low at
320 x 240 definitely left us craving a
little more at times you're taking
picture you can actually see lines
through your images and pixels and the
images look washed out the colors look
washed out it's just definitely not up
to the spec that you're seeing with the
current screens of the AMOLED the Super
AMOLED and even the current generation
LCD screens this is definitely a step
behind the processor at times did seem
to kind of chug along a little slower
than other devices with a faster one
gigahertz processor which is to be
expected loading some of the longer
Twitter feeds in the Twitter application
as you saw in our past video did tend to
sort of jerk up and almost slow down and
lag as time goes multitasking is fine
with this device and to start to run a
few I would say about a handful of
applications at once you'll really see
slow down there you'll see it almost
come to a standstill and lastly one
somewhat negative that we like to call a
negative only because it affects us here
is the fact that this device is not
compatible with the US 3g bands it is
only going to be using edge using ATT
and tmobile now keeping that in mind
this phone was created for Europe for
the UK that area of the world so you
really can't knock HTC there for not
giving us the compatibility here because
we do use different spectrum and
different frequencies if you looking for
a device that is going to use 3G and
really only use 3g most of the time this
probably won't be the device for you
unfortunately it is a very strong device
in a very good entry-level Android
device however if 3g is on the very top
of your list this may not cut that
unfortunate overall the HTC Wildfire is
an extremely strong entry-level Android
device if you've been on the fence with
Android and you're really you're
questioning a large investment in order
to get into the platform the Wildfire
may be for you at only three hundred
dollars at the unlock price it is
affordable to most people you're also
going to get many of the
best design aspects from HTC devices
like the nexus one and the desire
however if 3g is a must-have for you
unfortunately it's really not going to
fit into many of your needs that way on
the other hand if 3g isn't too critical
for you and you can get by using the
Wi-Fi no problem i definitely have to
recommend the Wildfire as an entry-level
device you can certainly get a little
bit more mileage out of a faster and
newer device but if you're looking to
stay unlocked and not pay through the
teeth the Wildfire is a great option for
you the ability to get through a full
day something that's hard to come by
today and the Wildfire was able to do
that just perfectly if you're looking to
pick up an HTC Wildfire you can do so
for three hundred dollars over at clove
co uk as always thank you very much for
watching everyone I'm Jeff ringer for
pocket now please give us a thumbs up
and stay tuned for future videos and
reviews over at pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
