whatever it will begin checking and it
will send a message to all of your
family members so we can get a location
of where our family members are so you

I want to send a message I can just
update I can also request their location

aight is a free game available on
android market thought to the game is to
use this self-powered a little light
here and navigate through this world
while avoiding these spikes and other
enemies and all this other stuff so
continue through this level and want to
collect coins the more coins that we
collect the more we can upgrade our
weapons and I it's really fast paced if
it's much more difficult while I'm on

through this level and want to collect
these keys to open up various other
objects ok so now we've
the checkpoint and we finish this level
and begin to continue on to the next if
you like to ski or snowboard rei snow
