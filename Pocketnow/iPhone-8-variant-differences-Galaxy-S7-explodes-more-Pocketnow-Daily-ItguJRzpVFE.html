iphone 8 but only one getting an oled
display Sampson keeps dealing with drama
over topics of exploding phones and all
points to Google's Andromeda being a
reality but still far I'm hi Mary Vanna
and at what time does the sunset at your
area it's set here at 420 p.m. that's
insane this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals as
t-mobile has just announced its magenta
Friday those of you that are interested
in good deals you might want to consider
that or the fact that the company is
announcing its Black Friday deals next
Thursday yeah you should definitely look
out for that and one of the most
interesting announcements yesterday has
become probably my favorite app because
yes I'm old enough to have printed
photos therefore google has just
announced its new google photoscan that
becomes part of google photos you can
look for old photos take four clips from
them in a very interesting way and you
get an old photo scan using your
smartphone it works on iOS on Android
and it's really good now for those of
you that thought that the problems that
Samsung's dealing with exploding phones
had ended that's actually not the case
of yesterday's news where of a samsung
galaxy s7 exploding in canada and
causing a person second degree burns
that is terrible obviously there is so
much to be investigated but i do know
that this is not the only smartphone
exploding guys i do know that there are
iphones that have exploded in everything
it's just that clearly there are needs
not just for samsung or for Apple but in
general / battery technology and the
risk that people are dealing with and
yes one of the most anticipated news
that has not yet happened as Google's
Andromeda which we assumed to be the
merger between Chrome OS and Android
even though we didn't hear any
announcements at the Google pixel event
there are strong strong rumors that
claim that we will be seeing it the only
problem is that apparently it is still a
full year away from being ready for
prime time so being a full year away
does actually mean that it could be
announced at Google i/o stay tuned for
that and
somewhere around may or june of next
year and finally the very interesting
news today or rumors have to do with the
iphone 8 we hear more rumors that there
are three variants coming and it makes
sense the plus the regular and the SE
model but this is more interesting
because apparently only one of these
units is getting the OLED display and
obviously that most likely will be the
plus variant apparently if you want to
go premium pluses the way to go but then
we also hear that across the board we're
getting better cameras and extra gig of
ram faster processors and pay it leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think about this mentality of Apple
making + phones get better
specifications that the regulars in my
case well it's called a plus for a
reason I'm not complaining i just feel
that the plus variants are crazy
expensive but anyways leave us a comment

opinion friends you know the way it goes
