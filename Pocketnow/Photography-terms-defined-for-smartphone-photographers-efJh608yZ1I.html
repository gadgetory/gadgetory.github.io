significantly over the last several
years and it's not much of a compromise
now for a smartphone camera to be the
only camera a person might own as phones
improve and replace point-and-shoot
cameras our discussion of smartphone
cameras should also improve we're
looking to review phones more like we
would review standalone cameras so if
you're unfamiliar with some of the
photography terms we use to describe
camera performance here's a primer to
explain some of those terms buckle up
folks we have a lot of ground to cover
and if you get lost or you want to hear
a specific topic again there's a handy
list of shortcuts to individual terms in
the video description below
JPEG versus raw think about CDs versus
mp3s
a raw file is just that the raw data
which comes off of the camera sensor
without any processing a JPEG is a
compressed file camera software makes a
number of adjustments to brightness and
color then squishes out any information
you might not need JPEG files are easier
to share RAW files because they have
more information are better for editing
typically though a raw file has more
information technically making it a
higher-quality file it usually isn't the
most attractive photo we can share until
we edit it exposure when we talk about
exposure we're talking about how bright
or how dark an image the camera produces
if an image is overexposed it's too
bright if it's underexposed it's too
dark
exposure can often be adjusted before
taking a shot usually through some kind
of slider like this one on the iPhone
but it directly relates to shutter speed
and ISO using this slider is a shortcut
for quickly adjusting shutter speed and
ISO but it's not as precise often when a
photo is too bright we call this loss
clipping we have clipped the information
in the highlights here metering how does
a camera decide how bright or how dark
an image should be that comes down to
metering some phones let you change how
the camera will prioritize light matrix
metering will scan the entire frame and
try to balance dark and bright sections
center balanced metering does exactly
what the name suggests focusing on the
middle of your frame and spot metering
take its cue from where you focus there
are pros and cons to different metering
modes but generally matrix will provide
a nice safety net for your whole frame
while spot metering will tell your
camera to expose for the specific
subject you're focusing on saturation
saturation describes how vibrant or how
dull the color of a photo is this is
often a result of the editing involved
in processing a raw file to create a
JPEG too much color information can also
cause us to lose detail though too
little color will only produce a black
and white image we won't lose clarity by
removing the color from a photo white
balance this one is a little bit tricky
a lot of smartphone reviewers
misinterpret white balance differences
as a camera having accurate or
inaccurate color but what is accuracy
here let's say we have white objects lit
by yellow light is it more accurate to
capture the lighting conditions or the
object color there's no right answer say
you're taking concert photos do you care
more about accurate skin tone or
capturing the crazy mood of purple
lights on stage some cameras will
prioritize lighting conditions and some
cameras try to find the true white of
your subject but the best cameras will
let you adjust the white balance to
capture the scene how you see it shutter
speed one way we can control brightness
is by changing the shutter speed
smartphone cameras usually don't have a
real mechanical shutter but we still use
a similar measurement for how long the
sensor will soak up light the longer the
shutter speed the brighter the image the
shorter the shutter speed the darker
your image will be of course this has a
secondary effect holding the shutter
open longer means your images will be
more susceptible to blur from handshake
or from your subject moving a shorter
shutter speed is better for capturing
movement and producing a crisp image ISO
ISO represents the camera's sensitivity
to light the higher the ISO the more
sensitive the sensor will be and your
image will get brighter lowering the ISO
reduces sensitivity and makes your image
darker why not use a higher ISO all the
time well have you ever turned up
speakers without playing any audio and
heard a hiss or a hump the same thing
happens with cameras a higher ISO will
be brighter
but it will also produce a noisier or
grainier image sensor size the physical
size of the camera sensor will affect
your photo and video output larger
sensors have more surface area which
makes it a bit easier to capture light
they'll also produce a softer background
blur which we'll talk about more in just
a bit
the compromise is a larger sensor
requires a larger lens which can mean a
bigger camera module or bulge on the
back of the phone at the time this video
was shot the iPhone 6s was the only
flagship phone still produced with a 1/3
inch sensor Android and Windows Phone
flagships have largely moved up to
sensors between one over two point six
to one over 2.3 inches on the diagonal
as that's cumbersome to say those
sensors will sometimes lazily be
described as half-inch sensors though
that's obviously not completely accurate
aperture the aperture is sometimes
referred to as an iris because it works
like the iris of your eye when we talk
about aperture we're describing the size
of the hole which lets light land on the
camera sensor the bigger the hole the
better that camera will be it's soaking
up available light a larger aperture
also helps soften the backgrounds of
your photos aperture is referenced as n
F number F 2.0 F 1.8 this is actually a
fraction though and represents F / 2.0
or F / 1.8 so the smaller that F number
is the larger your aperture will be now
most phones have a fixed aperture
meaning the aperture cannot be adjusted
by the user depth of field depth of
field references how much of your frame
will be in focus literally how deep into
the field of your photo will object
still retain clarity our phone sensors
are so small that even with a really
wide aperture of F 2 will still have a
really long depth of field this means
that when we focus on a subject quite a
bit of the space behind the subject and
in front of the subject will still be in
focus and identifiable for phones
depth of field blur is most noticeable
when focusing close up on your subject
and keeping your background as far away
as possible
phones with larger sensors and larger
apertures will do a better job of
blurring the background behind your
subject that sensor size is more
important than aperture as an extreme
example comparing an LG
ten with a one over two point six inch
sensor and an F 1.8 aperture will
produce similar background blur to a
DSLR with an aperture around f10 bouquet
while depth of field describes how close
your background will blur behind your
subject the term bouquet describes how
attractive that blur will be this is
entirely subjective every lens will
handle light and clarity in a unique way
some camera lenses will delicately blur
the background looking like a watercolor
painting some lenses will produce buzzy
or edgy qualities in the areas of your
frame which are out of focus but
ultimately whatever might be considered
attractive bouquet is up to each
individual photographer to decide for
themselves focal length focal length
describes the field of view as it
compares to old-school 35 millimeter
film cameras and that equivalents is
measured in millimeters the lower that
number is the wider the field of view
the higher that number is the narrower
the field of view so the Lumia 950 with
a 26 millimeter equivalent lens will
have a slightly wider field of view than
the iPhone 6s which has a twenty nine
millimeter equivalent lens like aperture
most phones cannot change the focal
length changing the focal length
requires a zoom lens like the one found
on Samsung K phones and the Asus zenfone
zoom even though the Lumia 1020 has a
great zoom feature the focal length of
that lens does not change the field of
view derived by the focal length
measurement should not be confused with
the camera sensors aspect ratio aspect
ratio aspect ratio is literally the
shape of the photo or video your camera
produces the two most common smartphone
aspect ratios are four by three and
sixteen by nine these two numbers relate
to each other to create the shape of the
rectangle four by three is a more
square-ish frame it's almost as tall as
it is wide sixteen by nine is almost
twice as long as it is tall regardless
if your frame is more wide screen or
squarish you can still have a wider or
narrower focal length a four by three
frame with a really wide lens will
contain more of a scene than a sixteen
by nine frame with a narrower focal
length HDR HDR stands for high dynamic
range and has more
with how your phone processes an image
rather than how your phone captures an
image an HDR photo is usually created by
taking a series of pictures and changing
the exposure on each photo this allows
the camera to see more detail and
shadows and in highlights then those
individual images are merged to create
one photo where detail in all areas of
the frame is visible this effect can be
used as a handy safety net in
challenging lighting conditions or it
can be used to create a more dramatic
image though usually this processing
will exaggerate the color of your scene
and it can be a tricky setting to use if
your subject is moving video all of the
previous terms we've defined for photos
also apply to video some are a bit more
rare than others like shutter speed the
time this video was produced only the LG
v10 came with a stock camera app which
allowed users to adjust the shutter
speed of video but other settings like
exposure ISO and white balance are
commonly included on camera apps first
we should tackle resolution
abbreviations like HD and UHD often
confuse the discussion and it's just
easier to talk about the actual
resolution of the video file width by
height most video files are now sixteen
by nine to better match the majority of
TVs and computer monitors HD resolutions
are 1280 by 720 and 1920 by 1080 where
we get terms like 720p and 1080p moving
up to qHD this stands for quad HD and
it's four times the resolution of 720p
which is 2560 by 1440 up from there we
get UHD or ultra HD which is four times
the resolution of 1080p and that's 3840
by 2160 UHD is also sometimes called 4k
even though it doesn't really reach 4000
pixels across frame rate as videos are a
series of individual still frames which
are strung together to create movement
many phones now allow us to control how
many frames per second our cameras shoot
the basic acceptable quality for smooth
video is around 30 frames per second and
a few cameras will let us shoot 24
frames per second which a lot of people
feel has a more cinematic look as film
was projected at 24 frames per second
high-end cameras now allow users to
shoot 1080p video at 60 frames per
second creating
an almost unnaturally smooth look to
movement in your video beyond 60 frames
per second we sometimes have options for
120 frames per second and 240 frames per
second video options these are often of
a lower quality in a lower resolution
per individual frame but the intense
frame rate is handy for creating
slow-motion video if you capture 120
frames every second but play back those
frames at 30 frames per second you'll
slow down the playback speed to 1/4
real-time bitrate another primary aspect
of discussing video is the bitrate
bitrate describes how much information
per second is saved and its measured in
megabits per second the higher the bit
rate the better the video quality will
be a higher bitrate will also take up
more storage space on your phone the LG
v10 and some third-party camera apps
will give users the ability to change
the bitrate when shooting 2160p video at
a 30 megabit per second bitrate each
minute of video will take up around 230
megabytes of space jumping to a 64
megabit per second bit rate means each
minute of video will use up around 460
megabytes of storage optical image
stabilization versus electronic image
stabilization lastly there's a bit of a
misnomer about image stabilization when
it comes to video there are two ways to
stabilize video optical image
stabilization or oh is involves moving
the lens the optics to adjust for
handshake or movement electronic image
stabilization sometimes called ie is
digital is or software is crops the
field of view and compensates for
movement by wiggling that crop around
this buffer zone now some phones can use
both optical and software stabilization
at the same time but usually only when
shooting 1080p video at 30 frames per
second take the Galaxy Note 4 for
example when shooting 2160p video we see
the image stabilization option is grayed
out the Galaxy Note 4 will still use the
hardware lens optical image
stabilization but is not capable of
processing a high resolution video while
also cropping the frame and using
electronic image stabilization if a
phone has optical image stabilization
it's pretty much always on
so even though the setting might be
grayed out the video will still benefit
from Hardware stabilization and that's
about as good a place to wrap up as
we'll get obviously this video is not
meant to be taken as a definitive
resource just as a starter whole books
can be written about each individual
topic we've covered and students spend
semesters in school studying these
topics
hopefully this stands as a resource to
help remove some of the confusion some
people face when discussing aspects of
any camera smartphone point-and-shoot or
DSLR and there are tons of excellent
resources available to expand this
conversation for smartphone
photographers there might even be some
books available COFF COFF shameless plug
cough-cough to help you get better shots
with your phone we're hoping to raise
the bar on how smartphone cameras are
reviewed and if you'd like to see more
in-depth camera discussions give these
videos a like and a share they take
quite a bit more work than your average
phone review and we can't continue
producing them without your support for
pocket now I'm camera snob Juan Carlos
bag now you can chat me up on Twitter
and Instagram is some gadget guy and I
will catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
