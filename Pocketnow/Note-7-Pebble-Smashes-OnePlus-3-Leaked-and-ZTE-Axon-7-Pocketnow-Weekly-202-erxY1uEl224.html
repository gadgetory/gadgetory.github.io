phablet from the future or it could just
be a name changed pebble smashes its
kickstarter goal but should companies be
allowed to use Kickstarter is a
pre-order platform we get a much better
look at the one plus three and our own
hi Matt iveta is in China now playing
with the ZTE axon 7 all that and
listener mail so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 202 of the
pocket now weekly this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile smart
phones tablets and wearables it's all
this stuff you wished existed when you
were a kid getting Nintendo thumb over
your summer vacation I'm Juan Carlos bag
now senior editor pocketnow.com blasting
the signal from sunny Southern
California rounding out this techy trio
we're joined again by senior editor you
know mr. Adam town afternoon sir the
only partner that won't go away yes I
was actually like I actually meant to
ask you before we jumped in when we were
in the pre-show because I looked you up
again you need to change your page I'm
pocketnow.com because you're still
contributing editor I'm not even sure I
know how but what pocketnow is basically
like the startup of news organizations
job titles don't mean anything well but
you know you corrected me last week I
wanted to make sure I got it right this
week and podcast producer jewelz wrong
Jules wang out of going out there you
always get it right kwan you always get
up I'm like what I'm batting like sixty
percent on butchering your name and it's
like the easiest name out of the entire
team you're doing alright if you're
doing above point for I think that's
good that's what um Teddy Teddy Williams
did so oh good call so yeah I mean we
can round that up to a solid win the
time on the west coast ladies and
gentlemen is 11am so let's talk some
tech woof boom so folks um we we have a
really cool sponsor set up this week in
that the sponsor for this week's show
I'm sort of fudging my script here
because I'm trying to
for something i had the suction cup on
this camera table well I couldn't get it
off my table but on this week's sponsor
is sigh oh I and SIA is producing this
really killer little 4G enabled action
camera and so we're seeing a number of
these products start filtering in the
market right now so I oh I to my
knowledge is one of the first to have a
real proper consumer-facing solution for
a little action camera that has its own
sim card so you can connect it directly
to scio I streaming service share that
on Twitter and Facebook and you can
stream your action sports adventures in
real time using this little setup they
were our sponsor last week they're
joining us again this week they're
really interested in getting this
message out for dads and grads season
you know father's Day is coming up and
kids are getting out of school and so as
people are going on summer vacations if
you want to share your events with
family and friends this might be a
product you would want to check out so
specs on the singer pretty crazy it's a
it's a you HD capable camera it shoots a
4k video at 30 frames per second or
1080p at up to 120 frames per second for
those of you who want that really tasty
crisp slow motion action and one of the
things that I think is super interesting
about this setup is that this is an
Android device so it's running a bill
that i think it's running a build of
KitKat or jelly bean it's no 44 so it's
running it is running a build of KitKat
and that's what i think is kind of
curious if a little action camera like
this can shoot a hundred and twenty
frame per second 1080p video and this
thing is obviously not running like the
most powerful Qualcomm 820 processor how
come our phones can't do it's been crazy
it's not it's you know it's just pushing
the the fragmentation that much further
well you said the f-word I know but nice
this is one of those devices that it's
not a phone it's okay if I mean as long
as it gets a job done that's what's
important well yeah but that's what I
think is so curious is that this is not
a phone it obviously doesn't have the
most robust you know phone chipset and
it doesn't have the biggest battery and
so now we have this really tangible
benefit for having a standalone device
and that it does have these really
killer camera capabilities um but you
know what
the cool things about their partnership
on the on the podcast this week is
they're offering up a promo code for
listeners on this podcast if you want to
grab a sigh oh I I gris 4G of your very
own if you head over to sigh oh I calm
and use promo code pocketnow at checkout
you'll save yourself 30 bucks off the
purchase price of your very own you HD
capable action sports wireless 4g
lte-enabled action camera the iris 4G so
we want to thank them for participating
on the show for sponsoring the show
helping us keep the lights on here and
if you guys want to grab some cool gear
maybe send this to your dad for father's
day or send this to your grad child
who's leaving school and you'll be an
empty-nester and you want to see what
they get up to you in college you
probably don't want to see what they'll
get up to in college um and this might
be a product that you guys want to check
out what was interesting about the promo
video that I just played was that the
this guy was doing all but BMX stuff and
just a whole bunch of people but the
cameras just focused on their facial
features like contorting and different
reactions all this ooh ah well that's
how that's how intense it is you see
sure that's what makes it totes exciting
it is why we're stoked to have them on
board use that promo code pocket now and
check out sigh oh I 4G they're there
they're being really kind to us we're
stoked to what to play ball with them
awesome and so what so let's get into
some actual news hows about well not
before we tell viewers how or listeners
how to write us in miyagi why don't you
ever feedback I'm obviously a not up to
the task but I think you're a little
tired today maybe just a take a little
second rest up while I tell our people
are good people that you can always
ahead us up and we're live just go to
the YouTube page and then there should
be a little Barnett says hangouts join
our hangouts right now and you can enter
that and hit up a question on the Q&amp;amp;A
tab and have people upvote your question
because we would really like to see that
and that's how you get those questions
so that we can see them
and yeah you can do that or you can head
on over to your email and type up
podcast at pocketnow.com you can write
us in any time and yeah we'll be able to
answer some of your questions that way
to boom that's how you do it folks
because we want to hear from you that's
how we kind of keep engaged in this show
it also just kind of helps keep the
podcast feeling fresh so we're going
through all of these shenanigans and
these hijinks so that we can interact
with you guys and see what it is that
you all are interested in seeing in
having us talk about so uh now properly
jumping into the right off the bat we've
got a little blip of a story here that I
was surprised to see actually got some
really heavy traffic on pocketnow.com I
and it's just a naming situation as far
as i can tell that samsung might be
skipping over the note 62 instead give
us a note 7 at the you know the second
half of this year that I mean that's
just a label change though right i
speaking of job titles don't mean
anything I mean do phone labels mean
anything I mean in this case is it's one
of those things it kind of makes sense
you know they're both being you know
both the s7 and the note whatever is
being released in the same year so you
don't want to have that perception that
the that the the phablet flagship is in
any way inferior so honestly just go
ahead and make it 27 a year from now no
one will care I a month from now very
few right and it'll be what it'll be one
of those questions that like like in job
interviewers ask interviewees for like
tech news say so what do you think about
that note 6 and then it's like the
answers then you know I think seven is
just a sexy number i mean when hallway
decided to make the sequel to their
ascend mate ford you know ascend mate 2
4g LTE gotta get the whole name way yeah
absolutely 19 they went up to a 787 and
was the next version and then what else
i mean we have the i don't mean to spoil
things but the
he acts on I just went up to 72 so
sounds just that number you have those
angles you have those Campbell lines
it's just just an awesome number in
design yeah and it's good becoming the
next one phone where every every phone
was a one device for a while I didn't
age to see he is taken evangelist yeah
with the species out a one device of
their own I think that would help their
and their brand ID so so I I totally
greasy though Adam I think this is a
smart branding philosophy especially
since the Galaxy s7 edge has already
been released it's weird having a 7
phablet and a 6 phablet in the same year
yeah I was just kind of curious like
people really seems to light up on this
story that this naming change was
somehow more significant or there was a
bigger deal so just kind of curious to
see all of those uh all those numbers on
the the pond the the website for ya the
traffic going to this story well it's
Samsung so it's huge and awesome it's an
epic thing it's a nice big thing and in
and for it being such a big thing I
think we're done talking about it oh
absolutely one of the big topics that I
thought was really interesting over this
last week was a pebble pebble launching
another kick starter for the pebble time
to the pebble to and the pebble core and
uh you know they I feel they have
purposely set their Kickstarter goals
low so that they can develop those
headlines now sure Apple smashes
Kickstarter goals so I mean it we can
talk about the watches too but i think
immediately one of the first questions
that i want to get your guys as a pinion
on is should kick starter continue to be
used by major companies or larger
companies as a pre pre order or pre
sales platform as opposed to this spirit
of kickstarter being a way to launch
products at otherwise you know crowdfund
products that wouldn't have gotten
approved by other manufacturers right
well i mean i think in general pebble
has a sort of tradition with Kickstarter
you know going back to the original
pebble that's how that's how the
original pebble was launched on text
and when they brought the pebble the
time of the steel and the time and the
time steel they kept reiterating over
and over we're coming to pebble because
that's where our roots are but at the
same time you're a mature company at
this point I mean you've been developing
smartwatches your arguably one of the
pioneers of smartwatches or at least
mainstream smartwatches develop your own
system now I mean it's you know you're a
big boy now you can come and sit at the
big boys table and have your own online
store um you don't have to go you don't
have to go through Kickstarter anymore I
just I see why they're doing it but to
me it's it's honestly just kind of a
lazy way out you don't have to do it but
I mean Kickstarter is just another
financing option as opposed to much more
strenuous terms with the angel investors
venture capital etc etc I think that
they're able to exploit in a well a very
excited audience that has been following
their progress through the years so hey
why not keep on the kick out the the
Kickstarter tree yeah I mean it's also
possible that they wouldn't get nearly
the turnout if they launched on a
different platform like let's say for
whatever they went crazy and they
decided go IndieGoGo instead of fixed or
a guy i honestly think there would be a
decline in sales just because it was an
extra but no I I'm that's I'm not try to
knock IndieGoGo I'm just saying
Kickstarter with its reputation with
pebble you know the to kind of work hand
in hand so I mean it's possible that you
know maybe they've got market analysis
that says if we don't launched on
kickstarter we're only going to sell
three million as opposed to six million
I don't know I total I totally believe
this is the numbers justified and
Kickstarter definitely has the lion
share of the public awareness for how
crowdfunding projects work and you do
get that that bump in social media
traffic because Kickstarter does an
excellent job of leveraging other social
media platforms for sharing and
disseminating projects I just think
there's something a little obvious about
it at this point you know we've got 33
days to go i just looked it up the
kickstarter is well over eight million
dollars when they had a goal of
one right we knew I mean like that one
million-dollar goal was was broken I
think within the first hour yeah of the
the project being live so we all know
that they're playing this game they know
that we know that they're playing this
game and we know that they know that we
can but you know it I kind of feel like
after a point like this kind of takes
away from some of the discussion of the
actual product too I mean we're looking
at the next generation of pebble pebble
time smartwatches I'm I'm a very I'm a
very proud pebble devotees since the
first generation product and i love my
pebble time now I you know we're writing
headlines about Kickstarter writing
headlines about sales goals were writing
later you know articles about um you
know the the the machine behind pebble
and we kind of get around like this
conversation here we kind of get around
to talking about the smart watches after
all that right you know it's funny I
have the same conversation with with my
podcast partners on the tech repair tech
vidcom but anyway and i was saying you
know boy I'd really like to get my hands
on a pebble time to I wonder if I could
sell my pebble time and and the one guy
clip is like why you have a pebble time
why would you want a pebble time to I
mean all it has it's a heart center and
that's really the main difference and
I'm just like you know what it's a good
point maybe it's just because it was on
Kickstarter know if II but but it
creates that kind of the kind of that
enter that was that desire like we get
interested in these things and there's a
positive association to those things I
think that's actually a pretty big idea
especially in light of like recent
stories like Fitbit may or may not have
accurate heart rate sensing capabilities
built into their smartwatches I feel
like fitbit's probably on the right side
of that conversation and other people
are trying to to make their products
seem less reliable than they really are
but there are very few products in the
SmartWatch landscape that are as truly
water-resistant have the same kind of
battery life and now adding a 24-7 heart
rate monitor to the equation when that's
something very difficult to do on
Android wear or the Apple watch without
destroying your battery life ryzza is an
interesting solution you like those are
the whole thing about pebble is there
isn't anything that's mind-blowing about
the pebble experience it's it's that
it's a very measured and conservative
approach to serving notifications and
small pieces of interactions to your
wrist and it does so with the best
possible screen for outdoor viewability
and it does it with crazy long battery
life so you're not going to get anything
is just going to blow you away moving
from a pebble time to a pebble time too
but seeing those little updates like the
heart rate monitor was enough for me to
go yeah I kind of need to push the
button on this all right I I didn't but
ok I contemplated I thought about it I
went to swap ax and I let's set out how
much are they getting four times these
days probably not much right like now
it's like yeah it's like 60 70 bucks I
was gonna say you're like 20 bucks and a
half a ham sandwich okay but if i want
to go from from my time to a pebble to
you know silence wafaa it's only an
extra twenty thirty bucks at sunup
that's not awful so I got in on the
early birds so what the couple to was
gonna be 16 169 ya know where the the
tradition that we have in my household
right now is my wife is currently using
my first generation pebble and she
really likes it so now i said well i
think i have to push a button on this
it's a little you know it's it's it's
hundred seventy bucks but you know it's
not too bad it's not too expensive in
she goes okay fine but I get your pebble
time all right okay win-win you know you
have to try and sell it this is awesome
exactly it's always awesome when you get
that permission slip under down your
tech I mean yeah it's what it seems to
be a good hand me down I just got a new
laptop and now she's like well I need
your old lenovo like okay that's great
on done we've been looking at trying to
get her a new laptop too and she was
playing around with a windows tablet for
a while she was like nah I need a better
keyboard like well what about yeah
that's gonna be great you were meant for
each other oh we're you know what I
every day I reflect on how lucky I am
that she picked me oh so um moving right
along let's get this set up here so um
we don't need to spend a lot of time on
this just because again it was just sort
of a III don't know what this is it's
like a tease it's a leak it's uh it's uh
something it's something fatigue
it's a teak um we have a much better
look at the one plus three and this is
now in in all its glory this doesn't
look like a dummy or a mock-up we were
pretty confident we know what the specs
on this bad boy are going to be and a
lot of people are commenting that this
kind of just looks like an HTC clone a
little bit a little bit and actually I
think this is more of a confirmation
that the leaks that we saw before were
we're legit yeah or accurate so the
whole way a lot of it was a lot of it
looks lovely HTC HTC and inspired um and
so but I mean it's good it's gonna come
down to price and with the oneplus
models that's what it's going to come
down to it has to come it has to be in
that three duh actually I forget what
was the one plus two retailed for was
that for 239 I actually can't remember
just because I can never remember what
the pricing differences are between the
different story close to was 389 for the
64 gig 389 okay so yeah it's got to be
in that same neighborhood for it to be
really you know compelling as a as a
flagship killer but yeah it looks I mean
it looks nice specifications wise and
and did it say the minimum internal
storage is gonna be 64 gigabytes that's
pretty awesome I believe ya 64 gigs that
that's just the one that was sent to
tena so okay yeah so we still don't have
final confirmation on pricing
availability all that fun sure to be
revealed soon because apparently one of
the other sales reps for 1 plus leet
when their announcement was going to be
yeah but you know we've seen I've had
this theory for a while that it sort of
takes around three generations of a
product for a company to start being
taken seriously I was not a huge fan of
the first one plus one especially with
all of the QA issues that seem to go
into manufacturing that device the 1+2 I
was a little cranky about emissions like
NFC and now it seems like we're kind of
getting back on track here with the one
plus three but I have to question you
like in a market where fashion design
aesthetics lifestyle plays
such a significant role in how emotional
a smartphone purchase is does one plus
win themselves any favors when people
could take a look at something like an
HTC 10 I know the HTC 10 is going to be
more expensive but you know you look at
that versus this kind of a device isn't
this still just serving the same
community of Android enthusiasts you
like I don't feel like I say I sell
finds broader appeal better HTC one a9
as opposed to an HTC 10 and we talked
about that I think we're comparing
different price brackets oh we
absolutely are but what I what I mean is
like your general consumer when they
start looking at our we're comparing the
same price bracket that it would be if
it were that HTC decided to sell it for
3 99 right right which we all know that
the a9 was probably a touch overpriced
for what it offered but that's also kind
of what I was what I'm kind of getting
point getting to is when consumers are
checking out flagship phones high-end
phones you know a one plus three is not
going to be on store shelves right
you're not gonna see those at an angel
in the store you're a key in virtual
space so it'd be everywhere what now
that one plus has shown dedication to
this market they've shown consistency in
this market run their third generation
of product releases what really holds
them back from finding a broader appeal
or a larger community of people to to
check out their products oppo oppo shut
them down ok guys got you guys so we did
I mean in that manner but it is I yeah
we've been we're going into our third
year of talking about the flagship
killer and I still wonder you know who
benefits or who's able to find this
product we're still debating about this
whole 1 plus abu connection and whether
or not you know if this is just their
online venture that they want to be you
know quirky and unique in or if one plus
is in fact operating under under their
own volition that
well they just can't make up enough
clout in within their own market and
then well they wouldn't be able to
expand to you like physical retail in
their market and then expand to maybe
possibly international retail like they
just don't have that kind of grip yeah
well the other thing that that needs to
be addressed and if from some of the
rumors have suggested that the invite
system for purchasing the phone is going
to be gone for good and if that's the
case then helped a lot I'm sorry I think
that doesn't that helped a lot Oh
that'll help a ton so if they can get
rid of that I think that that would
definitely um I'll help legitimize the
product I'm all step for man one giant
leap for me I'm seriously I mean it's
that that whole thing that just it felt
chintzy just from from from the start of
it and I understand the reasons behind
it but right you know just like pebble
you know it's time to sit at the big
boys table um you know and stop doing
these you know chintzy feeling type
sales gimmicks and just put the phone
out there let it stand on its own merits
getting good with some outlets like you
know pocketnow.com to get some get some
review devices in hands early so that
there can be a lot of buzz when the
phone actually launches and and you know
just let's let's play play the game like
everybody else does yeah y'all want
these OEMs to be more straightforward
with us and not in case there are little
devices in glam and sparkles but right I
mean they're hanging you're not a fan of
like swarovski crystals um we just gotta
we just got a message from Panzers ii in
the QA a nice product that isn't
available for purchase is always a
hindrance once i like your words because
like you know even if someone does find
out about a1 plus if there's an invite
system you know that most consumers are
gonna go Matt no I can go buy something
now I don't want to sit around and wait
for device to go over the best buy come
on right incident also from Kyle Ruggles
comment about design not that thrilled
by the one plus three they're looking
too much alike now HTC anyone antenna
line design is black do I mean what so I
find this interesting because they're
like some people that like really
praised certain types of design and
smartphone language and then there are
other people that are like antenna lines
that's terrible I've never understood
like you know that that sort of split in
what makes for good aesthetics outside
of that whole beauty is in the eye of
the beholder argument you know I think
that's it i think it is just beauty is
in the eye of the beholder I mean I
think it's just we're looking at one in
the same and we don't like the same be
meek come on getting it together but you
know 11 film that actually does I mean
getting away from the whole aesthetics
thing the one phone that I'm actually
kind of looking forward to like because
it is you know pretty attractive looking
is the the ZTE exon 7 and then moving on
we're going to talk about how oh my god
you're commenting yours for
transitioning Adam how about that you
know what hey how about this little
applause for that little transition but
we're not talking about lenovo we're
talking about the ZTE oh I ordered these
wrong o.o producer fail that's all run
ready everyone send your angry Jules
Wong hate mail to no don't don't do that
he's different tools at pocketnow.com
yeah so we've got the ZTE axon 7 and our
own hi mate iveta is in China right now
as we speak he just produced a short
hands-on video checking out some of the
features there's some really cool tech
on board here those front firing
speakers look delicious especially for
folks who were maybe not on board HTC's
current boomsound experiment these these
might fulfill that gap and then also it
was kind of interesting this interested
to see that this is using a samsung
camera sensor it's using an ISO cell so
it'd be really interesting camera
performance there and a step away from
the current Sony domination of camera
sensors on smartphones but from having
watched I Mays video and seeing like you
know what we're going to be doing for
expanded coverage and talking about the
fingerprint sensor and all
accessories that come with it what did
you guys think about that initial first
impression like ZTE may may be making a
bigger splash with Western audiences Oh
in the phone access I mean we're talking
about 20 mega mega pixel camera when
everyone else is shrinking back and
improving on their low light performance
supposedly but uh yes supposedly but you
know we have this huge AMOLED panel we
have a dual front firing speakers there
Dolby enhanced and there are two
dedicated chipsets 44 hi-fi and it's
just there's a whole lot going for the
hardware and there's also supposedly
daydream um competitive compatibility
yeah so I mean when we're talking about
future forward it feels like this is the
phone that's dividing the spring
flagships from the fall flagships and I
commend CTE for making the first step
yeah and I just looking at the whole
screen to bezzle ratio I mean there's
just there's like no there's no wasted
space on this thing actually that and
it's almost kind of a detriment because
that front facing camera sitting in the
middle of that speaker grill not a fan
of that I'll be honest you know at least
without some type of some type of
balancing mark on the other side but
yeah but I mean it's one of its one of
the quote unquote downsides of having
this much screen the bezel ratio which I
mean this thing is it just looks massive
just because there's there's practically
nothing on either side it's just this
gigantic screen and two little speakers
and that's it half bound to I mean we're
talking about what eight eight
millimeters thickness and edging up
towards that 200 gram mark I bet that
feels real good though that feels really
great unibody aluminum like we're ever
tired about I've never been a huge fan
of having the lightest possible phone I
don't like that wafer plasticky
lightweight feeling I kind of have one
that feels
not rugged I mean while i do like rugged
phones to for specific purposes but I
kind of like that that by like this
feels substantial it feels well built
yeah you know like the HTC 10 I get that
feeling from it it's just every time I
pick that up I'm just like man this
feels so good and it's not that's not
the latest not finished but it's well
proportioned well-balanced and it feels
right right hand and I think that that
that that's an important you know
distinction to make between just sort of
a heavy device and uh and just so you
know I have the original axon in my
presence here and based on that I can
tell you that the software is pretty
decent it's you know just close to stock
even so there's really not much to
complain about Z together a Chinese
manufacturer doing its thing here so I
mean there is you have to really be
nitpicking here at least from far away
you know we haven't gotten our hands on
it so I mean I might have well and I've
been excited to see some of the things
he was talking about like going back to
your point Jules about the software that
this is going to be a you know a Chinese
device that doesn't just mimic the
iphone it's been one of my biggest
complaints with Huawei's is they get rid
of the app drawer in your notification
shade has that split toggle vertically
just like iPhones have and I like if i
want to buy an iphone i'll go buy an
iphone um so I'm really happy to see a
more traditional home screen app drawer
layout on on a Chinese manufacturer
device really happy to see that this is
another company that's taking the
fingerprint sensor seriously that this
is supposedly wicked fast performance
for a fingerprint sensor and really I
think the the only question is going to
be one um is ZTE capable of producing
this for Western audiences quickly so
that it doesn't kind of get lost in the
shuffle on other phone releases and to
how much do we think this thing is going
to be once it starts landing in Europe
and in North America well time I said
sub 500 and well they put up an ad in
The Wall Street Journal so we do expect
this to come along we just haven't had
any inkling about it
uh and that's I mean wouldn't it suck if
it were if everything changed from you
know crossing the Pacific it's just
funny that's happened to a bunch of us I
mean we didn't we get burned not burned
that that's a little too strong but you
know when um when Sony delivered z
phones to the United States we lost out
on fingerprint sensors now I know that
the ZZ phones were having some issues
with the implementation on their first
fingerprint sensor but still like parts
were carved out of that phone and that
also happens in Reverse where companies
like HTC will put in lower spec
processors on certain models of their
phones for different markets just kind
of help with costs so put in a 652 ooh
in the Chinese HTC 10 and that only got
250 one pre-orders from the little thing
outside well that would not look good on
Kickstarter ya know that that would
absolutely not break any Kickstarter
sales records no headlines there at all
um so I really an impressive offering
especially from a company that I think
here in the United States CTE is kind of
isn't it more associated with like MVNO
players and less expensive devices if
something like this started popping up
to handle the undercut phones like the
galaxy s7 and the LG g5 does this create
enough word of mouth that consumers
might actually start looking at some of
these other companies as options I think
Huawei is starting to build some name
recognition in the United States I think
ZTE has a as a killer offering on their
hands here provided it doesn't have any
catastrophic flaws right so we review it
um isn't the only thing these companies
back just advertising at this point I
think that would be about that that is
about it i mean that's and that's where
Samsung is you know nominees that it's
yeah it's absolutely dominated so uh and
i think in this case CT definitely has
an attractive and attractive enough
product that it would back up the
advertising that would that would come
along with it so absolutely i want to
see them get out there and get there and
start so let's let's start let's start
putting some ZTE phones in the hands of
uh not 90210 hawaii 50 k and 90210 Wow
still using Windows Phones ah probably I
think the last time I I fired up in
episode of hawaii five-o everyone was on
Lumias and it just made me so sad I know
Oh what could have been and I still
without that surface and put it on the
on the hood of the car that's so
beautiful i drugged me we um go ahead
Jules I'm just gonna fire this up in the
Q&amp;amp;A no yeah I was about were you going
to do a Evan Adams question oh no real
quick I was just going to detail Panzers
II rights what we need is a refreshed
version of the samsung captivate a steal
back with removable battery aluminum
glass is so played out that's so 2008 Oh
blah so which one did you want to talk
about that huh yeah Evan Adams who was
asking about software updates and he's
considering HTC 10 because of those
updates yeah they do have this thing
called the axon passport program where
it's a whole bunch of services it's just
like HTC oh they also provide a screen
of first screen replacement for free and
there's a whole bunch of a warranty
extended warranty kind of thing going on
there and hopefully across the industry
we see a manufacturer's picking up you
know some of the slack on offering
updates for their devices we're gonna go
yeah in just a little bit but first I
want to switch gears here my hump day in
March by the way of marshmallow so oh
yeah mmm-hmm that's actually not too bad
considering not too bad though the pack
Android sex um but we do want to switch
gears here we're going to talk about
motorola moto and lenovo we got some
sales numbers coming from those two
companies and it's not looking super
Rosie the the first year of this
partnership between these two
manufacturers that I that moto is
failing to generate sales that it's not
really moving the market and that these
devices don't seem to be appealing and
they're kind of curious what your guys's
take on motorola's current position
might be well here's the thing and i am
not a business expert by any stretch of
the event and met
so but here's how I see it lenovo picked
up a company in motorola that was having
trouble sustaining itself and now
they're surprised when Motorola's having
trouble sustaining itself yeah it I hate
to draw this parallel so forgive me
audience but when HP bought palm it's
not like palm was really only two parts
and so HP I mean I think I'd literally
think that there was a board meeting
when HP said well we'll just pick up
palm will put an HP sticker on it and
people will buy it because it says HP
right that's how it works right and then
in fire sale and it's almost like and
it's almost like Lenovo and moto are
doing the same thing you know Lenovo is
like oh well you know we'll just take
this company and we'll put a lenovo
sticker on it and people will buy it
because it's lenovo right we've got all
these great laptops people love our
don't know what sticker to put on it
that's the problem that's another
problem too but it's just it's I in it
always surprises me when you know a big
companies by these other companies that
you know are not I don't want to say
failing per se but not doing all that
great and then they're like oh my god
this doesn't do it all that great what's
happened I don't get it so it's just
everybody I guess all these companies
think they can be the White Knight to
like charge in and rescue you and then
like their horse breaks a leg on the way
in and like now they're stuck in the
fire to and more legal realizable horse
already had broken legs before they even
jumped on it yeah right like that that
might be a little harsh for Motorola's
what if I was looking at those numbers
as we were scrolling by 11 million
devices and somewhere around five
million of them were contributed from
Motorola right which is almost fifteen
percent I don't see how that's bad well
and also but I mean like that in terms
of sale numbers those are a little
surprising when we were seeing a
motorola that was building some momentum
so motorola was having difficulties as
their own company under Google's
tutelage we got some killer devices we
got that that first push into those
great moto g's the Moto X 2 was is still
a beautiful
phone like that is still an eminently
usable phone today um and then when when
Google and moto parted ways Google kept
kind of all the good R&amp;amp;D stuff hmm and
then lenovo got sort of the main phone
business that was sort of just servicing
the current market today I find it you
know you know we were i was talking
briefly about sort of my 3 year strategy
we were just into that territory where
motorola was building momentum was being
taken more seriously had great
connections with with google and the
android development team and we're
kicking some killer devices near stock
devices just beautiful execution on all
of these phones and don't consumers sort
of pump the brakes when we see a major
shift in ownership like that sure than
that mean we got to have to like start
from scratch in not from scratch we have
to start over and kind of rebuilding
that momentum we've got see compelling
devices come from lenovo moto and then
we can start looking at motorola is a
serious competitor again if Lenovo is a
Chinese company is in this for the long
term I would expect that they probably
first saw some kind of dip after the
first year of devices I mean it's
difficult for me to imagine a scenario
where sales would just have continued to
grow right right multi rational well and
i also want to pump the brakes myself
and say you know my explanation of it is
way oversimplifying so please nobody put
stock in that and like you know i know i
don't want to see this on the internet
on twitter later saying well i'm so this
no okay it's way over simplified so
don't get me wrong i am not an expert
don't plan it don't pretend to be an
expert that's not like novo even way
there they had great sales before hand
in there in a domestic market but
they've just been beaten down by Huawei
by Xiaomi by meizu everyone else and you
know that that took them from top five
man you manufacturer down to wherever is
bill so it's not just Motorola's faults
here no no it's not and i also want to
you know point out that
there's also a tone that I don't think
that the article necessarily reflects
there's probably a tone to Lenovo's
expectations for what Motorola was going
to burn moto was going to bring so I
mean if Lenovo went into this thinking
oh we're gonna you know quadruple our
revenue in the first year then yeah
obviously expectations were were not set
right but if Lenovo is making this
announcement like you know where it
didn't have him you know didn't have as
many sales as we kind of liked but you
know no big deal then you know then we
just move on and we move into year two
of the building reputation and and
hopefully by next year we can have the
2014 Moto X hopefully this acquisition
doesn't mean lights out for the company
right on no I I don't think that's
that's going to be the case especially
as we've got that event coming up on an
on jun 9th and so I'm actually going to
be flying up to San Francisco to cover
that we've got a couple comments here in
the QA about this Motorola's sort of a
sweetheart company for a number of
people in our audience I so we've got
from Tiger bait calm addressed the Moto
X leaks with the three modular
attachments we've seen I mean we talked
about that on previous episodes of the
podcast that Motorola might have a
better take on a modular phone than what
we've seen from LG so we're definitely
going to be looking into that and then I
so just sort of the rumors that are kind
of floating around on moto Z as to
whether or not that's going to be a new
ultra flagship tier which is kind of
funny watching these companies trade
positions as we are looking at a sony x
line coming out to replace the Xperia Z
and we could be looking at some kind of
moto Z to supersede the Moto X um just
like we were saying with ones and sevens
we kind of need to find some other
letters yeah symbols or something to
talk about smartphones because they're
really yeah i'm in a delta I think we
need moto feathers I think it's gonna be
our next bad thing will have blood
feathers in plaster those will be the
two the two materon and an flagship it
should be that place in Wales that's
like you know London did go wing go go
go yeah absolutely
I think it's next Batman character Tala
get on that one and and once those
phones arrive we can all count on much
better upgrade in software support
because Google is going to start shaming
manufacturers that don't update their
devices in a timely fashion and I think
we're all really happy to see this
coming down the pipe because something
needs to change in Android land and
Google is really the only company that
can exert pressure on all of these
various manufacturers to stay on top of
security exploits and for newer features
that are going to be coming to our
mobile phones no and it's also and and
it should be mentioned that right now
this this list of manufacturers is is
internal it's it's something that's you
know past being passed around the
company and it's not going to be it's
not external right now so there's not a
lot of public shame going on right now
whether or not that changes it remains
to be seen but it would be really nice
if if if Google could start pointing
fingers just not not only from a
fragmentation you know standpoint but
also just from a consumer standpoint you
know if there was an official official
list of uh you know manufacturers and
and how they're keeping up with updates
I think that would actually help from
from a consumer standpoint be like you
know hey I'm gonna go pick up this new
blah blah phone and and then you look at
this listen here they're like way down
nearly oh well you know if I don't have
the latest software then the phone's
going to be you know susceptible to its
gonna below various security flaws so
maybe I should think about picking up
something else and I think I think it's
gonna be great for consumers and it's
gonna be great for geeks and it's gonna
probably gonna be good for Google as
well because OEMs will want to move up
that list well I'm sorry sorry Jules
rook why don't we see like every website
you know pocketnow.com included we all
try to put out lists of who did a good
job of updating their devices this year
and it's really difficult tracking down
that kind of information I don't know
there's a lot of stuff that we've got to
sift through
for when updates were applied and when
they were actually released and then you
usually have some kind of teared release
where 20 people get them day-of and then
the rest of the audience get some like a
month later um that happened to me on
Windows Phones um no in trying to
tabulate all that information who would
know better at Google so I completely
agree i'm absolutely hoping that we see
this list made public just like with
Netflix ranking ISPs for network
performance this is absolutely
information that transcends geek and
norm you know like yeah I think everyone
would want to know my device is getting
supported the company has a great track
record of applying security fixes and
bug fixes I feel confident in continuing
to give them money for products and
services I'm sorry Jules what were you
gonna say well I was going to say that
we should be differentiating as fantasy
points out i believe difference between
security patch updates and major point
feature absolutely and you know i mean
because point feature updates i mean
when we're talking about Play Store apps
most of them you know hey android 4.4
you're good you're fine and just the
comparability of those features works
out fine Samsung has been good I believe
on the security patches not so much on
the point upgrades but LG has been i
think the antithesis yeah been there and
I've emesis out of that I mean I've seen
the pretty early LG upgrades for the g4
I mean no that's actually a great point
from Panzers e to because um sorry
excuse me no that's a great point in
that I think we're all sort of
accustomed to the idea that smartphones
are maybe going to get two years of
major support for new releases on
operating systems but we have seen you
know a tremendous a sort of oversight
for all of the devices that are floating
out there in the Android ecosystem that
don't even receive security updates or
bug fixes anymore when we see sales when
we see usage numbers in the galaxy s3
still a crazy popular thrown around the
world that's a phone that will never
properly be upgraded against the current
generation of exploits and security
holes and that's that's a very unhappy
situation to be in on such a major
smartphone platform it's kind of like
all of the zombie windows XP machines
that are still out there you know
infected with God knows why we're kind
of creating a similar situation in
androidland when we look at the
worldwide community what we need is less
latency just like the latency on my
internet connection right now mine too
yeah it's great thanks google hangouts
so um moving right along google shaming
yes make it public we all want to know
anyone else do it just just do it um in
in another shameful turn of events for
fans of phones that are you know smaller
or niche platforms paypal is making a
little bit of public news today that
their app is saying adios to Windows
Phone blackberry OS and the Amazon fire
phone so for the ten people that we're
still on the Amazon fire phone you can
no longer make your paypal purchases off
of that device thank you can / no longer
buy your ebay purchases on your Amazon
phone really you have the fire phone you
should just be buying everything from
Amazon anyway yeah yeah it's probably
true um yeah it's it's unfortunate and
you know like you said it's it's niche
type type products I would say Amazon's
far more niche than Windows blackberry
but at the same time you know I and what
that what do they say they had to
properly devote their resources to
devices that have creating user Sri best
experiences were customers is there as
they're very very diplomatically trying
to say we just want to make apps for iOS
and Android yeah for well if they want
to they want to make a abs for their
ninety-eight percent of their customers
not be that you exercise
is the one thing that i did find kind of
curious we don't have to spend a lot of
time on this it's just sort of sad news
for people that are still in those
platforms but would there be any benefit
for paypal making a universal Windows
app or for most of the transactions that
people engage with on the windows 10
various windows 10 platforms is the web
browser good enough to handle your
paypal in there I'm not sure what kind
of experience you would get in terms of
a paypal app I mean if you are browsing
with your chrome app and you encountered
something with paypal and I mean would
that redirect that the whole
interactions and the whole feature set
I'm just I just wouldn't be clear on
that introducing instant apps by oh no
no my last week I mean I use I use the
web browser for for all my paypal
transactions I will occasionally look at
the app while I'm out on the go but I
mean for the most part if I'm doing all
the way pal I'm sitting down at the
computer and doing it but that's just my
usage so only racking my brain I
couldn't come up with like a usage
specific scenario where on my laptop on
my Windows 10 tablet on my Windows 10
desktop we're having a Windows 10 paypal
app would have provided me a better
experience or even just like a
comparable one well I almost always have
a web browser up leaving the browser to
open an app i would think one step was
making me like oh but i don't want to do
that i already have a browser oh but at
the same time if you if you have like an
app where you always logged in maybe
that would be nice uh you know as
opposed to having to enter a username
and a password but yeah that's about it
that that pretty much introduced that in
this update well excellent yeah
excellent so uh yeah it's just yeah so
it sucks but it's the reality of the
situation yep so unfortunately for you
folks on those those other third party
platforms a like I have to imagine that
you know symbian users and webos users
or
likely able to commiserate with you guys
but sadly paypal on those platforms will
be no more unless of course we go to
court also we go to court and we force
all app developers to develop for all
platforms like blackberry at one point
John Chang do you think yeah you could
pull that off be curious to see what ya
antitrust might be for a paypal app on
all platforms I'm gonna invent a
linux-based phone and cell like three
dev kits and then demand that konami i'm
a paypal app yeah absolutely the
antitrust so that makes me want to drop
claire forlani his name there so oh ok
all right i mean it's not particularly
relevant but we are always down for a
good claire forlani conversation I sure
sure I'm sure so is absolutely not
Claire Forlani is it as a story that
also got surprising amount of traffic on
pocketnow.com and what I wanted to put
you guys on the spot this is another
thing where I'm racking my brain to
really get what it is that people are
finding exciting about this I'm really
coming across as old man fuddy-duddy bag
nel this week that's right is not the
role I like to play I like to be the
more excited guy about technology but we
um we got this this tease from one uh
was it from one plus i don't know it's
from OBO from a leak so that they have
apparently been working for months on a
foldable phone and that this device you
know again I don't understand the
benefits of having a phone screen that
can fold in half over what traditional
phones can offer like I am not quite
sure what it is it's so exciting about
having a clamshell that folds in half so
i'm i'm sort of tagging you guys but I'm
also hoping that people in the cubicle
drops a comment ready ready for this
this might be ready here we go tennis
with his jewels it works cool yeah yes
and it's like it would be like it would
be like one of those Star Trek
communicators where you flip it open you
real upper room captain's log stardate
483 5.2
is the phone that we all face and not to
mention when you want to hang up on
somebody it is so much more satisfying
to be like fine buy food you know as
opposed to just like you know fine bye
beep so uh and I think unless they're
reinforcing it with Gorilla Glass that
might be a problem what is with with
having some kind of foldable device
there's that can't be a glass display
right yeah or at least it would have a
line down the middle of it which would
be less than optimal um but yeah I just
I think we're just we just need to have
you know like in Dungeons and Dragons
terms we need bracers of smartphone you
know so we can wear on our look no oro
by the power of grayskull you can put
your arms together and it'll like flash
up a cute cat video and it'll make
thieves run away you know I think that
would be the ideal you so we've seen a
number of likes like science fiction
loves showing us translucent phones
phones like that are like you can see
through them which I've never understood
what the big benefit would there be and
some major security issues if someone
can look at what you're doing true then
also we've also seen like in a number of
movies like rollout displays yes that's
what I will that's what I want I want to
roll out display where you know it's
like in a tube and if you want to use a
phone you just pull it a little bit and
you get a phone and then if you want to
watch a movie then you pull it out a lot
and you've got a big screen TV ah
instantly scalable displays you were you
just pinch to zoom yeah exactly exactly
and you can pull them down from the
bottom to and you can make a six by four
you know while display for your netflix
and then commit the Kree or two or thing
you can you could make a decree or you
know possibly a proclamation if you're
if you're she'll be so inclined ah but
yeah i mean i'm not really all that all
that looking forward to foldable phones
but I mean the scroll the scroll ones I
could see being a lot more compelling so
and it's also another thing to consider
is not just foldable but all
so just a bendable display you know
various other form factors where you
could actually put like a smart phone a
smart phone to like display I don't not
say it's going to be a smart phone and I
think we've all said that you know if
iOS and Android are ever going to be
offset it's going to be by something
completely new so you know maybe we're
going to have smart helmets or something
in the future I don't know but it's that
this could very well be like a next
generation type product which is going
to assure us in to whatever is going to
be the next you know the next generation
of mobile communications yeah I mean
that oh go ahead jewels I'll cue up the
QA while we're yeah I mean we have to
start using these flexible id's in some
way I mean talking about making them fit
to the form of an iphone and all glass
iphone maybe have an all screen iphone
at some point yeah that that would
require a flexible OLED so somehow
someway we have to realize that these
components are out in the market and we
should probably start using them somehow
well we've got from Joel GJ and he
writes no shattering screen when the
phone hits the ground that could be kind
of interesting if the displays all right
under suitable does that necessarily
mean that the device is going to be
inherently more rugged or more lifestyle
proof and they're from Kyle Ruggles
we've got clam shells for a tablet great
for a phone not so much unless you can
quickly use it with one hand and that's
another thing that I kind of look at
like if your phone is closed what does
that do to affect things like usage
because I mean especially this this demo
that we've seen from op oh that does
look like a bulkier device than what
we've sort of grown accustomed to on
standard phones no I think it's also
yeah there's definitely a but I think it
would also make a smartphone smaller um
you know we're yeah we're pushing for
smaller and thinner and this would
definitely bulk up on the thickness but
if the phone is only say four inches by
three inches as
to you know eight inches by three inches
i think that would probably be a lot
more attractive for pocket writing and
whatnot so Evan Adams writes clamshell
equals best way for Nintendo to bring
the DS to Android I can say I if I were
Nintendo I would absolutely just be
making the next in nintendo DS out of a
similar setup like it on that don't even
try and bother competing in the Android
space just beat phone manufacturers to
this type of technology and tempo
another portable game console that'll
last for a while interesting i jus right
across my twitter feed one of our
competitors came across with the Google
ready to shame partners you don't
upgrade a trick that's like yeah we we
already got past that one we already you
mentioned on the podcast in fact yeah I
mean come on was I fancy so um we uh
we're gonna we're sort of wrapping up
with the news here but Before we jump
into listener mail um and and wrapping
up some of the other comments in the Q&amp;amp;A
I wanted to take just a second um to
briefly talk politics I try and avoid
any sort of political deep dives on the
show around this channel but we recently
went through sort of the FBI vs apple
case and we're gearing up for another
fight in Congress over budgets and
appropriations spending for the FCC and
so there's currently a bill being
offered on on spending that is going to
cut FCC spending and then a severely
declaw what the FCC is capable of
regulating here in the United States now
it is not my job as an editor pocketnow
to tell you how I think you should
support or oppose legislation like this
but what I will ask for the members of
our audience here in the United States
to seriously consider looking at this
bill and then writing your local
congressman or congresswoman to voice
your support or opposition for the style
spending I know there are a number of
people in our audience that are probably
conservatives and libertarians who feel
like free market solutions will be the
appropriate response to business
regulations
and I know that there are going to be
people that are in favor of even
stricter regulation over our data
communication networks and
telecommunications industry and so my my
plea is for more of us to get involved I
feel as geeks we should be leading the
conversation we should be resources for
people in our circle of friends and
families and throughout our communities
for this kind of information to add to
the discussion and to raise the level of
discussion I think what we saw from the
FBI vs apple case was this stuff gets
dangerous when the people who really
know what's going on are not being
listened to and so that's where I hope
we can contribute to this discussion we
can contribute and participate politely
with respect to people who might not
understand the ramifications of these
business moves as well as we do but I
would hope that people in our audience
can can start leading the conversation
more than just joining the conversation
or even just that notion you like I have
that knee-jerk reaction where I just
want to complain on Twitter so yesterday
instead of complaining on Twitter i took
my complaint and I drafted a paragraph
of text and I sent it to my the
congressman in my district and it was
the same roughly the same amount of time
as I would have spent on crafting a
Facebook post but it went directly to
someone who has been actually do
something about can actually do
something and so in voicing my opinion
there I feel like my time was actually
better served than just complaining to
the people that I already know agree
with me you know preaching to the choir
of the people who I follow on social
media well yeah but how many retweets
did it get zero and actually know what
I'm kind of fine with that and no likes
you might have okay with that Sanford
four people in the United States this is
coming up you know for the 2017 fiscal
budget so I would recommend checking
this information out now for people in
other communities around the world I
would still ask that you join in the
participation of these tech discussions
with your local elected officials
because it's never a good idea to wait
for the United States to figure stuff
out you know um if I almost never rose
out it never was out by the time we've
moved on a particular topic leaders in
your area are already in the process
Tess of developing the responses to
there's two similar situations you know
when it came to encryption we saw a
flurry of activity in the UK regarding
very similar issues in terms of data
security and privacy waiting for us to
figure out what was going on at the FBI
Apple case would have been a terrible
move in actually drafting a policy that
will affect us for generations to come
and and again it's never my job to tell
you how I think you should vote on these
things but I I always ask that you guys
because I know you're smarter than than
or more tech savvy and smarter than the
average consumers out there that you
that you join the conversation because I
think your input will be invaluable for
how we move forward on these types of
topics and discussions I just think your
balls are part of the liberal media
machine I'm so torn on a number of these
issues because i am a capitalist at
heart I mean like I'm all about like if
I can be rich imma be rich yeah but
these conversations are so nuanced and
we leave them up to the media that we
have liberal media or conservative media
they're always way oversimplified and I
really do feel that that that the
majority of Americans who care enough to
even tuned in are going to understand
some of these nuances when they're
better presented and so what tools do we
have at our disposal to better
disseminate the new ones of a discussion
it's us we're that tool we're that
resource we're tools absolutely but if
we if we if we continue to be as cynical
as sometimes we've been in the past if
we continue to take our ball and go home
then our voice doesn't contribute to the
discussion and the discussion is led by
people who should probably not be
leading that discussion so that's always
my plea to this community is we can do
better we absolutely can and i feel we
should go blah blee that power love it
and so let's get to some Q&amp;amp;A is just
real quick I mean the first one that I
see here from heaven Adams Tom Wheeler
has been surprisingly less bad than
people thought he would be yeah he was a
staunch uh um punk-ass lobbyist yes he
was a thank you I couldn't I couldn't
find the word lobbyist and he's actually
turned out to be
a pretty fairly uh um balanced head for
the FCC chairman for the FCC I'm losing
words like all over the place here my
brain is ejecting at sir what was I had
right i'm gonna make it you make it
mm-hmm I know we're so close so close um
where's the other QA a bunch of people
jumped in with stuff isn't there some
sort of flip phone motorola is coming
out with if you guys seem uh talking
about the moto razr little flashback ad
i I don't see anything there it just
leads to the June ninth date so lenovo
tech world we're gonna see that mmm yeah
i haven't heard anything beyond that Oh
dozy I'm losing I thought I had one
other QA here but I think we're gonna
have to move on to uh listen email you
were male here I'll get these cute up
right now you had the bong bong oh no
the bong bong and yeah we've gotta do it
once the hmong bong sounds it's official
already get to the number one or yeah i
got number one for me while I I cute his
back up alright so my favorite person of
the day is mr. Billy cool cool and he
writes I currently own a galaxy note 5 I
really love great sounding high quality
mp3 audio via headphone jack my big
question is is there big enough reason
to switch to the HTC 10 rather than
sticking with the note line based on
that alone I'm due for my annual upgrade
in August and would very much appreciate
your opinion thank you so I picked this
question specifically because Adam
you've been rocking an HTC 10 what if
you're one of your impressions been I've
been rocking it for like a day and a
half um so I unfortunately have seemed
to have misled you in this um my my
train my train ticket is an e-ticket
that i keep on my phone and my metra is
the is the the the company by rail yeah
yup so they only allow you to move your
train ticket to a different device once
per month which for normal people
is perfectly fine for people like us
it's a stupid problem to have but I've
already had my train ticket on two
different phones now so i could wasn't
able to move it to the HTC so I had to
just not use the HTC for for a while
anyway so all that aside I haven't had
the chance to listen to any audio
although I know right although I have it
from a reliable source that the audio
output quality is sublime so hmm I
wonder what could have been it
definitely was not one of our editors
who's currently in China so actually he
thought it was pretty good too though
I'm he was cranky when I got the cuz
they had to send the 10 to me to do the
camera review right that's maybe the
crate crankiest I've seen Jaime about it
but you're gonna send it back to me
right where's yeah he's that came with
it come on man what's going on but no
hardware so I'm I'm under the impression
that the the audio quality is is
wonderful I can't confirm that but watch
my twitter feed I will make sure to do
that over the weekend and play some nice
high quality audio and and come back
with a with a judgment I'll be curious
to see your thoughts now one of the
things like when we're talking about
whether or not we're gonna make a phone
recommendation for someone else to spend
their money I can't really answer like
the no.5 as a solid performer oh yeah
really it's really good all around I
don't think it wins any major categories
when it comes to audio reproduction but
there aren't any significant deficits
that I can find on unknown 5 hardware so
it's really tricky when we're talking
about a single use case example for us
to be able to say oh yeah well if that's
your thing then you should total is
better yeah body this phone which is
only a couple months older than this
other phone or any only a couple months
newer than this other phone so you know
I would be careful because you really
want to weigh the sum total of
everything that you use a device for if
you ever click the S Pen well you need
to stick with a note like writers no
other offering that really uh champions
that kind of
activity usage um cameras are pretty
similar but you still want to look at
what it is that you focus on what it is
that you do with your device before
moving on um I one of the ring is when
up specifically because of audio and
Adam you just got your HTC 10 bless our
general this is all this is one of the
most common questions that we get on
this podcast and at least this one gave
us some kind of criteria yeah I like
listening to music but I can't tell you
the number of emails that we get hey
guys so I've got a galaxy s3 that's
that's totally dead it's time for me to
get a move on i'm looking at an HTC 10
LG g5 or a galaxy s7 what should I buy
yeah and our our answer to that question
is yes or maybe I want to start saying
no yeah but not it is good that he did
have that that specific audio request
and I'm I unfortunately am not qualified
to answer it um but yeah you know I i
will i'm actually got this email in my
inbox so I could even write them a quick
audio review once i get that looks like
i think yeah great I and and because I
am a very particular snob about what I
enjoy about like headphone audio and
speaker audio and camera tech and things
like that look me and I'd be very
curious to see what your experiences are
just to see if I'm kind of you know up
my own but I also i also will say that
at the HTC demo where i got the HTC 10
they very much focused on the audio
experience from the HTC 10 where there
is there's actually like a setup process
that you can go through and you can
actually adjust the equalizer through
presumably a user-friendly set up to
like just perfectly cater to your audio
needs so i will be doing all of that
this weekend so never fear but i will CC
you as well and and then a chameleon
article i don't know and kyle ruggles
also writes in and this this might help
you out mr. cool um if he's tech-savvy
he could root his note and install Viper
for android it'll bring new life back
into the no 54 audio I keep the note if
I was in this position if he needs
productivity so that's also another
solution there too is that maybe the
stock
software just isn't giving you the right
eq color the right amp bump that might
be looking for you can actually tweak
some of the sound coming off these
devices even the Samsung built in eq has
some interesting features that you can
pull way to kind of tweak and Taylor
audio what are the weird I mean in this
case he's saying he actually likes the
audio so I don't know if he doesn't
necessarily needs to adjust it he's just
looking for something fresh is he
looking for a seven out 10 or nine out
of ten dollars into ranks uh I give it I
give it an 11.3 on a scale of 7 to 17 on
my things with full moons comment on to
the next viewer yeah I was about to say
the only flex I have are outta shape and
that makes for a fun experience but yeah
on my HTC 10 definitely bright and I'm
just loving it and cool that amp does a
great job of driving even more resistive
headphones I didn't say that properly by
people in the chat and on YouTube
comments will correct me for our they'll
get all me moving ohms moving on to next
email this one comes from an eco Martin
and Anika rights I want to ask regarding
the new messaging app from Google allo
why does google why doesn't Google give
us a low features in the form of an
update to hang out it would be easier
for people to use that feature rather
than launching a new app which are which
is making the user which I sorry this is
written a little making user yassel
giving the user a hassle to move
contacts from hangouts to this I think
at least Google should be consistent
with their app at least I think they
should make a button to move contacts
from hangouts to hollow what do you
think about why Google is making zoom so
we talked about this a little bit more
in a little bit more in depth in our
podcast right after Google i/o but you
know with a little time a little
distance Adam what do you think about
this strategy it seems to me like this
is a way around built-in messaging
clients like this is another split so
that they can update this free from
carrier and manufacturer influenced but
also means that they're creating another
separate piece right that consumers need
to download on their own well as I
actually tweeted over the over the
weekend I said you know I'm not sure why
I'm surprised that Google now has four
messaging apps considering they have to
mapping apps and how many do you really
need um so I think there's making making
an update you hangouts would be fine
except I don't want to say lipstick on a
pig except it's just I don't know
anybody that you actually uses hangouts
I mean even even even the Nexus phones
now have a separate messaging app beyond
hang out so I don't necessarily know
that hangouts to ello is the natural
progression here I don't if anything
messaging to a low would would make more
sense I would think as far as like
transferring contacts from one to the
other if you're like me all of your
contacts are in Google anyway so I don't
think that's going to be much of a
problem and if your contacts aren't in
google put them in google for God's
sakes because um I don't want it I don't
want to have you well you know one day
having to post on Facebook hey I lost my
phone so if you could all PM me your
phone numbers that'd be great you know I
actually wrote an article about that
back in December about how to preserve
all your stuff in the cloud so if your
contacts aren't in google put them in
google so do that now don't even and
then the rest of this conversation
becomes somewhat irrelevant but now I
don't like I don't mind I don't mind the
fact that they came out with a new
messaging app I think it's gonna be I
think it'll be fine I think the people
that want it will use it and i think
that people that don't will use
something else i mean i think that's
that's kind of where we are there's such
a saturation that that people are going
to use what they want to use you know
some people still use whatsapp some
people use snapchat some people use SMS
for whatever reason and that's actually
a great point Jules do you think that
this might be just googles way of sort
of thrown everything up in the air and
seeing what sticks well I'm going to
have to say no because and I'm gonna
have to ask you why
you think that way well I i was i was so
wanting to say yes but i just don't feel
like google would know wouldn't do this
without having some sort of master
strategy uh maybe a year down the road
or two years down the road and I know
that's talking you know nonsense times
from this point in 2016 but there has
there has to be a way that they tile
these plot threads together so to speak
wait I mean there they have messenger
they have google hangouts and they're
kind of hinting that they're about to
like um I don't know separate things
once again and then maybe everything
will just blow up my voice google voice
is like the conch add the cockroach
it'll be left after the nuclear disaster
oh I'm still the house is alert I I
posted on Facebook 90 AD google voice
number so yeah sure okay Juelz with the
vote for tech optimism google has to
have a plan hello yeah i want to be
different no it's prep this up with our
last viewer mail comes from devore
divorce actually been writing a bunch of
emails in um and with very funnily
threatening email titles if we don't
read i would talk to you a second time
so this one has to do with one of our
favorite topics I actually recently
produced a video on pocketnow.com
talking about lag and soda for rights
note5 lag there have been a few articles
about processor speed on lag I'm pocket
now there's been a lot of news regarding
the new note how does the note 5 stat
stand up with the approach of the note 6
or 7 prices will start to drop on the
no.5 how is it holding up we're starting
to look at you know whether or not we
should be producing after the buzz
segments for these types of phones you
know we've got these companies that
develop reputations and Samsung seems to
have stuck with this reputation that
after a couple months their devices
slowed way down and so I was I was
hoping especially Adam you could comment
on what your some of your experiences
been using devices for longer than just
that first week review but how do we
feel about you know devices aging lag is
this a software problem is this really
like a consumer just accumulates a lot
of crap so all computers will start to
slow down over time lag is a very
divisive topic in our yeah yeah I'm now
I don't have a note 5 but I do I have
been using the s6 edge relatively
regular pretty similar hardware yeah so
relatively similar um and it's actually
been my my experience that the lag has
been um I don't know it was a good thing
or a bad thing but it's been pretty
consistent through the through the years
uh I mean there were time there and read
my review rebuttal which went up God
almost a year ago um you know there's
there's times that the phone starts to
kind of stutter and you just kind of not
do yourself and you just push through
for the next five minutes or so until it
clears itself up and that's still the
same that we get today so as far as the
Samsung specific leg is concerned it's
it's better it's it's a lot better than
older Samsung devices that I would use
um but it's still there um and it still
rears its head every now and then but
not with any more consistency years III
was i I've been one of these people
where I've you know voiced my opposition
to this notion that Samsung specifically
seems to have this notion of lag and all
devices will slow down over time I've
noticed one very odd slow down on my
Galaxy s7 so I don't have the S Evan
edge I have the s7 and it's on the
fingerprint sensor so this not
experienced on any other phone we're on
my s7 when when I go to you know hit my
thumb at the bottom of the seven it's
now like one out of four it'll just sit
there and look at me it won't actually
unlock the device I'll reposition and
it's not telling me that it's not
scanning right it just doesn't do it
yeah you know it's just it's an iOS
feature like it slowly cuz I can see my
vacations tea instead of that you just
see the time
no it'sit's interested in as much
feature yeah now that I've had another
live use the HTC 10 and I've used the
the 6p and it should eat these the
fingerprint sensor on the s6 edge which
was always like really fast for me now
it's just kind of like it is slower now
I don't know if it's because if it's
slowing down or if it's because other
sensors are just that much faster and
it's like when I started playing with
Huawei's even on like a even on like a
less expensive Huawei like those
fingerprint sensors are just bulletproof
I really like what they're doing with
Hardware on you know all of their phones
the p9 is likely um but this one
actually did take me by surprise on the
sfn where the s7 was a a quick and
snappy performer out of the box for the
first couple weeks that I was using it
and now when I pick it back up to do
like comparisons or when I'm producing
other content and I need the S Evan
that's one thing that really has aged
oddly I can't even say an aged poorly
it's just right odd that it would affect
a hardware component which seems to not
really I mean it's not a direct action
response to the Android operating system
right it's how you turn the screen on
and unlock the device and for whatever
reason that's the one area where my s
evan has started to exhibit some
twitchiness so i can't speak
specifically unfortunately Dvorak has be
specifically to the note 5 having any
particular kind of slow down um Ryan
sane andrea has one he's had one from
pretty early on and as far as I know
he's still absolutely enamored with it
so we are gonna say from some of the
others should get them on the podcast I
might actually be the email i'm sending
out after the show so the but from some
of the other podcasters that i've done
work with and some of the other tech
reviewers I'm friends with like everyone
else who's been kicking on the note 5 is
still going strong as far as a hanging
wall within the normal issues of like
you know I filled this device to the
brim with apps and services and it's
running a ton of stuff in the background
you would expect some slowdown in
situation right so cool looks um there
we go to say I think we're gonna wrap
this show up on time yeah and I'm
actually staying till the end
which almost never happens so yeah Mr
Wong could you would you be so kind as
to play us out so we can wrap this pot I
just had to start over the music but
because I pressed in there button but
there you go so that's how these things
work I love it there it is so there you
