smartphones homescreen that's one of the
things that makes Android so great what
if I told you there is a way you could
put the latest Google doodle on your
homescreen and give you a shortcut right
to your Google now there is let me show
you how this is my Nexus 4 and if you
look at this area of the screen you can
see I've got a nice Google doodle widget
across the top it is resizable I can
move it around I can do whatever I want
with it it even says you can't really
read it very well in the video but it
tells you the name of that doodle down
in the bottom the nice thing about this
it is a widget you can install it from
the Play Store there's a free version
there's a donate version what it does in
addition to just making your screen it
look nice it also launches Google now
right there from the home screen to get
in and make changes to this doodle you
just simply pull down your notification
tap here and now you can change to more
doodles you can see I have not paid for
this version so I have ads running at
the bottom I can pick some other doodle
anything that I want from here let's
choose this one because you know it
looks kind of fun I can set the doodle
as a notification that's up here in the
notification shade or as the widget I
can get more information about that
doodle because there's always a story
behind these doodles and then of course
I can share that with your friends and
you know it just sounds really funny
saying the word doodle let's go ahead
and set that as the widget that I'll go
ahead and do that on the home screen
while I'm still here
we can look at the latest doodle we can
look at worldwide doodles and set
whichever one we want now this has been
hit and miss I've been able to see some
here I've been able to not see some I
don't know if this is something Google
is doing or if there's something that
the app needs to be updated with but
let's say I'm in India because I got a
bunch of friends out there in India
trying to get the doodle and the doodle
failed why that is I don't know exactly
but maybe if you've got some idea you
can let us know down in the comments you
can also come in here and set a few
settings if you want your notification
if you want the theme to be light or
dark we'll change it to light that
changes this theme if it changes the
widget
come back here and take a look and it
looks like that's still the same adding
this is just as simple as adding any
other widget you simply come over here
to it's by a guy named Koji and we'll
just grab this when there are four
different versions one that has a little
information bit down at the bottom one
that doesn't and then stretchable
versions of the two here is the one and
it does not change that that color
scheme but you can see I can stretch it
out and make it a little bit bigger
right there overall kind of neat doesn't
serve a whole lot of purpose but if you
don't have a device that you can simply
you know swipe up to get to your google
now this is a very quick and easy way
for you to get to it
and also get to your settings right from
there I like it it adds a little bit of
whim and whimsy to your Android powered
device why not give it a try it's free
and let us know what you think in the
comments so if you liked what you saw in
this PocketNow video make sure you share
it with your friends on Facebook Twitter
Google+ or any other place that you'd
like and give the video a thumbs up for
PocketNow showing off cool stuff I'm
