this is part one of the video review for
the HP Ipek 110 speaking about hard
it has a 3.5 inch screen which is good I
like big screens it helps you see a lot
more in a smaller space the only thing I
don't like about it is the fact that
it's Q VGA if you'll notice my Harold
right here on the side when you sport
qvg on a small screen you definitely get
better color depth and clarity it's just
too bad this device doesn't bring VGA
but then again for the price range I
guess we can't ask for much the other
thing I didn't like about the screen was
the fact about sensitivity sometimes
it's sensitive sometimes it's not I
learned that in this device you have to
press it real hard for the device to
understand and then again you notice it
here on the toolbar you have the present
heart and like to bring future scratches
which is something that I really didn't
like about the device going into
settings some things that are different
about the iPAQ as you'll notice is that
there aren't any soft keys that's one
thing I didn't like about it but then
again HP thought about it and they
considered bringing you different
options so for example in my case I'm
not really much for the camera an email
button so HP consider the fact that you
could just press and hold them for
certain commands and just press them for
others so I chose for the left and right
buns to be soft keys and then if I press
them hard enough I get different
applications it's really really good
part in HP s for this part in buttons
you know things are pretty much standard
one of the bucks that I did notice about
this device is and sound
you have to listen real clearly because
it doesn't really sound that hard but
when you press any sort of sound like
for example this one you'll notice
there's a little bit of a bug at the
beginning it happens with each of the
sounds it doesn't happen doesn't happen
with mp3 stuff or anything like that but
at the swith the wild files that are
included in the device don't expect much
of a good sound from the speaker
built-in at the back it's really not
good and since it's not lifted or
anything if you put it on your table or
something you just won't hear anything
that's one of the things that I didn't
like about it either going into system
back light is one of the things that I
also like brightness is controlled
automatically by the auto sensor you
notice here which is here at the top but
then again you could also control it
from here there one of the things I
didn't like about this
if he push it all the way down you just
can't see anything as opposed to other
devices when you pull it all the way
down and it leaves a little bit of
lighting my HDC Herald has that which is
something I really do miss on the iPad
audio part it's pretty much the same as
just the auto gain control so don't
expect much of a different feature right
there HP asset view is something
different you now you seen but then it's
almost the same thing as the asset views
from other devices different things that
are available in the device
nothing real big here on the memory site
you will find something good for the eye
pack you have 256 megabytes of ROM out
of which 197 point 53 are available for
your job 64 megabytes of RAM are
available but then again I don't
understand why even if this is in the
phone device why you only have a little
bit of it available it's still not bad
but then again it could be better on the
connection side you'll notice that the
Bluetooth stack is different HP chose to
use their own which is different from
the Microsoft I couldn't say it's better
one of the things I don't like is the
fact that if you turn off the device and
turn it back on it'll turn off Bluetooth
- which is something different you'll
notice that HTC devices don't have you
turn off the device and it remains on
too bad for that part then again let's
try to end this here I pack wire this is
something that's brought in it's nothing
really out of the ordinary it's just the
way to turn on and off Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth which is something you can
also control from the Today screen this
pretty much it for some of the settings
that are different in the HPI pack 110
will keep on reviewing the device and
seeing different things that are
available pertaining software and
everything remember keep us posted on
the forum if there's anything else
you're interested in seeing thank you
very much for parking now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
