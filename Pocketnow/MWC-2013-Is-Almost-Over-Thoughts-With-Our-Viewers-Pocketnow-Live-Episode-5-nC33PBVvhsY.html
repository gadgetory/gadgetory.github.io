everybody this is episode number four I
believe of the Hangout this is a special
number five I getting five fingers is
number five yeah from the front hang up
it's the post mwc 2013 edition up and
I'm going to take this opportunity to
thank everybody on the bucket mouth move
back at home and you guys for watching
for following for all your support it's
been a great show but more on that later
and I guess michael has an announcement
to make uh he does oh that's right I
completely forgot I don't afford this so
we were at we didn't even tell Taylor
this to tell her Tyler doesn't know it's
gone we were at the grocery store around
the corner and his cheek man but we're
in Barcelona for mwc 2013 and Tony asked
if I wanted to pick up some more coke
zero which we've been drinking a bit of
for some reason whatever might you guess
it for my diet which I should also be on
but instead I was like no yeah well
actually the student was like well why
don't we pick up a coke coca-cola light
and I was like well alright but what
does that diet and he's like no it's
cook or later my what looks like it
looks like diet coke and I was like no
tae Kuk sucks I don't want any of that
and I was like this is different and I
think we're gonna witness a historical
moment is going to be a live tasting of
this so what did you Oh what did you
tell me so I said that Coke Zero taste
like I can't say the word yeah and coke
like tastes exactly like regular codes
that Coke light tastes exactly like
regular coca-cola I'm not talking about
code I look up like that sounds like
complete and utter BS to me and this is
my first drummer okolo hey let's see how
it goes live and this is scintillating
stuff
well you know it's not all right it's
not as bad as diet coke i will give you
this fungus better that's enough it
takes him almost exactly like Coke Zero
no come 00 okay enough with the off
topic steer what do you what do you have
for us um I don't know it's been a
whirlwind day so uh no no no are you
back in the states today what oh it's
just been one thing after another it's
not really all work but it's just what a
crazy well does not the world is not
spinning in the u.s. it's only spinning
in Barcelona yeah okay go ahead pick
somebody livestock wait we do want to
know if we do want to mention that the
focus of the night yeah please do
Young's mwc I was thinking about that oh
I kind of wanted to start it off by
asking you guys with your favorite
things you saw there have been I just oh
I think that we can we can tell you at
least one each but for for the entire
image you should check our YouTube
channel tomorrow because we're wrapping
this up we're the with guess what it's
up five not a top three what we're out
of top three whatever a tough sum total
of the top that means should i start
with reduced are you go ahead and start
so i am i am most excited that's right
here i am most excited about the bad
film infinity but of course i'm always
as I started off my video every year I'm
excited about the Phantom whether if
it's the bad for one that that's come to
already infinity but I go home with a
major want and never end up getting that
because it's if it's huge price so it's
at rages but I like the build quality I
like the concept and i think that's
that's for me the most exciting thing
that happened here yes what was actually
exciting to be present for because I've
seen Johnny do a hands-on with a pet
from one phone to and I'm like oh well
we have completed a trilogy yeah exactly
cheers um yeah I bashed that thing
yesterday not now because it's bad i
love the idea but the price is just
awful i read your editorial and i have
to tell you
and we're going to talk about that
action in the pocket now weekly tomorrow
yeah regret if Brandon wants to debate
it bring on your your exciting stuff and
then huh let's talk with the people the
first Sony product I've ever been
excited by in the mobile space oh yeah
that Xperia tablet Z is beautiful you
can't really tell so our connection is a
little wonky reader so Taylor and points
will freeze and it's funny you froze
exactly terror with it but at my
satisfaction face yeah that Xperia
tablet Z I have to say I have never been
as impressed by a sony products basing
that thing was absolutely gorgeous so I
i will i will discuss that more and i
have a feeling i'll read some editorials
on it will get review unit and stuff but
the fact that it packs all that beauty
into that tiny tiny frame and still
manages to pack a 600 million power
battery and waterproof sixth house and a
waterproof rating because it yeah is it
600 did i go back i still manages to put
them to pack a 50 ml and our double a no
no really that's my most exciting thing
Tony's telling me to shut the hell up as
we have no time yeah in a subtle way
failure real quick what's what's your
your most exciting thing of NW c and
then we'll get to you guys um well i
haven't been able to watch a lot of
videos I've been slaving away over
making videos so yeah I think probably
it's not new it wasn't announced to mwc
but the yotaphone is it's just awesome
totally totally we would love the
concept I love the concept of being able
to display everything on the back of the
phone without ever having to worry about
battery draining you know it's just it's
a unique idea and a lot of people are
actually starting to do that now so or
Lucy so before we proceed I have one
common question I've seen popping up on
comments is staler standing during the
Hangout yes I'm standing I'm staying I
have a standing desk and it's awesome I
built it and I stand most the time so
I'm good and and with that please choose
from the below gentlemen I'm not seeing
whether they are ladies too I'm guessing
not yet probably not bring it up um
Damon Damon crop I haven't seen you here
so i'm gonna choose you I may have just
not seen you before but how's it going
hey good Amy yes we grant loudoun baby
yeah I kept in one of these hangouts so
I'm extremely explain it to be here
actually you get to have you here yeah
thank you for joining so I'm gonna keep
this this going this since this is a mwc
kind of wrap up hang out what what have
you seen this really just I guess that
you can't live without or if there's
anything there's nothing then tell us
what the most of a certain thing you've
seen is well the thing that really
clearly will see Xperia tablet Z yes it
looks so great and I heard it's also
waterproof it is mmm yeah that's really
awesome thing it just one after eight
notes all that stuff it's really awesome
and I would really like to get one but
isn't it anything when you build a
product that beautiful you don't expect
it to be terribly durable right you
don't expect to be like to be able to
take it into the shower with you and
like you in that episode of like the
newsroom or whatever let's get get a
rain down yeah no it's totally that uh
on that exact note I would go even
further and I would ask you what is your
main disappointment at mwc I made to
Portland that must be the um what was it
I'm with ya I think it was Ian the note
8.0 oh why is that oh I think I think
the thing is pretty useless it's it's
just a bit too big in global horrible
HEPA have an earpiece so you can
actually make holes with that but but
why would you hold such a big thing up
to a year well I am the best person to
answer to that I just gonna
I'm a huge fan of the concept and I was
completely all the time complaining
about the lack of such product see I'm
currently rocking the note 2 courtesy of
michael and i like to have an in-between
device which which I could use both as a
phone as a tablet the note 2 is not
there yet but a 7 inch or eight incher
is the proper form factor for a tablet
and it also allows me to talk on the
phone while while not holding it in
front of my face or using any Bluetooth
yeah jutt so I think that that's that's
my main reason that's my main point and
the galaxy note 8.0 and the sousaphone
bed what else we had which wich has this
enabled there was comment or tweet
insist on reminding us all the time
there is some galaxy tab unit yes so I'm
excited as per to your question
regarding us it will probably be
unavailable on the US versions there's
nothing confirmed so I'm probably just
just speculating here and I can see that
probably carriers are at full format but
don't take my word for we'll just see
what happens you know I gotta say I
think that having seen some of the other
products here at mwc not that it blew me
away like that but the no date I
understand why it exists but the biggest
disappointment for me in it was its
design language in that it does look
like kind of a blown-up galaxy s3 and
that's yi not the best thing ever its
mother ugly tablet but also totally say
much I mean you do you agree or do you
like the design mmm I'm not a big fan of
either Sonya just yes you said it just
looks like a blown-up s3 mmhmm yeah and
it makes it Tony made a good point
earlier today that it says that maybe
says something about the important
coming design of the galaxy s4 I i hope
i really hope that samsung will just
draw a line and the note 8 will be the
last the gadget to wear the same design
language as the galaxy s3 the galaxy
note 2 to the tab 10.1 the note 8.0 vs
ramany and all the other phones and
tablets from 2013 a 2012 I'm
hoping they'll change it or else people
will get probably sick of that and
that's a bad point for samsung it might
be yeah oh my Ponemah I'm already sick
of that a sign I've just seen it so
often now it's nothing new nothing
special anymore they should really go
something good I hope they'll come up
with something decent with the s4 at
anything like that i had we land at f3
to begin with yeah yeah any time you
throw in fake brush metal I'm not really
on board so anybody out there any
closing thoughts mmm no okay then thank
you very much for joining us and please
do come back next week when hopefully
everything will be back according to the
normal schedule on Fridays right written
in first facebook continues to people
yes and and if you will go ahead and
drop on out so someone else can join in
and talk with us who or else Taylor's
gonna kick you up try not to be rude but
I'll have to kick you out thank you
thank you seriously thank you all right
one of you guys you're choosing next
well before we tie want to say this uh
if Tony's mother has whipped this up and
we're having this this is called zakuska
yeah and it is a spread that you put on
bread and other items from Romania and
it's amazing you should look it up and
make it cuz it's great of course it will
never be this good but you can never be
this kind hi mama in case you're
watching the Olympics of it I will
happily pick someone I will pick the
person there's a person with a young
with a meme like icon there like someone
dead center it's like with some impact
fun yeah but also something guys in
order to keep things transparent and
fair to everybody I'd like to kindly ask
you to switch on your webcam because
everybody's doing it and we need to be
fair to everybody or a better doing it
so if we don't have video okay let me
drop next one right then there's a
person who looks like he has a
lightsaber over is low yeah I've been
hiding that
never done probably i got curtain that's
half of drama yes or maybe he's a
generator or maybe it could be less
who's this person let's please sleazy
over and let us know what um Marcos yes
can area oh well it's it's my window
yeah I have my window in the back so
that I can i yeah alright just make the
noise especially that's coming to you
live Roberto om Barcelona so how you
guys been in Barcelona how well he'll
have been we've been we've been very
busy as you can probably tell by by our
eyes and our faces in the last couple of
videos yeah but wouldn't somebody say in
the comment seems like Michaels faces
they're getting me out of there were
many many many comments okay I probably
couldn't quote all of them because of
you know rating issues but yeah it's
been it's been a tough couple of days
but you know the interesting thing is
that we do this because we love to do it
and this is the pleasant kind of
exhaustion yes well I would like that I
would like to have a job like you guys
because I really like mobile technology
and everything and you guys get to see
everything that before us so that's one
of the things that I like about your job
you know what I'll say to that is that
it's this that's awesome to hear and
remembering that about being a viewer
for so many years is what is what keeps
me from kind of complaining too much
yeah because it's easy to like your feet
start to hurt in your walkin bunch o LG
hours and the food a lot of lies to my
ankles are like this so I'm just be this
one it's actually kind of medically
present it but uh but also like well as
long as you keep in mind the fact that
we get to see all these cool things yeah
you need to do a movie yeah that's
that's pretty cool
thank you for reminding us yeah how was
the show from from your perspective from
from the other side of the camera or
from the other side of the monitor um it
was really good i was expecting more
stuff like you know the nokia tablet
that was rumored aim but the windows the
windows for I mean the windows 8
PureView I was waiting for that too I
like the note paper you know I even
dusted off my 808 PureView and we were
just brainstorming with Michael how to
introduce the video the 808 PureView
versus the 1010 PureView and have one
shots to make about comparisons to make
and then it was electron you know what's
what the disappointment came early for
us because we were waiting in line yeah
like the second people in line to get
into the for which we woke up with like
five a.m. in the morning and we traveled
by by moonlight video of us like walk
into the transition that pitch dark and
the guy that was ahead of us in line and
tends to report a lot of Nokia stuff and
he had the inside kind of school so he
was like yeah man they're not gonna have
it's not gonna happen it was still
slightly mostly judgment good but yeah I
really like the note April no and but
mostly the best thing I thought it was
showed in the in the mobile world
congress was um the spare seat tablet
and Padfone infinity mmm nice double
nice don't know last week we both agree
sorry yeah yeah we did disregarding
price yeah yeah hey I complained about
the price and i received i think an
honest either comment or or or tweet and
if you come to think of it the person
was right one thousand dollars for a
high-end full HD phone plus a full HD
tablet of course it's not a standalone
tablet and but but if you have to think
of it that way it is justifiable there's
also just at all but if I think that the
ipad that the iphone 5 costs one
thousand dollars in my country but we've
been used to like 9999
I 199 again and I i don't know i would
broadly bay 649 8740 999 but 1,000 is
too much yes well the the conversion was
about thirteen hundred dollars also it's
1000 euros boogie a brother you guys
will get it in the states you get a
little yeah it's gonna be around the
1100 1 1100 domar it won't ever launcher
it won't ever launched in the states now
salad and I got the carrier of course
right not probably not even
international the only way you'd be able
to get is through like negri or someone
like that yeah yeah but then the steel
bolt probably on the upper end of eight
or nine hundred hours the next the next
full-size trade show we attend won't be
until August probably unless we do ctia
so I want to ask Marco is it my init is
mark of yet Marco's with ms sorry Marcos
that's all right sir I want to ask
Marco's since the next big event will
attend will probably be march 14th yes
the visual well are you are you excited
for that or are you waiting for
something else that's more exciting to
you um I'm actually going to get the HTC
one more even knowing what Samsung is
preparing yes I'm a I'm a die-hard HTC
fun iphone like like I said on the last
time that I was here I oh I own the
original evil the evo 3d HTC evo 4g LTE
and i'm getting the HTC one regardless
of what Samsung has three were a shift
why didn't you get the shift Oh theater
going on me I didn't put our consider it
to be like you know I really don't like
the key though physical keyboard that
much okay a lot of passes time marcos
any closing thoughts um I was yeah I was
hoping a lot more from the show and I
was really disappointed about nokia and
all that
they have really cool stuff to show up
you know the xperia c tablet the path
phone but what what I find ridiculous is
this phone fat they have the 7-inch
something the phone oh okay I mean this
is getting out of control I mean hello
to the notes who is like the perfect
size for size broad public not to go i
will disagree the note 2 is the
perfect-sized large smartphone but the
78 inch form factor is about the perfect
sized tablet so they are bringing the
head the earpiece to the perfect size
tablet and this is I think the niche
product I think it isn't he protector
Jose I hear that your face was never
never entered but but they're free for
people the dialer on the phone it looks
redic it looks like yes but when you're
not rocking when you're rocking a thump
at you no longer have to have your phone
you on the bus if you carry a jacket
with a pocket like this way no I can fit
that in my jacket and I can do the demo
right more in my internal what I do the
best no because I know but there is the
problem I carry an ipad mini now instead
of two phones so i used to carry two
phones every day and now i carry in an
ipad mini and a nexus fork but i can't
put this in any of my pockets on
anything it doesn't fit in my coat
pocket my pants pocket nothing so I have
to just carry it in my hand all the time
like this right here it is why that's
wider that's a lot wider the Nexus 7 is
a different story I get that thing in my
back pocket um so an 8-inch tablet that
ah I don't know but I'm yet but holding
it to your head that's the that's what
really kids me it's it's almost as
ridiculous looking at someone holding up
a tablet to take a picture or something
right
it's ridiculous yeah I'm people people
already make fun of me saying that I
have a TV as a phone so do you have no
triple I de waxed yeah the note to you
know I had two phones your age Oh your
captain to founders we got we got a few
other to go we have to keep moving on
down to me to be fair with everybody so
Marcos thank you very much for joining
us we're waiting for you next week on
Friday all right then I hope to see you
guys again too okay here uh I will pick
a him him okay because the guy with the
cap in my yellow t-shirt I'm sorry I'm
standing three feet / um meters away I
don't know names I can see like this
tall tiny avatars I'm gonna slaughter
this name um Walid why what I don't even
know while he Camille we can hear you
you have to unleash your self there is
an icon on the top right corner which
top right it's read it should be great
ok hi hey that is how bad that slaughter
your name uh Wally I got it ok yes I
query from Owen my chili I'm from Yemen
but i'm living in Malaysia and I'm a
very big fan of you guys and so excuse
me if I have any English mistakes you
sound as good as I do I have mistakes to
you all the time like Michaels being a
constantly checking my grammar and
spelling so how are you feeling about
mwc what is your top device if you were
to buy something which was only
announced at mwc with what would you buy
well i guess i will because I'm a very
big fan of nokia so i guess i will go
for the nokia lumia 720
and and why not the lower end model
which is cheaper I mean it's because of
Windows Phone 8 it's as fluid as the 720
um actually I'm here I'm using the nokia
920 uh-huh yes all the way when I that
when you're lucky you can get that in
your country i cannot get that in mind
no I mean actually I'm not living in
Yemen I'm leaving in Malaysia yeah but
you can get there eating in here yeah it
says it's not that really expensive
actually oh then you need to send me a
tweet and I will probably ask you to
send me what I should sure why not go on
go ahead i'm using blackberry as well oh
really don't tell me you're using the
the z okay good good what um the bold or
the curve that this is a the bold the
morning yeah 998 997 909 9700 nice and
it would slow music also at night let me
ask you a question but what is your um
what is the best thing about you free to
be carrying two phones like why do you
do it use the blackberry for some things
on the Windows Phone for something else
I mean actually blackberry here it's
like a must you know it is like we have
to get another phone and at the same
time you have to get blackberry because
Asian people they love blackberry so
much so is it because of the of the fact
that many other people use it or are you
actually having friends with whom you
can BBM actually because of the BBM okay
i chose with that and what why not I
don't know facebook chat or skype chat
or viber or or any other chat
application which which I mean bbms is
ok for being among library using
whatsapp is there for you so why not
that well I even I asked myself that the
first time I came here but I don't know
what is that I mean the specialist um
the special thing about that like very
bad people they love it so much here I
mean I guess because of the year the BB
and so that isn't good oh my god are you
wearing a fc barcelona cap yes he had to
know the final score of the match this
evening because when I walked in the
hotel it was 104 we are what would i
watch the the first half and then I'm
gonna get ready to go ah no I don't want
this guy i mean i don't want to take it
off I mean I'm a very big fan of
Barcelona but actually guys I wanted to
join you rather than watching the match
thank you very much for an idea that we
are honored i guess uh i think nah I
don't know just kidding I had scores you
got this course for me yeah I'll had
scores pulled up on google mouth so you
can see that i don't know if you can you
two to one um 30 regional real madrid
okay then kick me out of it oh yeah
suppose desk I remember also a certain
time with sire okay good the blackberry
they're carrying a blackberry this will
be my last question on the subject so
it's kind of a necessity and will you
you find yourself do you think it is
likely that you will upgrade to the
blackberry z10 or when when your time
with that blackberry is up do you think
that you and/or your friends will change
to a different platform entirely Luke
which well actually and i don't think i
will go for a blackberry after this
because i guess one black but it's just
enough and i don't really feel
comfortable with the new software ah
interesting I don't happy I don't find
it it's a very strong platform you know
I tell you what I think in my opinion
sure sure have you have you used it in a
retail store yet or is it just the video
that you see anything um I just like I
saw it in the videos and then I just
like boy buy it
so I failed to impress you and you might
you might choose to jump ship when your
time of the blackberry's over that's
good I like to get them the powers of a
cable who use a blackberry today because
you know it's you guys who I think
library is targeting with the z10 and
without without you so do I really are
in trouble Yeah right and guys I kind of
have a question here go on please go on
about the windows phone 8 um what what
do you think is going to make it like
different in the future I mean what I
can see that windows 7 and windows 8
it's like the same what we call it like
the same interface yeah it's like
nothing special about it you know even I
think windows 9 will be the same okay in
which particular order you want us to
answer like are they going to edit it
more in the future or it will be like
that for like the end of the luck good
who should answer first hmm who should
answer first anyone okay go I will say
that if that Microsoft will probably try
to learn a lesson from apple and if they
hold on to the look and feel of Windows
Phone as it is so tightly for so many
years Apple has been getting criticized
for this for a long time and I think
Microsoft if they learn from that
experience they will not they will they
will do some changes I don't think I
don't have a whole lot of confidence
that they will learn so I think windows
phone will look very much the same for a
little while okay then my two cents are
that the Microsoft is very fond of the X
Metro UI they've been working so hard to
become something different an
alternative and user experience with all
the tiles and the hubs and the toasts
and they've invested not only money but
time and effort and becoming different
so they're not going to ditch that
they've adopted that wood windows 8 with
rt so I think that the line as far as
user experience and user interfaces
concern is going to be the same what
will make it different probably but in
I won't say anything with Chad will
regret that ok that's just
hypothetically speaking um they will
slowly start to gain market share and as
soon as they get a solid brand
recognition that's gonna be like a
launching pad for them platform yeah
that was a much better answer than mine
either let's seal it up I don't know if
I can um I have not really been a fan of
Windows Phone and I don't like the way
it looks I don't like to met you I and I
hope that Microsoft can change it make
it a little more interesting in my
problem was initially that it was boring
it wasn't fun to use and it's still not
very fun to use and that was kind of
their goal is they didn't want to make
it fun to use they wanted to make it
different in that it didn't people
weren't tied to their phones they were
saving us from ourselves and the fact
that they started with that mentality
and I think I think now that they're
kind of back tracking just a little bit
too got it kind of get more interest in
it I think they've might but I'm not
really holding my breath if anything I
think they should at least add some
customization to it a little more than
being able to rearrange tiles resize
them maybe a full color palette I don't
understand why that's such a hard thing
to do custom colors rather than a preset
20 some colors and I don't know maybe
multiple pages but not in you know your
your left to right scrolling pages but
maybe tabs or something better way to
organize your home screen there are ways
that they could do this but I'm really
not confident that they will I'm glad
with Android eyes windows though yeah no
not necessarily that but I don't like
the idea of having you know just
everything on this one long scrollable
there's nothing main feature I mean you
don't have to hop back and forth you
just scrolling you have everything there
at the glance like switching and thrown
and gun flipping and I say that I say I
don't like that and then here on my
Nexus 7 I have what is called action
launcher i did a video on it and if I
scroll here I've got a list here we go
okay here we go
I say that but they're just adaptations
that can be made that that I think would
make it a lot better just a little more
interesting to use because right now
it's not very compelling it's just kind
of it's there the live tiles I know some
of you really love live tiles I never
really found them that useful and I
think lastly I think one thing they
really need to focus on is notifications
because more than anything that was my
biggest issue with the whole entire
platform is that once the notification
comes there's really no way to tell
unless you look at all your lap tiles to
see what's that's that thing where it's
like yeah if that doesn't come some time
in twenty twelve i'm basically like i
would bet anyone any amount of money
that by hurting yeah yeah that's my man
yeah yeah okay so there are your three
answers actually if you don't mind I
have a little bit of input Oh welcoming
guys yea sorry I'm photobombing I was
just outside shoveling six inches of
snow and now I'm here job to our
listeners to whom we are not talking to
please mute your microphone till until
we do talk to you welcome Adam doubt our
newest member of the team who joined the
team together with Taylor he is
contributing editor welcome Adam hi
there so I just I wanted to chime in on
the question since it's actually right
up my alley with the article that I'm
writing this way so why I'm here I can I
can I can I I can throw in some to
sickness but i have a huge dilemma
should I treat you like a listener
rieger or should I feed you like a
colleague what state your intentions I
intend to answer the question sir good
if I may know what yeah so this are the
this week actually tomorrow I will be
publishing an article that's all about
the mysterious windows blue and which is
depending on what theory you believe is
the adoption of the quicker iterate
iterative update cycle of windows rather
than two to four years between updates
now they're looking at an update cycle
of more 12 to 18 months very similar to
what OS X has been doing for the last
teen years so now it's my theory I'm
hoping that eventually these iterative
updates will bring all their platforms
together in a more unified ecosystem
right now they all just kind of look the
same but they don't really act the same
so my my hope is that one day they will
be able to say here's what it is on a PC
here's what it is on a phone here's what
it is on tablet and it's all the same
nobody else does that right now so
that's my theory that's true but but
will it all look as it as it currently
does will it all maintain the current
modern UI because I guess so I think if
they will continue to alienate a large
number of people and people like me
who's who say Taylor I don't care that
my live tiles aren't terribly useful I
like them because they're pretty right
you will continue to make us what okay
to the platform but I think the vast
majority of people might continue to be
turned off by it so I I hope that they
do introduce more customizations in
response to you Adam um there is a phone
that is coming from I'm eight I don't
know if you saw that will be running
Windows 8 that Windows Phone 8 but
Windows 8 well as an what processor yeah
then I got that too yeah I was supposed
to write an editorial about it today but
I didn't get to what was it announced is
it here in Barcelona I don't know hold
on I can drop you the link find out a
dress that's gonna be useless to just
drop an email does anymore we missed
that were pissed okay while you did that
I'd like to ask you whether since we are
at a special edition and since we don't
like five minutes late and we're lot
we've been joined by a lot of people can
we go over the one hour limit like I
don't know 115 120 130 I've got
somewhere to be shortly but yes I'm good
so what does everybody else is good I'm
good yeah let's let's do a one hour 30
minutes the special edition okay fine by
me um I'm gonna choose Nathaniel Smith
he looked a little bored he's got his
hand up he looks a little Smith he looks
a little Smith looks a little bored yeah
hello everyone was it go on at good
yeah okay um I'm gonna continue with the
theme what is the most disappointing
thing from Mobile World Congress this
year for you yeah I love it I'm more
disappointed with everything all the
time and I'll probably say the night
note 8.0 in their doubt a new note nice
i think we even like to to to hate it to
love it so Oh Brad I believe your best
argument what's the most disappointing
thing about the name pointer well I just
think it's just like you know that it's
sort of too big to be a phone and you
know like where would you carry it
around with you if you were to take as a
daily driver where were you can hear it
everywhere you go you're gonna get two
different answers and it's gonna do
something before yeah Tony would put it
in this in his pocket so don't know
don't think of it as a phone it's not a
phone it's a tablet with phone
functionality and all tablets on the
market have phone functionality the only
difference is that you'll have to use
probably the speakerphone or a bluetooth
headset that's an another accessory with
the note 8 window or the fonepad you
just bring it up to your ear if you want
to but you can use all the other options
so I'm just looking at it as a
convenience feature which is there if
you need it and I need it so I'm having
internet would you carry a phone as well
no no that's gonna be my only yeah
that's gonna be my only device because
I'm so in the just one less Ellen rabba
I only carry a phone and the tablet at
the same time because I'm more
productive on the tablet and then I'm
talking on the phone so then why bring
the phone when I can talk on the same
device on which I'm more productive I
want I do want to get back to you too is
gonna be allowed to bake tomorrow
I've been covering ensure with chimney
for you know all week and about whatever
lies once or twice a day Tony who's
using the galaxy note to a manageable
size compared to this note 8 it's like I
can use this one-handed I hate this how
are you gonna get to note any one hand
the same way I can't use this back to
you yeah yeah but I'm just wondering
where would you actually carry if it was
to be your daily driver in my jacket
pocket in my jeans pocket I mean
anywhere in my car in my other front
seat yeah there's enough yeah absolutely
yeah it'll get banned i right okay well
we did a size comparison right we had on
the video we have the ipad mini again
now I'm don't remember it very well
because we've seen too many devices
isn't the note 8 significantly bigger
than this nexus 7 a little bit bigger
but not extremely huge and it's it's an
eight-point Oh device the next is a
seven point 0 device I can compare Nexus
7 and ipad mini yeah anyone or Rob that
person then we know yeah all right I
have lecture 7 but I thought you'd bring
out without eight I have no date here I
agree you know you know I couldn't carry
the note is driving but here but Tony I
think your point is like it's a feature
why not why not have it right absolutely
if you can have it let's have it I've
made that argument management young when
defending like other manufacturers voice
control vs I'm like yeah it sucks but
it's there so why not use it yet in the
same respect i would love that i would
love to be able to answer calls on my
ipad mini and text using my actual
number not just by message and voice I
was like to be able to be able to
actually place a call using the number
that's tied to that using my pet but not
hold it up to my head that's the big is
better with it dinner that is an option
so you can either hold it to your head
either use a speakerphone or either use
a bluetooth headset you don't have to
hold it like that who likes choice why
do we want choice
but I will gladly hold it to my head I
mean I have no I mean I have big hands I
mean yeah I wanna hang out really here
let me snap a picture too while I'm at
it thank you for for resurrecting a
debate that will never end at least you
got a lot of laughs out of it any any
closing thoughts there what was your
favorite device what what has been each
of your favorite devices that you've
seen so far well we can't answer that
earlier you probably haven't been online
we're gonna do a wrap-up no problem
we're going to wrap up tomorrow so we're
not going to give away everything my
favorite is the Padfone infinity and
minus the Xperia tablet Z and you will
yeah we will do the record here where we
wants to do a pocket on weekly tomorrow
if you are a podcast listener see I am
like to stop yes good good thank you
look at you fit on the bucket i guess
the redheaded stepchild in the
now empire um I said yotaphone was my
favorite but it wasn't technically
announced at Mobile World Congress those
40 so I'll go ahead and say that um the
Padfone infinity it's nice it's just the
price I like the concept of it exactly
need us so like would you use it up like
a month or so here's my thing I think
and I've said this for at least an early
since I started doing this so three
years maybe a little longer that I've
said that a foam eventually will power
everything so you hold up a phone you
you dock it into your computer and the
touch screen is the trackpad your docket
in a tablet it powers that you dock it
here it powers this you know and I feel
that that that might eventually happen
probably not but it might and that's
something I've always wanted so when
they announced the PadFone I'm like whoa
this is something I've been saying for a
long time and
I hear it as a step closer I mr. just
mr. complete your your which I agree
with you completely about the only OS
which allows you to do that as Android
because once you doc the phone inside of
tablet it switches to the tablet layout
them to great way to take advantage of
that of course a boom to what is not
showy when it's not doing you
screenshots of calculators and note
making application alright so we talked
about this earlier today to about the
PadFone and like tony was like it does
it not excite you the PadFone and I'm
like it would have excited me like 10
years ago and this is why because like I
think 10 or 10 or 15 years ago my
concept of cost and technology of us
Taylor was your here's this here's the
small device I'm going to plug it into
this big device and it's going to become
a bigger one but I'm gonna take it
number cleared in putting a smaller on
whatever ya know but I think as our
understanding of technology has grown
and as our technology is wrong we could
come move this cloud based model where
it kind of no longer matters what device
or it should no longer matter what
device you're carrying whether it's your
smartphone your tiny phone your your
phablet or your tablet or your desktop
you should be able to access all of it
via cloud-based solution instead of
manually taking this piece of hardware
plugging it into this other piece of
hardware like a VCR I think as sous is
kind of like 10 years 10 years ago in
there drinking are you saying I'm
primitive I think primitive yeah yeah I
think you're hidden I'm not gonna stop
you right there guys thank you very much
for joining us you come back next week
yeah I'm gonna say you put you guys
doing this bright and keep up I've
really enjoyed this thank you a pleco

say that with a smile on my face but
Michaels next he is indeed unless we're

like you didn't thank you it's been an
awesome two weeks so far oh good what
plus weeks longer than a half i'm almost
32 priceless I feel like it's because
the seduction lasted so much longer yeah
I mean we were emailing for like a month

come on they were excited at first and
then actually join the team they're like
oh yeah Taylor whatever yeah 40 times
more often than I currently do before

I should give you guys less busy yes you
should now um anyway Benjamin this is my
first time Bobby welcome welcome aboard
how's it going good I apologize for the
screaming child then back around there's
nothing to apologize about this is as
scheduled as it gets oh don't worry
about it I'm drinking tea from a Stein
so I am drinking coffee at own mostly
local and what angry and what were you
doing Michael were you eating like a
cracker dipped in peanut butter what
were you doing there oh you came on
after the sicu scott was discussed this
is oh I'm sorry I missed that not all
right this is what's made by Tony's
mother this is called zakuska chuckles
cut the Cuzco correctly from the nausea
household lodge this letter yes and it's
a wonderful spread I won't bore you with
the ingredients but Tony's mother made
it and it is incredible I rather
recommend yeah it sounds fantastic you
just keep every time I see you you're
looking back and your non more taking
another one been in andover take it more
and it looks fantastic but it will you
guys talked about your greatest you know
things that you enjoyed what were your
biggest disappointments nope you guys
already in which particular order you
want us a nicer oh I guess it doesn't
really matter whoever whoever knows i
guess for sure while the other people
can think about it well it definitely
know for sure but let's let's let's go
over to tater he probably also knows for
sure yes I'm PureView there wasn't
enough PureView and that's what's really
don't know that's everybody I think yeah
yeah I want I want I want a true Windows
Phone PureView camera um so and I don't
have that I can also add to that I i can
add two more things I wasn't expecting
HTC and Samsung to have nothing on
display I mean I know there was the HTC
One event and I accepted that but I
expected HTC to have at least a
mid-range android or and Windows Phone
and I expected Samsung to have
aside from the note 8.0 something i
don't know the s3 mini to the ace free
the g o5 wanted ever just something
different but that didn't happen so
that's my number to disappointment yeah
and there's nothing that that eclipse is
the disappointment i felt in them the
lack of a nokia of a high-end uh well
for lack of a better word a true
PureView Windows Phone device um because
i didn't expect as much from mwc i feel
because you know the trend toward
individual manufacturer conferences is
unavoidable it's right in front of our
faces at CES said we had to stretch a
little bit more than we had to hear
there was a little more here to see
there was some cool stuff here but not
near as much as that has been a previous
year yeah yeah you know if you come into
it with with that realization there's
it's more difficult to be disappointed
unless you go to an okay event at little
dark outside and you really want them to
come with the hotness and they don't
yeah that's kind of what it seemed like
it seemed like with the you know the
previous dreams in the previous data
that was coming out there seemed like
there was a lot more interesting stuff
like like like you know feed after feet
after feeders like holy crap look at
this look at that look at that it seemed
like there was that stuff started at the
beginning and then it really started to
like level out and it kind of went
downhill a little bit unfortunately i
knows what kind of was released I I mean
I'm that may just be my opinion but what
do you guys think i have a tricky
question for Michael if you knew that
there will be known that yeah whatever a
period with this phone would you have
woken up at five a.m. in the morning to
go to the room yeah um me honest any
cheap I would have but I would have been
a whole lot more reluctant to get out of
bed and we might not have done this the
truth is you know you can if you look at
the pattern of the case of which nokia
has been releasing stuff maybe it was a
little unrealistic for me to be so
excited that maybe we were going to see
this now because it the 920 still has
life in it that would have been
instantly crushed the minute to release
any information about this and we might
have gotten lucky has policy wrong I
mean
the highest-end Lumia phone is the 920
which was announced as a u.s. device so
rakia is pushing the 920 is pushing the
Lumia brand on the US market so
announcing you in a European event even
if it's nwc wouldn't make sense so if
there would be an upgrade I would firmly
expect it to be unveiled in the US can I
talk about that person concept that
that's an interesting thought that makes
sense the distribution model for the 920
we heard this is not press release
material ok we heard this in line from
someone who's familiar with ugh the
matter I'd yeah the most rewarding that
well good yes everyone sign up the thing
was that we heard that that the Lumia
920 was part of a package deal that when
AT&amp;amp;T agreed to be the exclusive provider
for the Lumia 900 they also signed on to
the 920 with Nokia already knew they
were going to build and when the 920
failed to feel to move in as many
numbers as the oh if they thought you
know it was a disappointment but it was
sort of it was sort of expected after
the 900 also kind of failed to me on
those numbers and so all of our kind of
anger at nokia and microsoft for what we
thought was them choosing a one
exclusive carrier in the states again
with the 920 may have been entirely
unfounded it may have been a seguir old
agreement yeah so we really it served as
an illustration to me that we really for
as much as the rumors as we get and for
all that kind of information we give we
don't always know what's going on and
sometimes rumors are all wrong and
they're so high 5s Benjamin any closing
thoughts I just wanted to I mean real
quickly if you guys could go over one
thing that you're really excited about
that's already been released earlier
that's going to be released here soon
personally for me google glass when that
drops I'm going to be first in order i'm
getting it i don't care honestly google
take my money honestly when it comes
down to that is there something that you
guys that's coming out either you know
phone tablet
technology related that you're looking
forward to just real quick that is a
good read f3 on the top of my head cuz
I've got them all last year won an ipad
1 an iphone booya pebble and leap motion
i tweeted about her yeah tweeted about
it earlier today here you want a pebble
I got one oh come on come on Wisty i
just got a craigslist reply for
something i was selling Oh on your
pebble on what Apple yeah we see if i
can get ya don't mind us just go on
listing is yeah mine's been sitting on
my stoop in boston for like what a week
my yeast yeah III paid on ebay a little
bit of a premium because I was not a
Kickstarter but it wasn't as much as
some of the other ones that come out but
anyway certainly much change the subject
down here in put Taylor on the line for
a long long time it's it's pretty
awesome it's totally changed the way I
use my cell phone it's more of like a
gateway device instead of like you know
like a notification where you pull it
out okay who do I got it's just a all
right I'm gonna see if I could reply to
them and if not I'll just it's like I'll
just disregard it and and all and I'll
pull it up later so it's been amazing
it's totally the future I see it totally
be in the future that's a personal area
in it I am personally looking forward
for the galaxy s4 not because of the
phone itself but because I am expecting
samsung to unveil it so that i can make
a decision between the one and the s4 so
does that be a good comparison you're
not interested in the LG optimus g pro
now the optimus g pro is the at the
moment the perfect replacement and my
look for dino too I'm never using yet
bad Michael's face yeah things anything
I'm like what is he talking I was a huge
fan boy so that's that's is this is mine
so yeah um I will say for me that the
the things that Taylor mentioned before
is what I'm most
forward to right now Taylor's gone yeah
it's over finish left the room when we
started throw my headphones walk away Oh
yotaphone has taken as taken center seat
for me this week at least next week off
some different but the specifications
that's that's the one thing is what is
the specs well I think you don't you
know me well enough by now I don't give
a damn about the specs with Dean I know
you don't yeah so here's the thing the
fact that it happens to be a device that
is not yet another iterative Android
upgrade like I expect the galaxy s4 to
me if the galaxy s4 launches with the
same design language as the 3 i'm just
kind of like i'm going to pull a tailor
i'm just going to disappear in the
middle of our life good Adam you're
still with us I don't know yes I am sir
leave you answer oh uh technology coming
up this year I speak now oh thank you i
appreciate Thea oh yeah I didn't mean to
I didn't mean to leave you out no no
it's not you it's mike antonio anyway
it's true no actually it is you once you
want you tell us in which position you
are in right now as a guest or as a
editor will will be able to treat you
accordingly i am as an editor I thought
I made that clear my oh me please do
answer the question okay Oh what am I
looking forward to how about a webos TV
by LG know those there what webos
toaster yeah well I've already had one
of those so the guard wirelessly yeah
yeah that's it that's exactly it uh no
i'm probably i'm probably looking
forward to the s4 i'm a big s3 fan and I
you know I would probably switch back to
it yeah I know
I would probably switch back to the
fight if I hadn't gotten the 7.8 update
on my lumia 900 I would be using the s3
right now so that's what it boils down
to the other day my wife said was
looking to go you know get a new phone
she said why don't I just use your
samsung since you're not using and I
said now let's go to ATT because I want
so I'm looking forward to the s4 I want
to see what they're gonna bring at the
table beyond that I've I don't know
google glass whatever pebble whatever
i'm just i'm so mad about the the toys i
just i got in a big argument on twitter
a couple days ago about google glass and
just why I just don't I don't see it I
don't get it the price points that I've
heard of like sub $1,500 okay it's gonna
have to be like sub three hundred
dollars if it's even get my radar so I
don't know I just I'm so mad about the
whole thing so so funny because I want
to engage like I want to engage with you
Adam you know five of the things you
brought up and exactly happened how much
do you disagree but yeah you know what's
funny I want to do it on the hang up but
I know we don't have the time yeah and
and it's look so lovely by the way Adam
to see your face because I've never ever
talked to you outside of Twitter before
so thank you yeah unfortunately it's my
face that you're seeing so anyway we're
gonna move on ribbon thank you very much
for joining us and please do come back
whatever you can yeah I will you guys
all take care keep doing what you're
doing keep us all informed because you
uh you know you keep my Twitter feed
around them for sure so keep it up you
very much for that thanks for you guys
oh ok yeah to see you Taylor see Adam
yep see ya who's next yeah well first
time we got left we have environment we
had like 25 minutes okays great okay so
i gotta pick this person here oh i can't
see you here portland uh it's me kyle
from friends ah can you hear me guys yes
yeah yeah right just the two two quick
things because before engaging about mwc
thirsting first thing I have to disagree
completely with you and coca-cola light
tastes nothing like coca-cola I'm not
saying it's bad but it tastes nothing
like coca-cola so I wanted to point it
out and I'm European so I know I know
yeah yeah but I wanted to say something
about my collection because i went to
the United litem last last summer and
and tasted their coca-cola and it's
really different from from ours so just
about that interesting we should have a
whole hangar about this thing anyway
song angles the the second quick thing I
wanted to 22 Taylor is a I hope higher
to bring his girlfriend because we're
going to need wait wait wait will you
don't like it weekly sausage yeah
exactly anyway can't see how to hear is
here yeah yeah he's here for break up
break Devin along and then we'll switch
to you by popular request so about them
mwc I wanted to make you you all happy
because when you when you mentioned your
favorite devices I was like agreeing
with all of you because the is it the
PadFone of the phone pad I'm just on my
way they're confusing the headphone is
the one with the phone fits in the
tablet yeah doc zone pad is very yeah
that would be a big Tibet so the PadFone
the the Xperia Z tablet and also the
Euro phone even though it's not really a
mem debussy exclusive there are all you
know very innovative products even
though the bat phone is not a new
concept it's still the only product like
this in the market so it's pretty good
to see that they're hanging on this one
and stop you right there because i have
a question like on your topic
okay the grad has been around for this
is the third iteration yes 30 iteration
two years yeah okay yeah yeah why do you
think it hasn't picked up I mean I agree
with you it's a perfect perfect idea but
it still hasn't big I mean I haven't
seen a bad film one two or three in in
real life ever I haven't of you
everybody only one except for our
follower Denmark have you ever seen a
padfone ad ever no no so the idea is so
good what's wrong with the bad film that
people don't buy it aside or probably
that's the reason for the price I
thought is it's right like I think I
think the product is maybe you know two
different people don't we don't really
know what to do with it because we are
only getting you know tablets since
maybe two years inside of every homes
now a lot of families there are not tech
savvy but they have an iPad they have an
Android tablet because less Christmas
you you had to buy one so I think for
many people the fact of owning a tablet
is something new and this product is is
in the in the same you know lead but
excuse me isn't the same me but it's
still different so and the price tag off
obviously sets it apart from the anybody
back to open it II well actually I think
as you mentioned earlier the price if
you consider everything is kind of right
for the product is I mean it's easy is
it right why so much yeah it is too much
because because of all you can find in
market but considering all what you buy
I mean I would actually consider it to
to buy it at this point at this price
but i don't think i will ever see it in
the shop actually I never seen any any
pet phone in a in a in a shop Anna and I
kind of visit a shopper I wanna once the
time sir
yeah I've to me it's it's kind of like a
ghost product you see that in at
conventions but you never see it in real
life like it's only a prototype and it's
never sold but I would be curious to see
the numbers of that of your message oh
yeah I like that too yeah yeah there's
actually another product like it it was
launched in a kddi i think it was uh I
can't remember was something like spider
or something was a it was a phone that
would work fit in a tablet it would run
a little netbook you like I said earlier
um the screen was actually the trackpad
on a little netbook okay and it was a
had a game in controller I mean it was
mhmmm that idea to the max in there so
she kinda had that I saw with them you
know with Motorola what is the atrix
yeah the atrix that's it it was kind of
same idea hbu dock it and you have a
laptop but yeah but the bat phone is
more another day yeah in Nevada and and
and this phone specs are really beefy
it's like it's a droid DNA actually it's
a 5-inch full-hd qualicum 600 so really
it's a really good good device but yeah
the price points probably a hip problem
is not a problem with the price a sous
basically set the standard for bringing
down the price of tablets um because
they were the first ones to hit the 400
mark what the the e the eee pad
transformer it was four hundred dollars
for the I guess 16 gigabyte model and
500 for 32 and then you add a keyboard
dock and you get a tablet with a
keyboard dock cheaper than the cheapest
ipad or even motorola or Samsung tablets
at the time were six seven eight hundred
dollars some of them were nine hundred
dollars on that exact know Taylor I
would like to ask you for a zit fine
unbiased observer and the pseudo analyst
not in the wrong way how much do you
think how much do you think out of those
1000 euros is for the phone and how much
is for the tablet considering that the
tablet is just a huge battery
this late and some speakers right I I
mentioned this in the article I wrote
yesterday and I got bashed for it I got
people were just like you're crazy why
are you making this comparison and I
can't really say in Euros because I
don't know how much a phone costs in
Euros oh there's no way dollars go with
ya the conversion was for thirteen
hundred dollars a thousand euros about a
thirteen hundred dollars so i was
thirteen twenty nine and i would imagine
about seven maybe eight hundred of that
is for a phone so you have what five six
hundred dollars left over no living I
mean why why why would it be so costly
so expensive a plastic thing which it
has a 1080p display and nothing else
except the battery and some speakers
yeah five hundred dollars for a display
battery speakers and maybe a few ports
USB port and something I mean it's a
little bit when union when they make
this device right here a full fledge
tablet for two hundred dollars or 250 or
300 with connectivity we processor
memory motherboard and everything
everything it doesn't even make sense so
I said I made the comparison that you
could get a nexus 4 to Nexus 7's I was a
it was a 32 gig now 32 gig 16 gig nexus
4 2 32 gig Nexus 7 and a 16 gig nexus 10
for the same price right what of the
PadFone how can you not see this as
absurd yeah yeah well that's what I was
saying if people were saying that the
comparison was off base but whatever
well because it's because there is a
very specific use case for the issues
padfone and that very specific use case
will appeal to approximately 1400 the
market yes for the people who comment on
your yeah I mean I know a different
prices I'm so tired of talking about the
platform do we never talk ya know we
will let the damn problem in the future
wrap it up Taylor because yeah I lindell
miss if it were seven hundred dollars
for the phone and even 150 for the dock
which was that's the price that a sous
charges for the the keyboard dock and
for
the last platform before they were
paired it was 150 for that for the
tablet dock and a hundred and fifty for
the keyboard if i'm not mistaken if they
stuck to that foreigner model 150 for
the it would not work and and 700 or
even eight hundred for the tablet I
don't see why that wouldn't work but
thirteen hundred dollars no I get a
Chromebook pixel over that and I don't
even want to buy a Chromebook pixel
because it's so expensive done with that
because thank you very much for joining
us yeah can I have a just a few few less
thing to say Greece but very quickly the
American you have time for just two more
calls and we're already it's about it's
about that you really have to pick
Domenico and Hayatou because there have
been since the beginning as long as I am
so they're being really waiting for a
long time now so yeah I know what and so
are others I'm always the dilemma I I
want to talk with everybody some of you
guys are keeping coming back which for
which I thank you and some of the new
guys we need to talk with everybody and
I wish we could so difficult yeah we
need to come up with a policy on this
yeah anyway thanks for having me thank
you all right here I guess it's my turn
or Adam you're not gonna choose someone
yeah Adam I'm some item I'm sorry yeah
yeah but you go getta good about you hey
I'm just a photo bomber don't even worry
about me all right I'm gonna go with all
the way to the right side we have zodiac
Fang that somebody that is an awesome
name is an awesome name let's hear how
it sounds from his words from his mouth
mouth um are you muted I hear you oh
yeah there is we're over here Allah hi
there how are you today how do you
promise your first name of my name's
James James what what is it ok everybody
else XO new york oh right I'm not crazy
here right
damn I am I using name is over okay all
right this is your craziest killing of
James ever oh all right James what do
you want to talk about oh well I'm
actually tonight I've just started my
Nexus far excellent I've Google
themselves and I want to ask you all
this question because I think there's
kind of an important thing most of the
mobile retailers when when you go into
them if I go into the nexus 5 go and ask
for the nexus 4 it's about 5 or 500
pounds for one whereas if you buy
directly from Google themselves is in
this country because I'm in the UK is
about to I've just bought the eight gig
one and that was too far T so I'm
wanting to know do from that's fair that
google is selling it directly at a cheap
price than any of the phone retail is
asking for when they're asking about 400
pounds for it you can see the same thing
here in the US I'm t-mobile cells at
four or five hundred dollars and it's
250 through google play I think the
reason is google sells it add cost or
right around cost but they Bank on
getting the money back through google
play purchases so not to mention
eyeballs on ads as a result of those
purchases and all that kind of stuff yep
but I mean it can be frustrating I
definitely get that completely but ID as
if it didn't prevent you from buying one
clearly but you got it from from google
is that right Jane yeah just I just
bought it from google tonight hey yeah I
was 11 and I just busted so you should
be with me by friday i'm hoping whoa
well how does the song go you my mama
always told me a better shop around I
mean you just shopped around so good on
you bro yeah yeah yeah you know it comes
down to whether you whether you're going
to make the right buying decision for
yourself right and impulse purchasers
who don't do a lot of research might
actually go for the
embracing you don't want to be whole
price and you know it takes a very very
small amount of effort to shop around a
little bit before I made cuz cuz at the
moment I've got the galaxy europa that's
the phone i have at the moment but i'm
wanting to get a better phone so i
looked at reviews about on youtube i
watch some of your reviews on different
phones and they really helped me pick
pick a good phone to for my next phone
so that's why I've gone with the Nexus
far because I did look around I did have
a look all the different review sites
like yourselves on youtube as well not
really helped me make a decision awesome
ebony hoe I just have one more question
I would like to ask you all and we learn
and it's to do with os's do you think
that um then we we need because I feel
because there are only free established
os's on the planet of the moment which
is iOS Android Windows Phone hey Reba
gone but do you think that mark cream
cheese need to have the ability to have
more os's on offer because I fits a very
stagnant market where you you only get
free choices in most countries you you
have to get iOS you have to get Android
are you Eva have to get Windows Phone
well I I will disagree with you from the
very beginning I don't think windows
hill is an established OS and don't
bring on the hate mail I'm just talking
numbers and numbers don't lie if you
take market share and a brand
recognition we have Windows Phone
approximately at the same level as
blackberry whether if its previous
versions or blackberry 10 its BlackBerry
so I'm saying that the probably there
will be three key players but the third
spot is not yet decided if whether if it
will be windows phone with their sub
five percent market share blackberry in
the same boat for the newcomers sailfish
Firefox or Mozilla or whatever is the
yola Tizen
it's it's there it's there when when
there's such a small difference between
a couple of os's you can't just really
put it you can pretty probably trend but
those often tend to be different from a
zone to another and from the from you
know what I say right yeah this do we
need more than one great yeah why not
yeah yeah my argument would be that if
it's more if there's more OS is
available that encourages creativity and
innovation raised correctly if you if
you just wrap around the players right
it keeps the pressure on the existing
platforms to actually innovate and to
stay ahead of someone and not just
become complacent and in third place or
a fourth place for who and there's more
options always for the end consumer but
the problem is that because of the way
the industry works right now because of
our appt centric lifestyles you
absolutely need to have a platform that
has a significant app count and that is
the huge challenge right now and I don't
see any you know what I see first
happening is a cultural shift away from
the app mentality before I see a fourth
platform coming up at me like yeah we
got the app situation of the developers
aren't gonna developer for flat fun so
we're just not gonna do it yeah they're
they're struggling to do it for to the
foot little fuss already so right right
the plan I'd like to love this do you
think if the said 10 fails to take off
do you think BlackBerry's finished read
as an absolutely whenever busy then I
think you can bind on don't say than
another well yes agree which would you
say that if if would you say that if no
kids bring out his PureView phone do you
think windows phone is finished as well
well no no microphone throwing money at
that problem as long as I've been saying
it for a while Microsoft has a really
nice setup with windows song because
they earn revenue from Android through
licensing from patent disputes they earn
money on every android phone that's made
by what 12
teen manufacturers so as long as
androids around you'll see Microsoft
throwing money at Windows Phone to try
to make it successful too that's that's
the way I see it but my question was if
no cuz cuz i watched the last I heard
you were saying basically no Q won't
invest anymore in Windows Phone or even
oh no we didn't in it so what meets they
won't meet is it no what what we what we
said is that Nokia is standing by in
order to see whether to invest in a
Windows 8 / RT tablet all right I know
but what I'm saying is it because they
want to bring out a proper PureView
phone are they doing the same with that
are they waiting to see if that works
with a phone no no no regardless of the
review Lumia or not windows phone and
both windows phone as in microsoft and
nokia will continue living for how long
I don't know but it on the shorter term
nothing gonna happen nothing bad okay
that's how my questions unless you want
you guys to Raven yeah yeah I agree and
I know Taylor and Adam still have to let
their piece but that was I just wanted
to say there was a really good question
that's a lessening I'll have to say this
an awesome question yeah I'm done Thank
You Barbra Jean yeah actually guys I
gotta fly I got a suburban dad thing I
gotta go run and do so as far as you
know other platforms and right now I'd
say the car culture says that there
isn't much room it is much more than a
hobbyist platform but you know who knows
i mean it's it's an evolving culture and
that's why it's that's why mobile
technology is awesome so yeah sorry very
awesome jolie my style 10,000 forget you
like that nice they're like all right
guys I gotta run high take care of any
girl bombing us Taylor please do us the
honor of picking the last call for today
I have to do it because it is the second
female that has ever been on here yeah
yes
sit denisa is that how it's pronounced
I'm probably slaughtering your name oh
hi guys it's danessa I'm gonna panic
okay yes I couldn't tell wow I slaughter
names I am the hater Slayer and the
names later so all right so tell us what
you found most interesting about Mobile
World Congress this year well honestly
to me I completely fell head over heels
with the HTC One because well I'm I'm an
HTC junkie I absolutely love love HTC
they follow me on Twitter that's how
much I love them and I never thought I
mean I mean the idea of having this
whole aluminum phone was just amazing
and blew my mind and I have the
sensational XL and I don't know I mean
there's some places that I go to that I
don't have signal and one of my friends
told me that is because of that is
because the back part of it is part
Luminum so I'm kind of worried about
that you guys think that's gonna play a
role in it because that was the main
reason why it's like not oh we're out
there it made of aluminum because of the
resin the reception problems I we've
seen it in tablets um the ax sous
transformer prime had Wi-Fi issues
because it was all aluminum and I will
say this HTC spoke to this at the at the
unveiling in New York City they actually
spent like 45 seconds talking about like
we have this awesome design we have
other manufacturers out there who built
their phones out of aluminum there was a
problem with reception we solved that
problem so I don't know how much of that
is hot air I don't know how much we are
to to believe them but they actually did
go out of their way to say we know there
are concerns about this we fixed it so I
is it correct danessa yes I would like
to ask you something aside from the time
that you are a die-hard HTC fab which I
can totally accept why do you think the
HTC water will be good
and here's the question aren't you a
little bit afraid of the four megapixel
camera as as a typical user do you care
about the size of your your pictures or
the quality of your features I think I'm
gonna get a lot of crap from people but
I think the quality is more important
because my camera on the oh my phone is
8 megapixels but the quality is not as
good as you will get from it from a
camera that is ignant megapixels and i
think is one hundred percent quality
over the size of the picture cuz if the
picture can be huge and if it's still
kind of smudging and it doesn't have
that Chris quality i think it's just
it's for nothing completely agree yeah
brother yeah thanks Raph we actually had
the opportunity to play with the HTC One
mode yesterday yeah are you getting to
work and think you're getting you the
photo yeah Tony took a picture of me in
very difficult lighting conditions as if
she see by the way if you are a fan of
agency you need to know this if you go
to their events ever there are launch
events those guys can light a room to
make everyone look dead sexy it is
amazing all right now you got not sure
every human being in the room looks
amazing but the problem is when you try
and photograph any of their phones it is
impossible because the room was like a
club and they did that exact same thing
here at mwc how Tony trying to take a
picture of me is like I want to see how
this camera performs and challenging
lighting conditions and what happened oh
well I could see a lots of pixels yeah
there was there was some noise in the
shadows when they they uploaded the
video of the showcase for the HTC One
and they were comparing Oh photo a photo
be against competing against the picture
from the HTC One and honestly I just
don't buy it i think uh it's a marketing
thing they always do that you always
think oh my god this is amazing and then
you get the product without waiting for
other people to screw up and then you
just you're stuck with your phone and
you don't want to sell it because you
just bought it yeah
and that's why I'd rather buy phones
when they've been on the market for more
than a year cuz that's how you know for
sure how's everything went wrong or good
with the phone dinner I would like you
to ask you something please open up your
toolbox and let's give a huge clap to
our second lady during the podcast thank
you finally I wanted to join but I never
could for some reason I've been watching
on refreshing button um half hour later
after you guys I will say one lesson you
are absolutely right in that you can't
find the you can't buy the buzz I we
were at the Nokia event they were
advertising their awesome camera on the
Lumia 720 which looks to be a very good
camera but the photos they were showing
were simply incredible in it not because
they faked them and they went out of the
way to say these are not been altered
but because they took them in the best
possible conditions that wouldn't be the
first time they fake something just I
know and I do does like that why i went
out of the way to say we didn't they
thing is they took them the best
possible conditions and you can do that
with any camera you can make the
previous camera look amazing if the
conditions are right so you can't
believe the bus you can't believe the
hype you're absolutely right to wait and
we have a series focused on exactly
what's yelled after the bones of the
culture I always do and another thing
that's why my phone I bought it recently
I bought it for Christmas last year and
I actually came to regret it because
later i was like oh I should have bought
that HTC One X or the bionics plus or
one of those phones because they were
newer and everyone was going crazy over
them but and they're practically the
same price but I still love my phone
even though a lot of people don't like
the sensation Excel for some reason but
i think this one runs smoothly is really
fast even though it's not as good or
better as other fault but I love my view
Michael had the opportunity to play with
the HTC One in New York when it was
announced I haven't seen it yet
I did do that yesterday and I played
with it it's very fluid it looks good
it's fast it's that's not the problem
the problem is the s4 who even if it's
going to be the same speed same specs
it's going to have a higher resolution
camera and Samsung we're gonna it's
gonna capitalize on that and I think it
all comes down to design versus design
HTC one is a new design it's a great
design so the question is what will the
s4 ring and it's the four megapixel Zoe
camera versus the rumored 13-megapixel
whatever camera and the camera is on
samsung devices are good they are yeah
that's what I keep telling everyone if
you want a cell phone for its camera you
need to go with samsung or sony because
Sony is really good weekend for the
iPhone the iPhone also has a very good
camera or not yeah yeah hello but I
don't have a good relationship with
Apple for some reason because I think
they're really extremely pretentious
with her prizes and their products I
when the when iphone 5 first was
announced I was like oh my god I can
feel the wave of people oh my god i'ma
get the iphone flagyl and then I
actually expected something really big
from it but in reality it was just the
same phone but a little holler and I was
completely I was extremely disappointing
and I wasn't even planning on getting
the phone ever that's that's the video
but let's let's not bash the iphone
users you probably think the same way
about another company so everybody to
each its own yeah so uh yeah that's
that's about it any any closing thoughts
anybody else cuz we need to wrap this up
yep I gotta get going soon yeah so any
any closing thoughts anybody who is
finished with oh yes Jennifer's please
my lady I think that that's it I'm sorry
it was a pleasure to be in this hangout
finally I had the opportunity and you
guys are amazing i love pocket now ever
since i was doing research on I think it
was over a year ago that was doing
research on phones and this channel was

apologizing that we have not managed to
