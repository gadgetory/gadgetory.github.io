reportedly wanting to compete with
snapchat LGV 20 rumors detail the
proximity it will have to the launch of
the Nexus and now we've got some rumors
that the iPhone 7 features are getting
pushed to 2017 I'm Jaime Mehta Rivera we
will be heading out to Berlin on Monday
it's gonna be really hard to run this
show from there but you know I will give
it a try and if not we've got a ton of
coverage that's coming from that event
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with Deal su certain
degree a sprint continues to up the ante
and unlimited plans t-mobile obviously
has a ton of benefits with everything
it's launched within carrier and the
company has now decided to compete
there's the $60 plan but now we get the
$80 or you go up to 160 for two phone
lines you get unlimited everything you
do not get throttling in video quality
it's a little more expensive than what
t-mobile is offering again you don't get
the same benefits but if you're on
Sprint this is probably a good deal to
consider or if you want to move over as
well now let's talk about Apple we
usually do not talk about launches for
betas but this is interesting
Apple is launching beta eight for iOS 10
and the rest of its operating system
starting today it launched beta 7 a few
days ago and then beta 6 we have never
seen such an aggressive push over beta
updates this definitely means that we
are getting close whenever we you hear
say gold master Candidate that means
we're probably a week away from the
final event stay tuned
even though we know that the LGV 20 will
be the first phone running Android 7
dotto nougat out of the box
according to LG's claims this is
interesting as we've got trusted sources
claiming that it won't be the first
phone running new good to be widely
available because apparently the Nexus
devices are planned to launch earlier in
more markets than the LGB 20 and this is
interesting as Nexus devices have never
been widely available everywhere and we
wonder what Google is planning with
these new phone stay tuned now let's go
back to Apple we have heard so many
rumors about the iPhone 7 and then we
also hear rumors of the iPhone in 2017
we've got another trusted source that is
claiming now that that whole forced
touch home button that we were
expecting for the iPhone 7 is apparently
going to happen until the 2017 iPhone
for what reasons we don't know it would
be awesome if Apple would implement
forced touch in somewhere that we
actually want to use it as a I'm one of
the people that doesn't use 3d touch at
all but hey let's see what we get with
the next generation iPhone and finally
the most interesting rumors of the day
had to do with Apple but listen to this
it usually is not about software but the
rumors claim that Apple is building a
competitor to snapchat just like we have
Instagram stories just like about every
other company is trying to compete with
snapchat I love the people that is still
trying to get it I use it every now and
then I find that cool for certain
reasons but then again it doesn't solve
everything but apparently Apple is
working on that on a video service that
has messages that eventually expire etc
etc
hey it leads me to the question of the
day do you feel that it would be a good
idea for Apple to launch this as a
separate service and compete or do you
think that this should be part of
features like FaceTime because in my
case I feel that if Apple enhances
FaceTime or enhances iMessage to be able
to do this than great but to have yet
another ad to launch another service to
oh it's just terrible
well we would love to know your opinion
