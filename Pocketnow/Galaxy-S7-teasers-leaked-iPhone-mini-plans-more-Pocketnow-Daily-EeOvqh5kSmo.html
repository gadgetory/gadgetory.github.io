expect with the Samsung Galaxy s7 in a
few weeks Apple's I've had three seems
to bring dramatic changes to the tablet
that we know in Microsoft could pretty
much buried Windows Phone as it today
I'm hi meri behna and now that we're out
of vodka and tequila well let's get
ready for Friday this is pocket out
daily today's show begins with Microsoft
as we've got the company's quarter
results and I'm not even going to bore
you with numbers because that's just
technicality that you could read in the
link in the description but what we have
is a company that's down and revenue
down in profitability but the company
did feed expectations which is great but
not necessarily when it comes to its
products in the service line it seems
that the company is up twenty nine
percent which is great but then in the
windows fill in terrific company is down
forty five percent compared to last year
forty five percent and last year it's
not like if the company had any flagship
so let's just burn when those phone
while we're at it man a very similar
scenario happens to Samsung azza the
company is slightly downward compared to
last year as well but the company did
predict that this was going to happen
and again I'm not going to bore you with
numbers the good thing is that even
though the company does not predict to
grow much in q1 2016 apparently it is
predicting growth after that meaning
that we can expect the Galaxy s7 by the
end of the quarter pretty much tinted
when we should get it which pretty much
matches when we got it last year as well
and for those of you that are stoked
with the return of one hand that
usability with the iphone 5s see that's
being rumoured it seems that Apple is
not necessarily planning to launch this
phone everywhere apparently the company
wants to cut costs and launch a phone
that it can actually sell at emerging
markets and even though we don't have a
specific price points on what to expect
it seems that the company plans to drive
sales of its app stores in countries
that don't necessarily perform well like
let's say emerging markets yeah let's
see what they get but whenever they
launch the product we should learn more
as we hear that there are major
announcements that happen in
March and this is just part of it and
one of these products that will be
announced apparently and marches the
ipad air three and even though we were
expecting some minor changes just more
speakers and stuff as we heard rumors it
seems that Apple's planning some major
deals here it seems that we are getting
4k on a display which is a big deal on
such a small tablet but in addition to
that it seems that Apple is not
necessarily just going to offer you more
storage options but also more RAM
options up to the point where if you get
the 128 gigabyte ipad air three that
seems you'll get four gigs of RAM which
is crazy let's hope that it can run
better applications that are more
tailored to people that want Pro
Performance something you can't even get
with the iPad throw but finally the
spotlight for the hottest news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7
famous tipster efflux has just the claim
two very important things number one
will we talked about yesterday with a
you know for Galaxy s7 variance is
apparently not happening it seems that
there will only be two products the
regular and the edge and then the second
thing is that he gives us a teaser of
the logo of the galaxy s7 from the back
and if you haven't noticed what you have
there are herbs on the side so yeah
seems that the design of the galaxy
note5 is being pointed to the galaxy s7
bringing some changes that are actually
good and according to famous tipster
efflux we should learn more about the
HTC One m10 in the next few hours so
stay tuned it leads me to the question
of the day for this mwc or for the first
quarter of 2016 which phone are you
looking out for most the galaxy s7 the
HTC One m10 or the LG g5 in my case i'll
be honest i want to hear about the three
of them but leave us a comment down
