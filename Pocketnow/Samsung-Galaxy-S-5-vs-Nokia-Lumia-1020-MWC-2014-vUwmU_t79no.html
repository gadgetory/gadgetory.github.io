of the galaxy s5 the hottest android
phone at the moment and we're comparing
it with not the flagship one of the best
smartphones running windows phone the
nokia lumia 1020 let's go take a look at
the differences and similarities talking
about similarities they're both
smartphones and that's pretty much it
ones running Windows Phone ones running
Android and as you can see this is the
size difference between the two the
galaxy s5 is this much taller and if we
take a look at thickness of course the
1020 is much thicker and we don't even
need to consider the hump on the back
look we'll get back to that just in one
second flipping it to the side to the
back I'm sorry this thing is a
41-megapixel optically eight stabilized
camera this right here is a 16 megapixel
camera and that's it there's no optical
image stabilization or at least it
wasn't specifically cold out with in the
event that aside we have a five-point in
one inch Super AMOLED screen which is in
one of resolution of 1080 x 1920 so it's
full HD while we have a 4.5 inch screen
on the Lumia 1020 which is f resolution
1280 by 768 the processor operating the
galaxy s5 is a quad-core processor
clocking in at 2.5 gigahertz well the
Nokia Lumia 1020 is powered by a
dual-core Snapdragon clocked at one
point five though two gigs of ram vs. 2
gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage verses 16
32 and 64 expandable non-expandable on
the lumia and we've said enough there
they couldn't be any much more different
and that's even without unlocking the
phones
this is Windows Phone as you know it as
you've been used to it by now with the
scrollable applications with the life
that which you can of course make
smaller bigger and move them on the
screen and that's pretty much it
applications from the store we're not
connected to the internet right now and
that's pretty much it we have a lot of
customization options on the android
phone as you've been used to by now even
on stock android and this one's running
the latest version of Samsung's own user
interface on top of it we won't even go
into details as per the widgets and
applications and everything they're very
different this is a top-of-the-line
Windows Phone this is the best android
smartphone money can buy at the moment
which one should you go for first you
have to answer a simple question would
you prefer Windows Phone or would you
prefer Android and once you have the
answer to that question you can easily
pin it down to which one of these two
devices will suit your needs this has
been a short comparison of the two we'll
be back with the iphone 5s and the
anticipated galaxy note 3 comparison i'm
anton hi I'm behind the camera sweating
in Barcelona galaxy s5 event thank you
very much for watching
