pocketnow.com HTC has just released an
update for the inspire 4G and the Atrix
4G giving both of them HSUPA for faster
uploads in this video we're going to
show you a before and after let's get to
it
okay so there's been kind of a
controversy with the Atrix 4G and the
inspire 4G if you listen in the pocket
now podcasts we talked about this all
the time these devices cannot do 4G
speeds yet because AT&amp;amp;T S 4G network
kind of doesn't exist
it exists in places of enhanced backhaul
but 18d hasn't make it known where that
is and it's definitely not here let me
show you so when do begin test we have
full bars here with H+ it says H+ as if
we are over HSPA+ and let's see what
kind of speeds we get here pretty bad
speeds actually speeds that are worse
than 3G which is surprising because this
is caught the inspire 4G so let's see
what kind of speeds we get about 1.2
down and I've got a weird burst there
for the upload and the upload speeds are
horrible because right now this device
doesn't do HSUPA to at least to make it
as fast as a 3G device when uploading
okay so really horrible results here
we're gonna run the HTC software update
over there but first really quick let's
jump into the system settings and double
check what what the network setting says
so here is HSDPA no HSPA+ running this
update probably won't put us on the
HSPA+ it'll just improve the upload
speeds will cut back after we run that
and we're back for a second the update
is it's processing here it had to reboot
and we'll come back when it's finished
right and we're back in the update is
complete very important that you reboot
your device after the update or the the
new speeds will actually be worse than
the speeds you were getting before it's
bouncing to speedtest.net let's restart
the test and see what kind of speeds we
get we have almost full bars here the
phones in the same location as before so
the download speeds are much faster
these are still HSDPA speeds or
getting about 2.8 down which is
certainly an improvement over the 1.1 or
so we were getting in the first test and
let's see what kind of speeds would get
for the uploads that's really what we
have an eye on here so far they are
pretty bad almost as bad as before these
these benchmarks are very volatile
though swing in either direction will
restart the test let's see we get now
we're at 4 bars before we're three bars
okay so the download speeds are pushing
a little bit higher than in the last
test we're up to three megabits per
second again these are HSDPA speeds for
the HSPA+ we should it be we should be
at 4 or 5 or 6 megabits per second and
for the upload speed let's see if we
trend higher for that now with HSUPA
turned on and again we're really not
getting there um the speeds are pretty
pretty bad but we've got a faster up our
download speed let's just jump into this
screen here and just see what see what
the network says HSDPA let's run another
speed test
here's another speed test that's got
four out of five stars in the android
market we don't use it that much but
apparently it is pretty good so let's
see what this one says for 3g mode sure
go ahead
alright good 1.7 it looks like it
continuing to climb will probably get
close to to get 1.84 and the moment of
truth of course the upload speeds
alright not bad now we're getting some
pretty good readings over one megabit
per second in the in the upload let's
bounce back to the speedtest.net
application yes lots of speed tests this
in this video and let's see if we get
better results for some reason maybe
there is a network outage or something
like that Wow good 3.6 that's pretty
impressive around here a good HSDPA
speed is in the mid twos okay and let's
see what we get for the upload speed
hopefully we'll see some improvement
kanya we're still seeing really horrible
results but in the other app we got
about 1
a bit per second up which is definitely
an improvement over the 200 or so that
we were seeing previously before we put
this update in place so there see it
seems like there's a difference it might
not be a huge difference and it might
not occur all the time but it's better
than nothing we're still waiting for a
TTS HSPA+ network so we can get speeds
that are several times higher than this
so that the inspire 4G and the Atrix 4G
become true 4G devices if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
please drop a comment if you have an
inspire 4G or an HX 4G and let us know
what your experience was like with the
updates that were recently released
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
