pocket now calm and this is a rematch
between the google nexus one and the HD
HD two for website rendering speeds we
already did this comparison using using
the stock browser on the HTC hd2 Opera
Mobile 9.7 and it was significantly
slower than the nexus one but we got a
lot of requests from people asking us do
the same comparison with the fastest
windows mobile browser skyfire so we're
going to test that now and we've got
both loading loaded into program memory
so they should load at the same time
very quickly and there they go let's
start off we'll go to pocket now calm on
both devices see which one loads it
faster all right and let's do it one two
three and they're off
skyfire one nexus one is still loading
still loading so the nexus one was about
six seconds slower then skyfire on the
HTC hd2 of course we can pan down on
both we can get a little bit closer by
double tapping here double tap and let's
click on this top headline and see how
fast it loads sort of a permalink page
123 okay there there go there we go
skyfire one nexus one is still loading
the page and we can of course scroll
down and see the contents of the page
I'm just going to stop nexus one here it
is slower and we're going to check
screen rotation speed on both of these
devices on the same webpage so let's try
to do this as closely as possible one
two three ok so the nexus one was faster
there let's try going into portrait so
the nexus one was a little bit faster in
screen rotation speed let's go to
another website this time we're going to
go to engadget.com all right here we go
one two three
okay skyfire one again and nexus one is
still working away they're both
connected the same Wi-Fi network by the
way it's still going alright so that was
about ten seconds behind skyfire let's
flick down the page and see how things
look on the nexus one we can flick down
quite quickly and everything is there if
we do the same on skyfire a problem
skyfire has it's kind of slow to redraw
the screen if you're flicking really
fast sometimes it has trouble keeping up
but once you go down the page or wait a
little bit of time it clears up so
that's definitely one leg up on on the
nexus one has really good performance at
keeping the page rendered as nicely as
possible alright let's click a permalink
here we're gonna click on this story see
how long that takes to load all right
and the hd2 one in that test we can
scroll down the page and you get the
point so overall it does look like sky
fire on the hd2 is bastard rendering web
pages then the browser on the nexus one
that said it doesn't perform as well
because oftentimes if you flick quickly
you'll get checkerboards and it takes a
few moments to clear up whereas on the
nexus one everything seems to be already
rendered very very nicely on the bottom
of the page so for speed the hd2 wins
but again for rendering fidelity and the
ability to quickly refresh the page and
get everything loaded the nexus ones
browser is superior i'll put a link up
on the video in case you missed the
video comparing upper mobile 9.7 on the
hd2 to the browser on the nexus one
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
