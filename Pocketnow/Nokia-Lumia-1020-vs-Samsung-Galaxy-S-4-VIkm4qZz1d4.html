promising smartphones of all time and
one of the most popular let us help you
with that
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. samsung
galaxy s4 maybe it's fitting that the
two most visible flagships of the
Android and Windows Phone platforms
couldn't possibly be more different but
it also means we have a lot to compare
and not a lot of time to do it so let's
dive in we'll start with the least
relevant aspect of these devices from
the perspective of the average buyer and
we'll work our way up to the more
important stuff that means we're
starting with specs with a quick pit
stop to remind you to follow pocket now
on social media so you don't miss future
coverage on the Lumia 1020 and other
mobile devices so the Galaxy s4 is
absolutely the clear winner here in
terms of processing horsepower our AT&amp;amp;T
branded device packs the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 a quad-core SOC running
at 1.9 gigahertz and backed up by 2 gigs
of RAM and 16 gigs of on-board storage
the RAM is matched by the Lumia but the
processing power is not the 1020 gets
its power from an older dual-core
Snapdragon s4 running at 1.5 gigahertz
and while the Lumia is 32 gigs of
on-board storage outclasses the 16 gigs
on this particular Galaxy s4 the Samsung
phones capacity is expandable via
microSD while the Lumias is not that
holds true for the replaceable 2600
milliamp hour battery on samsung's
galaxy s4 which outclasses the 2000
milliamp hour battery embedded in the
Lumia and then there's the AMOLED
screens the Samsung panel at 4.8 inches
and 1080p trounces the 4.5 inch WXGA
display on the Lumia and this bloodbath
isn't even taking into account the
octa-core and expanded memory variants
of the Galaxy s4 so look if you're
buying exclusively on specs you can stop
here Samsung wins but two things one
we've still got a camera section to get
to and 2 in this case
sar pretty irrelevant so let's start
talking about what really matters the
user experience that experience starts
the first time you pick a phone up and
each of these devices is incredibly
distinctive at 130 grams and 7.9
millimeters thin the Galaxy s4 is an
ultra light super pocketable smartphone
it's so lightweight that sometimes it
doesn't even feel real its build is
polycarbonate and Gorilla Glass 3 but
its body is also finished in Samsung's
glossy hyper glaze coating and accented
with faux metallic trim the net effect
is a phone that looks quite nice on the
table but which loses some of its
premium feel when picked up the Nokia
device is put simply none of that
it's polycarbonate build is naked and
matte instead of glossy the material
almost feeling like bone or a blackboard
or something the gorilla glass display
protection also third-generation here
curves ever so slightly toward the sides
where the keys are aluminum and include
a dedicated camera shutter and speaking
of that camera it's huge the aluminum
PureView module sticks out like a moon
crater from the backside of the 1020
boasting its thickness to ten point four
millimeters and its mass to 158 grams
this phone is neither subtle nor dainty
in the hand it's decidedly more awkward
than the more conventional s4 but to
some it'll also be more intriguing by
virtue of that strangeness whether that
holds true for the Lumias Windows Phone
8 software experience compared to the
galaxy s4 Xandra jellybean OS will
depend on you the differences in
interface are apparent from the first
power on Microsoft's Windows Phone
emphasizes glanceable information in
flipping live tiles and a Spartan
minimalism that not only keeps it classy
but keeps it fluid despite the Lumias
last generation guts on the flipside
Samsung's TouchWiz UI atop Android jelly
bean is so heavy and loaded with
features that it tends to bog down at
times
despite the galaxy s4 s powerful
where you'll need to decide whether
you're interested in a more customizable
legitimately feature-packed experience
with Android or a more restricted but
also more consistent interaction with
Windows Phone part of that question can
be answered by which ecosystem you value
more Google's is significantly larger in
terms of app count but Windows Phone 8
as the third largest mobile platform has
been growing aggressively and now
features a very high percentage of the
most popular titles out there the
decision is a big one and frankly it's
one you should make before visiting your
retail store see our full reviews of
both the galaxy s4 and Windows Phone 8
for more insight into that platform
question now for the reason you're
watching this video the camera
comparison there's no reason to mince
words here if you're considering buying
the Lumia 1020 odds are it's because of
the camera at 41 megapixels with optical
image stabilization lossless zoom
low-light enhancements and full manual
control of focus ISO and shutter speed
and three separate stock camera apps
aboard
there's not even a contest the Lumia
1020 camera wipes the floor with the
galaxy s4 s in terms of specs here's the
thing though in conventional terms the
galaxy s4 s camera is great it's a 13
megapixel BSI sensor with 1080p video
recording and a ton of useful shooting
modes and fun filters all of it packed
into one of the easiest to use view
finders ever and highly customizable in
its own right the galaxy s4 doesn't lose
this section because it's got a bad
camera it loses because nothing even
comes close to the Lumia 1020 s hugely
overpowered one that shines through in
the results in normal light the galaxy
s4's camera does very well some of its
shots actually came out better than the
Lumias in our testing due mainly to
operator error when learning the 1020 s
intelligent but advanced interface but
true to Nokia's reputation for excellent
low-light photography once the Sun Goes
Down the advantage of the 1020 s huge
sensor and adjustable shutter speed
become
clear round all that up and garnish it
with some excellent on device tutorials
a powerful xenon flash and a suite of
software that tops even Samsung's
feature set in the 1020 is essentially
unbeatable in the optics category we
haven't yet spent enough time with the
1020 to get a solid battery performance
rating so stay tuned for our full review
for more on that and other in depth
metrics in more superficial testing and
in the context of this comparison the
Lumia 1020 behaves on par with its
predecessor the 920 colors said we
sounded better on the nokia device in
all testing conditions and we preferred
the Lumia for phone calls as well and
though we wish its speaker were as loud
as the s4 s for loudspeaker calls and
media playback headphone audio was solid
on each device though we really liked
the out of box Dolby EQ options on
Nokia's Lumia devices for tweaking our
listening experience reception over
Wi-Fi and cellular seemed on par between
the phones and we're really looking
forward to testing out those barometers
in a future video if you promise to
watch that is which one you should buy
is more than a question of which
ecosystem you're looking to invest in
it's a question of how much you care
about your camera if you need
professional-grade photo quality and
you're unwilling to carry a camera
separate from your smartphone the Nokia
Lumia 1020 is the best option that's
ever existed and it's camera is so good
it might even make you switch platforms
if you're not already on Windows Phone
certainly that's Nokia's hope on the
other hand if you're happy with a solid
enough smartphone shooter then you don't
want to drop to 9999 on contract with
ATT the galaxy s4 is available on almost
every carrier you can think of and it's
a member of the more mainstream Android
community if that makes your life easier
just don't expect to snag the kind of
quality photos that new Lumia owners are
about to start showing off all over the
internet when the 1020 goes on sale at
the end of this week
