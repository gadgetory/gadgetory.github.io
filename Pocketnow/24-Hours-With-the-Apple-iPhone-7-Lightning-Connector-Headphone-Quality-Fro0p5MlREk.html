brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm alright
folks we're less than 24 hours in to
using the new iPhone 7 and honestly
folks there's not a whole lot to report
in terms of using this as a smartphone
just yet but I'm not sitting here to
waste your time or milk you for extra
video views so I actually did want to
spend a little time to talk about audio
quality of course the most controversial
aspect of the iPhone 7 is the fact that
Apple got rid of the 3.5 millimeter jack
on the bottom of the phone now going
back and re watching Apple's press
conference Apple's announcement for the
iPhone 7 I find it very telling that the
reason they gave for getting rid of this
port was courage the courage to do
something daring do something new do
something different it's telling because
now that I've spent some time listening
to music off of this port the reason
definitely was not to improve audio
quality so just to recap what you get in
the Box you get your ear pods they're
not my favorite headphones but they
sound decent enough I guess I just wish
they had a better seal around the ear
canal I can still hear everything that's
going on around me which means I know
I'm listening in my music louder than I
should be but those terminate now in a
lightning connector port so plugs
directly into the bottom of the phone
and and make sure you check out because
it comes in a new cardboard casing that
you flipped that cardboard casing over
extend my compost already threw this
away you get your lightning to three
point five millimeter jack adapter while
this is definitely a nice consideration
that Apple has included this in the box
they're not making you pay an extra
twenty bucks or thirty bucks at time of
purchase just to get your adapter for
your headphones I kind of wish they had
made this just a little bit nicer maybe
a little bit longer and just a little
bit thicker some better shielding around
this cable that's all geeky griping
about cables and connectors now
obviously because we're going through
the Lightning port this is a this is a
digital connection it's Scott is sound
better than you know an analogue
connector which was invented oh-hey
1870s am i right it's the year 2016
you've heard me repeat time and time
again that audio quality is determined
by the DAC and the amp when we take the
digital file convert it into an analogue
signal that's what the DAC does digital
to analog converter and then the amp
boosts that analog signal so that it can
properly drive your headphones and if we
look at this little adapter there's no
room here to include a DAC and an amp of
any quality now on phones that have a
traditional headphone jack once you've
converted that signal and you've
amplified it it goes directly to the
metal connectors that interact with the
jack on your headphones and typically
for your headphones you need four
connections your left channel your right
channel the microphone and then a ground
to make sure you don't electrocute
yourself with your headphones so what's
happening on the iPhone 7 is the phone
is still sending out those four
connections through the Lightning port
and then there's an additional bridge
through this adapter to then send the
audio signal through the 3.5 millimeter
Jack hope what is this all mean for that
headphone audio quality on the iPhone 7
I mean the truth is it's good it's just
that we're probably dealing with the
same DAC and amp that we have in the
iPhone 6s it's punchy it's loud it does
a pretty good job of driving my
headphones but it truncates your audio
to 16-bit output this phone will play
24-bit and 32-bit audio files but the
actual output will be cut back down to
16-bit audio if you're still watching
this you're probably thinking same DAC
same amp no harm no foul right I mean
the iPhone has always been good enough
at all of these tasks like headphone
audio playback and that's mostly true
but again we still have to go through
the adapter and in our testing we'll be
expanding on this in the full review for
the iPhone 7 but every test that we can
throw on this phone audio quality is
slightly degraded from the iPhone 6s
we're talking very small scientific
differences between these two phones and
if I'm being perfectly honest the
differences are so slight I doubt most
people would be able to hear the
differences in a blind taste test but
the fact of the matter still remains
that not only is there no tangible
consumer benefit to moving to the
Lightning connector and not only has
audio quality not improved it's actually
gotten ever so slightly less good
it's just the knowledge of knowing that
Apple has made this move and it does
kind of bum me out why does it bum me
out
because it starts speaking to a future
where we can kind of slack off on what's
actually built into the phone and push
that responsibility onto consumers for
their accessories purchases do you want
to hear the full scope and dynamic range
of your high quality audio files well
for an iPhone user that means you're
gonna have to buy headphones that have
their own DAC and amp built into them
that's going to increase the cost and
those manufacturers are going to have to
license the Lightning connector so that
it'll play nice with the iPhone and
that's an additional cost I personally
feel in making this move that Apple's
getting to hide behind some
misinformation or just the general lack
of understanding on how this stuff works
and this is different than when Apple
would get rid of something like the
floppy drive when that happened there
was already a better solution available
to consumers and it didn't make sense to
continue supporting a legacy interface
anyone who's walking around making the
argument about how old the 3.5
millimeter jack is fundamentally does
not understand how audio works
especially at a time where we have
phones like the HTC 10 or the LG v 20
the 32-bit DAC built into this phone
which outputs to a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack is capable of generating
frequencies of sound that dogs cannot
hear we do not have a problem with
quality on this old connector folks
we're still really early days into
testing the iPhone 7 I mean early days
were early day into testing the iPhone 7
and obviously I'm very passionate about
things like headphone audio quality we
are talking about the premium the
top-tier the most expensive smartphones
on the market today and so I have an
expectation that those things are going
to deliver and this is one situation
where new isn't better and at best isn't
even quite a lateral move from what we
used to use pocket now's iPhone 7
coverage is made possible by D brand
manufacturer of precision cut vinyl
skins for smartphones tablets laptops
gaming consoles and more if you're
looking to customize the appearance of
your gadget while adding a bit of
protection and grip check out D brand
calm or visit the link in the
description below so stay tuned folks
we've got a lot more ground to cover on
this phone of course the real camera
review is coming up we've got some
comparisons which i think are going to
be a lot of fun
the full review should be interesting in
how we evaluate improvement and
refinement from product year to product
year as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for all of those goodies that I
just described and to help us out with
some sharing on your favorite social
