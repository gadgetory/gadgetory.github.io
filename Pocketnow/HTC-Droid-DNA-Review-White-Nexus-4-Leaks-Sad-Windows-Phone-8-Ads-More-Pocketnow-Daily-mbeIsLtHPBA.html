now live the LG Nexus 4 shows up in
white yet again in Microsoft's new ad
campaign for windows phone 8 misses the
point I'm hina Rivera wishing there was
a GSM flavored HTC droid DNA and this is
parking out daily for those of you that
agree with me that the HTC droid DNA on
verizon is probably one of the hottest
smartphones of the year AKA j butterfly
remember that well michael's full review
is already live and there are a lot of
really great things to talk about this
phone but sadly some things that weren't
really that good on verizon so make sure
you catch the links for his full review
michael has taken the time to compare
that thing to everything in our Boston
labs I think except for his neighbor's
dog so make sure you catch the links and
make a full opinion for yourself before
you make your purchase this holiday
season now let's be realistic here the
only cooler thing than to have the LG
Nexus 4 with a glass on glass design
like previous versions of the iphone is
to also have a white variant of the
Nexus 4 that's just as cool as the white
iphones we saw before so far there are
some leaked images in spec showing that
there is a white Nexus 4 though sadly we
have no dates for that and we're not
sure that front panels can remain black
and the back is going to be white
hopefully it's going to be fully white
so stay tuned for more rumors you know I
had my first shot at getting lost with
Apple maps last week so I did celebrate
this morning when Nokia finally released
their Maps application for iOS it's
called here maps and it's completely
free on the iOS App Store even though
it's not perfect and it's not really as
good as Google's navigation services on
Android hey trust me again it's free and
it's much better than just having apples
and maps for free getting lost and not
having a second opinion now skype has
made some major changes in a lot of
these really benefit Android customers
the most first of all because we finally
get a tablet optimized version of skype
for android tablets which you know is
hard to come by and so far to be honest
with you it's quite cool aside from that
skype is now making it available for you
to be able to merge your current skype
handle with your Microsoft account and
since you'll most like
you have to do it sooner or later next
year might as well do it now and finally
for the ironic news of the day Microsoft
is at it again with a new marketing
campaign to compare Windows Phone 8 to
iOS and Android sort of like smoke by
Windows Phone though without the
gangster named sadly the ironic part is
when you have these guys compare a Lumia
920 and video recording capabilities to
an htc inspire 4G that's two years old
or having them compare search
capabilities in local Scout with a
blackberry when you can have an Android
the bicycle pair that too how about if
they try to compare how Windows Phone 8
launches google voice in comparison to
Android right that's right there's no
google voice application on Windows
Phone 8 that leads me to the question of
the day what do you think about
Microsoft's new marketing tactics I can
mean smoke bite windows phone is ok it
only compared speed but this time
they're trying to compare services we're
not really things are matching in their
comparisons leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow was on Parker now calm please

what you saw I'm hi Marilee better
