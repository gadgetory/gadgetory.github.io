today I'd like to show you a live
wallpaper from LevelUp studios these are
the same people that bring you the
beautiful widgets widget pack and the
Twitter Twitter client it's kind of cool
kind of neat you got to see it to
believe it
let's go take a look you're looking at a
live wallpaper and in this case it's
just an animation it's a wallpaper
that's got some pretty colors on it and
it doesn't do anything other than show
off the capabilities of the phone it's
just kind of neat what life wallpapers
can do more than that they can interact
with data the first one I'd like to show
you just as an example is a live
wallpaper that comes with Google Maps
now Google Maps as you know is a mapping
program it shows you where you are with
satellite or just stick Maps as it were
but it also goes out and gets traffic
data and it can show you in a traffic
layer what the traffic is like if you're
gonna have a little bit of a delay or a
lot of a delay on a particular road so
that's neat this wallpaper can consume
that data and show you just at a glance
where the traffic problems are so you
can avoid those areas and hopefully get
home a little bit quicker what I want to
show you here though is the second live
wallpaper app that really has utility at
least the second one I've seen that's
beautiful live weather by level up
Studios too to get the full advantage
out of this you have to also have
beautiful widgets also from level up
Studios live weather is free but
beautiful widgets is not the widgets
pack is going to cost you a few euros
but the neat thing is this live
wallpaper will consume the weather data
that the beautiful widgets pack gets and
it will change your wallpaper
accordingly so let me show you that
again we're going to go over here to an
empty area of the screen tap and hold
will go to wallpapers live wallpapers
and beautiful live weather
and in settings we are going to read the
unlock information which basically says
the same thing that I just told you you
need to have the widgets back to be able
to do it so we'll set that as the
wallpaper and if you notice this is
basically the grass wallpaper which has
animated grass on the bottom but it also
has an animated Sun showing me at a
glance it's sunny outside now that's
what it was like this morning but right
before I went to lunch my wallpaper
changed it changed to an animated very
overcast day in fact this whole area on
the top was really angry looking clouds
just animated across in other words it's
really cloudy and blustery out there and
I knew just by looking at my phone
without launching an app without going
into a widget I knew that there was bad
weather
I grabbed my umbrella I headed on my way
and guess what I got rained on but
because I had this wallpaper installed I
was able to see in advance that I should
probably prepare for inclement weather
so I did that and it worked out great I
think we're gonna see a lot more of this
tight coupling of data being shown in
live wallpapers at least I hope we are
and I really have to give it to level up
Studios for making a live wallpaper
that's really useful and looks good too
so again the live wallpaper is called a
beautiful live weather by level up
Studios it uses the data from beautiful
widgets also oh I love love studios and
showing you all this I'm Joe with
