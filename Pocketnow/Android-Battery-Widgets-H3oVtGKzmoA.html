calm and I'm embarrassed to say but I
ran out of battery life on my nexus one
while I was at a very very important
meeting so I know I've done a couple of
articles on how you can prolong your
battery life but today I thought what I
do is show you some widgets some things
that are built into the operating system
and just some hints and tips on what you
can do to monitor your battery life on
your android phone specifically my nexus
one come on let me show you okay let me
start by saying that i am running
cyanogenmod 5.0 point 6 on a t-mobile
nexus one now that's android 2.1 for
those of you who don't know but most of
what I'm going to show you here is going
to apply to the other versions of
Android out there some of the widgets
may not be available on Android 1.5 they
may function a little bit differently
and some of the screens maybe just a
little bit different than what i'm going
to show you here but in general the
concepts are going to carry across so
the first thing I'd like to show you is
a modification of the stock battery
indicator which you can see on the
lockscreen the nexus one right up here
now with this mod you'll see and let me
come back in here to the main screen
you'll see that it's got fifty four
percent battery life remaining and it
shows me that all the time that's a good
indicator of how long I should expect my
battery to last doesn't tell me in hours
and minutes but I can know hey if it's
been five hours that I've been running
my phone as long as I continue to do the
same sort of stuff I should expect to
see about another five hours of life out
of it which for me is a pretty good day
I'll average anywhere between 8 and 15
hours of battery life on my phone
depending on everything that I do and I
have some tips and tricks that I showed
you in a previous article you can go
back and look for on pocketnow.com but
let's jump right into some other things
first off let's see what's getting this
fifty-four percent
number so I'm going to switch over here
to landscape mode to make things a
little bit easier for you to see and
we'll go into settings once we're in
settings we're going to go to about
phone and you'll notice battery use
right there so we're going to select
that and look and see this tells me that
I've been running for 21 minutes and 35
seconds since I last unplugged that was
on the car dock in my car on the way
home from work you'll notice that this
has a bar chart of how my battery use
has been split up eighty percent of that
has been on display if you don't have
your screen on you're going to get a lot
more life out of your phone you might
not be able to get as much use out of it
from a usability perspective like
surfing the web making phone calls or
whatnot but if that display is off your
notifications are still going to be
coming in your email still be going to
be coming in standby still going to be
there you're going to be able to get and
receive phone calls without any problem
at all so when you're running low on
battery turn off the screen leave it off
as long as you can that's the biggest
drain on this phone number two is the
Android system took six percent cell
standby five percent phone idol three
percent Wi-Fi three percent launcher two
percent so you can see the display is
the energy hog here so this is a really
good place to start and see hey where is
my battery being sucked up what can I do
to find a way to fine tune my usage
maybe a just an app or widget so that
it's not eating the battery quite as
fast here with display really the only
thing i could do is turn the screen off
so let's go in and look at some widgets
now let's go back home now we'll come
back over here to a blank screen that
i've prepared for you what i'm going to
do is show you a couple of widgets one
at a time we'll go into widgets first is
the battery use widget all these widgets
that i'm going to show you today are
free from the android market I'm just go
ahead and search for battery widgets
this one that's pretty much that gives
you a battery with a question mark you
tap on it and it takes you right back to
where we just work that's all it does it
doesn't show you how much battery time
is available how much runtime percentage
nothing that's it long press on it it
doesn't do anything let's just throw
that away next let's go back to another
widget here this is the battery widget
this one I like a little bit better it's
got a little picture of a silo a little
battery look to it kind of nice it shows
me the percentage that I have in the
battery and a little tier two indicator
showing me the various different levels
and you can see the green here is about
halfway down so I've used about half my
battery nice graphical representation of
my battery state not too bad I tap on it
that lets me do a bunch of other stuff
hit display it takes me to my sound and
display settings come back here and do
Wi-Fi on GPS on Bluetooth so it gives
you a to tap interface to be able to
turn off some of your power hungry apps
out there if you will Wi-Fi GPS and
Bluetooth I haven't found much problem
with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but if you've
got some gps program that's just always
on turn your gps off you'll get a lot
more battery life out of it so all in
all not a bad little widget that's about
all it does it looks pretty nice there
aren't any skins you're kind of stuck
with what you see here so let's take a
look at the next one next up is this
widget called battery life tap on that
I've actually gone in and configured
this a little bit by default it's just
got this nice big bubbly battery it
looks more like a beaker full of green
ooze than a battery but it's still kind
of cool it tells me now that I've got
fifty two percent which matches with my
little status bar indicator and it says
that my battery life is good you need
some way to look at it and see am i
doing good am i doing bad am I critical
it's a nice indicator a feel-good word
if you will tell you what your battery
state is in words the customizations
I've done is over here I've
turned on the options to show me the
internal battery temperature the current
millivolts and what type of battery it
is in this case the battery is at 82.4
degrees Celsius it's at 3796 millivolts
and is lithium ion so that's pretty good
go back in here to the settings and we
can show the charging information show
extended info we'll turn that off just
so you can see it and we can also turn
the temperature over to Celsius for
those of you who are not in the United
States of America coming back over here
you can pick colors and all kinds of
stuff to to configure how you want your
battery status to show up here I kind of
like the green so I'm just going to
leave it with that when you turn off
that extended information it does make
that battery a little bit bigger or a
little wider on the screen for you it
still takes up two spots in either
configuration so it's a 1 by 2 widget
does a good job shows you what you need
to know at a glance all around pretty
good widget and for free you really
can't beat it move on to the next one
we're going to skip by all these others
this one is called eoe battery I don't
know what that means very simple widget
in fact you can hardly see it here let
me move it over here to another area
it's kind of transparent which is nice
you can see stuff through it but when
showing you the percentage it's kind of
hard to read they see if I can zoom in
there for you depending on what your
background is hard to tell what that
number is is it too is it 52 is it 32 I
don't know so kind of nice clean thin I
like some of the others better so let's
move on to those go back into widgets
we're going to go back past AoE went
right past that there's a OE I've got my
other widgets in here
and I think this is my last one called
vis battery this battery is a graphical
representation of a battery again
instead of a green goo e liquid on the
inside it's got this kind of yellowy
doesn't come across very well in the
video but it's much more yellow than the
others were green tapping on it only
lets you go directly to the battery info
which shows you some different
information whom what the other screen
would give you now you can get to this
through the operating system as well but
I'm just going to go over it here
because this would does expose this
information a little bit faster than
going all the way through the OS to get
to it shows you the battery state is
discharging the power plug is unplugged
this is good for you to be able to
diagnose if you've got a bad power cord
for example or maybe if you've got a
surge strip that's turned off and you're
not getting any power even though it's
plugged in that's good to tell you
battery level it says is 52 of course
that's percentage the battery scale is
100 I guess that could be changed to a
thousand and then you could have 520 out
of a thousand don't know why they have
that but hey it's good to know the
battery health is good so I'm wondering
if on that other widget if good wasn't
the state of charge but if it was the
battery help itself I don't know how
they get help out of this if there's a
way the battery reports if it's having
problems I've never seen a battery do
that so I'm kind of iffy on if that's a
good measure or not the battery voltage
we can see now here is 3796 millivolts
battery temperature this only shows
Celsius which is why I kind of like that
last widget because it converts it to
Fahrenheit for me at 28 point zero
degrees it is a lithium-ion versus an
ikat or some other battery that I've
never seen any of those in android
phones but it's nice that you can tell
what kind of battery it is and then the
time since boot is two hours 53 minutes
and Counting so let's go back you've
also gotten a OneTouch access to the
display information kind of nice because
from here you can go in and turn it your
see if I can find it turn your
brightness down
I use automatic brightness almost all of
the time it seems to give me a little
bit more battery life but you could come
in and turn that off turn it back on or
even manually adjust it all the way down
to nothing to eat just a little bit more
battery life out all the time because it
won't be automatically turning it
brighter and less bright as as the
environment conditions dictate so kind
of nice no skins for it I haven't seen
any that offer skins but nice little
shortcuts to get into some of the more
deep information about the battery so
that having been said you can see here
I've got lots of other widgets on my
screens sometime in the not-too-distant
future i'm going to do some of those
widgets i'll talk to you about those let
you know why I chose them in hopes that
my decisions might be able to save you a
little frustration download time and
maybe a little bit of money in the
process but back to battery stuff I want
to know about you what do you use than I
didn't cover how do you make sure that
you don't run out of battery life on if
you can show me in a video what you like
about the widgets or maybe there's an
app that you like to use then gets you
specific battery information I would
love to see that go ahead and reply to
this video with a video comment or if
you don't want to go on camera go ahead
and comment right up to me what you like
what you don't like if you know what
that battery status good means and how
that information is achieved and if
you've ever had a battery report
anything other than good i want to know
that too so go ahead and do that spread
this via twitter facebook and of course
go back to our website pocketnow.com and
comment there we love when you
participate the apps this be a little
bit closer to our community and that's
really what pocket now is all about is
building community so for pocketnow.com
and helping you find out how much juice
is left in your Android battery i am
