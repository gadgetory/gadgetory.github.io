for me and this week's guest but more
people were affected by a total outage
at Facebook that affected a few
important social media platforms you
needed only to look at Twitter to see
the outrage even coming from our own
Jaime Rivera regarding the loss of
service and Facebook messenger Instagram
and whatsapp the issue even prompted me
and a few of our friends to move to
different messaging applications this
week I sit down with TK Bey and discuss
how we rely on all of these services and
what we ended up doing when they went
dark and then after the break we talked
about the recent confusion regarding the
Huawei ban and speculate on what the
next smartphone from samsung will bring
to the table in order to keep our show
going we do need the help of great
advertisers and we want to make sure
that those advertisers are ones that you
want to hear about so we need to keep
learning about you to make that possible
help us do so by going to pod survey
comm slash PocketNow and take a quick
anonymous survey that will help us get
to know you better so we can make sure
that we're bringing you advertisers that
are relevant to you and once you've
completed the quick survey you can even
choose to enter for a chance to win a
$100 Amazon gift card terms and
conditions apply head over to pod survey
comm slash pocket now that's p OD su r v
ey dot-com slash pocket now thank you so
much for your help and for listening to
this episode by the way before we
finally do get started I wanted to call
your attention to a couple of questions
later in the show that you should look
out for I invite all of you to answer
them in the comment sections down below
to let your voices be heard and then
next week we will feature some of the
top comments live on the show I feel
like that I should give like a small
explanation this is one of my this is
one of my my fatal flaws when it comes
to YouTube and content like this and all
that I always want to explain when
certain things happen there's two of us
in this episode the reason why is
because okay well in the first reason I
hope Jaime doesn't get mad at me for
saying this but we're all getting old
man I well I just turned 30 and I can I
can already
people already warning me that like
things are gonna start changing and I'm
open to that that's cool you know I'm
alright with that but then I can totally
tell that like jet lag is taking longer
to recover from so that's kind of what
Jaime was kind of going through the
other day Facebook which already in and
of itself is kind of not they're not
really under fire but I know people call
them out for for basically owning so
many different services on the internet
when Facebook goes down so does
everything else and that's exactly what
happened this past week did you did you
get affected by any of that um well
mostly on ID you know and I haven't
really been using facebook left as far
as just you know using the actual
platform but I noticed it and I was
looking for my Instagram stories and my
communication my messages were
refreshing and or if it does refresh he
was refreshing to an earlier time in the
day where I already kind of refreshed so
was like you know Instagram was drunk
for some reason and it's just bringing
up old stories and keep talking about
old stuff and I'm like already check
this what happened yeah this is
happening more and more and that's
alarming right ya know it's it's it's
harder to believe but it's not the first
time I mean YouTube was down at that
long ago he and other services go down
so it's just the way it's everything
centralized and we really need to start
building redundancies into these things
you know if something does go down like
a mainframe goes on jump on the other
one as opposed to just basically left
everything kind of go down and just not
have especially like I said the services
existed independently before Facebook
whatever they did after they took over
they made basically a pretty funnel
through the same path that's the control
that's their level of control I think
that's what where the issue happened I
think that with the outage of Facebook
you made us all rethink how we actually
communicate with people what are all the
messengers are using just how ridiculous
do you think it is that we have so many
and aside from that here's my other
question and next week on the podcast I
am going like we or I am going to try to
call out a few of these comments and
actually respond to them you guys can be
featured on the podcast next week so I
want to make sure we start doing that
more often anyway what happened to
texting like we just don't text anymore
awkward rather send you a message over
on whatsapp just debility because I
don't share more things with it longer
video formats you know there's the big
any encryption part of it well where
text messaging doesn't really have
there's not you know you don't
to get that whole I feel secure on a
text message but whatsapp encrypts on
both sides its Facebook is trying to if
report you know implement these things
and those are things that people are
worried about other people being able to
listen to their communication all right
so we do have some other stories coming
up Assoc a couple of really high-profile
ones coming from two of the companies
that a lot of you guys are really into
but we'll talk about that after the
break
support for the Pagano weekly also comes
from Netgear and their Nighthawk Wi-Fi
six router it gives you ultra fast
speeds and wider coverage throughout
your home it's the biggest revolution in
Wi-Fi ever our own Brandon minimun has
been using the router in his home he has
a tech heavy family and in his house he
has approximately 37 Wi-Fi devices
connected all at one time including
security cameras streaming boxes and a
4k television on top of all of the
laptops phones and tablets he was
recently using the newest router from
Apple for example to keep all of those
devices connected but noticed a
significant increase in Wi-Fi speeds
once switching over to the Netgear
nighthawk Wi-Fi 6 router what they need
a vice he can now go deep into his
backyard while maintaining a strong
Wi-Fi signal it's a serious router for
those needing the best in throughput
latency and distance the devices of
today and tomorrow demand more turn your
Wi-Fi up to 6 with a Nighthawk Wi-Fi 6
router check it out today add net
gear.com slash Wi-Fi 6 that's net gear
dot-com slash Wi-Fi and the number 6 you
know this is this whole thing with
Huawei and again we said this weeks ago
Huawei seems to be the one company that
is so easy to just use as a scapegoat
which sucks
and also Huawei is the company that
keeps being talked about when in general
we should be talking about us-china
trade war instead of just one company
but you know that the headlines are
always gonna talk about halawi in
general China actually it's not just a
trade partner there's a lot more beyond
trade wars so I'm really hoping he
doesn't stretched it throughout the you
know election process which I hope no I
really wasn't even seeing got that and
now that you said it that's probably
what's yeah yeah if you think about
right it's a year right of the year a
little over a year from now and as long
as he plays that it'll always be in the
news
if he closes it right at the time where
people are going to vote that could be
seen as a big move to increase support
yeah it sounds true but I guess that
would be a way for us to dovetail into
the general discussion of what we want
to see from the note
but I'm looking forward to seeing some
new tricks I want to see some new
features they bring into the s-pen other
stuff having the ability of using it
last year from the note 9 to take
pictures with a life saver am i that
enjoys that feature yeah just the
ability of using it even if you're
holding in your hand just using the
aspect that initiated that image is a
lifesaver so then eventually I think
that for with the wide angle because the
white the s10 was what introduced a wide
angle so if the note 10 is gonna have it
also man like that actually makes me
excited
will this unpacked feature another
appearance by the fold which okay to be
fair it is supposed to be out by now
right
it not only it was supposed to be out
but again so there's also reports then
that not only has it been fixed it was
supposed to come out in July yeah
so there were some reports kind of
conflicting and before saying that you
know we were supposed to see it in July
ahead of unpacked but I understand why
the rumors would basically link it to
unpack being that it's only like a few
days into August it would make sense for
them to show it again they'll probably
make it so that you can't peel off the
screen the way that you know some people
did when the first fold review units
went out but that also doesn't mean that
people are not gonna fold it the wrong
way they're not gonna I mean they might
sit on it while it's open battery is
gonna break something like they're going
to be breaks and I think that there's no
way of getting around that so hopefully
Samsung has found a way of at least
mitigating that to a small degree and on
that note we're gonna go ahead and call
it on this one thank you so much for

highlight reel over on the YouTube

questions this week in the comment
