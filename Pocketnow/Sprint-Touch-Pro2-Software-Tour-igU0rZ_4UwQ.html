partner calm and this is a software tour
of the sprint HTC touch pro2 you okay so
the first thing you'll notice we
actually have our touchflo 3d here and
it is a little bit different for the
sprint version so we're just going to go
into some the sliding features here so
we have the main time here and we can go
over and just to our people you can add
people here if we want to add our
favorite so we can go to our mail so
this is where we get our email to our
messages your text messages here
calendar feature a little bit different
colors than the normal touchflo you can
go to the day and select an appointment
so the one to add a new appointment I
can do that but it just goes back to the
standard windows mobile appointment
calendar feature so you just click OK go
back to the Internet and this allows us
to use our push page so that will
automatically update an internet page
that we visit frequently and go to the
camera right here and look at some
photos so just the same touchflo 3d
sliding foot scroll feature that we have
on all the touchflo 3d go to our music
and right here we actually a link to the
sprint music store and that will allow
you to download mp3s directly to your
device but it does cost around a dollar
per songs so the next one we have is our
navigation so if wanted to go somewhere
I can just click drive to and it will
launch the sprint navigation Program and
if I wanted to go to a city you just
could go here and type it or speak it if
you click on speak it it will actually
open the phone dialer and call a phone
number and then you have to talk into
that and it will sink out this it's a
little bit of a hassle so I'm just going
to click type it now search for Seattle
and it will show a it'll actually give
us a link pretty quickly so I don't have
to type in a couple of letters so
Seattle Washington and then click done
it'll give me a little warning about
replaying audio just click click do not
show this again and click done it will
actually give me the map and the one
thing that's a little bit annoying about
this perm is that you have to have an
internet connection to use it
unfortunately that it will not save the
matter
into the device so I'm just going to
click out of this okay so the next tab
right here we have our sprint TV so we
can launch TV if i go to the disney
channel right here i can just load this
let's see and i think they're more of an
on-demand than a a live TV feed it works
pretty good let's see if i turn it it
does recognize the accelerometer so
that's a great feature to have so just
close out this will just go to the
sprint radio so you have many different
channels to choose from but another
thing is that this does cost money so
you do have to pay this is a
subscription-based programs you have to
pay for this every month let's see here
so I wanted to listen to a certain
channel I can do that and it works
pretty good I'm gonna close this now so
the next tab we have of course is the
weather tab and that will should give us
an up-to-date weather information our
area we have stocks and our settings and
one feature about this phone that's a
little bit different than the other
touch pro tues is that it allows for
cdma angie is in so if i click on so
them in the settings tab I can click on
menu and then click phone network mode
and this will allow me to select which
mode of operation i want so i can either
pick cdma only gsm only or global so if
i do clicks gsm only it will try to
register on the network and because the
sim card that is inside it is only a
sprint based sim card it won't actually
work but when i was able to plug in my
AT&amp;amp;T sim card it was able to recognize
the network but for some reason it
wasn't able to get me any signal so
maybe it doesn't work on us networks or
something so i'll just put it back to
global and we'll close out of this so
some other programs on this phone it
does give you an international usage so
it does give you the instructions on how
to use the phone internationally we can
click on Jet Set prayer that's a neat
little feature to have on a phone
because you can print documents directly
from your device through a network
printer or through a Bluetooth printer
so I'm going to close out this and jab
set presenter which will play PowerPoint
presentations you can also make your own
so if wanted to click on menu let's just
click cancel here a menu and then file
and new you can create your
own power point presentation without
having to use the office mobile so we
also have an mp3 trimmer so if want to
make it an mp3 shorter I can do that so
let's say I wanted to make it a ringtone
just move it over to the windows folder
and I can use it as a ringtone so I'll
just close out of this that we have NFL
mobile so give us up-to-date information
on our favorite sports teams and just
flick through and see some latest news
and what people are talking about on the
internet so if you're a football fan
this will be a great feature to have on
this device if not well you still have
it so click OK and go back you also have
a NASCAR mobile and sprint does sponsor
NASCAR pretty abundantly so it would
make sense that they have a program like
this on their devices here we have the
standings for NASCAR and some more news
and as you can see the point standings
and all that great stuff so close out of
this there's a software store that will
actually launch the internet browser and
take you to sprint's website which will
allow you to download software for this
device we have our navigator which we
already saw sprint TV instant messaging
which only allows for a messenger and
yahoo so in close out of that world card
mobile is a pretty neat feature if you
want to take a picture of a business
card so you don't have to actually input
into your device it will transcribe all
the information on the business card
into your contact information so this is
a software tour of the HTC sprint touch
pro2 and make sure you follow us on
