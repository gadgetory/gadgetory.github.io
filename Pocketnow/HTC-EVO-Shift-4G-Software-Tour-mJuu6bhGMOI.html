pakka calm and this is a software tour
of the sprint EVO shift 4g on sprint's
wimax network so let's get started so
this device is running HTC Sense user
interface a top of Android 2.2 so you do
get all that flash enabled web browsing
all the other great features of android
2.2 we go into the applications here we
have adobe reader amazon mp3 app sharing
which allows you to share your
applications with your friends or
colleagues or whoever we have our
calculator our calendar our call history
we have our camcorder and our camera the
camera has some pretty cool features
which is which is pretty different from
other cameras we go into the menu over
here we can change the brightness and
exposure we can change the image
property so it's a contrast saturation
sharpness we can add certain effects and
we can also change the settings so you
can just go back into the applications
we have car panel which allows you to
use your device if you're driving of
course you should probably stop and
change some of these settings before you
continue on driving anything else I make
calls through a bluetooth connection or
wired headset so we can just go back Oh
actually have to menu an exit go back to
the applications we have a clock which
is standard on most HTC and android
devices so you can use a night time
clock and this one also has a timer and
a stopwatch so you can go back we can
view the desk clock which turns your evo
shift into a sort of a desk clock of
course and we can also change some of
the settings down here goes back into
the clock features so we go to Facebook
and we've all seen that this device
actually has the flashlight application
enable on it so if I click on here I can
turn the flashlight on and as you can
see the LED turns into a flashlight
which is pretty cool there's three
separate brightness levels and you can
also change some settings on here get
auto flash and SOS we just go back we
have an FM radio unfortunately this
device does not have headsets included
so you will need to either push your own
head
set or use one from a previous phone or
of course we know is you just use some
headphones and we can just fool we have
footprints with / to geotag of various
photos that you take so if i go here i
can create a new footprint and if I like
I can just snap a picture and then it
will locate my GPS settings and apply
that to the photo so I can share that
with other people we have french stream
which allows you to update multiple
statuses on facebook twitter and other
social networks I don't have it set up
right now we have the gallery so it can
view some photos here and it's a little
bit different on a default Android
luckily HTC has incorporated their sense
user interface on this application as
well so it does make it pretty neat
because you get the reflection on the
bottom and some of the other settings we
have gmail we have google search we have
HTC mobile guide which is pretty much
just a favorites that launches the
internet browser we have internet we
have Amazon Kindle which allows you to
read books on your Android vice we have
google latitude we have any other mail
service we want we have google maps the
market messaging music which is pretty
neat because HTC has also incorporated
their sense user interface into this so
we do get these neat album art
transitions from one album to the next
most carriers these days put a lot of
their own applications onto the phone
luckily sprint hasn't done that too much
they put some of the sprint NASCAR stuff
so you can view all the NASCAR ratings
and all the other great stuff about
NASCAR so we'll just wait for this load
and give you this little blurb about
Jamie McMurray so we can just go back we
have the navigation app for Android we
have the news news and weather we have
peep which is a Twitter application so
we can tweet directly from our device
it'll have that set up yet we have
people which is our contact list so we
can view all of our contacts so we have
places which is tied into google map so
i can view all these restaurants coffee
shops bars and all these other
businesses in my proximity so i can the
full version of quick office is included
unfortunately don't have anything
installed on the SD
are because this is a brand new device I
can search for people so this way I can
quickly search through all my contacts
if I have hundreds of contacts on here i
have settings i have set up a sprint
football live so i can go here and view
all my sports teams information and all
the other information around the
in-country sprint hotspot which allows
you to turn your 4g and 3g enabled
connection into a hotspot so you can use
it on your computer or any other other
smartphone or device like an iPad or
iPod or anything like that we have
sprint TV which is paid for service so I
can watch something live let's say that
I just want to watch something quick and
easy go to Hollywood Hills here and the
video quality is really poor alike even
on a 4G connection right here and as you
can see it's not very clear at all so I
can just go back if sprint zone which is
pretty much just an advertising
application that shows you all the great
deals that sprint has going on at the
time we can view our stocks go to Google
Talk play Teeter TeleNav GPS which is a
paid for navigation program that sprint
has put on this device we have our
videos if you have any video statement
on the storage card voice dialer voice
recorder voice search voicemail so this
allows you to set your voicemail really
easily get weather information and
YouTube so I'm going to test the speed
of the 4G connection that I have going
on right now and it's not the best
service the application said it was fair
so I'm going to hit begin test and wait
for it to load so the speeds are
somewhat adequate not the best speeds
that you can have an afforded connection
of course I am inside and wimax doesn't
work that great through walls so you
probably will get better service if
you're in a car or even outside or even
you're a window i'm not really near
anything right now so this is in the
software tour of the sprint EVO shift 4g
on sprint wimax network if you like our
videos make sure you guys a thumbs up
and also use comments down below we like
to hear you're saying and in case you
missed it you can check out the unboxing
i'll post a link right about here and
you can all
check out the hardware tour and I'll
post a link right about here thanks for
