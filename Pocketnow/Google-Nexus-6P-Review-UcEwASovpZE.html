many people
since the Nexus 1 rolled off the
assembly line nearly six years ago but
whatever else it may have stood for and
whatever other roles it may have
fulfilled the Nexus has always
represented the Android baseline the
showcase for Google's idealized vision
of its mobile platform this year Google
has split its Nexus smartphone offering
into the Huawei made Nexus 6p is the
larger and in charger of the tube
bringing all the power of last year's
Nexus 6 in a slightly less imposing
significantly less expensive package
unlike the veteran LG Huawei has built
few smart phones for the US market and
no Nexus devices period the result is a
fresh take on the concept of a pure
Android handset that while not flawless
is definitely worth your dollars i'm
michael fisher with pocket now and this
is our video review of the google nexus
6p
at a glance the Nexus 6p isn't always
the most distinctive phone around
especially in the graphite color of our
review unit lying on its back with its
large 5.7 inch display switched off its
twin speaker grilles recall its direct
predecessor the Nexus 6
the anodized aluminum chassis summons
memories of the old HTC One m7 or
hallway zone ascend mate s from most
angles it could be almost any phone flip
it over to the back though and things
get a little funky above the oversized
Nexus branding sits a rounded rectangle
spanning the width of the phone a black
Gorilla Glass 4 window that the folks at
Google have nicknamed the visor it
contains the primary camera mounted
oddly off-center within an elliptical
ring accompanied by a dual LED flash the
visor is counterbalanced by a barely
visible access plate at the phone's
bottom a subdued Huawei silk-screened
above the cherry on this special sundae
is a fingerprint scanner contained
within a circular crater it's very fast
and very accurate this all comes
together to produce an aesthetic that's
interesting in an odd way like a small
car with a big spoiler the 6p isn't an
ugly phone necessarily but neither would
we call it particularly attractive
probably the most accurate label is
unique like all phones the Nexus 6p
makes some sacrifices in usability to
accommodate its design while it's quite
thin at 7.3 millimeters it's also tall
and wide with a slippery finish the
result is a pretty awkward slab of metal
fortunately it's also durable we've
dropped it onto a hardwood floor about
five times and the only sign of damage
thus far is a tiny ding in the aluminum
the textured power standby key is easy
to discern from its neighboring volume
button but it's a bit too easy to press
accidentally that button is all you've
got to wait the thing up when it's just
sitting there
Android's ambient display only kicks in
when there's a waiting notification or
when you move the phone even then it's
as slow as molasses to do so
the display itself is quite beautiful
it's a latest generation Samsung AMOLED
panel under that Gorilla Glass for its
quad HD resolution making for 515 pixels
every inch google says it worked
especially hard to tune the displays
gamut and white point for color accuracy
the whites look a little Bluegreen to us
and we could stand for a little more
brightness in direct sunlight but aside
from those minor issues this is indeed
an excellent display we're 5.0 lollipop
was the update that laid the foundations
for a new Android look and feel 6.0
marshmallow is the revision that cements
the good stuff in place while smoothing
over some of the rough patches and
bringing a few tricks of its own easily
the most anticipated update is the new
Google now on tap this feature raised a
lot of eyebrows at the marshmallow
unveiling and for good reason it seems
kind of like magic when it works Google
now on tap is great in a text message
exchange debating dinner and movie
destinations a long press of the HOME
key generated a Google now card for each
restaurant containing Quick Links to
call or navigate and offering an
associated yelp review if there was one
where we mentioned specific timing plans
now on tap also offered a shortcut to
create a calendar appointment while
scrolling through the tourism section of
the page for Shelburne Falls
Massachusetts now on tap generated cards
for all the travel destinations it was
able to plot from the pages text it even
factored in what we were listening to on
Spotify at the moment telling us the
band and song title the problem with
Google now on tap is the same one faced
by many new features it seems like it
was rushed out the door before it was
ready in the Shelburne Falls example now
on tap provided an information card for
one of the movies the site mentioned was
filmed there but offered no card for the
other one a text message asking if we
wanted to see black mass at the
Somerville theater generated a card for
the venue but not the film in one case
and the film not the venue and another
the amount of information that gave us
about that pin back album changed each
time we long pressed sometimes it was
just generic Google search strings and
other times it was genuinely useful
stuff so while you should be excited for
Google now on tap future it
has a long way to go before it becomes
truly useful other upgrades are more
modest but no less welcome app
permissions are a big one in marshmallow
you green light access to your phone
features on a case-by-case basis
so the first time you run Evernote for
example the app asks permission to
access your location so it can create a
note title based on where you are now if
like us you just plain don't want a memo
taking app to know your location you can
deny Evernote that specific permission
it's other functions will be unaffected
the hated lollipop notification scheme
is gone too replaced by a more
straightforward trio of sliders with the
global do-not-disturb option move to a
toggle in the notification shade and the
standard Google now view not on tap just
Google now has gotten a denser layout
that packs more information into a
smaller space like the new 5x5 icon
arrangement on the homescreen it's great
it's about time modern platforms started
actually leveraging the power of today's
high-resolution displays Nexus devices
have long been somewhat lacking in the
camera department shortcoming google is
keen to address in this generation that
starts with the new twelve point three
megapixel sensor which google says sony
designed for camcorders and
point-and-shoot cameras rather than
smartphones the Google camera viewfinder
has also been redesigned it's now much
easier to get focus especially with one
hand and Google has built in a new
launch shortcut as well you double click
the power standby button to fire up the
camera whether the screen is on or off
it occasionally fails to open the camera
on the first attempt which is annoying
but it's a good shortcut it's much more
straightforward than the lock screen
swipe action though that is still here
if you've gotten used to it and if you
want it we're not going to talk your ear
off about the specifics of the picture
quality and if you want a longer look at
any of these check out our full review
of the 6p at pocketnow.com we'll just
say that this camera does really well in
a very wide range of lighting conditions
yes some shots are noisy and yeah
sometimes we miss the higher resolution
shooters that are becoming more
commonplace on high-end devices but on
the whole both front and back cameras
here are Swift they're reliable and
they're better than not just anything
we've seen on a nexus before well that
is true
they're better than a whole lot of
Android cameras out there we're very
happy with these optics and we think
most people will be too
oh don't eat that don't don't eat so
much grass that's correct the Nexus 6p
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
SOC that's that processor that got such
a bad rap for its thermal throttling
problems earlier this year but you'd
never know it Android 6.0 runs almost
flawlessly on the Nexus 6p with slick
animations and buttery responsiveness
it's too early to tell how well
marshmallow will age of course but this
hardware packs enough CPU power and
high-speed RAM to give it at least some
room to grow the 6p also offers plenty
of power in the literal sense under its
aluminum casings it's a very large
battery which makes the phone good for a
solid day of moderate to even heavy use
on a particularly taxing day we put the
phone through one and a half hours of
social media and email usage before
pressing it into service as a mobile
hotspot for six straight hours by our
eight the phone was still at 30% that's
a pretty solid reservoir and if your
phone spends much of its time in standby
mode you'll really see the benefits of
Android marshmallows new dough's and app
standby enhancements this phone barely
sips power in standby it's quick to
recharge to the Nexus 6p comes with the
new USB type-c charging port and cable
whose anyway you want it that's the way
you plug it connector makes up for the
inconvenience of buying all new cables
and chargers starting from a dead pack
the Nexus P hit the 25% mark in 15
minutes and a church to full in about an
hour and a half the Nexus 6p offers band
support for all the major US carriers
and we tested it on two of them at the
same time with Google's Project phi5
switches between Sprint and t-mobile us
based on which network has the best
reception at a given time and service
was solid over six days in our densely
populated test area of Greater Boston
calls were clear on the earpiece though
it's a shame smart phone still can't
leverage two speakers for speaker phone
calls when the Nexus 6p is allowed to
use both of its speakers like during
media playback and gaming the sound is
very loud and very good within striking
distance of the excellent Moto X pure
edition
the Nexus 6p starts at $4.99 for the
entry-level 32 gig model with 64 and 128
gig options taking it up to 549 and 649
respectively
well more expensive than its LG maid
sibling this represents a significant
drop from last year's Nexus 6 so is it
worth it definitely there are
shortcomings here as with any phone some
of marshmellows new features aren't
quite ready for primetime there are some
missed opportunities to take full
advantage of the screen size and the
slippery casing is a real drop hazard
but the Nexus 6p really nails the
fundamentals it's got a great display a
really good camera solid battery life
and beautiful smooth software backed up
by a vibrant ecosystem guaranteed to get
timely updates best of all you still
don't have to break the bank to own one
the Nexus 6p might not be the most
beautiful Nexus that's ever existed but
it is without question the best there's
a lot to that's found folks and there
are things we just couldn't fit into
