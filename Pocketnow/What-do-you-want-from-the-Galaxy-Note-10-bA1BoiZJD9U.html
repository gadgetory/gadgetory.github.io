PocketNow weekly brought to you by
pocket now and next day developers I'm
doing a bit of a different intro for
this one because we heard you we know
that a lot of you out there are wanting
to have the full podcast here on YouTube
and that's exactly what we're going to
start doing again we wanted to try
something a little bit different because
honestly we want to get the podcast in
front of more people who want to get in
front of your eyes here on YouTube we
want to get it into more ears using
podcast applications we want more people
to be listening or watching the podcast
so it's with that in mind that on top of
the question of the week that I do pose
later in the show I do want to ask all
of you what kind of things do you want
to see out of the podcast and for all of
you out there who wanted to have the
podcast back on the YouTube platform the
full podcast why don't you guys go ahead
and share the podcast with everybody
that you possibly can that way we can
get more people to this podcast and we
can continue making it every single week
and for anybody new that is watching
this for the first time welcome to the
PocketNow channel and make sure you
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already dropped some likes on all of the
videos and don't forget to get into the
comment sections especially to answer
the question of the week so you might be
featured on next week's full episode
found here and also on podcasting apps
this week I am joined by Jaime Rivera as
we talked about a few different topics
at the beginning of the show and then
get into some of your comments and then
the last half of the show is all about
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 well it's the
the podcast is not without its little
quirks every single week again it's a
two-person podcast last week we had TK
on but now it's gonna be me and of
course Pagano daily efficient out of
himself hi mater Vetta
mr. perfect Internet yes hi how are you
I'm also back to like a full on mic
right here because I'm trying to do this
is like the this is like the markiplier
set up right here any YouTube people out
there who watch markiplier right a ser
actually but I decided to try my G type
my G track Pro which is literally my
favorite microphone it's hilarious but
the TSA broke into my bag and forgot to
put my lock back just because they
wanted to figure out what this was
well nothing bad happened right even if
they didn't put the lock back oh thank
god no it's like everything's here I
think like all my socks were accounted
for
my underwear was sadly account
well the Jeep track that's a Logitech
right so it's like notice this is a
Samson Samson is a music more music
company
well that messes up my segue but because
I thought it was a Logitech one I was
gonna be like oh that's a gaming mic
let's talk gaming but that's that's our
first story for today is a little bit of
gaming news um I think a lot of people
are still reeling from the announcement
from Nintendo not of the Nintendo switch
pro but of the switch light bit of a
swerve from Nintendo there there is a
high me switch - I hear it's at home in
its dock alright so we are probably
actually it's kind of fitting because
since it's the two of us on the podcast
we are the switch players
I don't think Brendan really does switch
a whole lot I don't think Brandon has a
life now yeah so you have always been a
fan of the switch enjoying you bringing
it on trips I have actually gotten away
from bringing it on trips but I
personally think the switch light might
make me bring it on trips well is it so
is it just me did you notice that it's
smaller than the switch mm-hmm it's a
flat point five inch screen I think
because that is one reason why I would
buy it
mmm exactly quite but the biggest
question I guess I have a lot of like I
have a lot of questions that Nintendo
hasn't really answered like if I already
bought games for it and these are all
digital games will I be able to port
them to my other console and play them
in my separate switches this question
one that is a really good question I was
thinking that the entire time that that
video was showing and it you know what
it looks a lot of fun to play because
the hardware is probably really good and
you're right it's small it's easy to use
it's something you could just pop in and
out of a bag I completely agree with
that but yeah we're all digital gamers I
don't know and I think quick shout out
to David Emmel will have him on pretty
soon but he and I were talking about it
for a while and he was like so there's
no kickstand does that mean there's no
expandable storage that is a good
question like I don't know like there
are a lot of questions over like I did a
full version of the pocket out daily I
actually had to read that segment
because there was so much information on
this
product and yet so many questions left
over like I had to clarify to people
this is what you need to understand
about the Nintendo switch light number
one why is Nintendo calling it a switch
I understand that it plays switch games
but it doesn't have the functionality of
the switch
you can't dock it to your TV you can't
replace the joy conjugant and joy cons
to it but then that's a separate
purchase and so I've been debating the
whole concept of actually wanting to use
this product if I already like why would
I ever buy that if it's only a hundred
dollars cheaper than the switch yeah
exactly
and I I think I think I'm right there
with you and I tweeted out about this
and a few people agreed with me that the
price at $1.99 only really makes sense
on Black Friday when it goes down to
like 179 149 but the other thing that
they're gonna do a Nintendo inevitably
does this is the switch light will
probably go on sale in a bundle of it in
another game and that makes it make
sense that's why yeah but this this is
the thing like think about I remember
when I unbox the original switch the
first time I was like men you get a lot
of stuff for $2.99
like you get the dark you get that like
pad to be able to snap your controllers
on you get the snap ons for your joy
constant go separate you get the USB see
like you get a lot of like you even get
an HDMI cable I don't think you get that
with a Playstation yeah I don't remember
actually it's been so long what the ps1
yeah yeah but so that's the thing like
you get a lot of stuff and so if you
think about if you were to separate the
price like think about it the dock alone
is $100 the joy Khans alone or 70 bucks
just any other accessory is 30 $40 like
how much are you really paying for the
switch alone yeah that's true I wonder
it's probably gonna have a USBC cord
that's it
so yeah so this is the thing I feel that
the switch light is too expensive for
what you're getting mm-hmm this is me I
think that it's too expensive
for a portable console like if Nintendo
would have priced this at 149 oh my god
that would have been that would have
been like a sleeper hit cuz I would have
had no problem I would have had no
problem in like buying that for each of
my kids and being like this is all you
get you don't get to dock that thing and
you know what I like I noticed that my
usage of the switch is very different to
my ten-year-old son I only play the
switch docked for me I love the comfort
of the pro controller like the pro
controller is everything for me and like
the experience of playing Odyssey for
example I love this whole idea of using
the control for motion gestures and
stuff like that where like this switch
the switch like doesn't bring motion it
doesn't bring motion at all like you
know these are like the controls don't
vibrate there's no IR detection and so
if you want to play with with any of
those kinds of games you need to buy
separate joy Khan's yeah that's true or
just the pro controller or the
programmer yeah yeah and then you're
putting us a 5.5 inch screen you know
yeah I mean even it's smaller than your
standard smartphone mm-hmm whereas makes
me wonder like stray that's true 5.5 and
little standard switches 7 inches so
that thing is not really that big mm-hmm
yeah it's small looks big it looks big
in that video though which means that
that Japanese guy is small yeah exactly
well he put it he brought it out of a
breast pocket which I was like oh okay
okay I see you I see you right now
all right so but that's the thing like
there's a there was a note that I was
making here and also I won one David
Emmel and I were talking about it we
were like oh they're all these things
about it that we don't like doesn't dock
we don't know if there's expandable
storage we don't know how it's gonna
work with this or that it's not really a
switch because of that but that doesn't
mean we're not gonna buy it still that's
how much we hate ourselves is that we're
still we're still gonna buy it I will I
want that yellow one but here's the
thing I think that Nintendo probably
missed out on certain design elements
like for example if they actually made a
you know a switch that's you know more
portable more compact I would have loved
the the joysticks to have been a
different design do you remember the
the P what was it the Sony Xperia Play
you remember that sort of like
capacitive d-pads that it had mm-hmm
give they like if they would have made
that switch light to be like a flush
controller and then the these buttons
over here if they would have figured out
a way to place them in a different way
and make it just the flesh switch on the
front on the back that you could
actually put like in your back pocket
that would have been awesome yeah I
agree with that and it but the thing is
again the whole size of it the the 5.5
inch screen and all that stuff it's so
close to a smartphone and also Nintendo
has been diving into the mobile game
space I don't know if you tried dr.
Mario yet I came out on Android yeah I
mean who knows maybe one of these days
we'll get something that is literally
that small can you imagine like a like a
like a like a pixel 3a with some
controllers on the sides like that's
like the deal of it I would love it like
I would love I wouldn't even mind a
product that's like the Galaxy Note hmm
you know with with joy cons it's just
the problem is like right now
my biggest problem with carrying the
switch with me is I can't carry it on my
on my backpack for example because the
because of the sticks and the way that
the that left and the right buttons in
the front are designed you need to be
carrying it in a case if not it's you
know because it's a plastic screen and
everything you don't want it to get
scratched and so like I can't carry it
on my backpack and so this thing is
bulky it's not a small product yeah it's
it it is still portable but you're right
it's not it's not the sleekest thing no
it's not all right so we do have one
other headline that I wanted us to cover
on the show so Apple is back in the news
and after all of the hubbub over the
iPhone 10 the iPhone 10's all of the
current generation phones doing away
with the home button and thus doing away
with touch ID it looks like we're going
in the exact opposite direction now
because there are some reports stating
that not only will face ID go away it's
because that notch and all of the tech
that was in that notch that made it
special is going to go away and now
there's going to be a in display for
reader which will make Touch idea
returned apparently so according
according to the the news that we
covered yesterday this was actually Meng
Zhi Kuo it's a prediction from Ming Chu
quo and he always gets stuff right so
apparently this year all iPhones are
gonna have notches in face ID all
iPhones next year apparently there will
be two models with face ID but it would
be a smaller notch and then there would
be the flagship new unique device which
so these are they're kind of polarizing
rumors because before the rumors were
that there's gonna be a special iPhone
for China that would only have touch ID
in order to make it less expensive and
so but now we've got Meng Zhi Kuo saying
that know that this device is gonna be
like the know like that launch of the
iPhone 10 where we had the iPhone 8 may
plus but then we had the 10 which was
like the new more expensive flagship so
apparently this device is going to bring
in all the split it's not just an on
display it's an all display fingerprint
scanner you could place your finger
anywhere and roll all that expensive
though that's my first reaction to that
so apparently this is one of the major
reasons why we're getting rid of 3d
touch because 3d touch is a separate
module within the display that makes it
makes it thicker and so apparently to be
able to accommodate for this they're
gonna need to get rid of 3d touch so
it's a couple of things that Apple is
getting rid of to be able to accommodate
this fingerprint scanner I just feel
like that's that's one well there might
be a couple of other functions to
something that is across the entire
screen but I just feel like 3d touch
would ultimately be more useful in more
situations than just a fingerprint
scanner so I mean is that a trade I
never use 3d touch dude ever I kind of
liked it like 3d touch out is only
useful for me when I want to launch like
the camera from here and I just press
the button that is the only reason or
the flashlight these are the only
reasons why I use this thing and then
other than that like I because so my
biggest problem with 3d touch and this
is what I've always said is that the
context menus are different like if
Spotify has different controls than
whatsapp then and obviously these are
different apps they have
and functionality but I feel that a lot
of these shortcuts should not be left to
the developer because it's so
unpredictable and then with every
software update you get new functions or
things get swapped around and so for me
I have a problem like every time that
Spotify changes its design I get so
pissed because I'm like crap like where
do I find my albums now and so that's
the same mentality with 3d touch where
if I use Google Calendar there are
certain controls but then if I use
another there are others and then there
are apps that have no 3d touch command
so it's just like share the app which is
like that's the stupidest thing you
could ever add to the function and and
you know I don't feel that people really
care about it or the peak and the pop
I'm like whatever you know yeah I agree
but I just don't think it has any the
fuse I don't even use it on the Magic
Trackpad like like the push to extra no
I just two buttons two fingers and
that's it I never use the press and hold
ever mmm
fair enough and I guess I guess when I
think about the Android side of things
it's almost as if they were like if you
go on to any application on Android
right now you just have to tap and hold
there's no 3d touch involved you get the
same context menu yeah and depending and
depending on the phone you get you get
like there's literally all you need is a
context menu not a context menu for a
context menu and so it's it's one of
those things where it's like I'm not
gonna miss 3d touch I will miss face ID
during the winner mmm no yeah when I
when I just I don't I can't be taking my
finger out from my gloves in New York
City when it's like really cold just to
be a what are they my phone what about
that magical thing that they I have to
admit it's one of those features that
actually enjoy on an iPhone is when you
bring up the phone and when it
recognizes your face all of the info and
the notifications comes down and I was
like oh that's kind of good kind of like
that that's the coolest thing about iOS
titude which the only OEM that
replicates that on android is wall way
only wall way has it but you have to dig
into settings to pull it out mmm that's
fair I do think so if there are gonna be
a couple of other phones that still have
face ID I guess that's cool does face ID
actually require all of that tech in
there why not just
use the front-facing camera that is
already there anyway that's the question
because it is so it's just like the
galaxy s 10 plus with its like
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner where
it's it's like a 3d map like Apple this
is like literally that ultrasonic
fingerprint scanner is just like face ID
but designed for fingerprint unlocking
and so it creates a 3d map of your face
and so you need a dot projector to be
able to create the 3d map and so the dot
projector is what notices that it's a
person and not a photo and so that dot
and so for you it's the dot projector
plus you need an IR camera to be able to
have face ID work during the night and
so this is the reason why so it's not
that you need all that technology for it
to work it's just for it to be secure
and that complete and for it to work
every single time in the darkest
conditions like have you noticed that
like it could be pitch dark and you can
take out your iPhone and then it'll
unlock where it's not the same case with
face to unlock on any other phone the
only other phone
the only other phone that has that is
the galaxy note NR galaxy s 9 plus with
its infrared camera but again it's an
infrared camera using the iris scanner
so it's you can't so it's two cameras
it's one that creates the infrared
camera is the one that creates like the
you know that aspect of black-and-white
and that makes it work at night and
whatever and then the other one is
picking up your iris and so you either
need an iris scanner or you need that
whole ensemble that Apple came up with
the knotch okay I guess I'm just
thinking of the end-user result like is
all of that tech needed to create that
that that effect of the notifications
expanding oh well and here's the thing
about Android in the case of Huawei it's
only if you activate the facial
recognition that that works like it's
only if you because in the other case if
you used the fingerprint scanner on the
display it'll immediately just unlock
the phone and that's it
but it's only I've showed wait a second
there's another Oh am i think it's LG LG
with the g8 because they've got that
zyy camera the g8 yet the g8 is another
phone because it has it's like if
Android is limited to only if you give
me like a really secure way to unlock
through facial recognition
well I allow you to show notifications
after your face is seen and so I think
those are the only two phones that have
that okay there yeah so it's all looking
for that yep but then you grab the p30
Pro which doesn't have the ensemble face
ID thingy and that one works just like
the main 20 Pro so that's the reason I
was like yeah it could it could not be
you don't know so many different bits
and pieces for so many different choices
when it comes to this kind of stuff
speaking of too many choices as promised
I did say that in our highlight reel
from last week I was going to respond or
we were going to respond or just react
to a few top comments from that show so
we're gonna go in and do that right now
in this segment leading into our mid
break so there were a few things that I
wanted to respond to because one of the
main stories that Tiki and I talked
about last week was Facebook and
Instagram and whatsapp thus going down
and we actually had that problem like
happen again yesterday when was
yesterday yeah it was yesterday
at the time of recording this podcast
when Twitter went down so the whole joke
yesterday was Twitter's down the whole
joke was Twitter's down go to Instagram
to say it because that was what was
happening the other way around was
Instagram was down so they went to
Twitter to tell people I'll tell you
I'll tell you this much
wait you have a comment sorry read it
and then I'll tell you something there
were a few people it was basically I'm
not going to name off it cuz since I'm
since there's a group of people that are
all saying the same thing so pretty much
saying that I guess the term I'm gonna
use is good riddance like you know
because social media is such a crazy
thing now that some people are saying oh
it went down it should have stayed down
okay that's my comment okay there you go
we weren't in Japan right now and I
guess I had never I guess I had never
come to the realization that I notice
everybody like I had never been in a
train so silent as the subways in Japan
as the metro system in the
but the interesting part is every single
time that for some reason somebody was
close to me and I noticed what people
were doing with their phones because a
hundred percent of the people were on
their phones and the hundred percent of
the people were on Instagram no I had
not noticed I had not noticed that
Instagram was such a phenomenon like and
so it kind of worries me like it does
worry me it's it's like people are not
there but they're in this like what is
Instagram it's like this over glorified
beauty you know beautiful photos and
people posting their stories but then
these are people you know I thought that
people were like working or reading
email or doing different things you're
communicating with somebody no everybody
was on Instagram just doing this
scrolling scrolling photos scrolling
photos a hundred percent of the people
and that kind of worries me and dude
that that's like a very boring society
in a way yeah I mean it's it's it's they
use the term info snacking its content
snacking if a photo or a 15-second IG
story so easy to go through so so
incessantly every single day I mean we
were I made the comment last week that
one of the toxic things I do is I wake
up in the morning and the first thing I
do is open Instagram half the time dude
dude yeah right now I open the YouTube
studio laughs oh what time but it's one
of the it's one of those things where
I've made it a habit to turn off my
phone at night now yeah like I saw that
and I was like no man like I remember so
one of the I was I was in Kyoto I people
you know obviously people are there
during their touristy thing and it was
all about taking a photo of myself to
post on the gram and I was like man
that's so boring like this place is so
much more than just what you share on
social media oh hundred percent a
hundred percent which is why whenever we
travel and you saw how I was with it
it's all about the food
like yeah the sites are great and all
that but it makes you feel like you need
to take a picture of it to send it
somewhere I'd rather experience
something that's more for just me and no
one can eat the food that I'm eating
dude I had like obviously if you're in
Japan you'll have the best ramen in the
world but I have to take you to a
specific place in Kyoto for the best
ramen I've ever had nice we would
definitely do that okay so a couple of
comments here ace Lucero though this was
this was the question that I posed to
everybody what the hell happened to
texting a salut Sarah right here says
use SMS problem solved
do you text a lot still like do you
actually text whatsapp on whatsapp yeah
but I'm talking like the one tied to
your phone like your number actual SMS
messaging oh dude it's the the here's
the problem the problem is called us
carriers and Honduran carriers and
carriers everywhere one of the biggest
problems I think that people have become
irritated with SMS because it's full of
spam oh yeah I literally get a lot of
that - yeah dude so there's this company
that reached out to me recently about a
new ad system that they have and they
and they the guy dude the guy even
called me on the phone like the sales
guy with this like app like ad based
service where it's using push
notifications to send me ad to send
people advertisement and I was like I'm
sorry dude please stop contacting me I
don't want to use your product I don't
want to spam users with the new video
that we just posted and they dude people
are I get overwhelmed like and there is
nothing that I've realized that there is
nothing more overwhelming for me about
notifications than using Android and you
want to know why because these are not
chronologically ordered one of the
things that I like about using an iPhone
and this is gonna sound stupid and I'm
gonna get back to SMS in a sec is that
the most recent notification is going to
be at the top and so I literally just
look at it I see what the most recent
one and I just decide right there it's
important or it's not important but
Android forces you to interact with
product because it makes sms's always be
at the top and then it's telegram and I
have looked everywhere for a way to
stack my notifications chronologically I
just want to know what the most recent
one was but no with Android you
immediately you get this stupid block
and then it's all small little icons and
it's always gonna be SMS at the top so I
always have spam messages at the top and
it just irritates me because sms's are
not more important to me that's a good
point because Google Voice for me is the
top most thing and I noticed and I think
about it it always yeah it it's always
at the top and I just Android I really
want you to cater to me not to whatever
you want and so it forces me to drop
down all the notifications and slide
down and then it's funny cuz the other
day somebody I think it was in the
podcast and the comments was like your
notifications quarter I'm like no I
don't react to notifications I am NOT a
reactive person I have things to do and
so notification Android you kind of need
a SmartWatch if you want things to be
chronological you kind of need to you'd
be using where OS if you want things to
be stacked in order mmm
fair but back to SMS messages when's the
last time you actually you like actively
did use it no because I've become soured
by it I've become soured by it and also
there's so much more functionality and
services like whatsapp if I want to tell
somebody where I am
I just pin my location and send it if I
want to send the photo I can send it if
I want to reply like if it's
walkie-talkie and we're in like a trade
show and I want to send something quick
and I I'm carrying like a backpack full
of gear and I'm or I'm dragging my stuff
I can simply just respond with a voice
message and it's immediate and so SMS is
just so obsolete for me it's extremely
obsolete yeah that's that's a fair point
let me see here there were a couple of
other ones and you know what it's funny
since I mentioned on the podcast last
week that we have a few people that we
have converted over to telegram and
we've been using telegram since then
yeah there are a few people in the
comment sections that agree for example
Ibrahim Azhar done telegram is for all
of the reasons that you said is better
many functions and privacy on another
level I don't know I'm not too sure
about the privacy part yet but I will
admit it's not it's not tied to Facebook
though so that's good so the beautiful
thing about telegram that very few
people know is you can create secret
chats and you can have your messaging
expire oh I didn't know that yeah and so
if there's a specific conversation that
you don't want people to use on the
record you know or something like that
or is something that you just don't want
to be repeated you can literally create
a secret chat and you can define how
long those messages are gonna be in the
feet or these can be deleted and so for
me
tell up for me telegram is about the
functionality of like I hate WeChat
I hate WeChat because it's locked to
just one phone I hate whatsapp because
it's locked to just one foot and I know
that the average human doesn't have my
problem they don't have to be swapping
phones every week that's why but in my
reality I need a messaging service that
works everywhere but it's also secured
so what I like is that if I start a
secret conversation like what's a
telegram is epic knocks like it works
everywhere it works on your iPad it
works on your computer and like
notifications are like really good my
problem with whatsapp is like sometimes
I get notifications on whatsapp
immediately if I'm using an iPhone but
if I'm using an Android phone sometimes
these are my five minutes later like
their notification server is terrible
whereas on telegram it's like immediate
it's really good like I will notice both
like vibrate at the same time or stuff
like that that's good but then the other
thing about telegram is if I start a
secret conversation on phone one and I
have my computer and my this and my that
active even with telegram those products
will not be in the conversation it will
only be in the device that I started the
secret conversation with oh okay that
makes sense and that's pretty good I
like that yeah you mentioned you
mentioned WeChat actually there's one
other person here will will will Newcomb
WeChat here in China it's all things to
all people but in a good way
not just payments and shops transfers to
friends but also paying your small cash
to street vendors yeah yes it's Chinese
and there are risks but you don't get
Facebook Amazon and goo
which have risks and like we've seen
they've gone down so there are there are
those arguments in both situations but
this is what I find interesting about
this comment is it's the opposite
direction where we use so many different
messaging apps for so many different
reasons meanwhile in China there's one
it's only one for all things yeah
there's one app that replaces Facebook
it replaces Instagram it replaces
everything it's fascinating for me the
WeChat effect is fascinating because I
don't even find the app to be optimized
for other things
yeah it just happens to be the only
place where you can do those things yeah
yeah I know I think that Tencent like
really killed it with that service and
it's it's fascinating WeChat is it's
just for me the problem with WeChat dude
like dude I wrote you the other day I'm
like I'm sorry I was about to curse I
was like my god I I was finally able to
unlock my WeChat after like 2 years
because the last time that I used it was
in my Nexus 6p and so that they wanted
to force me to activate the Nexus 6p to
be able to use and in the phone doesn't
turn on anymore mm-hmm it doesn't way it
doesn't turn on anymore that's that's
weird like I don't know what happened to
it it probably didn't like being stuck
in a drawer and it got pissed that I got
one more comment I just wanted to add
one less layers of this whole discussion
mic may I hope I don't know if that's
actually your last name and that's kind
of funny Mike may MBH now I'm using line
and viber the reason I wanted to bring
this one up is because one interesting
phenomena I noticed about messaging
applications that we just bought of
WeChat is that often their geographical
so yeah line and viber nice night it's
Japan it's Japan yeah yeah exactly
what's one in your neck of the woods
that's what's that here here what's
happens everything dude like your
whatsapp it's funny but companies it's
like WeChat to a certain degree but but
there's no payment and that's literally
all that whatsapp is missing like
literally I wake up in the morning and
the first thing that I do is I text my
coffee shop and I make my order from the
text message oh that's such a great idea
and so and so and so usually usually
there are services like the airline like
there's an airline that I that I use a
lot here and so I will I can text them
that I want a plane ticket from point A
to point B and they will respond to me
with their bank account number and then
from my phone I just make a bank
transfer to their account and pay for my
plane ticket that way and then they send
me a receipt that I just paid for my
plane ticket okay makes it so yeah we
chat is more practical but literally
Hondurans use whatsapp like Chinese
people use WeChat it just needs the
payment functionality that's all it's
missing and you know why is trying to do
that I mean they're even trying to put
out their cryptocurrency and it's all
gonna hopefully be in one place but then
again that goes back to the same issue
that TK were talking about last week
like if Facebook creates a messenger or
their messenger or a service that has
all of these functions and then it goes
down what are you gonna do right so well
we can actually be regular humans and
use cash and like dude like right now my
whole car so here's the thing I didn't
remember the last time I had ever been
to an ATM until right now that we were
in Japan because like hearing on dudas I
could literally pay for anything with a
debit card or a credit card
whereas in Japan it's like the other way
around it's a cash country I was shocked
there's a little refreshing to what you
say well but my biggest problem is like
if the problem is the currency if the
currency like there are a lot of coins
and for me it's annoying to carry coins
that is true that wasn't annoyance for
sure that was a horrible anoints like
I've got a ton of Japanese coins that I
couldn't get rid of oh yeah because he
can't exchange metal like you can only
exactly and so and so I found myself
sometimes buying like ice cream or stuff
like that just to get rid of coins oh my
goodness I just remember - I still have
did you still keep your was it the pasmo
card I do but I I do but I I well you
why you return it you can
but if you plan on coming back you know
you might as well just keep it but I'm
totally further back yeah so for a
one-time tourist let's call them they go
they buy the the suite go or the pasmo
card put money on it and then if you
really feel like you're not gonna use it
ever again you can return it and get the
money that's in it back interesting yeah
so it's interesting little tidbit for
and I feel like 300 yen it wasn't really
much yeah it wasn't too bad all right
cool
so with all of that so thank you so much
for commenting and I do have one
question I want to put out to everybody

coming back from the break we do have a
great event coming up a couple of things
coming up but obviously everyone's gonna
be talking about Samsung unpacked it's
happening in New York
August 7th we're all going to be there
it's gonna be really fun and we're all
really looking forward to what the next
note is I think that's kind of a given
every single year
however because unpacked was announced
leaks are just everywhere right now and
it feels like I always have the same
issue like you know to do I look at it
and not
be pleasantly surprised when I'm at the
show or do I just know everything about
it leading up to the actual like
official events so on the fence about
that but we are a new show in a way so
we are looking at a couple of the leaks
first quick question though I think it's
an easy question
are you excited about the no 10 dude I
am like I totally am like that thing
looks sleek it looks nice it looks like
a p30 approach what I like the most
there are a few aspects we're gonna get
into about that yeah but like every year
we're excited for the note and it's it's
it is a cool thing the s10 made a bit of
a splash in a few different ways and
we're excited to see what the note 10
brings I mean Samsung still has that
that that public hype is on that hype
it's it's nice every single year like
I'm currently by the way I'm currently
working on the after the buzz for the
note 9 I'm actually working on - after
the buzzes right now note 9 in pixel 3 I
just don't know which one's gonna air
first because the process of after the
buzz is a little different to the way we
review products where you know I'm
actually more exhaustive about what I do
with a product during and after the buzz
because it's all about aging it's all
about how it performs after and so the
more I use the note 9 the more I miss my
S 10 plus know why and this is the first
time this has ever happened usually like
for example then between the no date and
the s 9 plus or was it known 8 an essay
yeah it was no date an S 8 I preferred
the note 8 between the note 9 and the s
9 I preferred the note 9 but then when
the s 10 came out dude it's just that
jump that they did to triple cameras
that jump that they did to do - have you
noticed just how just grow go grab an S
10 plus and compare to a note 9
size-wise and heft wise like I don't
know what Samsung did on the internal
chassis of the S 10 plus but it's
lighter than a ton of phones and so like
the other day for example I grabbed out
of the
Lu the pixel to excel do yourself a
favor go grab a pixel to excel in
compared to any other phone it was so
light and so it was a big phone but it
was light and so that's how I feel about
the sm+ it feels almost so really large
and so Wow shifting back to the S to the
note 9 man this thing is heavy and so
you know I can't wait for Samsung to
apply all that engineering into the note
10 and to actually have an s10 with
extra functionality so we have we have a
render of the note end that came out
allegedly a while people are saying it's
the official render so we are actually
getting a real look at this phone
obviously s-pen the infinity Oh display
has it in the center now quick hot take
on that yeah I I noticed though that the
note 10 only has that one camera though
while the S 10 + 2 cameras so what are
your takes on that like is that going to
be did you ever use the secondary camera
I mean like like here's the thing are
the are the selfie portraits on the s10
plus great they're not bad they were not
great there are no pixel shots these are
not pixel shots and so if you can't give
me that then I'd rather you just give me
one camera mm-hmm how about its location
like it's cuz it's straight up in the
middle like right there i / you know
what i find so funny about it though
it's so close to the top edge of the
phone that I'm like why not just you
coulda just made a teardrop at that
point you know what I mean yeah I get it
I get it
it's just I think it looks cool alright
you know and I wasn't bothered by by the
by the notch I by sorry by the Infinity
oh and like I really like the wallpapers
anyways I like it on the center it's a
way to differentiate the phone here's
the thing though they go into any bongs
Instagram right now and notice the photo
that he just posted where he's comparing
the footprint of the note n compared to
the note 9 in the node 8 and hopefully
you can post that as an overlay to the
video yeah but dude like that note 10
look small and I like it what do you buy
small though because in the renders I
keep thinking this is gonna be light at
it look at it alright I feel is so so
what Samsung is doing yeah but don't the
thing about it is forget about the
render and look at the comparison
between the note 9 and that than that
note 10 okay like that phone is gonna be
significantly smaller like it's
literally at least half an inch smaller
from the top than the note 9 once you
kill the bezel so what they've done is
in what they've done is instead of think
about it and I like that idea usually
the biggest problem with Samsung is that
whole idea of we need bigger screen
bigger screen six point nine seven inch
we need something crazy and for the note
10 what they're doing is like you know
what we're gonna kill the bezels but
we're not gonna take advantage of that
extra space and give you more screen you
know what now let's just make a smaller
note mm-hm
yeah cuz it's less about having a bigger
screen in just the fact that it's all
screen I feel like yes to think yes I
don't need a bigger note I don't need
more screen I just I need a product that
doesn't feel like a tank in my pocket
and also gives me that functionality
yeah I do see no bear in mind there's
pretty nice bear in mind I think that
this is the no 10 Pro sorry I think that
this is the standard no 10 which is only
a half three cameras and then the no 10
Pro is most likely gonna have the same
footprint of the note 9 and offer a
larger display with the four cameras mmm
wait for count well we're one of them is
time-of-flight i'll gotcha
what only still single on the front
though we're not gonna see like only
still single on the front alright family
from apparently from the front they'll
both look the same and it's just from
the back that we're getting an extra
camera the beckoned dude I don't mind
like seriously I would love like if they
were like here's your wide-angle selfie
camera like the pixel oh man yeah give
me but give me a notch the size of Texas
I don't care it's literally literally
the only way that I love the pixel 3
like I hate selfies unless I'm using a
pixel 3
mm yeah that's fair it's just my cheeks
don't look all over the place
because if you use the wide-angle selfie
camera and you actually look like a
human that's not 30 pounds heavier
that's my biggest wrong with selfies
like people even have angles for selfies
you've never tried to taken a selfie
with Fisher oh my goodness okay have you
noticed that like he will only take
selfies from a specific angle it's
always like it's gotta be like that yeah
pretty much yeah yeah and if you ever if
any of you fans out there ever get the
pleasure of actually hanging out with
Fisher and you get to take a picture of
him for something he will tell you
higher yeah well yeah that's the which
would see that's that's the benefit of
being a short guy that I don't have to
be telling people higher it's gonna be
higher by default I guess that's true
for me as well but yeah I mean I do
think that there might be different
versions of the phone and it might have
some some some features that are in and
out of particular I don't know what a no
10 II might be if they're even gonna try
to do that but here's my question
another report I was dude that'd be so
cool yes true right something a little
so I would launch yeah hold on I'm gonna
sorry for the interruption
I would love in no 10e where there's no
S Pen stuck to the phone like it's
literally just a smaller device with a
Wacom digitizer and then I would
probably have a pen you would have to
like carry the pen in your pocket or
whatever I would be totally down for
that that's a great idea I didn't think
about that
yeah like I don't I don't need a bigger
phone like dude I've been using the
pixel 3 so I did the Japan trip and the
whole idea was I asked for Google to
send me a pixel 3 for the after the buzz
because I didn't like the 3 XL and then
I loaded Android Q on it and so the idea
was to bring the three to Japan but it
didn't arrive on time but I've been
using the 3 ever since dude this is such
a delicious form factor it is so good I
just I wish the display were larger like
take up the whole screen and and and
have that 2 selfie camera
man I'd be down like that's all I want
yeah for sure that's why the pixel 3a
has been such a refreshing breath of a
breath of fresh air but it doesn't have
a dual selfies dude that's the thing
yeah that's true but still just a little
bit whiter before we get too far into
that tangent speaking of the speaking of
the features that might be on different
versions of the note 10 there's one
feature that people are alluding to that
might not be there anymore and that
makes me question whether this is gonna
be the all for everyone phone anymore
the power user phone if there's no
headphone jack like okay tell you what
if Samsung bundles the Galaxy buds in
the box I'll forgive them I don't know
about that though because as good as the
Galaxy buds might actually be the fact
that they are they are good the moment
they run out of battery though you're
gonna think to yourself oh Frick I wish
I had that headphone jack still which is
which is one thing that I have to hand
to Apple with air pods like the battery
life on air pods the the ear pods to
dude it's like epic like really epic and
then it charges them so quickly which I
oxy buds don't really charge that quick
and then they're like yeah but you can
reverse charge it and put it on the back
of your phone I'm like I'm not gonna
leave my phone with a screen on the
table and it does it more like life
doesn't work that way
it's a cool thing to do but then the
screen scratches so what WTF like you
know no yeah yeah exactly
I dunno that's how I feel about it
because the one feature of that truly
wireless earbuds need right now is ten
minute charging gets you at least an
hour that's gotta be a bare minimum and
the guys don't very minimum ya know so
code the thing is maybe there's gonna be
a new galaxy buds there's actually a
some thought that there might be a watch
active - I'd unpack there are things
that we're expecting to happen alongside
the phone so yeah we'll see what happens
there but if there's no headphone jack
man I just don't know like the note has
always been the easiest phone to
recommend to someone who wants
everything now something is missing yeah
I you know I hate I hate that hold like
I tweeted yesterday I got a lot of
retweets for that or something like I
love how companies lately have been like
we're giving you a better foe but we're
taking features away mm-hmm you know I I
don't get that mentality like and I
don't get how much Samsung has made fun
of every single company that kills the
headphone jack and now they're doing it
over what excuse like I get it if the
standard no.10 ditches the headphone
jack fine
if you're giving me a more compact no 10
and we're getting a larger battery and
listen that then that makes all the
sense in the world fine fine but then
give me the pro with everything just
give me one where I have the choice and
then you'll see which phone sells more
yeah indeed you see my my my you're
making me that's right you're making me
feel better about my my power issues let
me go turn it off the quick it's just
man this note 9 feels big now like big
ok finally like I look at that I look at
the top of the phone and I'm like man
you're so unreachable right now
actually I had okay no that's that's
beside the point I had a thought but all
shared and another episode final thought
on design though I'm looking at the
renders and I keep forgetting that there
are other renders of this phone I'm just
looking at the black one right now but
the picture that I kept using when I was
putting together the that my thoughts
for this show was on this gradient like
Samsung is actually throwing it in like
you said it looks a little bit like a p3
Pro so I guess I little bit like I can't
wait for that comparison p30 Pro versus
no 10 are you kidding me I kind of like
this though like if this is really it I
hope it looks like this in real life
because sometimes it does the same same
I love I love the fact that they gave us
that white bearing of the s10 mm-hmm for
review I dude I love the s10 don't get
me wrong man III need to go back to the
SME it's just the promise they gave me a
locked phone and so I'm not always using
t-mobile but it's just like for me the
s10 was like Samsung maturing into so
many things and coming up with a more
refined device that looks like the
previous one but it's not and so that's
the so that's why I'm so looking forward
to this no 10
I just for me the only problem with the
note line is it launches at a point
where you're so close to other devices
like the pixel four and the next iPhone
and then and then the s11 will launch so
early in the following year so the time
that I ended up using the note is too
little that's true unless you make the
effort to be like mr. two phones
another Fisher reference well no no but
but that's me so here's the thing the I
think that the only way and this is
something that Paul calm hasn't done in
a while it would be nice if it would
happen where like do you remember when
the when the pixel launched it was the
time of the 820 snapdragon 820 and then
they launched the pixel with the
Snapdragon 820 one they launched a new
process like a new processor that was
better for the pixel for the pixel for
the original pixel and so but ever since
then like we've had the 840 like the 835
the 845 now we've got the a 55 if really
I think that it would make it would have
improved the longevity of products
launched in the fall if Qualcomm would
come up with a newer chip for this you
know for the next pixel and for the next
because it's it's right now I'm using an
845 on this pixel 3 you know mm-hmm yeah
that's true and now we're at where we
are where we are yeah but yeah the I I
do think that I going back to the whole
design aspect I I hope that there are
more gradients it's not just the one
personally oh yeah I think that would be
I yeah I just I don't understand why
companies don't just like I get it
they're boring people that want to stick
to their black phones I used to be one
man I spent two years you know it was
the first film that changed my mind
about that was the one plus six in red I
was like wow that phone looks really
cool and so I feel that it you know
phones don't necessarily have to be
black I mean why not come up with like
if you notice the 1 plus 7 it come
there's no black anymore it's like that
gray variant for people that are adult
but that gray actually looks really cool
that mirror gray you've got that that
almond which I love it's my favorite and
then you've got that blue
which actually didn't like that blue
that much this year it felt really it
felt really simple but at the same time
just a tiny bit boring yeah like it's
it's a good blue but it just didn't make
the fun pop and then the almond arrived
and was just like okay cool where we
were where we should be now yeah but I
can't wait for a red one +7 Pro man that
would be pretty nice
alright so final thought on the note 10
most thing the thing you're excited the
most for this one I just I can't I
for me the note is is that phone that's
everything it's literally like the no
date was a disappointment and then comes
the note 9 where it's like alright fine
you guys were complaining about battery
life and the placement of the
fingerprint scanner and like here we go
here you go here's the note with
everything you really wanted and so they
launched it and so I love using the note
I actually do use the s-pen um I do love
the extra screen real estate I do love
the aspect of having a phone with
all-day battery life that also has you
know there are certain things like the
edge menus on Samsung I actually do use
these things and that pairs like I do
depend on them it's it's funny like the
other day somebody was making this
comment over split screen how how often
Josh do you do split window on your on
any other Android phone that much you I
never do no but I was I will tell you
though there is one thing I use all the
time and that's picture and picture at
YouTube which is kind of a same vein say
I'm saying the same but I do I do
picture in picture YouTube but then if
it wasn't for the the app pairs on the
side menus for Galaxy phones I would
never use foot screen and so I think
that that was genius and so those are
the little things that make me miss
using a samsung phone yeah and so for me
like the S line is always great but the
note line always has like the extra
charm like I would even wish that
Samsung would launch the note at the
same time as the s and B like he like
the S 10 plus would be the note variant
and just have all of them and just pick
the one you want and use it for a whole
year not use it for so little yeah that
would be me that would be me obviously
our our experience is very specific
though like you know there are people
who could get
this phone coming up and then use it for
a whole year yeah but but here's the
thing like like Qualcomm has been
pushing ever since the 8:45 like for the
last two years they've been like really
pushing their processors and they've
been pushing them in ways we're like in
the past I didn't feel much of a change
between the 8:35 in the 20 or the 8:10
but then comes the 8:45 and it was like
great battery life great discrete that
and then comes the 855 with HEV C and so
many other things and so it's like
really hard for me to not want the
latest processor that's the thing yeah
makes perfect sense I think it's really
go ahead sorry I was just gonna I was
actually going to start signing off on
here I was gonna say that the one I'm
just looking for as always with these
phones I'm looking forward to the
cameras obviously there's gonna be that
wide angle even at EOF as I'm looking at
this the back of this particular phone
there's there's a lot to be excited for
I will miss a front like a like a wide
front-facing camera hopefully it's still
wide enough they tend to be so I think
where it will be okay yeah and 4k
front-facing camera recording ooh yes
for or it's 2 quad HD but yeah maybe 4k
front here's the thing though whereas
with the s10 they announced that Adobe
Premiere rush was going to be a thing
eventually it is now so that means that
the note 10 will be able to start being
a video like monster out of the box so
that's why I'm excited yeah so the
cameras need to be what they are gonna
be good but if there's something even
better this time around
can't wait to put that into it like some
some some some editing some vlogging on
the go with that right I would I would
never edit a video on a phone that's the
thing I'd still want to try and this is
where I'm gonna try it because I haven't
really used it a whole lot I want to but
I feel like I should keep it for this
phone like get ready for it like III I
did I did iMovie on the iPhone a couple
of times I even did I'd movie on the
iPad and I even have a luma fusion on
the iPad and I still find the hole I
like I wish that Apple or these
companies would embrace like the whole
concept like I would probably use it in
a case like Dex ah with that fine I
could probably like I feel that video
editing like it's very hard like the
texe menus with finger with finger
gestures and everything it's just kind
of cumbersome I believe I'm right but
let me subvert that spen bro s-pen okay
fine I'm a believer now all right
precision editing on an S Pen yes but
but then it's Samsung would have to be
smart enough and partner with Adobe and
come up with things that only the S Pen
would do now that the S Pen is a
replacement for your finger true there
should be more to it than that but the S
Pen will just make it more comfortable
it's my point all right no because if
it's optimized for finger travel it's
never good like that's the problem well
I mean I've edited with a with a Wacom
tablet before and I do like that like
precision like like that precision I do
like it so hopefully that'll be that
will translate here but you're right
there should be some extra features as
pin on rush all right cool so that's our
thought on the note tent and yeah there
are if you look at the renders and I'll
have it linked in the description yeah
these are no 10 plus no 10 renders so
there are different versions of the
phone so make sure you take a look at it
on there and yeah let us know what you
want out of the note 10 the note 10 plus
man a note any like we said would be
pretty awesome but yeah let us know in
the comments and next week we will
respond to some of those and react to
some of those comments on the show all
right I should do it let's go ahead and
get to the outro and on that note we're
