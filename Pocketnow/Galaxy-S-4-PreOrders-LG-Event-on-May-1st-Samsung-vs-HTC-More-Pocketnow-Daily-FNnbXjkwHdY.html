for pre-order LD T's is a new event to
happen on may first and Samsung is under
investigation for steering comments
against HTC I'm high memory better and
if you think that Sam say is the only
company that hires paid chills you're in
for a surprise this is poking out daily
that's right LG has just sent out
presentations for an event to happen on
may first or a device that they're not
specifying as always everybody does this
but the point being is that we know that
the LG optimus g pro is most likely the
next device from LG soul and on the
United States so stay tuned the optimus
G was a good phone and the optimus g pro
proved to be a good phone as well in our
review now let's talk about the iphone
5s rumors have apple bringing a 12
megapixel camera to their
next-generation device and you already
knew that but the interesting news is
that apparently apple will invest on
better low-light performance and also
HDR video to come to the camera and
you're like wait a second I've heard
that on the Xperia Z in the Xperia ZL
right well the reason why is because
Apple uses Sony sensors for their
cameras and speaking of iphone those of
you that were waiting for facebook home
to come to iOS well you're getting a
sort of update that won't bring that
experience but you aren't really missing
out on much anyways but point being is
this new version 6 point annu facebook
layout that'll come to the next stop
soon interesting it's not available for
android just yet but another interesting
point is that you do get the chat heads
but well as long as you're within the
facebook app because everybody that uses
iOS products can't win it all and for
those of you gearing up for the samsung
galaxy s4 it now is available on
pre-order on AT&amp;amp;T to ship on April
thirtieth and guess what you also get it
on US cellular but you're not getting it
yet on t mobile or verizon and there's
no word on sprint apparently these
carriers will bring this device
eventually but again just pre-order the
device now is it'll most likely sell out
very soon and finally for the disturbing
news of the day the taiwanese fair
trades commission is now investigating
samsung over some leaked documents
apparently the company has been hiring
students to post negative comments of
the HTC One in favor of the galaxy s4
and social media and even on commenting
systems and websites Sampson could
probably be facing an 800
dollar fine but don't you believe the
spine should be a little higher we
measure the impact them that way due to
the question of the day how do you feel
about these companies hiring paid chills
to promote their products this is not
the first time this has happened we can
mention probably when Windows Phone 7
was launched we a lot of these comments
that weren't real of these people saying
that they couldn't wait for windows
phone 7 to launch and if these comments
were all real when those phones Emma
would have sold a lot more than it
really did so it's really disturbing
it's the terrible practice leave us a
comment down below how do you feel the
HTC One is a great smartphone for the
record and if you read any negative
comments about it I suggest you give it
a try first of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
mature you follow us on parking out on

up if you liked what you saw I am hi
Madame Yvette and as always thank you
very much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
