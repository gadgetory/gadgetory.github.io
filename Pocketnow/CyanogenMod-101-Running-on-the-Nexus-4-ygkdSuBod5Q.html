yesterday we showed you a video on how
you can go through and unlock root and
super user your Nexus 4 we did that for
a reason because today we're gonna show
off
CyanogenMod 10.1 running on the Nexus 4
let's go take a look so here we've
gotten the Google Nexus 4 of course made
by LG if you missed our full review I
will have a link to that at the end of
this video you don't want to miss that
if you missed our video on how to root
and unlock and install supersu you'll
want to make sure you watch that video
too I'll have a link to it at the end of
this one as well it's kind of a
prerequisite to this video so this video
what is this this is CyanogenMod 10.1 so
go ahead and if I can pull down my
notification shade here take a look at
this in the settings about phone got my
CyanogenMod updates and statistics yada
yada yada version 4.2.1 and you can see
that this is 10 2012
12:03 nightly so this is the December
3rd nightly rather than the December 4th
I think there were some problems with
the download of that version so we're
definitely running CyanogenMod 10.1 the
point one just means that this is
android 4.2.1 got it ok good deal so now
that we have this 10.1 it is a nightly
Knightley's our experimental they are
not stable there are things that are not
implemented there are things that are
broken so keep that in mind
generally speaking CyanogenMod roms are
fast sometimes they're faster than
normal roms we went ahead and ran some
benchmarks let me pull that up I took
some screenshots for you and in
Geekbench
scored 1823 just a smidgen slower than
running the stock rom take a look over
here at quadrant I can't read it from
that angle
42 69 which again is a little
it's slower than the stock rum for a
nightly version of CyanogenMod that's
not to be unexpected it's gonna get
faster it's going to get better and the
drop in speed between what we had seen
and what CyanogenMod 10 is really is
negligible and you're not going to feel
it in everyday practical use I mean it's
still very very fast so what are some
things that you can expect with
CyanogenMod first of all notice I have
gone ahead and modified my dock down
here my hot seat as it were and I've
added a couple extra spaces for icons so
now I can have seven or more icons down
there it's great it's customizable
that's what we like next we've got our
power widget which I love this thing is
great it lets you do all kinds of stuff
right there in the power widget this of
course is running the trebuchet launcher
so let's jump right into that we'll go
into settings first of all we've still
got the stock Android jelly bean 4.2
quick settings up here the quick toggle
screen not the one from previous
versions of CyanogenMod at least not yet
they're probably going to extend what
they have here rather than go back in
and and reinvent the wheel with theirs
but that's just a guess on my side so we
have this new section called launcher
and if I can tap it instead of going
into Google now I'll be helpful in here
we can modify stuff on our home screen
change our grid size the number of home
screens I've changed from the default of
5 to 3 because that's all I use and that
helps speed up my device I can set the
default screen I want to change that to
2 because that's the middle one
I can change my vertical padding
horizontal padding do I want a
persistent search bar yes or no I like
it if you don't take it off you can do
that it's awesome you can resize any
widget including widgets that are kind
of old and don't know how to be resized
now you can because the launcher knows
how to do that for you if you know what
things are based on their icon and you
don't need their label you can hide
their icon label it's super awesome this
is stuff you have seen before wallpaper
stuff
yada-yada-yada I show page indicator
fade it dock divider all that fun stuff
drawer say
basic stuff doc this is what I was
telling you how many doc I can so I
could have let's go back to five go from
there and general we can Auto rotate the
screen to whatever orientation we're in
I like that feature so let's go ahead
and do it and this of course is
trebuchet zero point two moving down in
here theme ability
one of the major most awesome cool
things that you can do with cyanogen mod
is theme it it comes pre-installed with
one theme the stock theme so there you
go
if you want to add more you can add more
you've got buttons up here to be able to
quick launch into that you can grab
stuff from the Play Store make it look
all kinds of cool coming into system can
change the status bar up here I have
shown the am/pm over on my clock as a
small I've got some other options in
their normal and none none being the
default battery status style percentage
I believe icon is the default you can
put a percentage in there a circle
circle with percentage which is what
I've done right there or you can just
hide it if you don't really care or if
you've got a widget on your home screen
telling you what it is go ahead and hide
it so we'll leave it where it is the
signal strength style there's an icon
for me this is for at your phone you can
make that text or hidden if you want
notification counts really cool if you
have notifications up here how many
Gmail's how many missed calls whatever
it will show you how many there are so
you don't have to go into the app or
pull down the notification shade to see
really kind of a quick easy way to find
out hey you've missed 10 calls might be
important power menu when you hit the
power button you can do all kinds of
stuff show the reboot menu take a
screenshot so you don't have to hit
volume down and power at the same time
expand a desktop I haven't played with
that one yet if you want to tell us what
it is go over to pocketnow.com
and leave us a comment just a brief
description of what the expanded desktop
is and how you use it profile switcher
now this is not multi-user profiles
this is I'm at home I'm at work I'm in
the car you can pre configure profiles
and use NFC to toggle between them and
you can get to that
hitting the power button if you don't
want to go to an NFC solution you can
switch it into airplane mode quickly
that way and go into the sound panel as
well lots of cool stuff notification
light I'll breeze over this the
notification light down here is not that
big but it is very convenient and with
CyanogenMod 10.1 you can customize it so
I have turned about my customized values
it will blink blue for missed call it
will blink white for voicemail it will
blink green for email coming through the
email app or red coming through the
Gmail app and orange if I get a message
through Google Talk so let's go ahead
and see how this works you tap on it you
can select what family of colors you
want and then whichever color you want
in here you can change the speed of the
flash I like normal just because it
looks better to me and you can even test
it so let's go ahead and test that will
bring up this dialog you turn off your
screen and you notice down here now
you've got this really cool blinky light
it doesn't blink faster and as far as
how many times per minute it blinks that
setting on speed is how many times or
how fast you want the light to light up
and go away now that was kind of
interesting you saw it was red and I
clearly have it selected as orange in
here I don't know why that's the case
probably because this isn't Knightly and
they are still working on things but
again still red but before I put this on
camera it was working and so your
mileage may vary okay
go ahead and try it I like it I think
it's awesome moving right along let's
get in there's so much stuff in this a
lot of stuff you have already seen here
we've gone through all a system profiles
this is where you set up and configure
your profiles if you don't want to use
them to turn it off
if you do want to use them here some
pre-configured ones you can change your
settings on each one of those over there
you can also go in and set up your your
NFC somewhere in all of this come back
here and getting close to the bottom now
developer options and performance are
both hidden so you have to use the
the multi-tap on your build number you
tap that 10 times it says hey now you're
a developer great once you do that both
of these will show up in developer
options I haven't seen much different
there but you do now have this
performance performance is just like
you'd expect you've got proceed with
caution warnings processor you can set
it to the maximum speed 1512 as the
maximum and the minimum speed I want
that to be down here at 384 for some
reason that didn't stick even though I
told it to set at boot I like it to run
as slow as it can when I don't need it
to do anything to save on battery life
like I said it didn't stick I don't know
why again it's a nightly maybe that's
the explanation you can also change the
governor in there I'll schedule ER I've
never done anything with that memory
management Z Ram and allow purging of
assets
this essentially compresses your RAM it
takes more processing power to do but
you have more effective Ram that you can
use so it's like you know instead of 2
gig now you've got 2.5 but it takes a
little bit more time to get into it if
you use a lot of RAM intensive apps
that's a good thing to do test it and
see if it works all of the benchmarks
that I did were without doing any
customizations to these so it was stock
and then allow purging of assets you can
just you know let the OS kick stuff out
when they're not needed anymore free up
some of that ram 16-bit transparency if
you want to lose a little bit of quality
in your transparent images and whatnot
you can toggle that get some extra speed
I don't like the way it looks so I leave
it off and surface improvement the
default is to fix color banding I've
turned that to fixed color man perfect
again after I did the the change or I'm
sorry I did this after I did the the
benchmark so the benchmarks are with the
defaults so that essentially is it
there's probably other stuff hidden in
here that I haven't shown you but we can
only cover so much in a video there is
one very important thing that I need to
mention and that is if you are going to
be running CyanogenMod 10 my preferred
way to flash this
is using clockwork my set right
using ROM manager and ClockworkMod
Recovery together
unfortunately the Google Apps the gaps
package that you download with
CyanogenMod ten nightly is version 4.1
and it will break that's kind of why it
took us an extra day to get this video
out it will break you will be in a boot
loop it will cause all kinds of
headaches Wow
I've got a link over at pocketnow.com
I'll have a link to the article where
you can find that link where you can get
a 4.2 Google Apps package that will
actually work and as you can see here
it's working just fine so make sure you
head over to pocketnow.com so you can
get that CyanogenMod 10.1 nightly I love
CyanogenMod I love having it on my Nexus
device even though it is a Nexus device
because well that's what Nexus devices
are really meant to do to let you do all
kinds of customization I love it
if you liked it let us know if you don't
like it let us know if you've got
another ROM that you're running on your
Nexus 4 I want to know about that head
to pocketnow.com and leave that comment
down below so I can go and take a look
at it and maybe even do a video about it
for PocketNow showing off cm 10.1 on the
Nexus 4 I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
