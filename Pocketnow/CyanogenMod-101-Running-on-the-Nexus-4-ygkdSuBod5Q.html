yesterday we showed you a video on how
you can go through and unlock root and
super user your nexus 4 we did that for
a reason because today we're going to
show off cyanogenmod 10.1 running on the
nexus 4 let's go take a look so here
we've got the google nexus 4 of course
made by LG if you missed our full review
I will have a link to that at the end of
this video you don't want to miss that
if you missed our video on how to root
and unlock and install super SU you'll
want to make sure you watch that video 2
i'll have a link to it at the end of
this one as well it's kind of a
prerequisite to this video so this video
what is this this is cyanogenmod 10.1 go
ahead and if I can pull down my
notification shade here take a look at
this in the settings about phone got my
cyanogenmod updates and statistics yada
yada yada version 4.2 point 1 and you
can see that this is 10 2012 12 03
nightly so this is the december third
nightly rather than the december fourth
i think there were some problems with
the download of that version so we're
definitely running cyanogenmod 10.1 the
point 1 just means that this is android
4.2 point 1 got it ok good deal so now
that we have this 10.1 it is a nightly
Knightley's our experimental they are
not stable there are things that are not
implemented there are things that are
broken so keep that in mind generally
speaking cyanogenmod roms are fast
sometimes they're faster than normal
roms we went ahead and ran some
benchmarks let me pull that up i took
some screenshots for you and in
geekbench scored 18 23 just a smidgen
slower than running the stock rom take a
look over here at quadrant can't read it
from that angle 4269 which again is a
little
it's lower than the stock rom for a
nightly version of cyanogenmod that's
not to be unexpected it's going to get
faster it's going to get better and the
drop in speed between what we had seen
and what cyanogenmod 10 is really is
negligible and you're not going to feel
it in everyday practical use I mean it's
still very very fast so what are some
things that you can expect with
cyanogenmod first of all notice I have
gone ahead and modified my dock down
here my hot seat as it were and I've
added a couple extra spaces for icon so
now i can have seven or more icons down
there it's great it's customizable
that's what we like next we've got our
power widget which I love this thing is
great it lets you do all kinds of stuff
right there in the power widget this of
course is running the trebuchet launcher
so let's jump right into that will go
into settings first of all we've still
got the stock Android jellybean 4.2
quick settings up here the quick toggles
screen not the one from previous
versions of cyanogenmod least not yet
they're probably going to extend what
they have here rather than go back in
and and reinvent the wheel with theirs
but that's just a guess on my side so we
have this new section called launcher
and if I can tap it instead of going
into Google now be helpful in here we
can modify stuff on our home screen
change our grid size the number of
homescreens I've changed from the
default of five to three because that's
all I use and that helps speed up my
device I can set the default screen I
want to change that to two that's the
middle one can change my vertical
padding horizontal padding do I want a
persistent search bar yes or no I like
it if you don't take it off you can do
that it's awesome you can resize any
widget including widgets that are kind
of old and don't know how to be resized
now you can because the launcher knows
how to do that for you if you know what
things are based on their icon and you
don't need their label you can hide
their icon label it's super awesome this
is stuff you have seen before wallpaper
stuff yadda yadda yadda show page
indicator fade it doc divider all that
fun stuff drawer same
basic stuff doc this is what I was
telling you how many dock icons i could
have let's go back to five go from there
and general we can auto rotate the
screen to whatever orientation we're in
I like that feature so let's go ahead
and do it and this of course is
trebuchet 0.2 moving down in here theme
ability one of the major most awesome
cool things that you can do with
cyanogenmod is themed it it comes
pre-installed with one theme the stock
theme so there you go if you want to add
more you can add more you've got buttons
up here to be able to quick launch into
that you can grab stuff from the Play
Store make it look all kinds of cool
coming into system can change the status
bar up here I have shown the ampm over
on my clock as a small I've got some
other options in their normal and none
none being the default battery status
style percentage I believe icon is the
default you can put a percentage in
there a circle circle with percentage
which is what I've done right there or
you can just hide it if you don't really
care or if you've got a widget on your
home screen telling you what it is go
ahead and hide it so we'll leave it
where it is the signal strength style is
an icon for me this is for your phone
you can make that text or hidden if you
want notification counts really cool if
you have notifications up here how many
Gmail's how many missed calls whatever
it will show you how many there are so
you don't have to go into the app or
pull down the notification shade to see
really a kind of a quick easy way to
find out hey you've missed 10 calls
might be important power menu when you
hit the power button you can do all
kinds of stuff show the reboot menu take
a screenshot so you don't have to hit
volume down and power at the same time
expand a desktop I haven't played with
that one yet if you want to tell us what
it is go over to pocketnow.com and leave
us a comment just a brief description of
what the expanded desktop is and how you
use it profile switcher now this is not
multi user profiles this is I'm at home
I'm at work I'm in the car you can
pre-configure profiles and use NFC to
toggle between them and you can get to
that
hitting the power button if you don't
want to go to win NFC solution you can
switch it into airplane mode quickly
that way and go into the sound panel as
well lots of cool stuff notification
light I'll breeze over this the
notification light down here is not that
big but it is very convenient and with
cyanogenmod 10.1 you can customize it so
I have turned about my customized values
it will blink blue for missed call it
will blink white for voicemail it will
blink green for email coming through the
email app or red coming through the
gmail app and orange if i get a message
through google talk so let's go ahead
and see how this works you tap on it you
can select what family of colors you
want and then whichever color you want
in here you can change the speed of the
flash I like normal just because it
looks better to me and you can even test
it so let's go ahead and test that will
bring up this dialog you turn off your
screen and you notice down here now
you've got this really cool blinky light
it doesn't blink faster as far as how
many times per minute it blinks that
setting on speed is how many times or
how fast you want the light to light up
and go away now that was kind of
interesting you saw it was red and I
clearly have it selected as orange in
here I don't know why that's the case
probably because this isn't nightly and
they are still working on things but
again still red but before I put this on
camera it was working and so your
mileage may vary okay go ahead and try
it I like it I think it's awesome moving
right along let's get in so much stuff
in this a lot of stuff you have already
seen here we've gone through all a
system profiles this is where you set up
and configure your profiles if you don't
want to use them to turn it off if you
do want to use them here some
pre-configured ones you can change your
settings on each one of those over there
you can also go in and set up your your
NFC somewhere in all of this come back
here and getting close to the bottom now
developer options and performance are
both hidden so you have to use the
the multi-tap on your build number you
tap that ten times it says hey now
you're a developer great once you do
that both of these will show up in
developer options I haven't seen much
different there but you do now have this
performance performance is just like
you'd expect you've got proceed with
caution warnings processor you can set
it to the maximum speed 1512 as the
maximum and the minimum speed I want
that to be down here at 384 for some
reason that didn't stick even though I
told it to set at boot I like it to run
as slow as it can when I don't need it
to do anything to save on battery life
like I said it didn't stick I don't know
why again it's a Knightly maybe that's
the explanation you can also change the
governor in there I all scheduler I've
never done anything with that memory
management z RAM and allow purging of
assets this essentially compresses your
ram it takes more processing power to do
but you have more effective ram that you
can use so it's like you know instead of
two gig now you've got 2.5 but it takes
a little bit more time to get into it if
you use a lot of RAM intensive apps
that's a good thing to do test it see if
it works all of the benchmarks that I
did were without doing any
customizations to these so it was stock
and then allow purging of assets you can
just you know let the OS kick stuff out
when they're not needed anymore free up
some of that Ram 16-bit transparency if
you want to lose a little bit of quality
in your transparent images and whatnot
you can toggle that get some extra speed
I don't like the way it looks so I leave
it off and surface improvement the
default is to fix color banding I've
turned that to fixed color band perfex
again after I did the the change or I'm
sorry I did this after I did the the
benchmark so the benchmarks are with the
defaults so that essentially is it
there's probably other stuff hidden in
here that I haven't shown you but we can
only cover so much in a video there is
one very important thing that I need to
mention and that is if you are going to
be running cyanogenmod 10 my preferred
way to flash this
is using clockwork mod set right using
rom manager and clockworkmod recovery
together unfortunately the Google Apps
the gapps package that you download with
cyanogenmod 10 nightly is version 4.1
and it will break that's kind of why it
took us an extra day to get this video
out it will break you will be in a
bootloop it will cause all kinds of
headaches wow I've got a link over at
pocketnow.com i'll have a link to the
article where you can find that link
where you can get a 4.2 Google Apps
package that will actually work and as
you can see here it's working just fine
so make sure you head over to pocket now
calm so you can get that cyanogenmod
10.1 nightly I love cyanogenmod I love
having it on my Nexus device even though
it is a Nexus device because well that's
what Nexus devices are really meant to
do to let you do all kinds of
customization I love it if you like it
let us know if you don't like it let us
know if you've got another rom that
you're running on your Nexus 4 I want to
know about that head to pocket now come
and leave that comment down beneath the
article so I can go and take a look at
it and maybe even do a video about it
for pocket now showing off CM 10.1 on
the Nexus 4 i'm joe levi thanks for
