antitrust allegations and this stuff
seems serious Sampson now focused on
giving Apple some better display
technology and one plus is rumored to
give us a more budget love very soon I'm
I'm Mary vera and would it be cool if
there was an automated editor so that
this video could go up sooner this is
rocking out daily the official news
today I did with Apple as a company just
spent a couple of million dollars in a
company called links technologies
because they were interested in their
camera software technology now think
about this the company has a couple of
patents with this sort of periscope
l-shaped design for camera module with
optical zoom optical image stabilization
and now we have a company with software
that provides depth within the software
package meaning that you could actually
take a photo and detect where the
subject is and remove the whole
background in a way to do something
similar to what I do with this green
screen really cool things coming let's
see if they come for the next version of
iOS let's keep talking about Apple but
more particularly Samsung as a yes same
thing is one of apples biggest partners
when it comes to silicon and a couple of
other things and it seems that Samsung
has the secret team of 200 employees
working on building display technology
for Apple and hey AMOLED technology is
probably one of our favorite displays
lately ever since of the galaxy note 4
particularly it's kind of amazing
display but even before that and the
reports are that Samsung is working hard
on bringing new technology to Apple but
we wonder if it's going to be at all LED
technology and we've loved that to
happen but we'll see it's IPS technology
is getting old that's all about
Microsoft's Windows 10 we haven't seen
it for tablets yet holy desktops and
certain smartphones but we have some
leaked screenshots of Windows 10 working
on small tablets and we assume or we
understand that Windows 10 on small
tablets will run the phone version of
the OS and so we see on the screen shots
we see that everything it bloats up in
order to fit the new display apparently
this is an 8-inch tablet we don't have
any info
on the hardware or anything but the
least do show was that everything adapts
to the tablet we just wonder if it's
going to be any better or you're just
getting a bloated smartphone we'll see
i'll talk about 1 plus we've been
hearing rumors of the one plus two for
the longest time and it hasn't happened
yet but Bloomberg apparently has
entrusted sources the claim that we
should get a 1 + 2 x q3 of this year but
listen to this well then the claims
we're not really sure if this is a
quotation issue or what but there is
also claim of a budget device for the
end of the year so we're not really
understanding and we're getting two
products one budget minded and another
the one plus two which was also budget
minded or if we are getting just one
device that's going to be focused on the
budget but then the quarters won't
really match we'll see what we get by
later in the next couple of quarters and
finally for the very hot news of the day
the European Union has just hit Google
with some anti-stress complains
according to the European Union Google
is favoring the companies that pay it
for ads when it comes to Google search
results and yes you do have portion of
the Google search that shows you the
people to pay the companies that pay but
apparently they're also getting better
search results and Curie's and they were
focused on retail Google responded
saying that no eBay and Amazon are
making more money in these countries
than we are but again we'll can allocate
as much as it can and while the European
unit is waiting for an official response
from the company but it leads me to the
question of the day whenever you use
Google have you noticed that it favors
specific companies not necessarily the
ones you're probably looking for because
in my case we've noticed that a lot here
in Latin America but not necessarily
with Google we've noticed it with ways
which belongs to google where it routes
you through particular areas where there
are ad pay the sections you know
companies that are paying ads free to
drive through there and not other roads
that we know that aren't going to be so
then so then xin traffic it's really
interesting but we can't really prove
this leave us a comment down below what
do you think friends you know the drill
