some positive news on the galaxy note 5
sony is rumored to bring us some awesome
experience for Aoife and it seems that
the Apple watch has destroyed the
samsung gear market share I'm high-net
iveta and if it were up to me I would
figure out a way to make wednesday is
another weekend day this is pocket out
daily the official news today start with
Google as the company has just published
a new update to its google map services
that's a little freaky particularly
because welcome the festive you wanted
to see your driving history or location
history you could do so if you dug a
little but now Google has offered a new
time line service for google maps that
allows you to stock yourself and
obviously allows anybody to stock you if
they have access to your device as well
and continuing on with the official news
bandwagon Apple has just published its
second beta or public beta should i say
of iOS 9 in the same case of OS 10 m
copy Thun sadly watch OS is still not on
public beta and trust me I don't blame
you for not giving it a try because
updating betas is terrible on the Apple
watch but the updates for iOS 9
particularly bring picture in picture
mode for podcasts in addition to other
enhancements in beta 4 will confirm if
these are part of what we get on the
public beta 2 we've also got some hot
news regarding Sony both official and
unofficial case of the official ones the
company has just published Android 51
for xperia z3 family and xperia z2
family great news the company is doing
an amazing job with its legacy devices
but in addition to that we hear of a
sony xperia s 60 and as 70 devices 24
Aoife and apparently these will be
flagships stay tuned for that now even
though Tim Cook did not provide any
official figures as to how many Apple
watches were so we've got analysts
already predicting that the company now
owns 75% of the SmartWatch market it is
now a 5.4 million unit market out of
which apple owns four million devices
and given the fact that the market
pretty much grew five hundred percent
because of the Apple watch those of you
wondering which company was affected
well it's Samsung the company went from
owning seventy percent of the market to
owning
percent of the market yeah I didn't get
that number wrong seven percent of the
market and then the rest of the
companies are buried down under that
terrible figures let's see what Samsung
does with its gear a soon and finally
for the hot news of the day or at least
rumors it seems that we finally get
specifications for the galaxy note 5 and
galaxy s6 edge+ I hate that name but it
seems that both devices will sport
identical specifications quad HD display
three gigs of ram not four gigs 32 gigs
of storage expandable to 128 gigs and
that is probably the best news because
we weren't sure that was going to be
expandable or not apparently the sim
tray will have the option for a microSD
card which is great and we get a 16
megapixel camera and it leads me to the
question of the day if you had to pick
the s6 edge+ for the galaxy note 5 which
one would you pick in my case I'll stick
to the note lineup particularly because
even though I don't care about the s-pen
it's great to have leave us a comment
down below which one would you pick
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the Rose earlier before this
video was filmed make sure you follow us
on gaana.com is the script range of
channel as well and follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore iveta we're on
instagram at high never iveta please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hina to be better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
