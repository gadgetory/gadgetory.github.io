super specific intro for today I will
say hello and welcome to episode 330 of
the weekly brought to you by pocket our
next day's developers recorded on Friday
the 2nd of November 2018 and I am elated
to say November no longer have to say
October can I ask you guys real quick
before we get into the rest of that
intro what was it called ok I get that
it was tech Tober but I feel like I was
much more correct and calling it phone
pocalypse apocalypse indeed I am I'm
really happy that the month is over
there's still a lot to do and there's a
lot for us to talk about on this podcast
but welcome back to everybody I hope
we're all okay and recovering as you can
see there are some residual problems
with tech Tober as you can see my webcam
looks a little bit different today we've
had audio problems Brandon won't you
give us a quick example of the problem
sort slow apparently my microphones
making me have a beep deep voice which
is great I finally sound like I've gone
through puberty
if the beard wasn't an indication indeed
yes this is gonna be the best okay so
that's for Jules's words in this intro
from the cluster fudge that is the red
hydrogen one to the distant memory sort
of of the one +60 event and a lot of
Apple in between we're here to cover it
all because we wish you were here with
us we wish you were there with us
throughout all of the things that we
were able to do traveling all over the
place just getting back from New York
Jaime of course is still in New York but
yes travel coming up as do I it's been a
crazy month
I'm your host Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and the crew is back
together let's start with let's start
with Brandon minimun how are you I wish
I could hear how it sounds
is it like super deep or just like kind
of like you sound like what was the name
of the the spy deep throat was it my mic
goes out as my webcam goes out deep what
no let's not let's continue on why isn't
it microphones having some issues but
you know welcome back to the cast we saw
you in New York which is awesome
if I'm hanging you out don't get to see
you guys too much in person yeah I made
a Venice finally settled back in his New
York studios for a hot second that's
true
so how's it going on your end packing
sadly packing that's my life right now
yeah a lot of travel coming up I'm
actually going to be out also in the
next couple of days so you may or may
not see me on next week's podcast but
that's for next week we do have one more
person who's meant to be on the podcast
Taylor Morin is going to be here a
little bit later bowl why don't we just
go ahead and jump into all of our
stories okay the most recent thing that
happened actually no technically not
because because of what Apple did
oneplus had to move up their date like a
day so we all had to go there early but
we finally got our hands on and of
course I'm the one who I'm the idiot
that leaves it in this car we have the
oneplus 60 now and of course Jaime has
is there you go nice so we have the one
plus 60 newly announced a lot of great
stuff to talk about with this device and
if I can make the quick thought that the
oneplus 60 with all of its flagship
specifications all of the news that was
supposed to come out from this
particular new phone from oneplus it
didn't seem like a very exciting phone
until the event am I wrong
that always happens right they they
dramatize the features and talk about
how many years they spent working on
things and you know but yeah exactly but
it was more like the story they were
telling on stage that got me like I was
becoming more in and by the time the by
the time the event was was done I was
all-in and I'm actually really excited
for this phone not just be not
necessarily because it's providing
anything completely different than
anything anyone else but it's just
because the way that they told the story
I made it clear oneplus is here they're
finally here it took six-and-a-half
iterations or whatever you want to call
it but they're finally here
so before we get into some of the
specifications Jaime some quick thoughts
on the oneplus 60 as you're holding it I
wish it came out in red I think this is
the only thing that that I feel it's
missing it's definitely a thicker phone
it's definitely heavier phone you've got
a larger battery it is probably the most
iterative update that I've well no I
mean if you saw the three and the three
t it was the same thing but I didn't use
the three so the three t for me was new
but then there were more differences I
feel between the five and the five T
then there are between the six and the
60 and so it's not that I'm underwhelmed
I just I wish that it came out in red on
day one and they gave me the red berry
and did I'd be a happy guy there were
some rumors that a purple addition was
going to come out do you do you would
you would you rock a purple one yeah I
would totally Rock any color that's not
this matte black or the never black like
these are like the colors that I least
like I like the matte black it's don't
get me wrong it's just uh I feel I don't
know they were the ones they're the ones
that I should blame for making me like
red phones so pleased I would like
another one thank you I'm really upset
with myself because I have my unit and
it has the matted red case on it you saw
that I was using it in New York like
that yeah yeah that was immediate
accessory that we put on but yeah I I'm
gonna I'm gonna get to a question to all
of you guys so should you hi me after
what you just said but let's give a
quick welcome to Taylor who's just
coming in he's still he's still getting
set of it looks like I've not quite
figured out this whole using my camera
for webcam so it was blocking my monitor
was directly in front of look it looks
really good your backgrounds nice and
blurred and by the way if I sound deep
that's because I've made the transition
to a man finally finally okay so back to
the 1 plus 60 I don't know if I could
truly call this a simply iterative
update though because you know we've we
actually have physical very tangible
changes that go from 6 to 60 and
obviously we're talking about the lack
of a headphone jack they finally did
they moved away from it even though for
years they were saying they're not going
to put it away yet there's now the in
display fingerprint sensor which I think
everyone I want everyone to chime off on
that and also there are just the
obviously the fact that it's on t-mobile
we'll get to that in a little bit but
that in-display fingerprint sensor has
anyone ever viewed this as a not really
I don't want to say game-changer because
it's still a fingerprint reader at the
end of the day but is it that much of an
innovation forward that warrants the 60
leaping forward well it's the first
phone in the United States to include an
on display in scanners so that is a big
deal the second thing is it's just
interesting that you notice when you set
it up that it took a little bit in issue
like it didn't really get it right at
the beginning and like for the first
couple of tries it was just giving you
issues and then by like the after the
tenth time you unlocked your phone
it just works now have you noticed that
it truly does learn from you for the
first a fingerprint for the second
fingerprint though that I'd registered
on it it's still having issues it's
still learning but that's because you're
most likely using one more than the
other yeah I think that's true too
that's why yeah for sure okay so in
display the fingerprint sensor I
remember when this whole trend was
starting to come about people were
really excited because you could touch
any part of the screen for it but of
course that's not the case now it's a
very specific area that shines a light
on your fingerprint that's the full
realization of this technology is that
in the not-too-distant future you'll be
able to just put your finger anywhere on
the screen and boom I'm not Jones in the
podcast everyone oh now is a lightsaber
yeah the whole it's higher for Darth
Vader and we're on you guys are bullying
me and being very mature I just want to
point that out and you can thank you
thank you that's exactly who I am I
appreciate that you acknowledge it
finally oh my god so so uh Jones is of
course playing the unboxing right now
over on his side of things
he's in the booth of course Taylor did
you take a look at any of the coverage
of the oneplus 60 that that we all did
and any thoughts on this phone this is
this is kind of a hot one despite not
being the most unique phone yeah well
one I was recently called out for saying
something along the lines of the most
unique apparently it's either unique or
it's not it can't be more or less unique
anyway stolen that out there because I
was called out on it recently but I
think this phone is probably one of the
most intriguing to me because as someone
who's not been in the game for so long
this is a phone that you know it's
something as a general consumer I would
buy it just because the price so the
value I guess is the better way to put
it the value of this phone and that's
really their play that obviously that's
what they've been going for for
like I guess since I came around
originally but yeah I think that alone
is enough to make me interested in this
foam regardless of any of the
specifications or anything else
yeah well going down the specs just real
quick snapdragon 845 you can get 6 or 8
gigabytes of ram 128 or 256 gigabytes of
on-board storage
the display is a 1080p display it's an
AMOLED display with that little teardrop
notch at the top which is the selfie
camera but also what it uses for these
super fast face on vlog I have to admit
one thing I like about the way the
fingerprint sensor is implemented on
here is if it fails more than once it
turns on the screen and looks for your
face and the face unlock is always fast
like it always no unless I'm mourning my
shades it knows that it's me so I'm
happy about that oxygen OS obviously I
want to get a few thoughts on I want to
get a few thoughts on oxygen no ass as
we move forward so first of all oxygen
OS the version of Android that I feel
like more so in the past week I've been
hearing from people is the their
favorite version of Android do we agree
or do we disagree oh yeah it's totally
my favorite I just wish they would adopt
like the pixel font instead of their own
proprietary but I love it hmm I have
actually never used it
I won't you will very soon tailor you
just give me a couple of days to finish
filming a couple of things and you will
have a unit as well but bear in mind
like there are differences there so the
t-mobile unit is actually not the same
unit as the International in a couple of
things first of all it's single sim
second it's locked to t-mobile which I
wasn't expecting and it does have a few
t-mobile applications that I also wasn't
expecting to come ok which ones were
that well what sorry would show what
chaps were those from t-mobile you know
the typical so you get to the typical
mighty mobile app and then the other one
is to be able to unlock your phone which
didn't work I wasn't able to unlock my
phone are you supposed to pay to unlock
it off of t-mobile if you would answer
that is a good question I don't know man
but it just it told me the phone is not
eligible and period that's it
according to joules you have to pay off
the you have to have 40 days of
consecutive use first
and then after that pay off the balance
of the device which of course is a
t-mobile that's the one that's I think
seven five seventy nine I think is the
is the price of that one because they
have the eight gigabyte and 128 gigabyte
storage mirror-black Edition yeah yeah
and that's another thing that's actually
an exclusive like if you can get the six
gig a 68 128 from one plus but if you
want that mirror-black
eight gig 128 it can only be gotten on
that on t-mobile right now a couple of
quick takes on some more device stuff
before we get into the t-mobile portion
of the story which I personally really
enjoyed and for one particular reason
Jaime and I went to the pop up in the
t-mobile store so we'll talk about that
a bit
that was crazy go for it yeah alright so
first of all the the display this is
gonna be a very typical question to ask
for a phone like this 1080p is it's
still not enough or is it just enough
still i I don't know about you guys I
1080p is more than enough I find it that
way what are you about what about you
Brandon I have always been a pixel
peeper and like it's fine for me I mean
the DPI is over like 400 and over like
you know if it's over like 350 or even
300 in a lot of cases you really can't
notice any pixelation or display quality
issues so it's perfectly fine for me
yeah it's never too much never to the
barrage oh no that's not very why does
it never mind anyway Taylor um 1080p yay
or nay on you it's way more than enough
it really truly is and and that's
actually the reason that I only make
videos in 1080p is because 4k is really
only valid if you were looking at it on
a large screen and relatively close to
it on that like a computer monitor sure
a TV sure but a phone it's so far beyond
what you can actually discern that it
doesn't matter I mean I was talking
about this stuff back in 2012 hey like
when qHD was first coming around it's
like okay this is getting to be a little
excessive
excessive only because you can't really
see it and if you can the
mount like it is well past the point of
diminishing returns yeah I think was I
think it was Jonathan Morrison he did
that compare some of the sexually right
here the 10r beside I think it was the
poco phone uh okay and he was saying
this one's a 720p screen or maybe that
the polkas 1080p and this one is 750 P
yeah yeah so I mean it doesn't matter
like you put them side by side it's more
about for me
the color accuracy and that's rather
enjoy my being oneplus said it on stage
themselves it's not about the numbers
it's about the user experience which is
why we talk about the oxygen OS which is
why we talk about these displays I want
to remember everything that you guys
just said though as we get into our
MacBook discussion a little bit later
anyway but let me talk about that this
way but there are a couple of changes
that are not necessarily good one of the
things that I loved about the 1 plus 6
is that if you went into full screen
mode for video it would not reveal the
knotch like it would automatically hide
the knotch the moment you zoomed in to
full screen video so you wouldn't be
able to see it whereas in the case of
the 60 the NOx is visible it does go
there pretty much like in the iPhone 10s
which pisses me off I'm like it steams
yes but it doesn't really matter it was
like this is something that shouldn't
have been changed like I 1 plus was the
first company to do it right with the 1
plus 6
why break it with the 60 is it really
good is it really that big of a deal
Jaime I mean like 27 men 27 pixels are
seriously can you imagine can you
imagine going to a movie theater and
having the person on one corner stand up
and put their head and part of the
monitor and cover it up it's not that
it's gonna be a big of a deal most
likely everything that you care about
the movie is gonna be aside from the
guy's head but it regardless it's a it's
annoying
does it does it offer the option to zoom
out you can't no no this is only when
you zoom into full screen video and I'm
the problem in any way late but the
problem is the problem is and by the way
commenters and listeners this is the
reason why we haven't made the move to
18 by 9
you don't need a you don't need a pillar
box it's not pillar boxing what's the
other
you don't need letter boxing on your TV
and notches are good there's no way for
you to avoid the knotch disruption on 18
by 9 video if you have a phone that that
you know doesn't cover it up and so like
if you're using a pixel three excel you
oh it's bad if you're using a pixel
three excel so that's the reason why we
stick to sixteen by nine video for a bit
yeah so I wonder if you we will have to
test this for our for our full reviews
as they come if you go into the settings
and you hide the notch if that kind of
fixes that but it's not an automatic
thing like it wasn't a one plus six it's
yeah that's a good question I haven't
tried it I will but then again you know
the notch is not intrusive it's not
doesn't bother me for everything else
like for daily operations it doesn't
really cause me anything to be annoyed
about I just I don't like that one thing
that was so well done on the six is
screwed on the sixty if you disable the
knotch
either through developer options or
through you know the regular settings in
display i think it's unethical to
disable pixels I do like what do you why
would you turn off pixels and reduce
your screen size you know it would be
with the exception of the pixel 3xl
everyone.i one final thought on the
oneplus sixty camera have you used the
camera quite extensively we're gonna
talk about this real quick talk about
t-mobile and then head out because
Brandon it has to have my head out
Brandon has a head so I was I actually
just came back from running some
comparison test between the 10s and the
60 I you know the photography on the six
was good these are the same cameras they
call for an enhanced HDR I do notice it
on the screen but I do want to pull the
photos out and see them on the computer
because I'm giving a verdict because
visually because this for some reason I
just find them to be brighter and more
saturated on the on the 60 than on the
10s I would rather pull them into a
computer and see if that's really the
case
okay fair enough um yeah I've been able
to go through it a little bit the port
remote seems to be working fairly well
on the rear on the front they have the
face retouching and if you look at my
Instagram I did do one photo where it
was me and then another photo that
wasn't me because my freckles are gone
to like a defining feature of my face so
so the face we're touching
Taylor you you you touched upon this
earlier that the price is a big part
about this and the base level model of
this phone comes in at 5:49 which is a
great price but even then 579 on
t-mobile and if you do the payment plan
it's only $12 a month for everything
that this phone is doing is this is this
the do we have the return of the never
settle mentality like they never use the
term flagship killer anymore no one ever
does so that's fine but is the Neville
never set old mentality back now that
this phone is and over 5,000 stores in
the US because of t-mobile i mean i'm
cana sneakin sitting down to this and
going to get one myself oh wow I've been
considering it because I have the s8
plus Stein I'll keep the unit here no
problem I won't sure that's the only
physically buying it because this is my
newest Android phone as the eight plus
si plus and I don't know I've always
kind of teetered on that line of wanting
to buy the oneplus or not and having it
available and and I shouldn't I know I
shouldn't but having it available to
finance to carry or just make it all
dollars a month or I think the upper end
the iron version is like close to $20.00
yeah something like that twelve dollars
it was via trade and I think that's what
Jules was trimming enough on I know I'm
a sucker I know financing and trading in
your phones is like the worst way to do
things at least from a financial
standpoint like I don't want to drop a
thousand dollars $1400 on the phone and
really truly five hundred and seventy
five dollars yeah for anybody out there
for anybody out there who's looking to
get or to suggest a new phone for any of
anybody in your families who have
to be on t-mobile this is a compelling
phone it's it is compelling to the max
because it is not only an affordable
phone but it does everything that the
other phones tend to do and then some we
are going to go ahead and wrap up on the
oneplus 60 I know that Brandon has a bit
of an out right now so Brandon if you
wanted to give any final thoughts before
you bid us farewell for today James Earl
Jones please you guys are really you're
gonna miss my delectable voice the new
me Taylor
learn to love it it's all right well I'm
gonna drop out I'll talk to you guys
later all right see you later man all
right Jaime and I will get into our
experience around the t-mobile / 1 + 60
experiencing a little bit later we're
gonna do that during our break but for
now let's jump into what happened just
the day after oneplus did their
announcement we're talking about the new
Apple products so there was this like
there's this invite that came out that
had like this drawing of an apple on and
they said knuth like more things are
coming i think it is i think is what
what they were saying on that invite but
i actually watched the keynote and i are
surely do you watch it there i was
actually getting excited for the new
macbook air like I'm using am a book X
Pro right now so I'm I'm obviously into
the Ultrabook life at the moments so I'm
really excited I was really excited
rather to hear what the MacBook Air had
to offer and then I heard the words
dual-core in a second wait let me and
are you using the no scam right now no
I'm not I'm using because I could turn
it on right now if you want here let's
say there's like anyway that doesn't
know on the huawei mate book X Pro
there's a little hidden cam that's at
keyboard level so it's gonna be looking
up here if Fe if I were to turn it on
right now so I'm using an actual webcam
and then my camera my actual DSLR is
behind it
wishing it could be used but for some
reason I had technical difficulties
anyway the MacBook Air
smaller bezels it's faster it's it's
it's lighter I mean it's a MacBook Air
and
from what I remember of the keno the
main thing they were talking the entire
time
I just remembered laughing when I heard
this they were saying and we brought the
feature that all of you really wanted a
Retina display and I was like that's the
one everyone wanted like that's the
feature that everyone was clamoring for
on a notebook that should be available
for creatives and for and for people who
want to be artists I don't think so I
think the MacBook Air sorry Taylor go
for it I was just saying I've used a
MacBook Air a recent MacBook Air and I
don't know switching back to that
display after having used a MacBook Pro
and the 12-inch MacBook it was kind of
tough so I think I think I think it has
a lot to do with um like especially when
I was photo editing and stuff on on the
12-inch MacBook comparing that to doing
some on my sister's MacBook Air it was
just it's just better like if you're
using the MacBook for what we do it
definitely matters but then again
nobody's like video editing or anything
on the MacBook area yeah and just a
photo edit unlike the 12-inch MacBook or
I'm sure this it's pretty intense
especially if you're dealing with like
real large images I mean this camera
puts out yeah something like that
yeah definitely um yeah I remember back
one mr. Fisher well as I think I think
in his last month's with you guys
he was using a MacBook Air that I had
everything and I thought he was a crazy
person it was all he used the MacBook
Pro for a year but he used the like a
first generation act book here for a bit
and that was if I'm not mistaken here
that MacBook Air when we were in Eva
yeah no I I used I used the MacBook Air
for video editing for about a year and
uh you know it was good enough it wasn't
great no it was it was a 30 minute
exploit that wasn't that bad and then I
jumped to the MacBook Pro and I went
from 30 minutes to three
you know pretty much mm-hmm I was I was
just thinking to myself you know cuz
I've been in the market for a new laptop
for all I've been using I know I'm
finally you have been a newer one and
I'm very happy with it
so I was actually really interested to
hear what the MacBook Air had to offer
and like I said like it's an 8th gen
Intel processor but it's a dual-core one
and it's made it's it's one that was
catered to dudes but that's the thing I
mean the the the MacBook Pro the 13-inch
barely got quad I wasn't expecting the
MacBook Air to get to get anything of
anything close to a quad like there's
just no way forget it there's it's not
gonna happen this is Apple and this come
this computer is not triggered for
creatives it's a business people's
computer where you're gonna type in
emails and stuff like that now now that
being said you can use it I mean it's
got two Thunderbolt three ports not even
the new MacBook has that uh two
Thunderbolt threes like it literally is
like like a mini 13-inch MacBook Pro to
a certain degree it's like a lesser
version of that MacBook Pro it doesn't
have the same clock speeds but you get
two Thunderbolt threes you get touch ID
which you don't get on the non touch bar
MacBook Pro for example you know so
there are a lot of things going for this
computer like I would be willing to use
a MacBook Air like on a trade show and
not carry a macbook pro just because of
the love you know it's 2 pounds less on
my back but you know that's just me I
know a lot of people that would swear by
their MacBook Pros and that said where I
prefer portability yeah that's kind of a
said if I have at the moment I have the
Ultrabook that may book and then I have
an e GPU that for the last two trips so
far I have had this EGP you set up in my
hotel room ready to ready to do the
rendering as I use this on whatever
floor I'm on so I do get that there's
some cover so so there's some to happens
big GPU that I will admit exactly and
that's really the probably the biggest
point about this MacBook Air is if you
want the extra horsepower you can
connect any GPU yeah you know so that's
one of the main reasons I'm like wow
this computer is actually no slouch it
is not but it's still a big ask for
1,200 bucks
definitely the my biggest problem with
that MacBook
is the 1200 they're pricing it like the
old 13-inch MacBook Air that's the thing
I mean if they would have come up with
the 11 inch which a for me an 11 inch
MacBook Air with just one Thunderbolt 3
port and stuff like that I would have
loved that thing yeah but still at 900
bucks at 11 inches that was I had one of
those 11 inch MacBook Airs I really love
that thing so I don't know I I guess the
starting price is literally the same as
previously with the old MacBook Air and
I you know I think that they they have a
purpose for it you know they're adding a
lot of stuff that is really hard to find
right now and a lot of like if you look
at any $1200 you know regular Windows
laptop Thunderbolt 3 is not easy to come
by and at most you're gonna get one port
at most you know and you're probably not
gonna get the best display in the world
I mean even that maple gex Pro that
you're using Josh that thing is like
1,500 bucks yep mmm it comes to
dedicated graphics it comes with a 6
core processor true that but it's a
$1,500 computer and you don't have
optimized applications for it like Final
Cut Pro for example which is the other
case you know it's not just the computer
it's the fact that Apple does offer a
suite of software that will take
advantage of dude you can added video on
a new MacBook if you want it's gonna
take you an hour and a half to render
that video but you can still edit it
without background rendering yeah that's
true I have I have toyed with the idea
of moving to Final Cut Pro but I'm you
know I'm happy with what I have right
now but yeah for $1200 I I wonder where
it's all hundred dollars I wonder who
has who this particular MacBook Air is
for and I think that I mean the number
one the number one answer at least in my
eyes is someone who had the previous one
and wants the new like display and that
makes sense to me but I still think that
a 13-inch MacBook Pro even priced at
let's say 1,800 that has dedicated
graphics and a 6 core processor would
have been like an immediate buy for me
what I think is that Apple needs to wake
up and smell the coffee about the
MacBook the non MacBook Air that
computers should not cost more than 800
bucks exactly like I get
that there was a lot of R&amp;amp;D to create
that computer and it took two
generations but right now it's gonna be
like you know the new MacBook is now
gonna be $9.99 and then we've got the
MacBook Air at $12.99 I feel that that
that would have been a good balance
right now the new MacBook is like it's
still 1300 I'm like no I'm not gonna for
a year and a half and just for writing
mainly and I would have tweet but I
would have bare or whatever writing app
just a basic minimalist writing app and
Chrome and that thing would just bog
down right but you were using non apple
applications we go back to the thing
like it's it's like Windows with Windows
10 s and even so like I'm currently
using that Samsung Galaxy book too by
the way it arrived to me three days ago
oh my god even running Windows from with
the approve apps for Windows 10s even
running slack on that thing is slow AF
and it's a bat and it's a $1000 computer
oh yeah all right well I do want to make
sure we spend a good amount of time on
the iPad which is why I want to ask for
a hot takes on the Mac Mini here's
here's one thought that I want to give
out there for someone like me who's
always looking for the optimized way of
going how does this sound to you guys a
Mac Mini bringing just that with me and
maybe the Huawei just so I have an
ultrabook to use on the show floor but
if I want to do like the hardcore
editing stuff back in my hotel room
Mac mini HDMI into the TV of the hotel
room how does that sound terrible you
know the TV's is gone not bad
that's these monitors are the worst like
you get this resolution this is this is
so funny to me though that like they
make many computers okay Jill says buy a
portable display I agree but still it's
but why would I have the laptop thing is
what I'm saying
but the Mac Mini is it's a portable
device not made to be portable that's
the thing that drives me nuts about
these kinds of products no everything I
asked for - like an 8 Gen 6 core
processor it has great storage options
it has four Thunderbolt 3 ports so talk
about your easy GPUs there's no butt
butt-butt-butt see
that's the thing I would rather carry
Annie GPU and that's it
okay fair you know I you you sold me on
that I just wish EGP use weren't the
size of my bike did you still need a new
GPU with this Mac Mini though right oh
yeah graphics 630 like yeah what is it
what is it what is it with these I
that's always integrated graphics I mean
like again just talk about the me book
it's just one example of it the MX 150
it is a it is a dedicated processor a
graphics processor that can be put into
these ultra books that they should have
which is not really good let's face it
it's not amazing but it helps it yes
it's not really that great I mean I
understand the Apple in the sense that
you know what why require the extra
space for the for the GPU if it's not
gonna be great
yeah that's true by the way I made just
so you know the gigabyte horas it's the
smallest easy GPU out there if you are
interested and not sponsored just sayin
the six core edition of the Mac Mini
again does not come with dedicated
graphics starts off at 1099 but it can
some wouldn't explain to me this maximum
edition that comes in at $4,100 like
what is going on i I guess they I guess
they had that Mac Mini server version
which wasn't cheap yeah and you've
already got your monitor and you want a
maxed out computer call it on quote you
can get that I mean instead of 10
Gigabit Ethernet
6 core i7 2 terabytes of storage on that
thing and if it's still that small like
wow you know how come you know I get it
but I but I would rather buy a Mac but I
would rather buy an iMac Pro for that
amount of money and also get the display
and the keyboard and everything because
that's the thing it's $4,100 without a
good keyboard or mouse or display you
know so once you add up all this stuff
you end up buying an iMac Pro yeah
agreed
alright so let's get into the one that
the refresh that everyone was waiting
for and talk about how the iPad pro may
be pushing the envelope but also kind of
step them back a little bit
and by that of course I mean there's no
more lightning port it's a USBC device
and I see how me already was shaking his
head okay so I I'm hoping if you listen
to what I'm about to say I'm hoping that
there is a USBC it's a lightening dongle
yes cuz I'm so loaded with lightning
accessories for iPads I'm like alright
man
could you just add two ports of that
damn thing one USB see one lightning and
make everybody freaking happy I mean
you've got you've got the space that
would make too much sense Taylor I
wasn't expecting such a such a realistic
remark for me right but if we're gonna
do that they would probably charge
another two hundred bucks just like add
two ports two hundred bucks you know
like there should be there's a hundred
percent there's gonna be a USB seats of
lightning because they did say on the
keynote that you could charge your
iPhone with it so of course it's gonna
be USB see the Lightning they already
make that that is true there is it no
but but after but no but I need but I
need a I would need the inverse
connector cuz I have a male Lightning
and we're talking that there's USB seats
to mail lightning so I need email yes or
female USB see no I would I would need
me I would need mail yes sir male USB
see two female Lightning is what I would
need yes okay it's like my microphone my
microphone for the daily requires a
lightning connector and I prefer using
an iPad because I'm able to see my waves
on one side and the script on the other
and it's just more practical but yeah
it's sure I could just go back and use
an iPhone instead but I would prefer
using my iPad my iPad pro for everything
that I currently use my nine point seven
inch iPad pro you know they're gonna
charge like $80 for that adapter right
you're so optimistic I was expecting 100
but fine
Belkin will wait six months and they'll
come out with one for thirty so how do
we feel about this I'm so so how do we
feel about some of these other change
on the iPad pro like obviously we have a
better display again liquid retina as
they love to use the Retina display
terminology face ID there's no home
button anymore uniform bezels the Apple
pencil is magnetically docked on
therefore for both just mounting and
finally charging in a way that makes
sense
thank you yep exactly a 10 hour battery
horrible idea yeah Apple pencil on the
12 inch I had a 12 point 9 inch iPad pro
2 Apple pencil and it's like this wide
when you're just I know it looked like a
painting cabin so it was the worse the
Apple a 12 X this is a larger version of
the a 12 so it has a has a lot of good
processing put that thing on a keyboard
you can do a lot of things that the
Ultrabook can do actually so there are a
lot of bits and pieces to this entire
iPad pro ecosystem just to show how it
can replace a laptop which I thought was
funny they were like iPad pro store
anybody who doesn't want a laptop but if
you do here's a macbook air so they're
trying to cover every base even though
the they made it clear the iPad pro is
probably their most celebrated device of
this particular event but you're also
still spending as much as you would on
the laptop exactly I mean it starts at
$7.99 but goes all the way up to 18 no
no no so I did the math the one that I
ordered is 1250 if you want the keyboard
and you want the pencil and the 256
gigabyte iPad pro cuz you can't buy an
iPad for 64 gigs I'm like seriously
Apple like you just can't that's
ridiculous well because they got Adobe
up on stage for the keynote and all
version of Photoshop on there which I
thought was great but they need to
optimize Adobe Premiere rush just came
out whenever whenever Apple comes up
with like a final cut light that allows
at least three to four layers of video
editing I would be like okay we've got
an iPad pro now well Jules is a believer
in rush apparently he just chimed in
premier brushes great apparently I gave
it a little try and it's got a limited
amount of layer
and you know it's like literally like
iMovie no it's not it's it's like
Windows Movie Maker almost Pro like
almost pro but not there ah okay the
biggest thing I need is photo editing
but the the photo editing in Lightroom
mobile now is fantastic to change your
presets and stuff which is beautiful
it's amazing but then again I just I
don't know I still have a twelve point
nine inch iPad the original twelve point
nine and I love it I just maybe I've
just got an old or cheap or the the
impending doom of having my first child
oh did I congratulate you on the cast
yet about that like by the way I haven't
been around in a couple weeks I
apologize man
it's made me that's a lot of diapers you
know oh my god this is that that's like
two iPad pros right there you know these
did I get instead of a crib so who-who
is this okay so hi Mia you actually gave
you or example of why an iPad works for
you you use it as your waveform and
recording device for the audio that's
one good example of how it's practical
to have this large screen here who else
is the iPad pro for if you have an iPad
from before the new one yeah rich people
serious note like the reason I got the
twelve point nine inch iPad pro is
because for the last four years my
primary job has been writing I've been
writing and not making nearly as many
videos as I do now and I used it as a
writing tool which is it's a very
expensive writing tool but it's a it's a
distraction-free writing tool like it's
limited in what it can do and I used
that as a benefit like you can do
multitasking on an iPad but it sucks and
I use that to block out a bunch of
distractions and use it as a writing
tool that is a good point that is a good
point I love using iPads for writing
scripts I just there are things where I
like there are people that don't need a
computer I'll give you
the example of my sister she has never
owned a computer all she uses as her
phone for absolutely everything that she
does from bank transactions to
absolutely everything she does not know
what it's like to own a computer so I
know a ton of people for where you know
computers are overkill all they need to
do is respond to email browse the web I
just feel that iPads got lost with this
whole pro moniker where I feel that iPad
should not cost more than five hundred
files yeah that for me is the problem
iPads and Chromebooks should not cost
more than five hundred bucks and so it's
very good no and so for me if like the
whole composite of buying an iPad
meaning the keyboard and the and the
stylus would be eight hundred dollars it
feel like it's it's an impulsive by I'm
like yeah why not you know it's it's a
it'll be that light thing that I want to
carry to a briefing that I don't want to
carry a computer and then I could also
use it for my for my shot list and
everything it's so practical that's me
but I'm not gonna lie like we were
discussing it with a Brandon and I'm
like I think I'm better off with my
existing iPad pro I don't feel a need to
upgrade because of the price it is too
much money for a product that's
convenient but not you not fully useful
as useful as a computer it's just
convenient I also forgot the the other
main reason I got the iPad pro is
because I was camping and you can't just
like move a bush out of the way and then
in the tree there's a outlet here which
I could charge with the solar panel but
it's the anchor powerhouse oh yeah yeah
a power but I can charge my iPad with a
power bank to three times I can charge
it with the powerhouse at 10 times or
more I could charge my laptop maybe
three or four times yeah that's that's
the big thing there is USB power being
able to charge things Mowgli when you
don't have access to an outlet and
that's the other big thing for me
especially for like students if you're
in a classroom and you need a laptop
with with a if you need power you might
not have that
matter what classroom you're in you
might not have access to that AC power
but if you've got a power bank you're
good for a day it could work that way I
agree that was one of the biggest
reasons for me buying that is it's not
having to lug around a big power brick
everywhere I went I just had a power
bank toss it in my backpack and I could
go for I could work for two or three
days but I having to bring other
charters with me yeah for sure okay um
by the way I am looking in the chat
James W agrees with Jaime in regards to
your use case scenario of the iPad who
you he also said that the iPad is still
not going to be a replacement for
laptops for most people pretty much all
people really I'm still not going to get
to that point
Adrian Rozier says never been interested
in the iPad sorry a bigger device is one
thing but once we have a device for
every single little category it starts
to get a little ridiculous in my eyes
like I would have loved to have
something like an iPad but I already got
the Ultrabook and I already have like in
my case the pixel at the moment but I'm
reviewing a lot of different phones so
any of these phones that have come out
in October so yeah I think I have most
of my most of my stuff most my bases
covered
okay so we got through all of that we
have the oneplus 60 and also the Apple
announcements which happens back-to-back
with that just like when we were
covering all of those events we need to
take a little break so we're gonna do
that right now all right here we go
couple of reads for this one the pocket
not weekly is brought to you by the
National Security Agency almost every
day we hear something on the news about
a cyber attack sometimes it's just a
bunch of pranksters but more often it's
a foreign country with vast cyber
resources trying to hack our power grid
our banking systems or our military's
information networks the National
Security Agency plays a big part in
protecting our country from cyberattacks
and you can help the NSA is hiring
technical professionals to serve on the
front lines of information security if
you work in computer science networking
programming or electrical engineering
you can help keep our country safe
design new hardware systems and networks
write faster smarter programs protect
America's infrastructure or help uncover
what our adversaries are planning to do
next learn more about careers at the
National Security Agency today visit
intelligence careers gov slash NSA
that's intelligence careers gov slash
NSA
all right the pocket not weekly is also
supported by one plus if you've had your
eye on the one plus sixty and we all
have had some good things to say about
it with it's in display fingerprint scan
or teardrop notch and impressive
specifications you can buy one now
starting at five hundred and forty nine
dollars that is half the price of many
other flagships and with frequent
software updates in that oxygen OS and
top shelf components this phone's gonna
run fast and smooth for even longer
order yours now by heading to
pocketnow.com / 1 + 60 alright and we're
back as our little uh a little break
occurs there we have our last let's say
fifteen or twenty minutes of the show
talking about man I don't really have a
whole lot that I can or even wants to
say about this one so over on Pocket now
you can head over to the red hydrogen
one review and drills are scrolling
through that thing right now that yes
Jaime's laughing this is what we're
ending the show on is the over hydrogen
what oh my god did you see it Michael
had it Michael Fisher yeah you know run
with it for a little bit I think was a
Rick yes so what were your impressions
let's start with that okay I what I
thought was a okay just just by the way
it looked the red hydrogen one seems
like a Frank and razor because it has
that like really blocky but then they
added all of these like textures to the
side and whatnot
it's it looks like a branding nightmare
because like it's almost as if red is
trying way too hard to make this phone
look different from everyone else
because you want to know that that is a
red camera a red phone now to make it
look tactical yeah it's ACTA cold out
that's the one tactical tactical attack
to cool I think we have the name of our
podcast now um the the other thing was
that I'm trying to remember who I didn't
turn it on but a couple of the people we
were hanging out with who are using the
phone turned on the 3d screen effects
and I was like oh cool that's the
feature I turned off on my 3ds like I've
never I don't know I it doesn't do
anything for me and from what I can tell
the as has been the folly of many a
phone company over the last over and
pretty much throughout the history of
smartphones when it comes to the camera
it's not that the camera itself is bad
it's that they don't know how to tune
the software for it yet and it seems
like that's the problem the biggest
problem right now with the red phone the
red hydrogen rather so honestly it's a
phone that's trying way too hard to make
it clear to you what it is
without actually fundamentally making it
what that is you know red four cameras
this is not a great camera apparently so
that's what I've been hearing at least
ya know and if red is gonna make a
camera and not or a phone and not make
it the best damn camera around what's
the point yeah you don't have they
shouldn't have to explain what it is
about this phone that that's so unique
it should be red made of foam it's a
really good camera phone if they did not
hit that mark it's a failure and can you
know what what gets me is like okay
Taylor so you you've been as you've been
saying out of the game for a while but
you've been able to see the evolution of
smartphones and what these companies
have been able to do over the years of
improving their phones and whatnot why
is it so hard for a new player to come
into the game and not already understand
the lessons every other camera or every
other phone company have have have
learned like you just have to look at
smartphone history to know don't do that
or do this or do that it's like the
used-car lot I don't remember who it was
but somebody explained it to me it's a
there are a lot of them around here and
I'm sure everywhere in America probably
around the world where there's this one
spot in a Township or whatever that's a
used-car lot it opens it's around for
six months a year it shuts down because
I didn't get any business so the next
one moves in there like we can do this
better and they're the exact same things
happen and then it it's just like it
recycles over it over and over and
nobody ever learns anything and it's
that same situation downtown Concord so
I live in Concord North Carolina this
downtown area there's this this shopping
mall in the downtown
area that's inside there are a bunch of
shops in it and it's like one week there
will be a Thai restaurant and then
they're gone and then another Thai
restaurant comes in and they're gone and
another comes in and they all make the
same mistakes and I can't explain why
yeah because it looks like all the same
all the same Follies are occurring with
the red hydrogen right now case in point
the very top portion of the review by
the way everybody packing.com slash red
hydrogen one review the red hydrogen one
review each word has a - by the way so
like segment those so head over to that
review and the one of the top portions
of it not only about the buying
experience because red did not provide
this unit he had to buy it is the whole
modularity portion there supposed to be
a camera module a battery module a 2d
cinema module none of those wrong yet
it's it's it's the it's the Moto's well
then again moto Z it had modules
available at launch this doesn't even
have that and moreover to the point
we're gonna talk about the story a
little bit later that the titanium
versions of this phone were completely
flubbed up not even not even made
available at the way that they wanted it
to be and you know there's do you really
go over to the go go over to the review
like there's there's a lot to unpack
here Jaime I think he needed a minute
but are you back yeah and I'm back sorry
about that so no like Adam had a
horrible experience starting with the
buying process like people pre-ordered
and he got billed immediately and then
didn't get a phone for a full year no
emails no apologies no nothing to start
with that and I think josh has paused is
Josh Foster is he gone he's just so
flabbergasted by that I know that's
rough man that's rough like they should
not charge until it shipped no that and
that's the first thing in that and then
Adam compares it to like the Nokia what
the n900 I think it is from like five
year at the n8 how old is that phone
Jules is that 2009 or something like
that 2010 it's 2010 2011 I have one
somewhere yeah for install it so yeah
near friends still
exactly and so like it's literally it's
like if it's like if the razor phone
that I have right here the right shape
it's like if the razor firm that I have
right here and the Moto something had a
baby and I don't think I've ever held a
phone that's heavier than that one I
have never heard how the phone that's
heavier than the that than that red
hydrogen one anyway I don't know them
but it's Gramps it is horrendous ly
heavy it's really bad and can somebody
ping Josh I think he doesn't know that
he's frozen I think he doesn't know that
he's frozen yeah he's cool he's fully
gone but yeah I 7 ounces holy crap
that's dude that's more than half a
pound that phone is heavy and so you'll
say like yeah no but the iPad weighs one
pound yes but the iPad is this big and
so the weight distribution is far better
on the iPad then on that chunky like
it's funny when when Adam reached out
and he's like dude do you wanna do you
want me to send you my unit cuz he
bought the phone do you want me to send
you my unit for review and I was like no
I don't after after holding it with with
Michael after seeing that holographic
photography I am like alright
this phone is DOA like I'm sure that
there will be fans from red that will
bite and those same fans from red will
not be I don't think they'll be stupid
enough to keep it
see I was also asked by Brandon if I
wanted to take a look at it
and yeah the reaction was like doesn't
have an amazing camera because otherwise
nope like it's it's a gimmick if it
doesn't have a great camera yeah and for
reference this is seven and a half
ounces and this is heavy
this is yeah it's just weight
distribution is everything if you're
gonna make a phone you can't make a
phone that heavy because again it's just
it'll give you your it'll give you pinky
strain like whenever you're holding
the phone to type it'll give you pinky
strain it's too heavy maybe you need to
do pinky workouts good point good point
oh sorry guys my wife ice decided to
reset itself for whatever reason okay
exactly okay so it almost seems like
everybody has these problems with the
phone even the people who are trying to
sell the dang thing because Verizon have
gone ahead and Quarantine to their units
the day before the sale was meant to
happen
so there's just there's still like there
are people who are just saying that the
phone is just going to be sold at a
later dates but I'm being held people
who want to Verizon wanted to get their
phones they weren't able to and it's
just it just seems to me like this
entire thing like if there's any company
that has the resources to be able to
make this comfort that this phone come
to market it should be read but look at
all these problems that are happening
right now so are we going to call this a
DOA like is this going to be is this
considered a deal wait are you calling
it and calling it
I'm calling it I'm sure that there are
fans out there it's just here's the
thing let me just put it to you this way
a lot of people are like yes but the
modules that are coming I'm like alright
guys if the phone can you Larry
ever worked it no but but that it's not
just that if the phone can't even handle
Android well if it can't even handle its
own operating system well how are we
expecting it to be any greater with with
out of complexity yeah like it's you've
heard it here folks do a look if you and
you're like hey we've also got these
attachments that you can put on and
it'll make it even better no if it's not
good enough without attachments it's
deal way like I don't want to carry
around attachments for my phone because
even even the specific use case
scenarios for a phone like the hydrogen
one don't seem like it they're enough
for people who own red cameras like
could you see mkbhd actually buying this
phone just to use it as a second monitor
no I don't think you would use it as a
phone I mean if there's just no point I
mean if that phone worth 200 bucks I
wouldn't buy it it's I'll put it to you
that way
phone is so bad if it were worth 200
bucks I wouldn't buy it like in and let
alone if it's $1,200 and I think it's so
much um I can get a far better
experience
not even a far better I can get the
experience that a smartphone is meant to
do with the 1 plus 60 I I would not even
I'd like again I this is one of those
reviews that I was like not interested
no thank you
whenever you've got like whenever you've
got like generation for you guys let me
know but this phone is like wow it's
just all it took was five minutes with
the phone to realize my god this is a
very it feels like an early alpha not
even a beta of a product yeah okay so
the just to make sure we cover our
stories here apparently the first
production run of the titanium version
is literally just not gonna ship that's
that's that's other it's just they just
said no I'm sorry like that's a very
expensive mistake yep
very expensive yeah he acknowledges the
CEO Jim Jannard says that those who paid
more than 1,600 dollars to reserve the
titanium edition of the phone they're
probably pretty pissed off and they're
gonna be waiting much longer than the 14
months they've already had to wait for
the phone like yeah when the CEO is
already saying guys we screwed up I get
that you're mad but what can we now and
then you've got all like the image image
processing improvements on the
snapdragon 845 which the 835 doesn't
have and so like you're using last
year's camera technology and so people
are like yes but the modules I'm like
guys can we just let's let's accept one
fact this is a phone phone the oh let's
Mitch let's make sure that it can be a
phone first that it's good enough on its
own as a phone like if Jim Jannard would
have been like yes but it's got a red
camera sensor it's the first mobile full
red camera sends boom I'm gonna be like
alright fine
I want to see that that I want we the
only way that even remark ly a remote
I'm a burglar remotely it moves the mark
is if that sensor is about the size of
this camera hump yeah I've been singing
that forever like I think that there are
companies out there like GoPro who
already do great jobs with their sensors
how come we can't just like shave that
off and put it on the back of a phone
read could have definitely could read
could have done something like that
something radical like that
and I think Sony needs to start blurring
the lines between it's you know rx100
and its phones yeah I mean if they could
put a 1 inch if they could put a 1 1
inch sensor on a phone 3/4 inch half yes
sir you know we're right now we're
talking about like eight inch sensors
yeah so tiny so if you can start
building out a bigger sensor I would
carry a thicker phone I would carry a
phone that's twice thank you it's the
iPhone 10 if it had a bigger battery and
a massive sensor and I would I would be
okay with it just being an OK phone and
a fantastic camera I'd be okay I'm
really happy you said that because I do
want to I do want to just call out a
couple of things going on in the live
chat right now a few people are saying
like you know you're seeing this about
the red hydrogen one but what about the
fact that you know you're just saying
that the pixel 3 is so great when
obviously it has so many different
problems well this is the thing the red
hydrogen one is failing on all fronts
like we don't look past the problems of
the pixel 3xl the knotch the display the
software stuff like that yeah
Android P the way it is right now
annoying to use in a way those gestures
I personally don't like them at all it
is not the most optimized device out
there you can look at the oxygen OS
software it's for that kind of
optimization yes there are problems with
it but here's a phone in the pixel 3
that actually gets it right when it
comes to a couple key things and one of
them is camera if the case with the red
hydrogen one we would look past all of
these problems but it's not to doing
that it's not actually killing the
camera game as in anyway I'm trying to
understand the purpose for the phone
it's it's are you telling me that this
phone has the capability of replacing a
brain for a standard red which yes the
brain is $20,000 on its own and so this
phone will serve because it's a smart
phone it's it's
smarter than a camera brain technically
if you think of it if that is the
purpose for it and we're waiting on the
sensor to attach which is what I've
heard I've heard that they'll will there
will be a red sensor that will attach to
the film the question is then does the
purpose of the phone mean that it's
gonna become the brain if that's it
and they just haven't explained it well
or they have and I just hadn't I haven't
paid attention well I just god I like
how much are all those modules gonna
cost and how is that going to be better
than buying a Sony a7 three for eight
hundred dollars more yeah that is the
big question like listen people go buy
yourself a one plus six
buy yourself in a 7-3 and you've got two
things that are really good on their own
yeah that's what Taylor is using right
now that's oh he looks so damn good I
was supposed to use my GH five right now
but the freaking I don't know I
hopefully I'm better for next week or if
I'm even here next week so here's a
question that I want to pose to all of
you like we have seen partnerships
happen between companies camera
companies and phone companies that have
actually yielded great results while we
like oh come to mind shouldn't have read
just partnered with an established
entity we're just right at which is read
like like like you know which is read
you know I think the Motorola did it
right with the whole concept of the
Hasselblad moto mod but then they
screwed up in the implementation and so
I think that read should have just
created a module that attaches to
certain smartphones and partnered with
somebody but not try to make a phone
yeah exactly
Samsung I know Samsung makes some
cameras but that's not their Forte
Samsung should make the phone and read
should make the camera honestly Google
Google should have just gotten read into
like their fold because if there's one
huge problem that I just have a lot of
trouble looking past with that one
Pleasant with the pixel 3xl it is the
audio pickup of the video the video is
not bad but the audio pickup is terrible
so if you were to enhance the video and
then make audio better and then put red
in there to like create codecs for the
video that make it look amazing blah
blah blah that would have been awesome
like that kind of thing but there's just
a certain level of we got this and
clearly you don't so sorry red like
point to our phones with all these mods
and attachments turn into like the
vlogger cameras you know I've been
waiting for it I mean I've vlog with
smartphones all the time and not one has
actually proven to be the best for
vlogging at in any case I thought the
pixel 3 would be that phone because of
the wide-angle front but the but there's
no OS on it so it's always so jittery
and the audio pick up is terrible so
like I'm saying like the phone you know
they're trying to push all these
attachments and mods and and eventually
your phone is gonna which don't exist we
haven't even seen that's true but I'm
saying you're gonna be holding a phone
and it's got a detention on the top and
then on the bottom on the sides and then
you know it just it's a Franken phone
right there the quality of it's not
there it's a lot of waste of time and a
lot of wasted money somebody should just
spend the money on R&amp;amp;D and get it right
and you know on the market with
something that's half-baked and fast and
you know what red in your defense we've
got the Amazon fire phone you're not the
only company that has screwed up a phone
really badly so you've got that yeah but
that was my question to Taylor earlier
like there have been so many examples of
these things going wrong and why
wouldn't they make it so that they don't
make they don't make those mistakes you
know I would I would have loved
situation I would have loved the USBC
smart phone adapter ah $1000 USBC smart
phone adapter then you can snap to any
Android phone in a way you remember
those Sony those Sony like attachments
for experience but just work for
experience it had its own separate
sensor its own zoom lens and and if it
would have liked it the equivalent of an
aps-c or Micro Four Thirds sensor that
you can attach to an existing smartphone
red that should be your business I'm not
making the phone I would buy that
someone on the chat said Leatherman
needs to make a phone you know I read
I'll give you I'll give you this much
credit I have I did not look at your
phone
I would have liked to but it's not like
I even got contacted by you guys to
actually get a unit or anything
that I will tell you this though you are
you're inside well I mean I just wanted
to say like you know I could look at
your phone it is actually going to come
to market in one way or another at least
you've done that whereas another company
like touring never even got close to
coming to market no so I'll give you
that much credit so it the funny slowly
attachments a few people were using them
I remember I went to a couple trade
shows where someone was using it to like
record their content for the shows but
now that kind of died
been in there so yeah they weren't
terrible they were basically where we
are now
with smartphone cameras like you know
they were ahead of their time in that
sense but they had to be this thick for
that to happen but now we now we have it
given phones like the made 20 pro and
whatnot so it's good okay so we've been
able to cover all of that I want to wrap
this up in a couple I just want to check
in on everybody one last time
tech tober did not kill us thank God
phone pocalypse we are definitely all
really tired I know I am myself I'm
behind I'm not behind on reviews like on
my personal channel the you know but I
have all of them to do still what's up
next what are we looking forward to for
the rest of the year it's the holiday
season at this point is there anything
coming up I mean sorry sorry I apologize
I was interrupted for a minute what did
you say I was I was checking what's
coming up next like cuz I have a table
full of 1 plus 60 mate 20 Pro razor
phone the pixel 3 these are reviews I
haven't been able to complete that it's
Jame god it's it's been so crazy then I
had issues with my pixel the razor phone
didn't have final software the mate book
the may 20 pro didn't have final
software and we're still waiting for the
final build of work behind not
intentionally it's like you know it's
it's the crazy amount of announcements
in addition to the fact that some of
these phones were in ship complete that
all that's true it's becoming a bit of a
cry and I know that there are
publications that already have the
reviews out if they want to do it with
pre-production software that's great for
them we don't do that kind of stuff we I
would rather be late and not get the
views but do the
do the job right that's just me and
that's just us oh yeah definitely and
you know to to all credit to any of
those other publications I have seen a
number of different reviews that say by
the way this is pre-production well
updated if anything crazy how is then
how is that a review well I agree
you know what throw shade is all I'm
saying
you know I'm not trying to throw shade
it's just it's just no and by the way
this is not me throwing shade at other
publications it's the contrary I mean I
know that all of us have a certain
amount of pressure and their schedules
are probably tighter than ours oh and so
it's like it's one of those things where
it's like we need to get this review out
because we've got so many more things to
do you know all most of these are
dealing with more things than just
phones it's just the problem is you know
when I read the comments and it's like
like for example I did an opah find X
video recently and everybody's like yes
this review is horribly late and I'm
like what do you want me to do oh they
were only giving out China phones they
reached out to me offering a China phone
what am I gonna do with a China phone in
the United States yes it's not gonna
work so I was like send me the phone
where I can wear it were to the United
States and I will definitely review it
and it took that long yeah but you know
by the way that's the reason for a
couple people in the chat right now
we're asking where the me makes three is
that was the Chinese SKU that I was
using there you go yeah you know and and
so and it's one of the reasons why I
didn't even review them we mixed to us I
did a hands-on but then they ended up
sending me the final review unit we US
software so late it was it was not
relevant anymore I you know honestly I
was I was I was even considering not
doing that fine next review if it wasn't
because that phone was so cool in my
opinion and so that's the thing you know
some people are like we have a horrible
schedule coming up we've got more travel
to do the reviews are gonna come up but
they're gonna come up when we you know
they're gonna happen but you know we we
just we I hate rushing stuff man but it
just doesn't work that way yeah and a
few of them I know I know I would love
to see your thoughts on the me a -
honestly like it's an Android one device
yeah the me a - I would love you to you
later on but abut the highest-profile
thing right now in Taylors a camp would
be the iPhone 10 R which you can look
forward to that as well and yeah on that
note look forward to all of that there's
a lot coming up you're basically gonna
see a review like every five days so I
think the the reviews are going to be
coming out throughout November there is
some travel still coming up I'm gonna be
taking a look at a new Opel device in a
week so like you can look I don't know
if I'm gonna be here on the podcast for
next week but we'll see what happens
then and then there's a lot of stuff
coming up after the words after all of
that as well so at the end of the line
of course there is CES so hopefully
we're all gonna be together for that I
think registration is open right now so
that's something for us to do but yeah
on that note we're gonna call it on this
