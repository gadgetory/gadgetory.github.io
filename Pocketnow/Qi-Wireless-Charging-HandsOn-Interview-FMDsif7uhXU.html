pocketnow.com here at Las Vegas still at
CES 2013 this is the fun part
we're here at chief to just learn how to
bounce not we as we've been
mispronouncing it over and over again
but I'm here with Steve from Qi who's
gonna answer a few questions for us on
the current state of the Qi wireless
charging and maybe a little bit about
the future we've currently got on the
market yes so this area here really is a
highlight of the different phones and
transmitter pads that we have that are
released and available today on the
market so you can see that many
different phones that are released such
as the HTC s the Nokia Lumia this is a
Bluetooth headset from Nokia here is a
here are some back covers for the
Samsung Galaxy s3 there are several
products that are available in Japan and
you can see some of the different
charging pod Caesar from Nokia frequency
different types of designs this is what
he speak well on that one before I've
never used the Fat Boy a speaker this is
the basic view this has this insight
just has the standard what other
circulate inside the pillow okay
this is the stand which does the same
exact box
so much I go ahead yet so there are some
other different types of stands here so
you can see from down here and this one
here is that's just not at all your
department you know what we don't worry
about the communicators and this is just
the core of it is just inducted like
p.m. induction right I can't unfold we
have instead of the coils being it's
linked they are separate the idea is
there's 130 companies whenever you build
a payphone it works on any or a
transmitter
it works with any receiver and any
receiver works with any transmitter
there are now I think in Japan they are
rolling out ten thousand different
tracking statements
in retail establishments like coffee
shop right so the idea is when you want
you have a phone you move you go to a
public area you want it to work in a
bargain and with it like is this so this
is a portable return
yeah so you charge your battery and then
you plug this in later and charge your
iPhone so it's a little power pack
basically the charge is about you
pocketed where you're traveling around
you plug it in via microUSB there that's
very nice longer range is a good
question I think why might I think the
first challenge with longer range is
working with furniture because today the
standard is designed to be work with a
few millimeters and here five
millimeters of Z cap and which is fine
for just placing your phone on the pad
but if you want to upgrade furniture you
means you have to drill a hole
information so I think you proved
distance the first focus is going to be
to allow you to bolt a transmitter to
the bottom of a table and then you can
charge your phone top of the table so
over here we have
this is a new version and this is called
qi+ so this is a or adaptive residence
this is a new version of wireless
charging so you can put two receivers on
the pad and you can also get efficiency
there in any sense the efficiency gets
worse we see it drops with increased
distance even on the ones designed
specifically for it so that's yeah right
is this another vehicle charger here
yeah this is so there is no the big you
know the big thing interesting market
for the ecosystem is car charging so you
obviously have bluetooth in the car my
ability to charge off the charger phone
is very important this is a prototype
system from negative class okay major
accommodate pretty much just announce
the wireless charging in their new
vehicle so that's what this thing over
here is over here
thank you
so this is like the culture so this is a
very exciting that they're adopting of
first consumer production available
super long range of process room would
you say so I think it ultimately is
cutting the cord on your person adding
products you're cutting the cord getting
rid of the power of I think it's a
primary goal it's less about distance is
more around convenience I think you know
today the focus is very much on cell
phones and things but if you think about
other application like industrial
medical systems then you know there's
lots of battery-powered applications and
medical they don't want to have contacts
because they want to have the
hermetically seal things industrial want
to get rid of contacts because of dust
and things so there are some practically
attractive elements of getting rid of
contacts of connectors of wireless
charger you can just just charge
directly through a barrier that'll keep
of that seal in place for at least you
have medical they have
totally sealed things that you just put
it to ball to clean and tape out again
we used without a recharge without
having to worry about important things
like that yeah so it's really about
mostly about convenience but I think
there are some some applications that
drive a practical ability and finally
just my last question would be and you
know there are some other standards out
there like I know the Energizer of the
Duracell or whatever those you remember
the brand name I'm talking about you
know I mean there are other standards
out there that are also making
aggressive pushes into things like
Starbucks and the things like retail
establishments and that is still
incompatible the tea is a totally
different standard so is there there
must be some element of competitiveness
with the standards butchers I mean is it
something where you feel like she is in
a good place relative so I think we
think she is in a very good place
obviously it is a new technology and
there are some competing standards so
she today is the only one that's out
there which have products with
integrated wireless charging built-in I
think it's very possible to do a back
cover which is where they're competitive
competing technologies are today but
ultimately the trick is to have the
electronics have built into the products
so you don't have to buy your own
separate skin for the technology to work
and I think that's where the WPC is that
is ahead frankly with with a large
number of members and also the large
number of products are now have been too
great a wireless charger Steve thank you
very much thank you very much once again
from CES 2013 in Las Vegas
thanks - gee thanks to Steve who's to
everyone keep watching for a whole lot
more coverage as CES rolls on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
