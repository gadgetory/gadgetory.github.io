phones in a bunch of accessories to
check out motorola has well outfitted
this review package for the Moto Z and
the z4 s and unlike some other modular
phones which we won't mention we can
jump right into showing you the initial
batch of Moto mod add-ons I'm taking a
quick look at what's in the Moto Z box
we've got the phone of course which I
almost dropped that's awesome moto
includes a woodgrain backplate which is
a nice touch we got some papers which
I'll totally read after I'm done with
this video there's a turbocharger though
it's important to note that the cable is
built-in and there is no separate USBC
cable in the box for folks who connect
to their phones to computers and as
these Moto's lack headphone jacks we get
a headphone adapter that plugs into the
USB port this handy little strap also
helps keep your headphones connected to
the adapter though it does add a little
bit of bulk and cracking through the
z-force box I almost dropped this phone
- and it's outfitted almost exactly the
same as its leaner brother alongside the
phone's we have the to me battery back
the Lenovo projector and the JBL speaker
back a plus Verizon also sent along this
handy carry case to keep all of your
moto mods well organized nice touch
there walking around the phone Hardware
little has changed since the lenovo tech
world unveiling event but moving to a
dark front face keeps the overall
appearance cleaner than the dots and
sensors we saw on the white panel moto Z
these are sleek and well-built
phones these devices share largely the
same overall platform similar internal
specs though the z4 s includes the
shatter resistant display a higher
resolution camera and a significantly
larger battery it's thicker and taller
but moto engineers have done something
really clever with the tapers here
sliding to the rear of the phone these
line back up with the dimensions of the
regular moto Z so the two can share the
same moto mods this might mean future
Motorola's won't be constrained to
exactly the same dimensions so long as
the camera is the same shape and same
distance from the bottom pins this is
very clever very early impressions these
phones feel nice in the hand the
using at least a mod backplate will
probably be the norm I just don't see us
using these phones naked and we'd
probably want to keep those pins clean
on the bottom the side buttons are
clicky but there's not a lot to
delineate the feel between the power and
the volume buttons the fingerprint
sensor is a touch on the small side but
it is a quick performer like we
mentioned on the Moto G however it feels
strange to use this hardware to turn the
phone on and not have it also double as
a home button the long press on the
sensor turns the phone back off I'm not
used to that at all it's not bad but
it's really unfamiliar bottom of the
phone is home to the u.s. PC port top of
the phone holds a micro SD and SIM card
tray the back of the phone is home to
the camera bulge up top and Moto mod
pins at the bottom the front face holds
the 5.5 inch quad HD AMOLED display with
a 5 megapixel front-facing camera that
also has its own flash the first boot
happens radically fast it would probably
jump even quicker wear it not for this
Verizon intro and the center process is
reasonably smooth though there are a lot
of Verizon add-on menus before dumping
you into your home screens I also find
it a bit disappointing that the phone
will finish the initial setup on LTE and
that it never asked me to sign in to my
home Wi-Fi Verizon must really need me
to use their data and of course there's
quite a bit of value-added software
pre-installed caller ID Verizon cloud a
gems game Empire game whatever this is
hotels.com message + NFL mobile slacker
Verizon Navigator and Verizon protect
and most of these can be disabled
otherwise we have a pretty clean moto
style build of almost stock Android I
actually wish we had a few more options
to play with as the home screens are
pretty stark I accidentally left on the
option to add icons to the homescreen
installing apps but NBD we can just
delete these home screens but no we
can't there's no way to change the grid
size it's just a 4 by 4 grid of 16 even
though 5 icons look just fine
below in this dock maybe if we remove
the Google search nope that just stays
up there as empty space and our main
home screen is always the leftmost
screen so I'll probably be installing
Nova Launcher to replace this a quick
look at the moto mods this connection
method is very sick
your magnet snapped the mod to the phone
and a little pin here helps lock the mod
in place there's a tiny bit of wiggle
but it holds together very well and
easily supports the weight of the phone
for mods that contain their own
batteries we have power indicators that
allow you to see the capacity of the mod
without having to snap it onto your
phone and the JPL speaker also has a
handy USB port to charge the mod
directly a hardware option we hope to
see on more mods in the future the
install action here is instant snap the
mod on the phone chimes and it's ready
to go no hardware swaps battery poles or
resets required this really does feel
like the first proper joint venture
between motorola and Lenovo and the Moto
Z's give off a stellar first impression
how do these to perform in real-world
conditions what's the difference in
camera performance or battery life and
what exactly do these mods really bring
to the table well you'll just have to
stay tuned for our future Moto Z
