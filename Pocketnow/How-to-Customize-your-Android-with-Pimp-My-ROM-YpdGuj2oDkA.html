what if you want more than that or what
if you don't have a custom ROM and still
want to be able to customize your
existing wrong luckily some guys over at
xda-developers have some really
interesting things and somebody put them
all together into a really interesting
installer I've never seen this kind of
installer before I think you'll like it
let's go pimp your rom so what I've done
is I've headed out to xda-developers and
I've downloaded this package it's in a
dot zip which is just like a custom ROM
but it's not you don't have to have a
custom ROM you do however have to have a
custom recovery image like clockwork mod
which we talked about a couple days ago
in the Android power user so if you
haven't got that you'll want to go and
do it now this package is called pimp
your ROM or pimp my rom I forget which
says paper your ROM here but pimp my rom
comes to mind it's version 1.5 from
October 3rd so not that old it's
actually version 1.5 one according to
the the download link that I followed
what I've done is I've rebooted into
recovery mode and I flashed this it's
about a hundred and thirty Meg's so not
small as soon as that was done flashing
it didn't reboot instead it launched
into this installer so let's go ahead
and hit next to continue it with the
installation gives me some Terms of Use
essentially saying if you break it not
this guy's fault
it does require an Android device a
custom recovery and a brain oh okay that
was a brain joke you see that okay I
agree next and it says please take this
only the first time you pimp your
current run well this is my first time
so let's go ahead and do that
the reason being they're going to backup
your original build dot prop file that's
a property file by the way has a whole
bunch of variables and their values
don't tick that if you've already pimped
your current wrong because then it's
going to be backing up a not an original
build prop file which if you ever want
to go
Eck would be bad okay what version of
Android am I currently using well it's
asking me an AOSP based rom or a stock
rom i am running an AOSP jellybean
CyanogenMod 10 nightly so I'll select
that a little less selector mark next to
it and I'll say next
what tweaks do I want to install this is
where it starts to get really fun do I
want to install all tweaks that sounds
kind of dangerous to me so let's go
through them individually you can see
we've got a long scroll list here
internet speed tweaks speed is always
good on the internet battery consumption
tweaks I hope this means it's going to
help save battery consumption not
consume more so let's go ahead and say
yes miscellaneous kernel tweaks
absolutely stroll up on demand governor
tweaks sure this helps with your
overclocking underclocking dynamic
clocking and whatnot
not really over/under some people say
that it is it's just dynamically
adjusting the speed of your processor
dalvik VM tweaks again another topic
that we covered in Android power user if
you haven't watched it go back and do
that I'll have a link to the whole
series at the end of this video for you
now all of these changes I might add are
happening in the init D file do we want
to defrag all of our SQLite three
databases yes that'll make anything that
accesses the database is faster disable
logger I never submit logs anyway I just
live with them so I'm going to disable
that disable normalized sleeper I don't
know what that is so I'm going to leave
it off use strict min free handlers
again no idea non rotational flags
blocks I don't know improve ext4 file
systems performance okay that's always
good force GPU 2d rendering I have a
couple apps that I use that this does
not work on so I'm going to leave that
off miscellaneous Ram tweaks on improve
multitasking on ABS sequel Lite tweaks
on at experimental tweaks hey that'll be
fun I have backed up my entire run
before this by the way install various
in it the smoothness tweaks smooth is
better enable external
SD card IO tweaks I don't have an
external SD card
unfortunately Google cache use adblock
hosts no you know what I'm a web
developer web developers get paid by
looking at ads when their customers look
at ad so I'll leave that on zip line
apks at each boot on if you don't know
what that is again Android power user
enable main Thunderbolt I have no idea
but that sounds awesome
tweak CPU and GPU tuning yup use CFS
tweaks sure I think okay I almost hit
the back button there use TCP buffers
tweaks this is internet stuff yes
optimize sequel three or single light
three databases on alright and we're
done with the init.d we'll go next bill
dot prop install all tweaks I don't know
I want to go through them one by one
3G signal and speed tweaks yes battery
saving tweaks yes camera quality tweaks
yes I do have a front-facing camera
maybe it'll work for that Wi-Fi tweaks
to connect and disconnect faster yes
Dalek Graham tweaks yes deeper sleep to
save more battery when in sleep whoo
that sounds fun dialing time tweaks I
don't have a dialer it's a tablet
increase JPEG images quality sure I
believe that's when you're taking
pictures could be wrong disable Koerner
kernel error checking no I want to know
when I'm getting errors locked launcher
in memory absolutely yes that way it
doesn't have to reload the launcher like
other apps if you come back to it after
a while
more internet speed tweaks touchscreen
tweaks remove black screen after calling
again not a phone allow purgable assets
yep scrolling tweaks and video streaming
tweaks and that's all for the the build
prop it looks like next enable disable
functionalities do we want to allow
dalvik to use JIT absolutely again don't
know what that is Android power user
enable hardware video hardware
acceleration if disable boot animation
no although that would make it boot
faster enable surface dithering better
images at the quality of pricasso
performance no enable HSUPA network mode
no I don't have it it just UPA radio in
here
disable ADB debugging icon I don't care
disable volume wake I don't care
disable setting of usage data sure
that'll save me some time and speed
button backlit always-on I don't really
have any buttons and enable 16-bit
transparency but that might degrade the
performance so let's leave that alone
extra apps do I want to install Apex
Launcher Nova Launcher no I'm kind of
happy with trebuchet miscellaneous apps
do I want to install any of these I'm
going to go ahead and install rOM
Toolbox now you know I won't do that
I want Adobe Flash Player I can do that
here on jellybean script manager that's
useful for running scripts ah plus that
sounds fun in let's do it in landscape
and then smart stay e^x that's very much
like the smart stay that comes with the
Samsung Galaxy s3 so let's go ahead and
write at next any themes I'm going to
install all of these themes just because
I'm a theme junkie add Open VPN support
don't ever use VPN I don't you might if
you do choose that beats audio
absolutely that's just a digital signal
a signal processor install adrenaline
boost script yep Sony Walkman hey that
sounds kind of fun s voice I know thank
you
and TouchWiz @ux launching with widgets
mmm not for me it says I'm all ready to
begin press install now to start and if
I wanted to go back and review some
things I could after about a minute I
get this message that says pimp my rom
is checking if all the pimpin went right
please stand by it unmount data in
system and says finished
enjoy your freshly pimped rom I'm going
to go ahead and finish that it asks if I
want to reboot now which I suppose if I
didn't check that it would just take me
back to clockworkmod recovery don't know
what that is
go watch yep Android power user a lot of
the things that pimp my rom does happens
behind the scenes but there are some
things in here that are not for example
I've got this new awesome beats DSP
manager so I can set a just a digital
signal processor with an equalizer for
my headset my speaker or Bluetooth audio
very cool coming back in here I've got a
couple other things for example whoo
plus again I installed the landscape
version I don't have a Hulu Plus account
so I really can't show you much but
there's the app it's right there on my
device really kind of cool if we keep
looking we've got a couple other things
I believe yep right over here we have
Sony Walkman and I don't have any music
and it's kind of confused between my
layout mode see if I can switch it so
here's the app I don't have any music on
here that I can show you no tracks
nothing a couple playlists but
apparently nothing in them but there's
the the Sony Walkman app everything else
is it does is behind the scenes it's all
in settings so now it's your turn head

the most advantageous tweak that pimp my
rom does is this something that you're
going to do we of course want to know
that as well and I know you're going to
