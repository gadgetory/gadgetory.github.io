iphones next month Robert Downey jr. is
HTC's new marketing strategy and Sony
will bring some high-end camera adapters
after all I'm hi Mary vera and no sadly
Michael Fisher has already confirmed
that he will not be wearing his Iron Man
suit for this HTC gig but this is
parking out daily let's start they off
with some official news we've all
complained about HTC being terrible when
it comes to marketing and they've now
hired Robert Downey jr. as their new
guru to figure out new ways to use the
letters HTC and new names and we're
still trying to figure out this campaign
is called HTC change you can watch the
first video and links in the description
and so far even though it's not as funny
as we expected it still is a step in the
right direction great to see that HTC n
on the unofficial news that are still
cool we finally get the first press
renders at least the leak ones of the
HTC One max and it looks like an HTC One
so links in the description to see that
as well now even though HTC put the
rumors to rest about the company being
sold the company that's actually making
it a strategy to get sold as blackberry
they just published their new thoughts
on what to do to get the company back in
the game and since their blackberry 10
launch was terrible apparently one of
the things of the company's considering
is a buyout in it thanks to wonder which
company will buy blackberry stay tuned
for that now we're just a couple of
weeks away from Aoife and Berlin we know
that the samsung galaxy note 3 is gonna
be one of the first phones to get
announced but we hadn't really landed
some official specs or at least from a
trusted source as we have today and
listen to this I'm just gonna say a
couple of things first of all five point
sixty eight inch display and the 13
megapixel camera with optical image
stabilization it does seem as a samson
plans to make this phone not just the
bigger version of the galaxy s4 links in
the description for the full list of
specifications this will be a hot phone
if those things are true it will be cool
now speaking of September all things D
has just pretty much confirmed that
apples next-generation iphone or iPhones
will be announced on sep tember 10th
this apparently will be the date for the
event and even though it's really hard
to confirm right now of all those iphone
5c and iphone 5s leaks are kind of true
well it's historically been that case
for the last couple
the years so September temp which is
just a couple of days after Aoife set it
on your calendar and finally for the hot
news of the day a couple of weeks ago it
was reported that Sony was working on
building these lens adapters for their
Sony Xperia lineup in order for you to
build these phones into a full-fledged
camera whenever you need to as these
lenses are apparently and dependent from
the phone they don't require the phone's
camera they just use the phone as
storage it's a really interesting
concept interesting idea they'll even
have their own battery power penalty and
we finally get the first leaked
photograph of this lens and it begs to
wonder I mean that leads me to the
question of the day judging by this
photo I mean do you feel that this is a
good idea that we get this lens adapter
instead of a big hump for a good camera
on a phone you can always carry around
in my particular case honestly if I need
a good camera I'm always going to be
carrying it so it's great to just have
the option to adapt it to my phone I
just wonder how the whole sensor thing
is going to work but leave us a comment
