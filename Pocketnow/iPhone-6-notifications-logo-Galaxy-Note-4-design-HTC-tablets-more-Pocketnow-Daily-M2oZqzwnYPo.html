to line up for notifications reports
mentioned that the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
will include a curve display and the
Spotify CEO claims that Apple wants
beats for the fashion I'm hi meri beti
and do any of you agree that the beats
headphones are fashionable because I
don't this is parking out daily let's be
in today with rumors rumors and more
rumors as there is nothing really
compelling when it comes to the official
news today those of you that are
interested in the Moto G apparently
there is already a successor in the
works but the big problem is that if you
look at the licks of the description the
specifications don't really change much
and we're really wondering exactly what
Motorola is up to now the fact that the
company is working on a product at times
when it's being acquired by Lenovo is a
great thing so hey if you're interested
in moto G it's actually a good phone and
for those of you wondering of HTC is
actually working on a tablet it turns
out the new reports from the famous
steps forever leaks are that there are
three tablets in the works apparently
the team one is the nexus tablet that's
already in the works but there is also a
t7 and a t12 and we're wondering of that
seven and twelve have to do with the
screen size whereas a t1 would have
nothing to do with that right apparently
these new tablets are already in the
worst we could probably see them by the
end of this year hard to confirm that
but it would be cool to see some more
than one HTC tablets in the market and
that phrase didn't sound right now one
of the most anticipated phones of the
year is the samsung galaxy note 4 we are
expecting a launch to happen at Aoife in
berlin during the month of September but
we've got rumors of three things number
one that apparently Samsung will include
a curved display that's flexible ok fine
but apparently there is also going to be
a metal body in this new note phablet so
you wonder exactly what's the point of a
curb flexible display with the metal
chassis that can't bend but even more
interesting apparently we are getting
optical image stabilization on a 16
megapixel camera Samsung has been
reluctant to embrace this technology but
yeah the note lineup does have a big
enough chassis so hopefully they do
consider it and for those of you that
are wondering
exactly how does the competition feel
about apples acquisition of beets well
to Spotify CEO was recently interviewed
and interesting instead of claiming
worries of any sort when it comes to
music streaming obviously he wasn't
worried because Spotify as a million
times bigger than beats music is but his
biggest statements where the fact that
Apple is trying to become a fashionable
company that that's the purpose that the
reason why the company has hired the CEO
burberry and the reason why they hire
the Tag Heuer employee for the iWatch
project this with the purpose of making
this a fashionable company and therefore
that's why Jimmy Levine and dr. dre were
hired it's really more about these two
people than beats as a company to bring
fashion to headphones to bring fashion
to the company and to make music more
appealing so yeah interesting points
from him do you agree leave us a comment
down below and finally for the
interesting news of the day we've got
some leaked photos of the iphone 6 pack
chassis and it shows us the whole
assembly for the future glowing logo of
the iphone 6 and according to the rumors
the reason for this glowing logo is not
necessarily just to go for the fun of it
apparently number one it's for the NFC
antenna to fit and number two it's for
this blowing logo to glow and give you
notifications whenever the phone is on
its back but it's hard as a I for
example don't like to put an iPhone on
its face on the table to not scratch the
screen so there is a sapphire display
and that does make sense though that
leaves you to the question of the day
how important is it notification LED for
you because in my particular case yeah
it is but it's not really something
groundbreaking for me leave us a comment
down below does this make the iphone
more compelling to you friends yes you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming she follow us on talking out

well he also follow me on twitter Jaime
