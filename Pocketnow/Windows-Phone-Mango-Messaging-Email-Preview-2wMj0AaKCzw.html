and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview okay now we're gonna look
at you from Natalie dren zemski you can
say read it or ignore read it okay so
what do you need me to do you can say
reply call or I'm done reply say your
message just send me an instant message
and i will reply to it using my voice
this doesn't mean instant message and i
will reply sweet using my voice you can
say sent more try again try again say
your message just send me an instant
message just send me an instant message
you can say sent or try again send
alright so i'm showing you the new
messaging feature that was an instant
message from windows live messenger and
i just replied to it using my voice
without touching the device or anything
now you can see the messaging live tile
shows one new message now this is going
to show new messages for incoming text
messages windows live instant messages
and facebook chat instant messages so
that's really nice that model
message from Natalie dren zemski you can
say read it or ignore read it okay what
do you want me to say you can say reply
call or I'm done reply say your message
yes that's good thanks yes that's good
thanks you can say sent or try again
send so there you go pretty cool now if
I go into the messaging app here we see
threads and I can see threads for her
and you see down here it says chat on
messenger so that means she's available
on windows live messenger and at the top
you're going to see messenger but if I
am talking to her on facebook or text
messages it's going to show me which
network each these messages is coming
from and down here I can see I can
attach pictures there's my speak button
so if I want to do voice recognition
right there I can eat that and switch is
going to let me choose a different
network so i can choose facebook or i
can text her on our mobile
so that's really cool and they're so you
can bite someone if you want to have a
multiple person chat and back here down
here we have status so i can choose if
i'm busy away blah blah blah i can do a
new message right there there's your
settings and right here is the online
tab so this is awesome to have we can
see everybody who's online with windows
live messenger or facebook chat and here
here we go they're all ordered by
alphabetically so that's kind of
annoying if you've got groups set up
either on facebook or when is live but
this really nice thing is it shows the
recent contacts at the top so you can
really have quick access to the people
leave talk to most recently so there's
some of your Facebook people
here's our settings we'll just look at
these real quick you can shut off
facebook chat you can shut off group
text that's about it so that's the
messaging app and it's really really
cool to be a look do no hands facebook
chat or live messenger instant messages
as well as of course text messaging
works that way too that's it for the
messaging app now let's look at email so
see I'll have one email account pin
they're down here I actually have a
linked email account and i called it
junk emails now this is the this is the
answer to unified inbox some people were
missing the unified inbox feature in
Windows Phone 7 because each email
account had its own life tyle you had to
go and find it and click on if you
wanted to but we have linked to emails
now so if you want a group specific
email accounts here i have my hotmail
and my google mail account linked
together so you don't have to have all
of them if that would be like way too
many emails I don't want that many but
you can group once it you know we don't
need to see all the time so the way you
do that go into one email account and
then down here is the LinkedIn boxes so
I can choose which ones I want a group
and then down here I can rename it
so that's really cool now here's another
thing see that this is a folder within
another account so sometimes you might
have some server-side rules that
automatically put certain emails from
certain people or with certain subjects
all into one folder it's really great
way to automatically organized emails
but with a normal email account it's
only the show once you no new messages
in your route inbox so this way i go
down here i'm already navigated to a
folder and then i can choose pin to
start and then i can see the email
account just for that folder so that's a
really great way to organize your emails
so that's some really cool features now
if you notice in the program's list junk
emails that appears only once it no
longer shows hotmail or Google email as
items in the program's lists they are
only available as a link linkedin box
but again if you want to see just the
emails from hotmail you just go to the
folders and then you can see those
really easily
now there's a few other issues let's see
drafts this is one thing that I really
hate I have some giraffes on my hotmail
email account but guess what they don't
show up I can't edit them this is
something you know other phones are able
to do but apparently Windows Phone and
Microsoft can't seem to sync drafts so
if i wanted to edit 1 or send one it's
not going to happen you'll also notice
let's go to
conversation view I can see which ones
i've replied to this only works with
exchange 2010 unfortunately I map email
accounts and older versions of exchange
do not work for reply or forwarding
status sinking so if you want to
remember which email reply to your not
going to be able to see that as an icon
one more thing that's new we don't have
context-sensitive search button anymore
in email so you have a new search button
right there on the toolbar so that's how
you can search your emails so big
features their LinkedIn box and pin to
start mating for the folder switcher
pretty cool that's it for now be sure to
check out Pacquiao com for our full
preview of Windows Phone mango with lots
of text pictures and more videos that's
it for now
