Twitter lately is if it's really worth
to upgrade from the galaxy note5 to the
brand new Galaxy Note 7 you'd think that
their similarities are enough to stick
where you are but that's actually true
and it isn't I'm high metal better with
pocket now and this is Galaxy Note 7 vs.
galaxy note 5 brought to you by deep
brand pocket now is Galaxy Note 7
coverage is made possible by D brand
manufacturer of precision cut vinyl
skins for smartphones tablets and other
gadgets go to deep brand calm slash
galaxy to pimp out your new Galaxy Note
7 if you do a little history you'd
probably remember just how polarizing
the Galaxy Note 7 was yes we all wanted
it to adopt the build of the s6 but not
at the expense of expandability
samsung's choice to jump a number
between the note 5 and the note 7 is
really not just about standardizing even
if looks can be deceiving
the hardware on the note 7 reminds us
more of the SF an edge than of the note
5 the added curves allow the note 7 to
be just this tall but 2 millimeters
narrower 0.3 millimeters thinner and 2
grams lighter weight distribution lists
have also improved as you don't feel the
same heft of the note 5 on the note 7
even if the differences are really
meager 7000 series aluminum is standard
on both but Gorilla Glass 5 allows for
higher drops than the generation 4 on
the note 7 internals are also more
powerful at least on paper between them
and the note 7 solves the biggest
complaint of the note 5 with face
storage doubling at 64 gigs and also
that being expandable both devices
sported gorgeous 5.7 inch quad HD
display but the note sevens curves allow
it to seem more like if it lacks vessels
and the mdn ie chip technology boosts
HDR playback capabilities there's also
an IR scanner on the note 7 leading to
more secure biometrics and a new Samsung
secure folder to help you keep even
applications private the note 7 also
includes a USB type-c connector compared
to microUSB the quick charge 2.0 and
fast Wireless
urging our standard on both about the
only disappointment and specification z'
between them is the fact that the note
sports a larger battery though screen on
time on both devices doesn't really go
beyond four and a half hours now
definitely one benefit of going note
seven has to be this ip68 water and dust
resistance where on the note five you
really don't have any and even though
most people are really careful about
their smartphones it's really great to
have the peace of mind of not having to
worry last but not least we have a new S
Pen on the note seven with a tip that's
half the diameter of that of the note
five allowing for a feel that's more
natural to write on than in the case of
the note five now that feel isn't really
complimented by much of a change in
software about the only new thing on the
note seven is the gift creator samsung
notes and the translator when it comes
to the s-pen all things which could
reach the note five with a software
update you can learn more about these
particular features in detail with our
separate s-pen video the company's new
grace UX that provides a cleaner look
and feel to the software experiences
definitely welcome on the note seven but
we assume that it might reach the note 5
in the future along with the blue light
filter that we've come to live on the
note 7 about the only thing that we
don't really believe will reach the note
5 or the edge menus given the lack of
hardware but even the new theme store
with separate access to wallpapers and
icon packs is all a software update away
hopefully and even while you wait the
galaxy note 5 continues to be a powerful
device that handles its user interface
just as well as the note 7 we're playing
games in addition to just sliding around
menus is just as much of a delight and I
don't really think the wit will be long
as features like game launch are already
available on the old galaxy note 5 so
you get the same enhanced experience
during gameplay one thing that's really
neck-and-neck are these cameras though
sure the note 5 has more megapixels at
16 compared to 12 but the note 7 has
larger pixels at 1.4 microns and face
detection autofocus there's also a
brighter lens at F 1.7 aperture compared
to F 1.9
and practice though you can't really
tell which camera is which during the
day in most cases both devices provide
amazing image quality and punchy
saturation deep contrast and awesome
detail if it wasn't for the galaxy note
5 the 14 16 megapixels the 16 by 9
aspect ratio you really wouldn't be able
to tell them apart I won't even talk
about the selfie performance because
that's nearly identical even with the
differences in aperture and in the case
of video recording the note 7 has a
little more stabilization in the note 5
but it's not like if the differences are
substantial so if you follow the theme
of this video you're probably already
getting the point that we're trying to
make with this conclusion the samsung
galaxy note 7 is definitely a more
beautiful more powerful more secure and
more ergonomic phone in the galaxy note
5 but it's not like if last year's model
as a slouch in any way if you're
currently owning a galaxy note 5 and
you're doing ok with non-expandable 32
or 64 gigs of storage you don't really
worry about getting your phone wet I'd
say you're pretty much okay sitting
around another year until the Galaxy
Note 8 comes to the market now if you're
thinking about which Galaxy Note to buy
then you should definitely go for the
galaxy note 7 there's more guarantee of
software updates there's ip68 water and
dust resistance it sports newer hardware
and this is not just the best Galaxy
Note but quite possibly the best
smartphone of 2016 this video was made
possible by deep brand the boss of vinyl
skins for your smartphone tablet game
