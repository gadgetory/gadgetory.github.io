now calm i'm on my way to the nokia
vente de where we expect to see some new
windows phone 8 devices let's check it
out
the red one
4x4 work
but it looks beautiful
for bright display
Galloway different live tiles in
different
sizes i got my wife my tile that's the
CNN at the gym belfie' where i was
talking about
the thing that really stands out for me
on this phone are kind of three things
and we talked about the brother day one
is the display itself it's so bright and
it's so responsive there's just zero lag
I haven't done the mitten demo that
Kevin Shields head but I can tell you
with your hands especially when it gets
a little bit colder outside a little bit
damp sometimes screen get a little
lagging in a little jumpy that doesn't
happen here at all
I love how bright the display is i've
been i've been playing with it different
light low light bright light and it is
absolutely awesome the industrial design
itself
I say it's just really nice evolutionary
step from the nine hundred and even the
800 facts got that nice curves which is
fits really well in the palm of your
hand I've got big hands it fits really
well here
I love the big screen size and it's a
hd+ two incredibly high resolution so
everything is really sharp really tight
I think my favorite thing on this well
no aside from all that in itself is
awesome is the camera
we talked a little bit about or actually
a lot about i should say
here of new technology
fast this thing takes pictures
pictures build
that's right
and tap it is pop focus
the auto image stabilization something I
really
see how the image just automatically
stabilizes
a really super clear photo on even when
you're bouncing around when you grow up
the train i lived in DC for a long time
i took the metro everywhere bouncing up
and down now you got a great picture off
of it
I want to show you one
so this is a
bollocks
so I got our working in hyper speed on
her phone you see everything else is
completely still the image
animate if your hand that I've actually
sped up the time loop so she's moving in
hyper speed yeah export that as like an
animated gif or something
really good question that i actually
don't know my head
can you show me the 820 and how the back
snaps off
I can actually snap the back off
absolutely
I don't want to try disassembling this
for music I said
as you said all these pop off we've got
I think seven colors is what we
announced
this was the red one it looks great I
love the fact that you can add that
wireless charging back to it listen does
not have that on there but if it's
something that you want to add if you
get the fatboy pillow you can just drop
it on I've been using the wireless
charging now for a couple of days and
it's it's life-changing
you don't actually have to plug it in we
just set up one of those clothes or
targets based on your nightstand tosser
phone in the nights
and wake in the morning full battery
it's pretty awesome
and do both these have micro SD card
slots or
we don't know
no I know the 820 definitely does but
i'm not entirely sure about me
check
all right thank you very much you got it
today he'll be running
Nokia Lumia hardware which commits
announced today
920
and become the Lumia
820 both brand new handsets the
personals running Windows Phone
so the defeat things that start out with
the night 20 the first is it is based
off of the award-winning design from the
Lumia 900 it's got a polycarbonate
through and through so this color is all
the way through scratch-resistant it
doesn't show much device second is been
an amazing screen
which writer twice as bright as any
other device on the market
wsvga wvga so better than HD quality for
supporting me
so there's a few things on here that
think that are really important the
first is the brightness for up their
usage
the second is this device has an amazing
camera it's got the PureView technology
and the reason that's important is you
want to compliment a great camera with a
great display so you're going to get
every ounce of benefit from the camera
and you launch the camera app I am flute
camp so as you know windows phone 8 is
simply launched cameras must buy the
and I say french
no flash button
video switching suit and a lens button
yes so this is a little Bobby just
announced so this is a great way to get
to those features of new lens as that
third-party developers can write right
from the camera
so by simply tapping on the egg
I can now start using that functionality
the right again
show me some of the set setting
available here
my head can't go there so I'm not about
today this part of the phone
so one of the great features that I love
and this is not a software enhancement
this is a hard one handsome it but if
something called row is optical image
stabilization yeah so the way that works
is going to rotate this when I start to
press the camera
it focuses the picture and now
what's happening is the lens in the
springs are actually stabilizing the
image using the transcript bill tried to
run to the device so you get these
really great photos that are not blurry
and they're great in low light
situations
and there you can see the difference i'm
moving at the same amount to see quite a
bit of movement
you
and the first thing you'll notice about
the 20s
how much I can take this off pretty
gorgeous screen
nasik Orson Scott
clear black technology you can see the
city and
absolutely gorgeous
very sensitive screen
fingernails
there's a bachelor sponsor
here's the new start screen see how
sure
the cameras and a mechanism camp
front-facing cameras of vga camera
this thing has eight gigs of memory unit
with an expandable memory card
kind of problem it's the same Snapdragon
s4 processor
so super fast
open it up
looks like I
changes with different colors that we
showed earlier
a microSD slot she can't thank you for
making this day for joining us
