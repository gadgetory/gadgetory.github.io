geun-hye calm and this is another
episode that Android application weekly
in which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started
android the lander is a pretty simple
game to play so the first thing we'll
have to do is select a world and every
time you be the world you can move on to
the next world so we'll select this work
right here the object of the game is to
propel your little android onto a flat
surface using these variable thrusters
so let's see this one looks kinda flat
let's try that and wait second hand
these are thrusters and hopefully he
lands directly on the space locust is a
great navigation program that allows you
to save the tracks and maps directly to
your SD card so you can use this when
you're outside your coverage area so
this program has many features which I'm
not going to be able to go through so
you can save the maps directly to your
SD card by just clicking here on record
and you can start according the mass
just move your finger around and OH
begin recording so you stop that can
also go to park which will show us where
our car is we can search for points of
interest and we can also go up here and
change the map to any one of these other
maps TV shows straying is a great
application for anyone that wants to
watch archived television shows of
various season so let's go here to the
simpsons and we'll just wait for it to
load and now we can pick any one of
these seasons so let's try season one
and we'll pick the first episode we use
megavideo to download the movie and now
we can start watching the first episode
of the simpsons season one directly on
our hands or device the paid version
does have many more television shows
available also this does require android
2.2 or greater zombie beef is a free
application allows you to turn your
friends or practically anyone else into
a zombie so always do is start here at
the new we can either select from the
camera or a photo okay so now that I've
selected a photo of one of my friends it
will begin processing
and now we'll turn them into a rather
frightful zombie if you touch the
picture the zombie will try to even
eating your finger and you can also
share this over Facebook and save it to
your device grocery IQ is a free
application allows you to add items to a
grocery list depending on which store
has those items you can also go and get
cute bonds and email them directly to
yourself or you can add them to your
savings card so this is pretty cool
because if you have a savings card for a
store all you have to do is add the item
to the card scan your card at the end of
your shopping and it will deduct the
coupon directly from your savings card
so that's a great thing to have to save
a little bit of cash so this has been
another episode the android application
weekly and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
leave some comments down below the name
is live wallpapers called blue skies
live wallpaper and there are two
versions available a free version which
doesn't have very many settings and the
full version which gives you many more
settings and allows you to customize as
many things to get the download
information for all these applications
just visit the link in the description
to be directed to Pacquiao's website
where we stored the QR codes and all you
to do is scan it with google goggles or
any other QR code scanner to download
them directly to your device thanks for
