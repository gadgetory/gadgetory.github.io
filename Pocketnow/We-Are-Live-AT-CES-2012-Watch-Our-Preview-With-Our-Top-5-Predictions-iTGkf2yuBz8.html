talking out common well you'll notice
there's no longer green screen behind me
there are no arts I've got a press badge
on my chest and that's right we're here
at Las Vegas to cover CES 2012 for you
as of now that's right it's that time of
year for CES 2012 to launch in Las Vegas
a lot of expectations are coming around
a lot of 4G LTE a lot of quad core
processors and tablets a lot to talk
about so let's begin with our top 5
predictions for 2012 CES and well on the
table the first prediction out there is
obviously Windows Phone there's a lot of
talk of Windows Phone happening this
year and bringing as much as LTE capable
devices to the market now there's a lot
of Nokia buzz around here so we'll
definitely get some nokia devices being
released let's wait for details and see
what nokia brings to the table in their
events and also if we will be getting
LTE on the devices which we don't see
that likely because rumors have it that
that's not coming until Apollo gets
released later this year now remember
that Microsoft usually launches products
or announces products sorry every
specific data and then they wait like
about a year to release them so that
could be the case we could probably see
that being announced right now and then
getting released in the fall time will
tell now in the second batch of rumors
we have been hearing about an LTE LG
spectrum and an HTC fireball coming to
verizon but what makes these devices
special is that they will be bringing
also DSM radio so these will be world
phones working on the LT Verizon network
and also city in May now again we will
be seeing most probably a lot of LTE
volte phones coming to verizon but again
that's also just rumors right now
speculation let's see what happens in
the verizon part of the event now
another batch of rumors come from sony
and notice i don't mention sony ericsson
anymore apparently sony will be having a
really good event that will bring more
devices to the table probably live as oh
me and also the a ova that have been
rumored now we don't have any details on
specs yet but hopefully these devices
will bring new sony 720p resolution
displays to the market because sadly
sony needs to catch up with current
specs the devices are already bringing
to the table let's see what happens now
what about until rumors have it that
Intel will finally come
back to the table bringing mobile
processors to the smartphone market and
apparently they're teaming up with LG to
bring their medfield processor with some
interesting specs though we're sadly not
sure if that will bring quad-core
processor that will bring a dual-core
processor what will it bring to the
table it's cool to see that LG and Intel
are teaming up again to bring a
smartphone again like last year and they
didn't end up releasing anything so
let's see what happens in the end for
Intel as LG because hey if Intel doesn't
do something quick arm is really going
to get them and well what other
smartphones are we expecting well we
don't have to even guess about the
Samsung Galaxy Note coming to AT&amp;amp;T
there's a big sign outside of the event
that shows it and well we are also
expecting that Motorola finally brings a
droid 4 to the table though sadly so not
sure about that but again we have a lot
of expectations for really good phones
coming up and we also want to see if
there will be quad-core processors being
launched there's been a lot of rumors
out there we could expect it from the
Tegra 3 4 or whatever processors put
again these are just rumors for now
let's see what happens in the end of
this event now that's it for today's
preview thank you very much for watching
remember two tunas up tomorrow because
we will be constantly uploading all the
hands-on videos are the devices that we
get there will be a lot of devices out
there a lot of tablets also that we will
be covering so we will not be waiting
we'll be uploading everything live to
our YouTube channel so remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
