new tablet but you can't decide between
Android and iOS well we've got two of
the latest examples of each here in the
studio so let's put them head-to-head
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Sony's Xperia tablet Z versus
Apple's iPad just a quick note before we
start while we took a gander at the
fourth generation Apple iPad and a few
earlier videos we're using the
third-generation iteration for this
comparison because that's the one we
have here in the office because most
buyers will be considering the more
modern iPad with its improved processor
and forward camera we're not comparing
benchmarks or app launch times we'll
only compare metrics that are equally
applicable to the iPad for our aim is to
give a slice-of-life perspective to
those buyers torn between these tablets
and we'll do that in three categories
build software and loose ends you don't
even need to pick these devices up to
see they're wildly divergent design
backgrounds
it doesn't take noticing the
manufacturer logos to know that these
are going to offer very different user
experiences the aspect ratio is probably
the most notable difference here with a
four by three aspect the iPad appears
chunkier on its face than the sixteen by
nine tablet z a perception helped along
by the fact that the iPad is indeed
about two-and-a-half millimeters thicker
than Sony's product picking the tablet
hub makes it immediately clear that the
iPad is indeed the more robust device at
652 grams it masses over a hundred and
fifty grams more than the tablet Z that
gives the iPad a more premium feel than
the tablet Z but it also makes it more
cumbersome one-handed use in landscape
is much more difficult and holding the
iPad above your face to read in bed
becomes a chore after a while the iPads
anodized aluminum casing is also
slippery in the hand while the
rubberized plastic of the tablet Z is
easy to grip it's not all wins for the
Sony offering though because of that
four-to-three aspect ratio the iPad
feels quite natural to use in portrait
orientation while the tablet Z turned on
its side is just bad hilariously bad
also the iPads thoroughly minimalistic
design with penetrations only for the
bare essential
like volume power and home keys truly is
beautiful
while the tablet Z is also an attractive
product its design is significantly less
streamlined its ports hidden away behind
finicky little hatches that aren't so
much fun to deal with but there is a
reason for those the ports themselves
provide for a microSD card for memory
expansion beyond the 16 or 32 gigs of
on-board storage the expandability not
found on the iPad and the port covers
make possible the tablet C's IP 55:57
and IP 5x dust and water resistance
ratings ratings the comparatively
fragile iPad can't match there's also IR
and NFC on the tablet Z in addition to
an FM radio features apple's product
doesn't include in terms of the displays
each panel is an IPS LCD with the tablet
ZZZ screen edging out the iPads and
sheer size by a little less than half an
inch the iPad though is the winner in
pixel density beating out Sony by about
40 PPI that's not really detectable
though and they're each capable of
pretty extreme brightness with the
tablet Z producing slightly warmer
White's readability in bright daylight
is right about on par and watching video
is a pleasure on each with the slight
edge going to the iPad 4 side visibility
the tablet Z's Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2
continuously adjusts the display for
optimum performance so we noticed more
saturation more often on the tablet Z
whether this is a plus or a minus for
you depends on your own personal taste
they're both outstanding screens in
terms of audio while we like the tablet
Z's speaker position at the lower left
corners better than the iPads rear
firing arrangement the Apple device is
the clear winner in terms of sound
quality yes the iPads single side
speaker is less dynamic than Sony's faux
3d surround effect but Apple speaker is
also louder bass here and frankly just
better all-around of course the much
more significant difference between
these devices is that of software and on
the tablet front the war of Android
versus iOS and increasingly Google
versus Apple is a fierce one on the iPad
you're given very little to experiment
with
with version 6.1.3 you get the same four
by five grid of apps and folders the
same pop-up row of currently running
apps and shortcuts the same Notification
Center we've been seeing for years
if you've used previous iPads or iPhones
you'll feel right at home and even if
you haven't you'll pick it up in a jiffy
that's the whole idea
Sony's custom build of Android 4.1.2 on
the tablet Z is a different story
because it's Android it's highly
customizable with widgets and custom
launchers allowing you to modify it
extensively to suit your own needs and
Google integration is tighter here than
on almost any other tablet now because
it's Sony the software is already
heavily tweaked for usability and a
unique aesthetic and it leverages the
tablet Z's unique hardware and features
like DoubleTap to wake and the remote
control app and there's also small apps
here for multitasking on the iPad the
reward you get for putting up with the
tired old iOS software is an app
ecosystem larger and more elaborate than
any other with beautifully designed
tablet apps that take full advantage of
the added screen real estate that a
nearly 10-inch screen provides you also
get tight integration with Apple's own
ecosystem of course and a pretty handy
virtual assistant in the form of Siri
should I buy an iPad or an Android
tablet that's an easy one check out iPad
at the Apple Store and you will see why
on the tablet Z you pay the price for
the type Google integration with a much
less mature app ecosystem with many
popular titles still merely stretched
out versions of their smart phone selves
and some coated only for portrait so
you're forced to use the Z in the least
appealing position possible depending on
your Android build you may also
sacrifice a bit in terms of
responsiveness Android has come a long
way but the custom build on the tablet Z
isn't as fluid as the iOS experience on
our iPad there's more to these devices
than ecosystems of course and like it or
not the camera is one of them Sony's 8.1
megapixel Exmor R for mobile camera
offers a lot of customized ability and a
ton of shoe
but it comes up short in the final
product with fuzzy edges and a
washed-out look the iPads interface is
almost maddeningly simplistic but the
output from its 5 megapixel iSight
camera is also far superior with crisp
edges and authentic color tones of
course the field of view on each isn't
great and come on you really want to be
that guy taking pictures with the tablet
but if you do then even if you use
tablet cameras for more practical
applications like scanning text these
differences might matter to you of even
more import might be how long the device
will last while you're using it the
newest edition of the ipad boasts
slightly improved battery life because
of its newer processor and on the spec
sheet its battery capacity of eleven
thousand six hundred plus milliamp hours
destroys the tablet ZZZ six thousand
milliamp power pack there are times when
spec sheets do reflect real-world
reality and this is one of them though
it's not as long-lasting as earlier
versions in terms of our own admittedly
unscientific testing the new iPad still
beats the tablet Z in endurance now
Sony's tablet does offer very handy
tweaks like stamina mode and highly
customizable power profiles to go along
with it so you're not going to bleed it
dry in less than a day but under our
normal testing conditions it doesn't
last as long as the iPad in moderate use
whether that compromise and the others
are worth the tablet Z's slim lines and
water-resistant rating remains up to you
similarly you alone will have to decide
whether the iPads incredible ecosystem
advantage makes up for its dull software
experience and experience very likely to
change when WWDC starts on June 10 then
again the mere presence of beautiful
Android tablets like the Z might spur
developers to finally give the Android
tablet app world some serious thought
with so much in flux you could be
forgiven for putting the iPad versus
tablet Z decision off after all they're
identically priced for the moment but if
you're buying right now the choice is
between a lightweight extremely portable
Google centric experience on a water
tablet with a light tablet app selection
and a heavyweight not as portable Apple
centric experience on a simpler less
expandable tablet with a massive
software and hardware ecosystem behind
it there's a lot to consider but
hopefully we've given you enough input
to make the decision a bit easier folks
