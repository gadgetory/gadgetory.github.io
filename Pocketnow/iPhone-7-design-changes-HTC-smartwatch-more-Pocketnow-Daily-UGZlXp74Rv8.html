might retain some of the basic design
elements we see more rumors claim that
an HTC SmartWatch might still happen
soon and the one plus three might launch
with better specs and deals than we
thought I'm high Meadow iveta and if you
don't understand the t-shirt then I'll
have to admit yeah I'm getting old this
is pocket out daily the official news
today start with deals those of you
after a smartphone at a good deal one of
our favorite ones the next bit Robin is
currently on Amazon until May tenth for
299 you can bar this phone on lock for
399 the website but hey the deals
available it starts on May fourth ends
on May tenth and yeah I really like that
phone another product that might be a
very interesting deal and always is is
the feature one plus we assume that it's
going to be called the one plus three
and we've been hearing that this product
will bring snapdragon 820 1080p display
in addition to four gigs of ram and all
the specifications are great I mean
that's the standard flagship but
apparently the price is just going to be
three hundred and ten bucks now that is
a deal's a call for we cannot wait to
hear more after the launch of a product
like the HTC 10 is hard to not be
excited over whatever else HTC is going
to do and we've been hearing rumors that
we should expect that probable Android
wear or proprietary operating system
SmartWatch to happen on the week of june
six so set your calendars i know i will
be extremely excited about that and all
the news today have been about apple
mainly because we've got conflicting
news from different sources on one end
we've got supply chains claiming that
this has been one of the worst quarters
for the iphone they've got terrible
orders things are just crazy bad and
then we've got Tim Cook on record on the
other end claiming that this has been a
great quarter that the company has been
doing great that it's been selling a
crazy amount of iphones and true even
though iphone sales are down ten percent
you have to admit the 51 million iphones
is a crazy amount of iphones regardless
it's better than pretty much every other
smartphone out there I mean smartphone
not obviously full market share numbers
but we'll see how that plays out and
finally the very hot news today have to
do yes with the iphone 7 because we've
got the first leaks of the internal
logic board of the iphone and even
though we've been covering the fact that
probably the iphone will be changing its
design losing the headphone jack and
apple just making a big deal out of that
according to the leaks it seems that
there is a headphone jack on the logic
board at least the connector so it could
just be that there will be various and 0
variance of the iphone other rumors also
claimed that hey Apple does a lot of
prototyping maybe they're testing it
didn't go so well but it leads me to the
question of today would you be deterred
from buying the iphone because of the
lack of a headphone jack because in my
case i will be honest with you know i
mean i feel that so long as you don't
have to be carrying so many adapters
i'll be fine with the lightning cable
because of the high quality audio you
get and I don't mind bluetooth for
convenience in times but we'd love to
know your opinion in the comments down
