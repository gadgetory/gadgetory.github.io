just the large with a few subtle changes
LG has decided to do some corporate
shakeups after terrible sales for the g5
and we get more elite benchmarks of the
hcc marlin nexus google phone I'm hi
meri behna and I don't know what the
relationship is with the whole band
truly and man and Stark but I'll take
this this is parking out daily I
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market wanting to
try google music even though I still
prefer Spotify there is a very
compelling deal you get four months off
when you sign up apparently even if
you've already taken the trial in the
past you can sign up now you get google
play music pretty much for free for four
months in addition to youtube red yeah I
know stop thinking about it just hit the
link of the description now Samsung has
been up to its special edition phones
are quite a bit we saw the Batman phone
and we also heard the rumors of an
Olympic phone or a phone for the
Olympics and if you're in the market for
that well July seventh there will be an
announcement on July seventh the company
has already begun teasing that we are
getting something and there is music
bets I don't know it has to do with the
Olympics but no confirmation just yeah
we'll keep you posted that's with a
spotlight over to the HTC Marlon aka one
of the next nexus smartphones to expect
apparently we're getting two phones from
HTC and the benchmarks that we just
found it very interesting mainly because
well even though we can't confirm the
amount of RAM what we do know is that
apparently this is not a Snapdragon 820
it seems that this will be a more
powerful processor meaning that finally
the Nexus lineup we'll have more
powerful internals than the other phones
that are in the market stay tuned for
this on a very sad note today we get to
hear from LG claiming that it has just
made a major corporate shake-up where
the heads of departments for
manufacturing rd sales pretty much every
important deal here that have to do with
the g5 has now been replaced the company
is extremely upset over the last four
quarters on a dive and the fact that the
g5 did not live up to expectations
mainly because it was a great promise
but then
the phone that we got wasn't really as
great as expected and that's really sad
there was nothing really bad about the
idea about the g5 we just feel the
company's need to polish that
manufacturing a little more let's see
what the new executive team brings up
and finally the very hot news they have
to do with a samsung galaxy note 7
famous tipster Evan Blass has just given
us the color options to expect and well
we've got the black onyx which is my
favorite color of the galaxy s7 lineup
then we've also got silver titanium and
a new blue coral not the dark blue that
we liked from last year blue coral which
hey it's not necessarily bad and reminds
us of the lgb 10 and it's blue variant
but hey it leads me to the question of
today if you're in the market for the
galaxy note 7 and even if you're not
which color would you pick for this next
mark phone in my case already said it
the black onyx is my favorite color it's
funny I don't like black phones but this
one in particular is beautiful it was a
