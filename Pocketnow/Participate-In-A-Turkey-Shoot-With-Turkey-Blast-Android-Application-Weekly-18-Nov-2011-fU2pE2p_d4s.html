pocketnow.com and this is another
episode the android application weekly
and which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get to it on the
fly is a free application of element
Android Market lecture to book flights
easily on your Android device so here we
just select our location and our
destination and we can either search for
specific dates or we can choose flexible
and how this works with this calendar
date in which you want to leave so we'll
just click there done and now we'll
choose five nights one adult and click
search and it looks as though all these
airlines here have a price of three
hundred twenty-six dollars round trip so
we'll click on their and our return
flight and now we can just book it from
our Android device Pixar is a free
application of El in the aftermarket the
light should do many things with your
photos you can draw on them you can
create a coke collage choose from any
one of these photo services we can just
choose from our gallery origin capturing
new photo ok so now we can edit this we
can also draw on it we like and there's
many tools let's say we want to give
this a little spicious speech bubble and
you can say hi or something like that we
can create a collage for a photo so we
can choose a grid here so we're done
with our collage we can just go back and
we can automatically save it to our SD
card or we can upload it to out there's
various sites turkey blast is a like and
paid for game available an average
market doctor the game is to a user
accelerometer to shoot these various
turkeys and you have to hit 20 within
the time period and these ones I have to
shoot three times because they have a
shield and a helmet on so we use the
accelerometer to to move over and we can
just shoot into the sky as well so let
me just give some of these turkeys and
when we're able to complete the level
there's many bonuses available so
unfortunately I wasn't able to get the
20 turkeys in that time period so we can
try it again zaga is one of the leading
authorities for rating food
establishment and as well as bars so
what this application allows you to do
is to view all the ratings that zaga has
posted in either metropolitan areas so
I'll show me the scores for the food the
decor and the service and the higher the
score the better the rating as well as
also the cost so now we can read a
little tidbit about this restaurant we
can call them we can add our own review
and see what some of the dishes the play
we can just click on there
and here are some of the photos that
people have submitted to foodspotting so
it looks pretty appetizing so this looks
like a pretty good place to eat baguette
is a paid for game avail in the android
market after the game is to position the
items inside the bag without breaking or
crushing any of the objects so let me
just position some of these in here and
let's see if we're able to move them all
around without breaking any items okay
so let me just move this cereal over
here and move that down there and put
the juice over here ok so when we've
completed the level we can use the
accelerometer to move some of the items
over so they don't break and we get a
high enough score we get three stars we
also get these other metals and we can
move on to the next level so this has
been another episode of the android
application weekly and if you like our
videos make sure you gives a thumbs up
