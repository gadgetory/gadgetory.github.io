aluminum the HTC One x+ and VX become
official and as Microsoft planning their
own smartphone for 2013 I'm high never
iveta wondering of that ipad mini will
be dubbed the super new ipad and this is
parking out daily that's right today is
HTC's day so bear with me as I cover the
news first of all we get the official
announcement of the one x+ which is the
same 1x design only now you get it in
black color you don't get the options to
buy it in white or grey at least for now
you get the new Tegra 3 quad-core
processor that allows for LTE to live
inside the same chip a bigger battery a
better front-facing camera and also more
storage options like for example 64
gigabytes and we also get android 4.1
jelly bean out-of-the-box along with
sense 4 plus and for good news of the
current one series customers you also
get android 4.1 jelly bean being
launched this month along with the one
x+ so good timing HTC and then we've got
a TNT announcing that they'll be
carrying the HTC One x+ and this time
you'll be getting the same specs as you
get in the quad core international
version you'll also be getting an HTC
One V X which is a mid-tier device that
has similar specs to the HTC One S
that's currently stuck on t-mobile so
you won't be getting the same camera
both devices will be available on AT&amp;amp;T
and November though exclusively so don't
get your hopes up now even though
Samsung is doing everything to launch
their galaxy note 2 in more countries
which include the United States has of
October 24th with their event it seems
that Sammy didn't have enough time to
bundle all the software and need it for
the device to ship so apparently split
screen is not working on all devices
you'll most likely only require a
software update to get that to work but
our review unit should arrive shortly so
we'll definitely keep you up to speed on
the goods and yes believe it or not just
as Google surpassed microsoft and market
cap recently and Apple did two years ago
it seems that Microsoft's getting
desperate rumors have Microsoft again
building a surface phone just as they
announced the surface tablet recent
now apparently the dates have the device
being announced in early 2013 and
judging by how Microsoft performs will
most likely get it by the end of 2013
though I still can't understand why
Microsoft just doesn't buy Nokia I mean
oak is barely worth like 150 what
Microsoft is worth and finally for the
hot news of the day let's talk about the
iPad Mini or ride book or the super new
iPad whatever you want to call that
thing first of all rumors have apple
announcing the device on october 10th
and launching it on october 17th and
since apple has been terrible at keeping
secrets lately i'm going to believe in
that the second rumors have that apple
apparently is now going to build an ipad
with slate black aluminum just like they
did with the iphone 5 and they'll also
be launching a model with the gray
aluminum that we currently know for the
ipads and macs so that leads me to the
question of the day if Apple would
launch two different colors of iPads a
black slate and a gray aluminum which
one would you pick I'd stick with the
current grey iPad just because I know I
can handle the scuffs better there but
leave us a comment down below now if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet wont make sure you follow us on
Parker now calm please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi every letter thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
