has nearly quadrupled since the company
pretty much pioneered the market in 2013
the most significant use Fitness at a
staggering 92% and growing last year's
gear s 3 and gear fit to try to address
that to a certain degree but it was
clear that the market was in need of
more I'm happy to be better with pocket
now reporting from me for 2017 in Berlin
and meet the Samsung gear sport
we thought your Samsung gear is three
became obsolete as of today actually no
the classic and the frontier continued
to be the company's flagships
the new gear fit to pro is the company's
new dedicated Fitness watch that you can
find that wants separate video a new
gear Sport lies somewhere in between
we've got the same circular design of a
gear s with the same rotating bezel and
the same 316l aluminum construction what
changes is that this is a smaller 42
millimeter body for less bulk while you
train with now 580 M for water
resistance up to 50 meters while
swimming saltwater certification for the
beach and military grade 8 10 G yeah
this SmartWatch is definitely no joke
there are two new color options black
and blue though it's hard to tell them
apart
it comes with 20 millimeter silicone
bands but there are bevy of accessories
that include leather options and even a
hybrid that blends silicone with leather
we've got a gorgeous 1.2 inch circular
AMOLED display protected by Gorilla
Glass 3 and Tizen continues to grow in
functionality now being able to help you
track your calorie intake by comparing
it with your calorie burned the rest of
the specifications remain largely
similar to the Samsung gear s 3 with GPS
support Samsung pay support though
through NFC support for Samsung
connected services 4 gigs of storage etc
the storage is now more crucial than
ever with Samsung's new partnerships in
conjunction with gear fit 2 pro the new
gear Sport allows for Spotify to become
a major player now being able to sync
music offline to the watch while you run
Samsung claims that nearly 60% of
SmartWatch users sync music to the watch
so this update is crucial
other services from Under Armor also
work offline now including active maps
while you run and even training zone
data even speedo has joined the crowd
with a new way to help you track your
laps while you swim
Samsung is also launching a new training
mode that helps you use your Android
smartphone or a compatible Samsung TV to
be able to help you train while you're
able to also view your heart rate on the
monitor something that proved to be
quite useful on the demo is the Samsung
gear sport for you well I'm more
inclined for a one SmartWatch that does
everything and this one does but it
isn't as fancy as I'd like but we'll let
you know more as soon as our review unit
arrives later this year is availability
is set for the fall well that happens
