in the Android line of smartphones and
they're doing things differently than a
lot of the other devices out there
simple elegant just beautiful touches
I'm Joe Levi for Pocket now this is how
you can get Moto X style active
notifications on your Android device
today according to the developer this
app will run on Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich devices and above although it's
specifically made for Nexus style
devices and is tested with Android 4.3
and CyanogenMod 10.2 immediately after
you've installed the app you'll have to
allow notification access hit OK and
then tap on the check mark next to
dynamic notifications launch the app and
you'll be able to go in and set whether
you want dynamic notifications on or off
you'll even be able to fire a test
notification if you want if there are
some apps that you don't want to be
displayed you can set them up in your
block list simply select which ones you
want to not appear and they won't the
default is to allow everything if you
want to see the screen a little bit
longer you can set a custom screen
timeout simply come in here and set the
time to whatever you want we'll accept
the default if you do set a custom
timeout you'll need to add administrator
access to the app after you've seen your
notification you can choose to turn the
screen off after you dismiss it it's a
good idea to save batteries those are
the basic features of the app premium
features require unlocking and that
requires an in-app purchase of $0.99
doing so is relatively easy in my case
it's protected by a password confirm the
purchase wait for a minute and the
payment is successful just as easy as
that you're taken back to the app then
you have all of these other options that
you can use you can use this as the lock
screen you can auto awake if you want to
night mode night modes kind of
interesting you can set this so it
doesn't show the the notifications in
the middle of the night and potentially
wake you up
so that could be a good thing you can
also set custom brightness if you want
to dim the screen or make it a little
bit brighter let's go ahead and send a
test notification to the device you can
see very very simple and clean I've got
the time I've got my latest note of a
cake
and you can see that this is a gmail
type notification it's really not the
the developer sends you over to rate
their app which you can do I mean that's
easy enough this is what a normal email
notification looks like very clean very
simple elegant it shows you what you
need to know and nothing more
the app is called dynamic notifications
by a great byte software it's available
for free today in the Play Store but if
you want to see some of the features
that we showed off here you'll need to
buy the in-app upgrade to the the plus
or the pro version it's about 99 cents
for that thanks very much for watching
