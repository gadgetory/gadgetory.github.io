the iPhone 6s and we've dug deep into
the camera performance now it's time to
see what all the fuss is about I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket now and here's
our full review of the Samsung Galaxy s7
brought to you by debrie a new galaxy
smartphone will always generate a lot of
discussion walking around the hardware
our review unit is an AT&amp;amp;T branded
device powered by a Qualcomm 820 chipset
4 gigabytes of RAM on tap backed up by
32 gigabytes of internal storage and
this year sees the return of microSD
card expansion to add up to another 200
gigabytes of storage space the non
removable battery has been bumped up to
a 3000 milliamp hour capacity and will
cover runtime a bit later in this video
the front face holds the 5.1 inch quad
HD AMOLED display the bottom chin is
home to the hardware and navigation
controls and the fingerprint scanner
built into the home button the top of
the front faces where we'll find a
respectable phone speaker and the
5-megapixel selfie camera the side
volume and power keys have a terrific
clicky action the bottom edge still
looks a bit iPhone inspired with speaker
holes microUSB port and the headphone
jack but all of these ports are
terrifically finished and well balanced
on the phone body many were hoping to
get USB C but maybe that will arrive on
the note 6 later this year the back of
the phone is where we'll find the 12
megapixel camera and heart rate monitor
yo metal and glass is sexy Samsung
delivered a striking look for their
phones last year this year we see this
aesthetic refined no revolutionary
changes but some subtle tweaks to button
down Samsung's design language we could
call this a note mini if it had support
for an S Pen the flat sides from the
Galaxy S six are gone in favor of a
curved rear plate the new metal edges
scooping to accentuate the back glass
and the camera has been sunk into the
back of the phone surprisingly well it's
almost flush with the heart rate monitor
these materials are prone to fingerprint
smudges but the gold platinum color does
a respectable job of hiding them until
you hit the phone with some light of
course the s7 is a millimeter thicker
than the s6 but height and width have
actually been trimmed by about mmm
the overall feel in the hand is
excellent even for someone with little
hobbit hands and the form factor here
gets surprisingly close to the iPhone 6s
which has a noticeably smaller screen
hardware improvements are more than
skin-deep though the s7 is ip68
water-resistant which means it should
survive being submerged in up to five
feet of water for up to 30 minutes this
is by no means a rugged phone but it
should easily handle the occasional dunk
or spill looking at the display there's
really no competition for AMOLED screens
at the moment unmatched contrast with
inky blacks and a satisfyingly juicy
saturation out of the bots the adaptive
mode produces colors a touch warm for my
tastes especially yellows and reds but
moving to the basic mode delivers
excellent display accuracy the
combination of high brightness and
contrast also makes this phone screen
one of the easiest to read and bright
light every pixel on an AMOLED screen
makes its own light which helps minimize
the power draw from features like the
always-on display when the screen is off
you'll self have at a glance access to
the date-time battery and your messages
the fingerprint scanner has been
improved and the s7 recognizes prints
faster than the s6 it replaces the
bottom position can still be a bit more
difficult to reach when using the phone
one-handed especially opposite rear
mounted fingerprint scanners now reading
through comments from our iPhone
comparison from viewers with tips on how
to better train the phone we have
improved recognition from a side thumb
scan but the galaxy s7 scanner still
isn't as fast or as flexible as what
Huawei includes with mid-range errs like
the G x8
now moving over to software how nice it
is to fire up a phone with marshmallow
installed out of the box and TouchWiz is
running on top of Google's OS Samsung
skin isn't nearly as garish as it was
several years ago the candy colored
icons have been toned down but if the
default theme still bothers you a
replacement is easily installed there
are a bunch of customizations baked into
TouchWiz the notification tray including
scrolling shortcuts to wireless and
power saving features we're waiting on
Android n to deliver native split-screen
multitasking but until then Samsung has
the most complete solution for using two
programs on your screen at the same time
and the s Evan has a huge number of
options for gestures and one-handed use
even people with the most petite paws a
triple click on the home button should
shrink the screen enough to use
everything with one thumb my gripes
about app drawer management remain
though the s Evan won't automatically
alphabetize newly installed apps you'll
have to keep manually hitting this A to
Z button and for some reason the AT&amp;amp;T
flavor of this phone has removed the
single column settings menu that I
prefer I don't know why paging through
these tabs makes me so cranky but it
does between Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T there's
also quite a bit of stuff pre-installed
Amazon apps Facebook plenty and uber
then Samsung's collection of services s
voice s health milk music gear Samsung
pay and lastly a tease collection of
Locker protect plus two direct tv apps
drive mode my AT&amp;amp;T and the usage manager
none of these can be properly
uninstalled but most can be disabled
throwing unused services into a folder
is one solution but if you organize
alphabetically folders are thrown into
the first slot on your app drawer but
for mobile gamers the galaxy's game
center is a handy way to not only launch
titles but ensure that your gameplay
won't be disrupted by obnoxious facebook
notifications for those who like to
share gameplay videos the ability to
record footage will certainly be
appreciated the galaxy s7 performs daily
tasks very well it's quick enough
sliding through menus and home screens
even with TouchWiz customizations you'll
rarely be kept waiting long for apps to
load and while there's always room to
refine multitasking performance out of
the box here is lightyears ahead of the
mess we originally saw in the galaxy s6
the s Evan is still a bit more
aggressive about killing background
tasks than some competitors but you
won't feel like you're constantly
relaunching every app from scratch the
Qualcomm 820 chipset benchmarks really
well but we can't see tremendous
differences between it and the Exynos
last used on the s6 edge+ or note 5
that's not a bad thing but performance
here feels like more of a lateral move
than direct improvement daily driver
aspects like launching the camera or
unlocking the phone feel a bit quicker
but a few of our more demanding games
struggled to keep up the same buttery
smooth frame rate the Qualcomm 820 will
get warm as your
the phone especially while charging but
we're nowhere near the kind of heat
which can be generated from an HTC One
m9 on a Qualcomm 810 cruisin around
Southern California on 18 T's Network
we're getting excellent signal reception
on average we're seeing around the two
decibel advantage over the LG v10 and
closer to a four decibel advantage over
the iPhone 6s the blend of metal and
glass doesn't seem to be interfering
with cell tower connections and we get
great data speeds in areas with good
coverage phone calls come through loud
enough on the earpiece and I haven't had
any complaints from callers about the
audio being sent from the phone so
that's good enough for me
but speaking of audio speaker playback
seems fairly unchanged from the galaxy
s6 reasonably loud output volume for
alerts and speaker phone and multimedia
playback is decent enough for a bottom
firing speaker though it is easy to
block while playing racing game
we'll label headphone audio quality as
good but not great and we wish there was
a more powerful amp onboard the galaxy
s7 has a fairly flat EQ profile where
neither bass nor treble seems overly
exaggerated that's a good thing but
output is duller and quieter than the
galaxy s6 it replaces the s7 amp is
handily outclassed by the note 5 iPhone
6s and LG b 10 but here we get to the
real meat and potatoes as Samsung has
made some bold moves with this year's
camera if you want to dive deep we have
the most in-depth review available
online on just this phone's camera
performance linked in the description of
this video
our review unit came with a 12 megapixel
Sony sensor with dual pixel focusing
technology and the lens features a
fairly wise 27 millimeter equivalent
field of view with a huge F 1.7 aperture
and optical image stabilization in
reducing the resolution Samsung is
aiming to improve low-light performance
judged by that standard Samsung would
seem to have achieved their goal the
galaxy s7 is able to focus in almost no
light situations where the s6 would
refuse to acquire focus this camera is
very good at handling indoor lighting
situations producing bright images with
a minimum of noise now our phones have
limited room to grow in this regard and
pushing to improve low-light performance
introduces compromises elsewhere the
huge aperture is terrific for getting
more light on the sensor but it makes
macro shots a bit more challenging the
depth of field is super shallow larger
pixels are better for soaking up light
but the lower resolution obviously makes
zooming and cropping more difficult and
pixel peepers will likely be
disappointed in the slightly softer
output of this sensor compared to last
year's no.5 and s6 edge+
on the whole this is a very good camera
Samsung's reputation for producing
bright punchy saturated images is alive
and well here a full suite of manual
controls for still photos will be
appreciated built with this Hardware
onboard it would be nice to have a few
more options to control video the HDR
mode unfortunately remains little more
a shadow brightening mode and if used in
bright situations it will likely
exacerbate already clipped highlights
motion photo though is very fun to play
with especially when capturing panorama
shots and those panorama shots have
excellent detail stitching as you move
through your scene video quality is
excellent UHD video at 30 frames per
second is captured with a very high
bitrate producing a lush and detailed
image the 60 frames per second 1080p
mode is super slick for capturing krispy
action and slow motion video sees a huge
improvement 240 frames per second 720p
video almost reaches the fluidity and
smoothness of the Nexus 6p and iPhone 6s
it's a lot more fun to play with than
last year's Samsung phones what we can't
find fault with is the insane speed of
this imaging system launching the app is
fast firing off a burst of photos is
fast the focus lock and react juez ition
speed is incredible the galaxy s7 camera
encourages us to ask some interesting
questions now obviously no camera is
perfect but will consumers be happier
with a camera which absolutely excels on
a handful of features or will people be
happier with a jack-of-all-trades
shooter it's a question consumers will
have to answer for themselves as they
look to throw their hard-earned money at
a new phone now moving to the
front-facing camera it seems on par with
previous Samsung selfie options you get
a nice wide field of view which should
help you capture not only yourself but
also your location and video quality is
also higher than most competing front
shooters offering quad HD resolution
which should be appreciated by people
looking to do some vlogging but as
mentioned in our in-depth camera review
the insane number of filters and facial
manipulations produces some very
disturbing plasticky results but all of
the coolest technology features in the
world won't do you much good if your
phone's battery can't last the day and
we're happy to report that battery life
on the s Evan is noticeably improved
over last year's model moving up to a
3000 milliamp hour battery we have to be
seeing other efficiency improvements
than just a 17% bump in
cassadee maybe coming from a more
efficient chipset display improvements
or software optimization we're not sure
but the Galaxy s7 has little problems
making it through a busy day off the
charger with over 4 hours of screen on
time and around 30 percent battery
remaining after dinner our video tests
streaming 30 minutes of HD video at 50%
brightness over Wi-Fi resulted in 5
percent battery draw where the galaxy s6
was closer to 8 percent and even though
we don't have the latest and greatest
Qualcomm quick charging technology the
galaxy s7 recharged 30% of the battery
in 30 minutes while I was still using it
and wireless charging is built in for
additional flexibility in topping off
the battery throughout your day so let's
wrap this up where does that leave us
with the samsung galaxy s7
this is a damn fine phone nearly every
issue we had with galaxy s6 has been
addressed and most everything we liked
about the s6 has been refined there's
precious little fault we can find here
and most of the criticisms we can lob at
this phone will largely come down more
to personal preferences than objective
examinations of course no phone is
perfect and at this price it would be
completely understandable if one minor
issue might turn into a complete
deal-breaker for some customers COFF
COFF I'm looking at you headphone jack
COFF COFF plus the galaxy s7 doesn't
exist in a vacuum and it faces intense
competition from other manufacturers
this year even so the galaxy s7 will be
a tough act to top and I've thoroughly
enjoyed my time reviewing it this is a
damn fine phone looking for a way to add
some grip and eliminate the fingerprint
smudges from your new Galaxy s7 deep
