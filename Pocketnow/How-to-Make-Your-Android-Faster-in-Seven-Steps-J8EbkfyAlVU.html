pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to talk about seven ways to make
your Android feel faster let's get to it
so probably the two biggest things you
can do to make your Android feel faster
we're not going to get in because
they're very involved that would be to
install a custom ROM because a lot of
custom roms out there are very lean very
light tuned for performance and number
two would be to overclock your phone
with something like set CPU which
requires root access short of that if
you don't want to root your phone and
get into all of that there's a lot you
can do with a stock Android phone to
make it feel faster number one disable
homescreen animations or screen
animations in general what you can do is
go into the settings go into display go
to where it says animations and you can
turn on some animations all animations
or go to none and what this will do is
it will bring you right back to your
home screen without an animation when
you're an email and you flip to another
app there won't be an annoying animation
which just takes time and system
resources so doing this will make your
device feel a little bit faster let's
jump back to the home screen another
thing you can do is disable browser
plugins so if you dump into your browser
and you go into the settings you will
see an option for plugins down here and
what this is doing its scanning the page
to determine whether there are any for
example flash plugins and so if you have
always on set that will always load the
flash plugins and you'll probably get
one or two second delays your device
charged to pull that in on demand is a
good option for most it will allow you
to choose whether or not to run a
plug-in so there's a little icon that
will show up if it's a flash element for
example and off is just probably the
fastest thing that you can do to prevent
the page from even looking for these
plugins and attempting to load them so
let's go back to the home screen and
talk about number three number three is
to run a third-party launcher this is
the galaxy s2 and we were running
TouchWiz 4.0 on the home screen when we
were reviewing this and we found that
going back to the home screen even when
we only had one or two home screen setup
took like two seconds after installing
launcher Pro here
is my launcher of choice and I'll put a
link up to a video talking about that
there's also ADW launcher after
installing a third-party launcher things
are much faster when you are in an
application you go back to the home
screen it's a lot more faster than it
was before
and plus launcher pro gives you a lot of
added controls and so do the other
third-party launchers out there another
thing you want to do is turn off your
live wallpaper live wallpaper is
basically a video playing in the
background which might look pretty but
every time you go back to the home
screen there's a video playing and this
will delay the time that it takes to get
back to the home screen this will slow
down overall the system resources
because it's having to basically play a
video on your home screen so turn that
off I know it's fun but it's not really
the most efficient thing to do if you
want to have a device it's that is as
fast as possible
number five limit the number of widgets
and icons you have on your home screens
here I have no widgets except for the
time widget over here there's a lot of
people out there that like that Facebook
widgets Twitter widgets etc and so forth
these use system resources and they
always have to redraw and the widgets
are more complicated for the system to
redraw because they have live data
elements they're streaming information
so turn those off if you can another
thing that would help and Joe Levi made
a good point about this is to reduce the
number of icons you have icons are a
little bit complicated they require the
operating system to draw the icons a
good alternative the icon our folders so
you can make multiple folders instead of
having you know all these icons like I
do
I could have four folders along the
bottom we reducing the amount of
graphical elements on the home screen
moving on number six limit the amount of
installed applications you have so we're
going to dial in two applications right
here and go to manage applications and
your downloaded applications list look
for the apps that you never use it's
very compelling to go to the Android
Market and download this app in this app
and this app because most of them are
free but they use up system resources
and a lot of them come with background
services that total your device even
when you're not using them so be sure to
go through and uninstall apps that
you're not using or ones that you don't
use
a regular basis and finally number seven
is reduce the amount of data updates
that occur on your device and the way
you can get to this android makes this
very easy go to accounts and sync and
this will show you all the accounts that
are pulling data on a regular basis and
apps like Twitter and Facebook
automatically add an entry here and by
default they turn on which is kind of
silly
so you'll find your tweets are updating
automatically but that's slowing down
your device and you could be checking
your email or browsing the web while
Twitter is reaching out and pulling down
updates which will slow down what you're
doing you're the primary task you're
doing so the seventh tip we have here is
reduce now the amount of apps or
accounts that are pulling down data keep
it to just the ones that you find very
critical to what you need so those were
seven tips on how to make your Android
feel faster none of them are too extreme
they're all very small and incremental
but taken collectively that can really
help to bring back a little bit of speed
to to the Android operating system if
you can think of any more tips leave us
a comment below we really want to hear
about other ways that you put into place
to make your Android feel faster because
we want a fast phone if you like this

thanks for watching that's it for now
