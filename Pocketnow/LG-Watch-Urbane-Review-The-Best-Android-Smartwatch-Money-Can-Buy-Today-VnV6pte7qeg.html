watch is pretty much your only choice
for a SmartWatch experience well not
really but it is still you have many
options for smartwatches though if
you're an Android user from cheap to
expensive
sporty to elegant you can definitely
find something you like on the Google
store the latest addition is also the
most expensive offering but not only can
it take some real abuse but it's also
among the very select few if not the
only one at the time of this review
running the newest version of Android
wear 5.1.1 not to mention that to our
eyes it's also the best-looking beauty
is still in the eye of the beholder I
meant in the united front pocket now and
this is our LG watch urbane video review
at $349 in the Google store it is the
most expensive Android wear device the
throwning its predecessor or almost twin
sibling the LG G watch R which was also
the most expensive product at $2.99 and
so was the G watch before that even at
this price point at the time of this
review the gold version of the watch
urbane is out of stock whom does it
compete with you mean aside from every
other Android wear device the Moto 360
currently which should have a refresh
soon and of course with the G watch are
there are many similarities between the
watch urbane and the G watch R one might
be tempted to say that it's exactly the
same watch with a newly designed case
it's all a matter of perspective as the
watch urbane is everything in terms of
looks the G watch are was not it is made
out of stainless steel and this time
around the LG opted for a screwless
design and assembly which not only
contributes to the wearables good looks
but also makes it sturdier despite
measuring ten point nine millimeters in
thickness and 63 grams with a 22
millimeter genuine leather strap
attached it is not at all bulky however
if you have small wrists the watch
urbane will look at that big on your
hands while you're wearing it thanks
mostly to its wide and tall brackets the
body is made entirely out of stainless
steel with a screwless design as we
mentioned and the ip67 rating ensures
water and dust resistance the one-point
three inch P OLED screen has been
carried over from the G watch R with the
same 320 by 320 resolution and a PPI
rating of 245 and being the same display
our conclusions can be different the P
OLED screen is on the small side at one
point three inches but it's also the
best quality we've seen on an Android
wear watch it's absolutely gorgeous in
both active mode and the power saving
ambient display it is gorgeous also
carried over from the G watch r is the
1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
processor together with the 512 Meg's of
RAM 4 gigs of storage and the
410 million power battery these ensure
buttery smooth operation with stutter
free user experience thanks in part to
the speedy internals as well as the
polishes google applied to the watch
operating system in its latest iteration
running on the watch urbane and talking
about the software the watch urbane is
using the Android wear platform like all
Google smartwatches however as we
mentioned it is among the select few if
not the only one at the time of this
review running the latest iteration of
the platform version 5.1.1 notifications
for incoming calls texts emails social
updates weather calendar appointments
and everything else supported by Google
cards is what you should expect to see
once you set it up and pair it with your
smartphone via the Android wear
application talking about the latest
version of Android wear Wi-Fi sync is
now onboard the watch urbane supports it
but the G watch and the G watch are due
not after setting it up to connect the
watch to your hotspot the watch urbane
will be able to receive notifications
even if your smartphone is out of
Bluetooth range as long as you're
connected to a known Wi-Fi network
gestures are present for scrolling up
and down between your cards with a flick
of the wrist to the outside for
revealing a card or going to the next or
to the inside for scrolling up as well
as hiding it we have found this
extremely useful in situations where
your hand cannot interact with the
touchscreen for instance while driving
if you put your watch down you have the
option of securing it with a lock screen
that comes up automatically to avoid
curious eyes and hands from accessing
your information and you can also draw
emojis that you can send after
conversion of course to real emoticons
in your instant messages oh and there
are app install notifications for
whenever you install an application on
your phone that has an Android wear
counterpart throw an always-on
applications for apps that support it
like Google Maps for instance and you
have your info ready at all times unique
to the watch urbane are the LG Cole and
LG pulse applications with LG Cole you
can dial any number from your wrist no
you cannot talk to the other person
using your watch
of how geeky that is the app sends the
dial request to your phone and that's
where you have your conversation
however throw in a Bluetooth headset and
you can dial away without touching your
smartphone LG pulse takes heart rate
measurements at your request as well as
during an exercise it is able to display
a graph and it will also be capable of
syncing with your LG g4 if you don't
want to use this feature you can always
use google fit to track your health and
fitness activities on top of all this LG
made sure you can personalize your
experience with a cornucopia of
pre-installed watch faces from classic
to elegant from geeky to utilitarian and
you can always install more from the
Play Store we're not just talking watch
faces but applications as well Android
wear is able with the latest update to
do most of the things you'd want your
SmartWatch to do whether that's replying
to an email or text with your voice
without touching your phone getting
directions on your wrist checking
weather getting reminders or controlling
volume and music playback it's all there
that's not to say there's no room for
improvement and fingers crossed for
Google i/o and the possible iPhone
compatibility announcement we've been
using the watch urbane for an entire
week and we found it convenient and the
pleasure to use and we're not to mention
it is a looker people were constantly
asking us about the make and model as it
attracts many eyeballs battery life may
vary but with the always on feature we
got anywhere between 30 and 35 hours of
operation on a single charge however if
you're wearing it while driving like we
did you'll see your watch coming out a
stand by very often and that may drain
your battery to some extent have the
ambient display turned off and you can
get two to three days of operation
charging from 0 to 100 takes around an
hour and 15 minutes maybe an hour and a
half so if you're in a hurry 30 minutes
of charge will probably get you through
most of your afternoon then there are
the inconveniences of dictation we
talked about and basically every Android
wear device review as long as you don't
pause things are looking good but take a
breath and the message or email is sent
with
contents available to it until the
moment you've decided it was a good idea
to breathe it's just as frustrating as
when your watch forces you to take your
phone out in order to check for
information that could have been
otherwise easily displayed on your wrist
we don't really care whether or not the
watch urbane is the same Smart Watch as
the G watch R it definitely looks a lot
better if the casual business style is
the one you're after and with Android
wear v that one that one and Wi-Fi sync
it is definitely more capable than the G
watch our not only does it look good but
it does all the things you'd expect from
it and it does that regardless if you're
at the office hiking driving or at the
pool thanks to its ip67 ratings well who
is it for if you're an Android user
looking for a smart watch the watch
urbane is one solid watch option it is
the best generated wear device one can
buy today even if it's a little
expensive but then again the Apple watch
base model is even more expensive and if
you come to think of it for an extra 50
or $100 you get the full Android wear
5.1.1 experience on flagship internals
the best screen on Android wear and a
beautiful casing and general
presentation the funny thing is that we
did not mention once in our review the
single feature that the watch urbane
does best
it shows you the time all the time until
next time this has been hands in the
night from pocket now you can follow me
