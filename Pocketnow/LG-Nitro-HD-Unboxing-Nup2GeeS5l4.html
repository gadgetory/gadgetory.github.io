now calm there been a lot of new devices
announced and released lately yet only a
few of them actually sport HD screens
well it's time to unbox another new
device that does support and does have
an HD screen and that is the LG nitro HD
with AT&amp;amp;T let's get started the LTE arms
race may still be under way without a
clear-cut winner however that doesn't
mean another new race or another new
bragging right can't come aboard and the
newest ones of the game are devices
sporting high definition or HD screens
that's right 720p or higher is now
official on a few of these new devices
that are coming out today the LG nitro
HD as mentioned is one of these devices
let's go ahead and take a look at the
box before we open up to the
nitty-gritty it's honestly a very boring
box give you some details on the back
tells you that it is an LTE 4G device
using the AT&amp;amp;T 4G network has a 4.5 inch
HD display will have a dual core
processor it's a 1.5 gigahertz more on
that later to come an 8 megapixel camera
it does record HD will have to give that
test and see how well it actually
records that HD in the android platform
now flip them over and flipping open the
device of course you'll have the typical
Quick Start Guide giving you some
information on the device itself here is
the LG nitro as you can see right here
would put this aside for now and what
this is going to also come with pretty
simple just your standard micro-usb
charger it is a AC adapter with the USB
port very simple nothing out of the out
of the ordinary here run of the mill has
the LG logo here is the LG nitro HD
itself at first feel at first pick up it
has a very good amount of weight a very
adequate weight to it the back of the
device actually has a very industrial
almost it's plastic but it almost looks
like a steel look it's very industrials
the best way to put it speaker grill
here on the back and of course there's
the camera it does feel very nice in the
hand the bezel is moderately thin on the
sides and it
does appear to have a beveled look as
you can see here hold it up to some of
the actual other devices that many of us
are that I myself use we have the droid
razr the motorola droid razr which is a
4.3 inch screen but as a very big bezel
in the HTC Thunderbolt which also is a
4.3 inch screen so as you can see the
size difference between the federal and
the nitro HD is definitely noticeable
however the nitro HD toward the razor
it's actually about the same height same
width however this has rounded corners
so it's not going to feel as rough on
the hand per se removing the back
battery cover which actually has a
little slot down here at the bottom will
uncover a pre-installed 16 gigabyte
microSD card it is upgradable to 32
gigabytes ghoshal your sim card slot
once again this is a 4G LTE device which
is a nice option there and then your
battery which looks like it's an 1800 30
million power battery so it's pretty
beefy battery will see a while it
actually performs in the testing that we
do when it comes to playing video making
phone calls browsing the web just your
everyday tasks let's go ahead and get
this guy started up for the first time
and see what what we see and there we go
a quick vibration signifies that we are
ready to go as you can see this is your
unlock screen here slide up to unlock
this reminds me a lot of the samsung
galaxy s2 wallpaper for some strange
reason and at the same time as you can
see LG has put their own little overlay
a skin if you will on top of Andrea
which we will go over in much more depth
in our software video but at first
glance it does look very much like
TouchWiz what we'll do is we'll actually
show you which version of Andhra this is
running we go into the phone options
here and there we go android 2.3 point 5
that's the newest version aside from ice
cream sandwich it's the newest version
of gingerbread on these devices now
before we go is one thing I do want to
show you is that the bottom of this
device you'll see it only has
three capacitive buttons sony ericsson
has been known for changing up a little
bit but now LG is doing the same thing
with this nitro HD you have a
combination button here on the left very
little clothes as you can see it's
actually a menu and a search button home
button and back button so we'll have to
see how that combination works honestly
if you hold it long enough and you get
the search key it may not be a bad
option at all but we'll have to see for
more initial impressions on the LG nitro
HD be sure to check out the link in the
description of this video to see our
thoughts I have to honestly say right
now at first glance the screen is
gorgeous as always thank you very much
for watching everyone be sure to stay
tuned for our continuing coverage on the
LG nitro HD where we'll take a further
in-depth look on the software hardware
and the recording capabilities of that 8
megapixel high-definition camera if you
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up and stay tuned for more thanks
