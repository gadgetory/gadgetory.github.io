for HTC's design language but you're not
sure whether to choose Android or
Windows Phone we can help you with that
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is HTC 8x T versus HTC One on
Sprint third largest American carrier
Sprint is one of several to carry the
HTC One the Android flagship we reviewed
several months back but it's the only US
carrier to feature the 8xt
a special variant of the HTC 8x and
Sprint's first Windows Phone 8 device
ever we'll have a full review on the 8
xt shortly and to make sure you don't
miss it please follow us on social media
and subscribe here on youtube and then
join us as we put the 8 xt against the
HTC One in hardware software camera
performance and a few test notes let's
get to it these phones might both be
branded HTC but it's probably more
proper to call them distant cousins than
siblings the one feels every inch the
flagship device in the hand it's
aluminum and polycarbonate construction
working together with the Sham furred
edges around the display and the
machined speaker holes for a premium
look and feel whether it's silver or
black the ones Hardware screams stylish
quality while the 8xt definitely makes a
different statement it would be a
mistake to call it cheap feeling as you
might expect from the brand name the 8x
t feels a lot like the older 8 X in the
hand with a soft touch paint job
wrapping all the way around the tapered
sides and giving the phone a grippy
texture that inspires confidence so
you're not gonna drop it
that same rubbery finish means the 8 xt
takes a bit more work to get into and
out of tight pockets but it might hold
up to scuffs better than the ones fancy
metal at 140 grams the 8 xt is only 3
grams less massive than the HTC one but
thanks to the plastic construction it
feels even lighter surprisingly it looks
somehow thicker as well at nine point
nine millimeters it's only half a
millimetre thicker than the one but the
different shape matched with that
California blue paint job your only
choice on Sprint does funny things to
your eyes
firing up the displays though eliminates
any doubt about which of these is
high-end and which is the mid-range er
the 4.7 inch s LCD 3 on the 1 cranks out
1080p resolution at 4.7 inches for a
ridiculous 468 pixels per inch
well the 8 xt makes do with a 4.3 inch
WVGA LCD at a pretty ho-hum 216 PPI
that's basically the definition of
mid-range and that continues beneath the
screens at the processor level as well
while the ones software is pushed along
by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
at 1.7 gigahertz the 8 xt runs a
dual-core Snapdragon 400 instead at 1.4
gigahertz the spec Gulf continues in
terms of RAM with the 8 xt carrying a
single gig to the Android phones 2 gigs
and the on-board storage is pitiful on
the 8 xt only 8 gigs to the ones 32 with
only five point five of those available
to the user but that's somewhat made up
for by the presence of microSD expansion
on the 8 xt which is absent on the 1a
neither phone offers a removable battery
but the 2300 milliamp hour battery on
the one definitely outclasses the 1800
milliamp hour pack on the 8 xt and
finally the one sports some added trim
in terms of its transceiver loadout
posting 802 point 11 AC support and an
IR transmitter both of which are absent
on the a dock see the Android versus
Windows Phone comparison is always a
tricky one because the philosophies
behind the platforms are so different
Microsoft's interface prioritizes
glanceable information housed in tiles
and a very minimalistic very locked down
interface whereas Android draws its
utility from home screen widgets easily
accessible notifications and a very
customizable experience normally the
differences also include responsiveness
with Android usually lagging behind
Windows Phone but that's not the case
here the one is just as snappy and lag
free thanks to its optimized software
working together with that powerful
hardware we talked about before the 8 xt
while often as buttery smooth as we've
come to expect from Windows Phone seemed
a little easier to trip up than some
other devices running the platform
you'll want to wait for our full review
here's will be checking another 8xt demo
unit to see if we can reproduce that
performance the bottom line is that
you'll still want to choose your
platform before choosing your device as
there's way too much to compare for an
in-store spur-of-the-moment decision
definitely do your research first
starting with our full Windows Phone 8
review and our HTC One on Sprint full
review at pocketnow.com of the software
similarities that do exist one of the
most surprising is the camera viewfinder
HTC has ported much of the design
language and functionality of the ones
viewfinder to the 8xt including the
company's dual trigger approach to
Stills and video and a few of its
real-time filters there's also an
avalanche of options to choose from in
both still and video modes on both of
these units so you should be able to
tweak each cameras software to your
particular shooting needs based on
almost any environment that said these
ones do pack significantly different
camera hardware the one earned a name
for itself in low-light photography with
its optically stabilized 4 megapixel
camera and it's oversized ultra pixels
whereas the 8 xt features a much more
conventional 8 megapixel camera the Edit
resolution does it a favor while it
doesn't feature the standout low-light
performance of the one the 8 xt does
manage to deliver some pretty nice
captures in proper lighting especially
outdoors and especially if the HDR
option is used appropriately side by
side in brightly lit conditions with a
steady hand the phones produce results
that are pretty comparable despite their
divergent hardware specs even indoors
assuming there's enough light it's
possible to get similar results each
camera tends to wash out a bit in bright
light but in dimmer conditions the one
pulls ahead rendering more detail and
more authentic color than the 8 xt also
because HTC's camera app on the 8 xt is
pretty heavy and runs a bit sluggishly
on our review unit there's more
potential for motion blur when snapping
off a shot finally in the still category
the ones camera lenses both front and
back are a little wider angle capturing
more at the same distance than the
and the front-facing camera on the 1 is
a 2 megapixel shooter whereas the 8 xt
makes 2 with a 1.6 megapixel sensor that
delivers less impressive more ruddy
results the video performance between
these two is close to par with the 8 xt
impressing us more in this category than
instill the windows phones 1080p video
is crisp well saturated and delivers
excellent audio much like the HTC one
plus there are options galore in the HTC
camera app for slo-mo saturation
contrast and resolution adjustments and
more if we had to call a winner in the
camera overall it to be the one due to
its more responsive camera software and
it's excellent low-light performance
combined with the optical image
stabilization and it's fun features like
Zoe and the excellent gallery experience
but the 8 xt is no slouch under more
conventional conditions we were
surprised by how consistent the 8 xt was
with the 1 in side by side reception
tests that took us beneath Boston on the
city's subway system from LTE to 3G to
full-service to no service to roaming
coverage the to sprint devices stayed in
virtual lockstep now voice quality
wasn't anywhere near as consistent HTC
established a reputation for an
excellent calling experience on the 1
and that holds true for the Android
phone but it's not matched by the 8xt
callers could hear more background noise
from our side with the XT and said we
sounded less clear overall on the
Windows Phone the call was less
enjoyable on our end - with callers
sounding loud but muffled in our
earpiece compared to the crystal-clear
quality on the 1
fortunately the XT does live up to its
boom sound branding the forward firing
speakers though not uniform in size on
top and bottom do put out a powerful
sound if anything sound was louder and
bass ear on the 8xt when playing Spotify
or watching Netflix you won't have any
trouble hearing either of these phones
there's a lot to consider when choosing
between these devices the $100 price
difference on contract doesn't quite go
far enough to cover the large Gulf in
specs and perform
whether the 8xt is a good or a bad
device overall will be answered in our
forthcoming review but compared to the
one it's not really even in the same
league yes both devices are very pretty
in their own ways and yes each brings
some unique touches to its particular
platform but the one is a flagship
device and despite its name the 8xt is
not about the only reason to favor the
8xt besides its microSD expansion is if
you're desperate for a Windows Phone on
Sprint it's your only option after all
but if you're open to Android as a
platform and you've got the extra
hundred bucks
it's the HTC one that has the walk and
the talk that's more likely to keep you
happiest over the course of a two-year
contract
kind of an unusual comparison we know
folks but thank you for sticking with us
