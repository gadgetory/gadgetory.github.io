specifications to complete with current
flagship sources claim that Google is
already testing its future Google pixel
- and Tenzing starts fishing updates to
fix the problems of the Galaxy s8 I'm
Jaime Rivera and there was a time when
most of my allowance would go to
investments in GI Joe figures I'm sure
you did too this is PocketNow daily you
know it's kind of weird to start a
Monday without official news but I think
it's kind of early when I recorded this
video it was most important today when
it comes to the rumors have to do with
t-mobile the company is apparently
working with an undisclosed odium in
building its own smartphone sort of like
the company did with HTC many years ago
with devices like the t-mobile wing that
were branded as t-mobile but built by
HTC the case is it apparently this
device is important because of a couple
of things number one is because it has
some sort of a limited warranty number
two because apparently it has great
specifications for a mid-range price
range so we will keep you posted as we
learn more now for the spotlight over to
Amazon we've got a creepy update here
where we hear that the company is
working on making alexa more natural but
not natural when it comes to speech
we're talking about the fact that Alexa
will now be able to whisper
you will hear Alexa breathe and a couple
of other things to just remind those of
the film her you remember that case for
Scarlett Johansson was an AI computer
that would just evolve and evolve and it
seems that Amazon is wanting to take
that direction we're not exactly sure
how that's going to play if you're
continuously having to say Alexa - you
know call on her it's not necessarily
the fact that she always understands
that you're talking to her so I hate the
fact that I'm actually even saying her
these news it sorry
and speaking of voice the same thing has
just pushed out a four hundred megabyte
update to its Galaxy s8 that includes a
couple of changes depending on your
region number one of your in Korea you
are getting Bixby voice I wish were in
Korea to actually tell you how it works
but the second thing is the fact those
of you dealing with red tint on your
displays apparently this will fix the
issue now if I got megabytes is a lot of
that we're getting some other
performance enhancements we should learn
more as soon as we work closely with the
subject we'll let you know those are the
spot over to Google as we hear that the
company has already begun testing its
wall hi Google pixel 2 we know that this
device is being made by HTC we know that
this device should bring some major
enhancements to the pixel we're hoping
that it starts with design even though
the pixel continues to be one of my
favorite phones regardless of how ugly
it is not exactly sure when we're
getting it and the thing is that if it's
already in testing should be only a
matter of time and finally the very hot
nurses they have to do with HCC welcome
back to the hottest news man I mean you
eleven we've got leaked images of the
possible specifications in the packaging
snapdragon 835 processor six gigabytes
of ram the whole edge since you I in
addition to the fact that this device is
ip57 watering does resistance
now don't worry ip57 means you get less
dust protection but you do get ingress
protection up to one meter over thirty
minutes so that's actually great that's
what we've been wanting to get from HTC
for the longest time but it leads me to
the question of the day do you think
that these specifications are good
enough to compete with the g6 in the
galaxy s 8 in my case it'll all depend
on design hopefully this will not be
another HTC you ultra leave us a comment
