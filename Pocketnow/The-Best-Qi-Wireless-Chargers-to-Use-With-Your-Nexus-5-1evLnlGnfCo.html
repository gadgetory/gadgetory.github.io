been out for a little while but it
includes a feature that's been out for a
while longer than that qi wireless
charging support but what chi chargers
work best on the Nexus 5 I'm Joe Levi
for pocket now let's go take a look at
four qi chargers that'll work just fine
with your Nexus 5
the first charger to show you is the
original Nexus 4 charging orb this is
still my go-to device it's really nice
it's USB powered so you can just plug in
your USB charger right there set it down
on your desk and you've got this really
nice angle you've got this kind of
sticky center ring that grabs on to your
device and holds it really well charging
couldn't be easier simply set it down
and immediately you are changed over to
wireless charging charging works very
very quickly on the Nexus 5 in fact a
lot faster than it did on the Nexus 4
especially when charging wirelessly now
I know this is primarily focused at the
Nexus 5 so I don't want to spend too
much time on it but here is the 2013
Nexus 7 and I've got the official case
in it or it's in the official case and
you'll notice when I put it down it
doesn't do a lot it doesn't show me that
it's charging that's because you've got
all of this extra bulky material that's
kind of slowing down or getting in the
way of being able to charge wirelessly
so keep that in mind however the the
angle the orientation everything still
works so you can still wirelessly charge
pretty easily if you've got less bulky
of a case then unfortunately the
official one overall construction is
good usability is good especially when
you take into consideration that this
holds your device at the perfect viewing
angle for you to look at it for you to
get access to the information it works
in any orientation that you want it to
be in this sits on my desk all the time
at work and I just throw my device right
there it charges you can see it's stable
it doesn't slide around very nice
gonna run it around 50
if you can still find it it's getting
harder of course because the new flat
version is and it's a square version
it's going to be coming out soon more on
that a little bit later in the video
next up is the nokia dt 900 now this if
you've paid any attention to any of our
social networks you'll know i'm not all
of that fund of it because with the
nexus 4 getting this thing to charge was
just a pain I absolutely hated it I
would wake up in the middle of the night
looking at this little light down here
in the bottom blinking an SOS to me
saying this isn't charging and sure
enough the phone wouldn't be charged the
next morning the Nexus 5 however seems
to charge just fine on it so I may have
spoken too soon but you've got to get
you got to get it just right and line it
up just perfect to make this charge you
can see even here it's having a hard
time getting into into charging mode now
for the Nokia phones this is not a bad
idea because it seems to fit quite a bit
better on the Nokia's just if you're
going to be using it with other devices
like the Nexus 5 or even the Nexus 7 I'd
kind of avoid this it costs about the
same price you're running about 50 60
bucks to get it the Fat Boy pillow is
essentially this tucked inside a big
fabric pillow to help it sit a little
bit better so you don't have any way of
telling that your device is charging
because that led at the bottom just you
can't see it because this inside the
pillow so if you've got a Nokia great
and this is one of the Nokia's that
Sports supports Qi and not the other
standard you're probably okay however I
would stay away from this if I were you
next up is a charging pad by energizer
this actually comes in two different
varieties one is a single position which
is what you can see here they do have a
double wide version which has
essentially two charging pads in it you
can place two devices
it looks like it's big enough to charge
three but it's not there are only two
coils that having been said take your
device drop it down the light up top
turns blue and in fact it is wirelessly
charging it works great as long as you
don't have a slick back like on the
Nexus
or because it will just slide right off
now you'll notice I am using a case on
my Nexus 5 this one being the spy Jinnah
how you pronounce it the Neo Hybrid and
this works really really well my wife
has a generic Nexus 4 case and it
doesn't work it just it's too thick and
the further away you get from that pad
the less efficient that charging is and
sometimes so you can see here it just
turned off it's not charging at all I
can get it down somewhat close and be
able to do it but some cases are going
to be thick and not let you charge
showing you what this looks like with
the Nexus 7 we'll just set that down you
can see this one charge is just fine
right through the case takes a minute
for the light to turn off turns back on
so we're charging works great you can
set it up in that direction and not see
the the light but it fits a little bit
better that way as well last but not
least is my second-favorite wireless
charger this is the Panasonic QE TM 101
and it's kind of interesting you're
gonna be paying between 60 and 70 bucks
for it
it's got one button on here and it's got
this cool little ring of LEDs that's
actually your charging coil so rather
than lining things up with magnets or
getting things positioned exactly right
it doesn't matter where you put your
device that ring is going to go right
over to wherever it needs to be you've
got a status LED up at the top you can't
see very well here because of the camera
angles well there you go it charges
great it charges fast this is what I use
to charge up my Nexus 5 all the time I
love this thing except for one small
feature and that's the sound so listen
really close that actually physically
moves your charging pad and there are
times when in the middle of the night it
will move that up and out of the way
which is nice because it's going to stop
charging when your battery is full but
if you're a light sleeper it's going to
move that
and up and out of the way and it's going
to be somewhat noisy when it doesn't if
you are charging in the same room well
let that reset put the Nexus 7 on it and
you can see here that that charges just
as well works great most of the time try
and get that little tabby so that it's
kind of off to the side and it'll it'll
work even better if you've got a case
that has a tabby and lifts it up off the
the surface but that is by far my second
favorite and the coolest one out there
but so far the original nexus orb still
takes the cake for the most useful most
convenient and simplest qi wireless
charger of all that i've used so far so
we recognize that wireless charging
isn't everybody's cup of tea and that's
