news this week Qualcomm and broad camp
Qualcomm and Broadcom just can't seem to
find that love connection Google and
t-mobile face separate lawsuits and you
might be in line for a rebate if you
replace your iPhone battery at full
price we've got a lot to talk about so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode two nine one of the pocket men
weekly recorded February 9th at noon
pacific time this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and buying music CDs was
the coolest thing ever and those are
apparently going the way of the dodo I'm
Juan Carlos bag now senior editor
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong out on
the east coast how's it going buddy boy
yeah to be honest I'm a little tired
today it's a it's a gray day of a Friday
so and the mood isn't up to speed as I
would like it to be I haven't had coffee
today
sleepy sooo dude I like I would happily
share some of our 80 plus degrees
sunshine in weather here in the
southwest I mean I need 80 plus degrees
I just need sunshine I think I got this
artificial thing going on here seasonal
affected yeah because you know we're all
actually the fact that it's 80 degrees
in Los Angeles feels really nice but
that makes us crazy nervous about what
you know the warmer seasons are gonna be
like and especially for those of us out
in the valley we're gonna get new come
August so I'm not looking forward to
that I can't wait to see you fry right
it's gonna be some gadget guy on a Hot
Tin Roof it's gonna be sizzling like
crazy some bacon guy bacon right the
whole show I'm gonna look like like guys
some really crazy midlife crisis he dude
and driving a convertible way to tan
those crazy midlife crisis II guy
see you know the the the moniker works
it works really well that's just
questioning you gotta keep it you to
keep your on brand with persona in check
and what's completely on brand is uh us
moving from our general top of Show
banter to start digging into the hottest
news stories of the week as published on
pocketnow.com as shared by people online
joining the conversation on twitter with
the hashtag bookie and weekly and
definitely if you're offline if you're
not watching us live i hit up our email
address podcast at pocketnow.com we're
gonna have our favorite pics the end of
this month we promise it was we're gonna
try and get back into our viewer mailbag
viewer take the wheel shows on a monthly
like are you sega Wade he pulled up all
the the information that you could there
you kind of we're almost going to jump
in and then you realized oh we have to
talk about it the social so we have to
do some admin well then very well may
have been the absolute best segue I've
ever pulled off in the history of the
show I just want that there on one of
like not the most exciting news weeks
considering we're all kind of getting
our pre Proust ready for MWC and you
know we're we're between the cliffs here
and we're just traveling down the the
riverbed and the season before harvest
it's we're we're still here though
because we want to have this
conversation with you find folks out
there and there are actually some pretty
interesting things to talk about it's
just you know it's not gonna get off
exactly really hot news we're gonna
pretend that this is good or exciting
and I'm gonna didn't like put on my
radio voice or whatever for the week of
February 5th 2018 this is Albany as
those with podcast let's start off with
Qualcomm which has rejected broad comms
revised acquisition offer of 121 billion
dollars that's over the magic $80 per
share mark that
stock holders see but directors has sent
a letter to you Broadcom CEO hak tan to
negotiate a true highest offer for the
company leading to some concerns with
technique analysts that if innovations
are up for sale to a conservative money
making regime but coq10 himself is a
pretty harsh negotiator he has not paid
more than six percent above his initial
offer for any of the recent acquisition
acquisitions that he has made google has
a few class-action lawsuits going up one
of them focuses on the hardware audio
issues that it failed to properly
support and address on the pixel and
original pixel XL another concerns its
carrier project Phi where the compiled
being billed for public Wi-Fi access
which is part of the conceits for the
network switching between 4G 3G and
Wi-Fi been sued by a victim of a part
out scheme
prior to telling consumers about a new
measure to protect themselves from being
switched to another carrier suddenly and
for s relief the man claims that the
uncarrier failed to provide adequate
account security which led ultimately
led to him losing thousands of dollars
in cryptocurrency wirele fox abhrush
British throne om that has invested in
Santa Jane in Windows Phone devices has
entered into administration and could be
looking at complete dissolution soon
tearing robotic industries which has
long tried to deliver on the world's
first phone with liquid morphine is also
going through bankruptcy though it says
that the process is for selling of rent
the speeds and the those will be
interesting to watch obviously are we
mourn for any loss of competition in
this space especially with more marginal
players margin it's just we're coming to
a point where things are just you know
it's the main competitions here it stays
and it pretty much sucks any other
a player out of the race that's it sorry
I think I think the your completion of
the new segment there also coincided
with a nice little Google there was
definitely some bandwidth tearing as we
were getting through a couple of those
news stories I definitely want to
backtrack like take it right back up to
the top of the news list and this on
going back and forth the will they won't
they this is the you know the Sam and
Diane or the the moonlighting escapades
between Broadcom and Qualcomm well will
they ever get back together and once
they get together it's gonna wreck all
of the romantic tension that we've seen
as this dramas played out I think that
would be the end of the show if they
finally did you know kind of join up get
get that this is the show for
Valentine's Day so I'm trying to make a
bad pun here but uh I don't know I mean
it's I mean well it depends I see the
whole psyche of what's going on here
because as we've seen Qualcomm has been
shelling out all the renovations 5g and
what and it has been complaining that
has been undervalued because of the
failure to include nxp it's a gap
becoming a physician it's 37 billion
dollar acquisition of competing
happening and then there's also a few
other portfolio things that have been
neglected they feel like and this comes
about a month away from the annual
shareholders meeting where if Broadcom
is they have a nomination for its board
of directors that they're sending to
Qualcomm and it's right now a chance to
see if they can pull that off
where's Kwok well I'll just be curious
to see if like this is qual comes future
business strategy every time they get
close to a merger then they'll just
acquire another company and be like nope
or worth more now
oh no we spent like
twelve billion dollars on this other
company can I have to raise that that
bid price like I wonder how long they
could go before Qualcomm just don't
everything and broad comes you don't
like Oh we'll give you ninety five
dollars a share please this is already
the biggest you know deal ever pretty
much biggest acquisition of a company
and but especially as we get towards the
if they do happen to agree on a deal
there's certainly plenty more years to
have to go into motion and especially
with regulators across the world because
this would have more countries to and
there are se sees there are security
Exchange Commission's equivalents to
look at this deal because currently
broad comes still headquartered in
Singapore they're trying to move it to
Wes but until then there's national
security issues that they have to deal
with and it's just par for the course in
terms of these kinds of of things but
it's it's a mess they say Broadcom says
they would close a deal within 12 months
which for a deal of this scale is kind
of laughs of one that's what Qualcomm
did last week with a letter of appeal to
its shareholders saying that this is a
bad deal don't vote for their board of
directors for our we can't ever
completely escape like the high school
popularity votes for Student Council
like no don't vote for Becky she's
smells like glue I'm the only one that's
gonna promise you a pizza every Tuesday
so well if you want to I have no just
and delivering on that pizza but I will
promise it to you well all the
principals and all that of course the
principle of the matter speaking of
delivering what do we think about this
clap these class-action lawsuits against
Google the project Phi a ques ation is
actually pretty serious if this turns
out to be true with the way that these
phones are
monitoring data usage metering what
you're paying for and what you're not
that if Google was trying to double dip
on Wi-Fi sent content where because
we'll in project by they bill you per
gigabyte whenever you're using LTE
whenever you're on a carriers network
but you're supposed to have you know
that that's supposed to be off when
you're on Wi-Fi obviously you're paying
for Wi-Fi or you're using a business's
Wi-Fi that they're paying for so Google
shouldn't be encroaching on that or
using that as the metric for how much
data you use if we think that this could
be a serious allegation do we think this
is why maybe Google did their price
Protection Plan recently making them a
little bit more competitive against
normal carriers or t-mobile did the same
it did like a pre-emptive kind of thing
going on to when it's a class-action
lawsuit no it's not class-action it's
just a lawsuit but single file lawsuit
in any case the bill protection thing I
do think is kind of a recoil reaction to
it in terms of the key because the only
grounds that I would see Google even
remotely tried argue this on is because
of its Wi-Fi assistance because the way
it would jump from you know LTE to a
public Wi-Fi thing automatically is the
Wi-Fi system that was wasn't it already
a need of feature on the pixel and the
even some of the Nexus is the 5x and 6p
cuz that was one of the features that
they introduced before projects I came
on I'm not sure if this has become so
like a feature that is be marketed as
exclusive or something the only way that
I would see it as a you know if Xfinity
mobile you know owned by Comcast hello
right and we have probably some million
the player entering the market from like
a DISH Network's cell phone competitor
now is going but you know he actually
owned those hotspots they actually own
the connections
whereas the this is just public access
and their if they're only doing like
charging for the mechanism to which
you're connected automatically to a
public thing it's kind of ridiculous and
yeah it's not very fun and then also
I'll be curious to see if there's any
traction on this microphone issue I've
not been impressed with audio hardware
on Google phones and this is coming in
from the p-n weekly hashtag Peter Hayden
on Twitter in relation to pixel audio I
have I heard the sound on hi Mary vadas
review of the two XL thinking of mics
has this lawsuit come too late
I feel really bad audio in caps really
bad audio is an issue it should be given
more attention what do you think and you
I mean me being the audio nerd on this
team you know I'm gonna say yes this all
makes it better but this was one of the
primary reasons we returned our original
smaller pixel to it was we found out the
hard way that the mics didn't work when
shooting video and this is already bad
because the pixel shoots video like the
iPhone where it's mono audio only which
is really disappointing for such an
expensive device problem here was that
in the cases of these select customers
because you know the faults has been
demonstrated to be a replicable or at
least widespread more widespread than a
typical kind of one percent issue where
it only affects one percent of the
population but the thing was is that the
the soldering to the audio codec was
poorly done and therefore we experienced
some of them experienced crackling
peaking a speaker audio and some of them
experienced the microphones not working
at all as in is it not just for video as
it not at all meaning that they gain
that I can't make calls or acts I mean
we really own anymore I mean all the
kids are doing the what's happened and
the the Pinterest now I'm pretty sure
that's how everybody's talking these
days exactly
no yeah we all use Bluetooth headphones
and whatnot totally like in and
in the snapchats I hear that's a that's
different than making a phone call
so you would do that instead so yeah I
mean in this and it's not just because
this was an issue that Google didn't
acknowledge Google did acknowledge it
but they fast around with a whole bunch
of customers in between multiple RMA
units and just having the warranty run
out and when they could have gotten a
better deal out of this whole mess it's
a it's that's that's their claim that's
the that's the class action going on
there
they're trying to get as many class
members as possible they are looking at
at least 100 and at least five million
dollars of damages going on here
which I'm sure every pixel one owner
will receive a whopping 37 cents
once the the lawyers and everything is
sorted it out and what's the lawyers
take their cut I'd actually be kind of
curious if folks out there especially
folks who have a first generation pixel
if you guys were affected by any of this
drop us a comment hit that Twitter use
the p-n weekly hashtag or or also just
sort of broader in general the notion of
really premium and premier gadgets and
devices these are coming with ever
inflating price tags and yet we still
seem to encounter really obnoxious QA
problems you know really obnoxious
consistency problems these are the
things that were supposedly paying for
when we're investing in a nicer gadget
what do you guys think if this is
actually gonna move the needle on the
industry or have cell phones just become
so commoditized that this is now just
what we have to expect for progress for
phones to iterate this quickly we'll
take the compromise of phones which
don't perform as advertised or are
inconsistently manufactured hit us up
I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on
this if we get some good comments we'll
we'll chat them out towards the end of
the show we definitely need to unpack
this t-mobile story though because this
is beyond just like you know oh no they
throttled my YouTube's and made me watch
standard definition video
this actually has some real security
implications so this kind of scam the
poor doubt thing has been going on for a
good while I heard the news some sort of
case where 18 t account was compromised
they just they could just go in not ask
vague questions or answer the questions
vaguely or just good like somehow
manipulate the the representative on the
call just made that that I think get
little pieces of information and
eventually they wriggle their way into
that cow and do whatever they please
with head ends with a phone number being
used for two-factor authentication or
for SMS authentication or for whatever
it's a key to plenty of accounts that
count itself has plenty of information
that you can extract from and in the
case here with mr. Carlos Tappan of
Washington State apparently his three
phones his wife's his daughters at his
own were wiped of data and then
afterwards he found out that AT&amp;amp;T had
their accounts it took them a little
while to get them worked back in but
Tappan actually was during the time that
his account was compromised
he lost access to his accounts from Oh
mais go and bit connect a couple of
crypto countries but the whole thing
amounted to about three Bitcoin and at
the time of the lawsuit or the other
time of the incident which was November
last November it was worth about $20,000
yeah and at its peak around a Christmas
or so it was worth as much as fifty five
thousand dollars so he could I mean he
missed out from all this just because
t-mobile apparently didn't have enough
of the security that he needed in order
for an you know to prevent this kind of
scam
recently they've been notifying
customers to set up a dedicated poured
out pin so that they can protect
themselves right at that step actually
have that pin set up though isn't that
was a general account access pin you
know what you use to it Nexus that
counts and do commit to actions whereas
this this would be right before oh I'm
going to switch alright we'll need your
pin for that so yeah I'll be curious to
see what t-mobile's response here I
think the the escalating security
concerns on how much we live our lives
through mobile accounts
small pocketable computers this this
thing is you know obviously we're gonna
see an increase in this type of data
trafficking which means that we're gonna
see an increase in the bad actors out
there that want to find novel ways of
gaining access especially when they can
they can hard target hit people on
individual issues and you know it's it's
not going to be as scary excuse me it's
not going to be as scary as when there's
like an industry-wide exploit that can
be leveraged very very easily but I
think there's still enough money for
taking the amount of time to
individually target consumers like this
I'm not entirely sure what t-mobile can
do to make this situation better how do
you safeguard and account data to a
point where you really trust that an
outsider can't get in but you also don't
make it ridiculously painful for the
consumer to get in or change information
or update information it's like as soon
as you have some kind of point of access
that's that's a point of failure and you
know company like t-mobile has a lots of
points of access which means they have
lots of points of failure yeah I mean
well I mean there are different ways
where in which the encryption comes in
to savior but and in this case the only
encryption that you get is hey what was
that what was my name again
it was a it's a double view is it and
there's like this little they start
playing like what was I who was the guy
did it was a crossing over that terrible
sci-fi show with the
with its crossing Jordan no not crossing
Jordan crossing Jordan was an okay show
I think what's crossing over like
basically a guy who goes out there and
does his Vegas act like oh I sense
someone in the audience I'm getting the
letter R is are someone and you're like
if you just do that to a t-mobile
employee who's maybe making a buck over
minimum wage like yeah you'll you'll
probably be able to get into anyone's
account again the social engineering
yeah we all know this we all know like
you watch a movie scene and someone's
hacking and they're typing frantically
on a keyboard way more hacking is more
about social engineering and unraveling
someone's behavior than it is hacking
the hardware that the the unraveling the
encryption on the mainframe like that's
not that's not the way more is done on a
bed with a box of pizza next to you and
you're trying to figure out what's going
on with this hash and then you just give
up for the night and sleep on the box of
pizza and and and like like your super
fancy with pizza I was gonna make a joke
about like pizza rolls you know yeah
that would be better a scattering of
like 3/4 eaten pizza rolls he really
just hates that last little crunchy
crust bite he can't stand it so he
leaves that on the side he's watching
his carb intake but all there is it you
really wants to like get that gooey
Center out of every single Totino's that
he can yeah it's really tricky because
once you first microwave a man those
things are molten like that is lava in
your mouth right there but you know he
needs his he needs its hacker fuel along
with his Mountain Dew Code Red and
that's exactly not the image I think we
should be trying for a KERS because now
they're gonna wreck my ass are not
wanted by Totino's nor are we sponsored
by Mountain Dew Code Red or passers
difference you're upon surd by hackers
so well okay great
a real quick we do have one here from
renato Laporte p and weekly those are
two tweets come in and how can number
porting be so easy have you either here
you either need physical access to the
sim to provide the sim number or you
need to confirm with an SMS
further your old provider will notify
you by mail and SMS and the whole
process takes at least 11 days so if
asked
so if asked a number porting I'll need
to wait at least 11 days I'm on prepaid
or 30 days went on contract and in the
meanwhile I get notified by the old and
new provider of the day and time that
the number porting will happen now
that's that's because I think you're
going through those individual points of
contact if you can if you can replace
someone's user data like if you can
impersonate that person and you can
switch over some of that communication
like oh and hey send my new bill to this
address or you know like an you send
like some specious address and it's not
really a the right thing if you can kind
of wedge yourself in there I bet it
wouldn't be too hard to intercept some
of that communication and verification
process yeah my species address would be
the address of the transformer that's
outside the house over here so I I
probably I don't remember what it is now
wow that's that's a terrible I was gonna
say I'd probably do something like
Evergreen Terrace from The Simpsons ever
who lived there in Springfield no yeah
who lived there because it's Simpson I
just forget for your email because it's
something something something Evergreen
Terrace that's neither I would ever be
thinking yeah whether there had been
Smithers but then no way walk the street
from Gerald Ford and then Gerald Ford
just disappeared and was never heard
from again in the Simpsons universe but
that's that's on say well I think I
could do with some steamed hams right
about now so we'll take a 30-second
break and we'll I'm gonna go watch the
over aura borealis in in my kitchen wall
listen to this amazing cut of audio from
this yes you go do that don't know where
to begin check out the Google cloud
platform weekly podcast where Google
developer advocates Melanie Warrick and
mark Mandela and
your questions get in the weeds and talk
to GCP teams customers and partners
about best practices from security to
machine learning and more hear from
technologists all across Google about
trends and cool things happening with
our technology click to learn more and
subscribe to the podcast at GT o-- / GCP
podcast and we are back and ready to do
some little little more news as we go
along on this show here certainly you
know and we've got some topics to
discuss for Apple as it goes on in terms
of its iPhone battery replacement
program for the 6 all the way through
the 7 with the SE included and it has
reported to Congress to a Senate
Subcommittee on its progress saying that
demand has been very strong and that's
one of the members of the actually the
Chairman the Republican John Thune of
North Dakota said that Apple may be
considering giving rebates out to those
who had already gotten an out of
warranty battery replacement for $79 and
they could be giving $50 rebates to them
to reflect the current price the
subsidized price of $29 so that might be
interesting to look to in the meantime
we've got word from Amazon that it is
now selling Amazon Prime exclusive
phones Android phones that used to have
lockscreen hands and wallpapers
compromised with promotions nowadays
they're not doing that anymore they are
charging $20 more but there is still
it's still a very hefty discount from
the original price and instead you'll
just have to deal with Amazon apps more
of those services coming in baked into
your phone so less intrusive but the
reason why they said they're doing this
is because of facial recognition that's
their peach their lockscreen ads would
preclude those features from working so
that sort of makes sense right there
Carl Pei has taken down some rumors as
he is want to do some
times he has been a pretty vocal person
but especially when it comes to rumors
about his company making phones that one
less x2 that's not a real thing it's
fake news we should be combating it with
the civility and I don't know but it
would be a sequel to the mid-range phone
of 2015 that followed on from the
oneplus 2 and it was a one-time-only
thing at $249 it was a pretty cool thing
too as we have reviewed it with its
ceramic back and whatnot but sadly it
doesn't seem like we're gonna get that
let's talk about something now see how
about LG the company has said that it it
will be leaving the Chinese market for
smartphones apparently a reporter was
able to go up to their offices in
Beijing and a staffer just said that so
it's not surprising we're gonna go that
there's a very anti-climatic story there
that's what they said it's not
surprising given that less than 1% less
than 0.1 percent market share that they
have in their troubles trying to compete
on price where everyone is competing on
price including the domestic players so
there they're just looking there were
wounds at this point and one of the
other industries that is licking their
wounds is the the fabricators of CDs
DVDs those kinds of things because Best
Buy has announced or it reportedly
announced this is a through billboard
here that's they are dropping CD
inventory from July first and that
target also looking towards moving to a
consignment model where the owners
design the suppliers to take care of the
inventory and whatnot and they would
only pay the suppliers per sale so this
is a
this is a weathers last gasps aver that
the CD will have in our retail space for
now especially as vinyl comes up and
streaming dominates Oh talk about that
we should we should probably save that
though what excuse me I my beef jerky
snack during the ad break is coming back
to make itself heard during our podcast
I want to get back to the absolutely
because one of the things it's just sort
of a throwaway comment that a lot of
news outlets are putting out there is
that Apple is already facing 50
class-action lawsuits directly related
to the battery battery throttling
situation I really don't feel that this
story is resonating with general
consumers I think it's something that
tech fans have been talking about a lot
but it doesn't seem to have
significantly impacted disrupted or even
just cracked into the general mindshare
on sort of the general populace I with
with some of these stories like Sumer or
about us or about Apple or what well but
that's kind of what I'm trying to
unravel is like at what point do we care
this kind of goes back to that question
that I threw out there about the
perception of the smartphone market and
the commoditization of the smartphone
and now we all just sort of have
accepted certain kinds of lobster
potting compromises that seem to get
worse over time not better but you know
we're still buying these things and
we're still supporting certain companies
because they're our team I'm wondering
what it would if if Apple goes through
this process of offering up rebates is
it's probably just gonna be some jenkki
little press release on the back pages
of the Apple website where someone would
have to know about it through some other
means look it up
search for it dig through the website
fill out some really obnoxious paperwork
serial numbers date of purchase proof of
purchase and then try and get some kind
of receipt back from when they got the
battery replacement in the first place
which no one's gonna do or very few
people are gonna do for the $50.00 that
they stand to potentially get back from
it just seems like it seems like kind of
a non gesture from Apple's perspective I
think back when Apple was announcing
their profits or the no not profits uh
the jobs 20,000 new jobs in the because
of the tax cuts they there was some
characterization maybe in the ABC News
interview or something that some
something like that but Jim Koch
may be one the analysts that they had on
was saying that this was the battery
replacement period and it was kind of a
olive branch or like something something
gracious on Apple's part that they were
offering it wasn't because you know this
was you know a thing that could have
damaged or maybe is damaging their brand
is damaging sales in some respects so
well I I seriously doubt it is
especially just because when we look at
traditional media I had to reach out to
my contact at Fox and the producer I
work with thought it was hilarious but
when this story was first reported and
it was only reported sort of in the
initial batch of disclosure that came
out one of the one of the actual like
hard-hitting investigative journalists
at Fox 11 she had you could tell she had
very little understanding of what was
going on and just kept talking about how
Apple was throttling the battery and
just kept repeating that phrase over and
over and over again like you know
they're slowing down the battery they're
throttling the battery a lot of people
are gonna be upset about that no one
wants their battery to be throttled
no one wants their battery slowed down
it's like you had one job it's like it's
like saying they're slowing you down the
water and like like the water is being
slowed down but that it was completely
nonsensical that was the level of
traditional media coverage that we got
in Southern California I know some other
outlets probably handled it better local
news people there were probably some
people who handled it better some people
who didn't talk about it at all because
it's geeky stuff but yeah that was
emblematic of one
the nation's largest media markets and
that's how they were talking about this
issue you know any consumer who saw that
and you're like oh you know my boater is
gonna slower used to charge really fast
you know like that's not that wasn't
what the problem was and and so knowing
that there's a woefully under educated
base of consumers out there and and to
their credit it's that they want a
product that's going to be easy to use
and that just sort of fits into their
lifestyle and they don't have to think
about managing that product too often if
we wonder about the reason yeah there's
like oh my battery's slow I don't care
as long as you fix it and make sure that
it's a whatever slow is fast again well
and then but it's also like this I feel
like if Apple is in earnest trying to
repair some of the ill-will that this is
caused they need to be proactive in
reaching out to consumers you've got all
of the records of customers who shopped
through genius stores and got excuse me
got products and got batteries replaced
I would want to see at you know like I
think it would be probably 2 grand a
gesture of Apple right now because
they're not a magnanimous company
they're a corporation that exists to
create as much value for shareholders as
they can what I would want to see them
do is contact all of those customers
that supplied email addresses if not
that then some sort of public posting on
a major page of the Apple website I
would want to see them publicly
disclosed this was the problem this was
our communication we're owning it and
this is how we're gonna fix the problem
I'm really not impressed so far with the
little dance we're doing with oh no this
was for the consumer benefit because it
really does need to be disclosed at some
point that there is no expectation of
your multi hundred two thousand dollar
product being able to last more than a
year and not face severe instability
shutdowns slowdowns without wrecking the
performance of the device that needs to
be front and center for every discussion
we have about Apple now they
in the bare minimum battery to last you
the day when the phone is brand new and
they haven't addressed this publicly to
any great degree while still maintaining
this public image of this company in
this brand being you know so user
friendly so consumer friendly so so easy
to use it just works they get so much
goodwill from the the carry over days of
Apple's brand reputation that this
should be a bigger deal in the general
populace I want to move to Australia not
because Telus or not Telus Telstra or
Optus or any good but because of the
Australian Consumer Law which says that
you've you know if you're the consumer
is entitled to your refund if the
project doesn't last for a typical you
know for a typical life cycle and you
know they base it off of industry
figures of but like this is you know
there's a lot of there are a lot more
protective aspects to it so that you
know consumers aren't fobbed off by the
manufacturer or the store or the seller
like there's and we wouldn't be we
wouldn't have to deal with all this yeah
I we definitely need to change some part
of this conversation I think one of the
things that's been most frustrating is
the geek side of this has been devalued
what with tech being so prolific in the
consumer space is becoming more of a
lifestyle conversation to be fair geeks
are intolerably frustrating to converse
with you know like we're not always the
easiest people to to engage with but
this is precisely why we need to be
leading these kinds of conversations and
making sure that we're being inclusive
really trying to draw people in and and
not engaging in as much schadenfreude
over Apple's brand reputation as we
probably want to be more trying to
handle the concern for our friends and
family who are getting a raw deal and
and approaching that is going to be
really sensitive because you have that
backfire effect you know someone has
sort of a dogmatic relationship with a
brand and geeks are certainly guilty of
this too but someone has that dogmatic
relationship with a brand there
here information that runs counter to
their assertions even if it's good
evidence they're going to actually
recoil farther away from that new
information then then if you can join
the conversation in a way that's less
confrontational
speaking of geeks my relationship with
consumer brand Amazon I thought you were
gonna skip Amazon and go to one plus
because one plus I think is the perfect
a geek brand we followed a brand
regardless of whatever evidence that
brand is likely to show them you're
right let's talk about Amazon first
though yeah no I wanted that was the
part of the joke but I'm happy I'm
certainly happy that we're seeing fewer
ads or at least you know not having to
deal with them as obtrusively as they
used to be for what hundred dollars
lists aren't like 20% off the price of a
usual phone it's just gonna be a little
bit more smoother we'll actually be able
to use a feature that was intended by
the OEM on the phone like it's gonna be
I know I
this is a really good look for Amazon
right now because this is a Amazon as an
organization is going to face some some
optics problems coming up soon Jeff
Bezos being so ridiculously wealthy and
valuable in terms of the company stock
and his own earnings while also looking
at stores that are probably gonna start
laying off cashiers for automated Amazon
systems to do check out the whole job
pocalypse is gonna be you know fueled in
part by Amazon innovation and we also as
a society need to come to grips with how
do we value labor and human dignity when
it's it shouldn't necessarily always be
just a fixed to a straight dollar amount
that you can generate through your labor
or through your I mean there isn't
into an Amazon ghost or have you seen
what we'd look like in those cameras
where we're we're kind of dancing around
and looking at objects and determining
the value of them and I can't say that I
have jewels I'm familiar with the
dancing in an Amazon ghost or so but but
this this this is a step that I actually
do want to say thumbs up because I think
we're starting to get the early
indications that the next phase of
online services can't be built in just a
dumb advertising model anymore I don't
think that's going to be the future of
monetizing content I think YouTube is
learning this lesson the hard way and is
pissing off a humongous part a a hunk of
their user base in the process Amazon is
probably looking at these metrics and
saying you know for what ad revenue we
might engage with or what services
people might sign up for if we charge
$20 more for the phone we're gonna
balance that out as opposed to keeping
people signed up on Amazon Prime that
Amazon Prime is the bigger draw for
Amazon then making sure someone is
constantly aware of ads in their general
sphere of influence frankly speaking I
mean we're talking about prime exclusive
phones they were available they are
available excuse me only to those who
have an Amazon Prime subscription does
that ninety nine dollars a year that you
pay and Amazon is encouraging you to buy
more products that generate more revenue
than just an ala carte service which you
already have access to prime music crime
movies like you can it's they're like
all they've done for you is just make
the app appear on the thing
automatically as opposed to you having
to download it and but that's where most
of the revenue has come from and with
that out of the way their largest
revenue generator for something that's
arguably kind of like human pro-human
you can say that then I'm wondering
where they might be able to squeeze in
another kind of thing that might be able
to encourage sales or prod them long
well but that's and I think that that
goes hand in hand with this this change
in philosophy you weren't getting you
you weren't getting the ad impact on
someone who was already a prime
subscriber by jacking their their
lockscreen
that wasn't the big value-add keeping
them in the prime ecosystem is way
better from a monetary standpoint then
potentially losing someone to a
competing product or a competing service
and so now we've got these offers on
phones which generally have very very
competitive pricing like looking at the
LG G 6 plus on Amazon Prime that's a
that's a that's a decent deal for a
reasonably powerful phone right in that
mid range er territory against other
competitors like there is an idea there
that that works really well so you get
them to buy that phone which comes
preloaded with Amazon services this to
me speaks of a future tactic that
Microsoft is probably going to be
engaging in don't try and fight Android
instead make Android full of Microsoft
services so you sell you you have that
licensing deal with Samsung Samsung's
are being sold in Microsoft stores and
come pre-loaded with Microsoft services
you know this is the one part of
Microsoft that is like absolutely
dominating still and still finding
growth at the same time is keeping
people invested in the Microsoft
software ecosystem don't try and fight a
hardware war you can't battle you can't
win so that this this I think is going
to be a really interesting take on the
next-gen of services is what can google
do to provide a value-add first service
like YouTube you know you you want to
keep people invested watching content
streaming content and trying to monetize
that has proven an uphill battle and
even more difficult proposition in this
era of super popular YouTube channels
engaging in abject douchebaggery
you know like you're gonna scare off
advertisers well that's Google's
bread-and-butter getting people to pay
for ads but how do you leverage that
against people who don't watch ads and
Facebook is trying to figure this out
too at the same time saying like oh no
buy an ad so that all the people will
know about your product but ads couldn't
possibly affect political campaigns ads
aren't effective for for that you know
like you know every single company that
built their service uncool put it out
for free and is now trying to find a way
to monetize we're gonna see radically
decreasing benefits to making consumers
interact with advertising to try and
fund your cool service all right you
talked about a war that you can't win is
that right so I've met Carl pay in real
life a couple of times he seems very
determined or with me again is that is
that what we're getting at very civil
with him when it comes to Twitter when
it comes to social media he is like a
wall you can't get things you know a cry
you know blasts you can't blast things
through him without talk okay so they're
big rumors about a 1 plus X 2 as I've
talked about and be a mid-range sequel
to the 1 plus X and there were like spec
rumors about the snapdragon 835 as I say
I haven't looked into you the source
rumor material but what got my attention
was Karl pays retweets of the story and
then he just says nope and then he goes
on to crusade about fake news is a huge
threat to human civilization let's all
do our part in stopping it and the third
goes on you know claims about him
denying the 1 + 3 T before it was
launched or something like that maybe
could have been talking about the 1 plus
3s but letters ready
hashtag fake news hashtag click baits
blah blah blah please make a compact
5-inch 2x1 handsets oneplus device sizes
at getting out of hand
Karl pay grow bigger hands so I mean
he's a he's a he's a force to be
reckoned with
Joker I you know so so here's the thing
I mean getting into the to the meat of
the rumor I really hope that one plus
does not try another X experiment I
think you already have a messaging
problem with the no compromises never
settling device that's supposed to come
in at a much lower price point you you
can't you can't extend that conversation
back down into a phone that's purposely
designed to have compromises to meet
certain price tiers this this is this it
didn't work for the X and I know the
other people are complaining like oh
well the X never got nougat and like
maybe if it got if you've gotten those
software updates that was out of oneplus
as control I don't know that any
Qualcomm 801 series phones got got
updates to nougat because of issues with
kernels and Google and programmers and
developers but this is where the company
needs to focus they need to kind of keep
a very clean brand message going
especially if they're trying to pivot
mainstream and a one device strategy
that sort of land smack dab in the
middle of the smartphone market Park it
place price is I think the safest way
for them to go I think if they diversify
and they try and do too much then
they're probably gonna make everyone
unhappy not all will will have products
to you know entice more customers I
don't think those those products will be
as well built or as well supported I
don't even think the tea should like
exist it should be just blood device if
you have to wait until November to
launch it then go ahead but I kinda like
that as an idea I don't think they're
executing that idea very well is because
they don't have multiple phone lines and
they they're trying again remember a lot
of this is that emotional branding right
they're trying to get you to
have an emotional relationship with the
company because I mean all things being
equal there are numerous solutions for
having a smartphone today whatever draws
you in is likely going to be an
emotional response first and then you'll
go back and rationally justify why you
want to do business with that company I
think there's something really cool
about the conversation of them saying
tech iterates and cycles quickly and so
we are going to put out two phones a
year but they're gonna be the same phone
it's just there's always going to be a
refresh so if you're at this point of
the year if you jump in now you're
you'll be getting the best tech that we
can get our hands on because that's
gonna change very rapidly over a period
of about six months we're gonna give it
a refresh coming in here so that way you
never really feel like your phone is
like three years out of date it's
depending on when you get in and
depending on when you decide to rebuy
buy in for a new phone you know that
you'll be pretty close to whatever is
bleeding-edge at that time I think the
problem is is they're trying to operate
with secrecy as if these are so such new
and different devices that are coming
out though the five the five T oh it's
fresh it's new it's exciting that it's
going to make people who buy in at the
first half of the year feel like like
they're getting the bad device that's
that that to me is just a problem of
brand perception I think if they were
more proactive and more forthright in
the conversation because the customers
would know like I'm getting the best
possible device that one could buy today
because if you wait you can always get a
better device it doesn't matter what
manufacturer you wait six months better
phones will come out you know there is
there is a qualitative difference in
like Galaxy s8 to Galaxy Note 8 and you
know part of that is just getting a
newer version of Android and better
understanding of how to optimize for the
hardware that Samsung built so I think
if oneplus could join the conversation
that way there'd be a lot less ire over
these you know these refreshes every six
months if specially if it wants to be a
mainstream brand toad but those tumors
aren't gonna follow that our consumers
aren't gonna piece that together on
their own you're gonna have to
spoon-feed general consumers and no way
carriers are gonna want to support those
kinds of SKUs they're gonna want the one
oneplus phone that they can put up in
display case they're not gonna want to
jump through these types of branding
shenanigans unless one-plus already
comes with a growing user base that are
demanding that phone alright let's get
to our in memoriam parts I'm not sure if
that's all
but yeah so Best Buy Target they're not
playing around CDs anymore
digital downloads or even going down the
drain and they're open rumors about
iTunes that music store going away
although Apple's denied it it's a dude
you can tell that physical media
especially the laserdisc now that's not
right but people compact that's that's
later laser-etched and can store up to
four point seven gigabytes of media on
it I think that's for a DVD or something
like that era CD dude CD was 750
megabytes is that 750 megabytes
mm and he had those right speeds I never
really understood like what was 8 x or
sit down with a big deal back in the day
I remember when I got my first CD burner
and I splurged on the the faster it was
I think it was an 8 speed CD burner you
actually had to make sure the media was
compatible because if you tried to burn
too fast it would like it would like
corrupt the data in the burn when it
would fail and you'd have to throw out
one of these preciously expensive shiny
reflective you know coasters whatever CD
is made of because like beyond the
chrome and varnish I don't know like
what the medium actually is I mean it's
it's a it's plastic with with a light
reflective substance now CDs that were
that were finished for distribution in
music the the zeros and ones are on a
medium that is that is pretty well
permanent like a metal substrate I
believe the CD burner I believe actually
had an ink like layer that the laser
would then disrupt the patterns in the
ink
to create the zeros and ones I'm grossly
oversimplifying the technology of the CD
because it is it is a little bit more
complicated than that but that's a sense
this is up I think how totally and and I
mean it's not like there's ink in a CD I
just mean it's it's it's sort of like a
you know like like a hole punch like
process and so it is a different
material than what a finished music CD
resembled but yeah III think it's kind
of interesting there there's something
so organic and tactile like I need to go
and get a new turntable my turntable
actually died last year and it was a
cheap turntable so it wasn't like I was
super sad but there's something so so
tactile and so organic about the needle
drop on vinyl when you want to listen
you you want to sit down and you want to
listen to music not just have music
sound tracking another activity like I'm
not gonna put on a record to go and then
work out that that it's hilarious that
has well eclipsed the the convenience of
the CD like you don't want the CD for
that organic listening experience that's
way less convenient than just listening
to mp3s
I'll be curious to see if in this
digital space since people don't seem to
be as concerned about owning digital
files of their music as much as
streaming if we'll ever get back to some
idea of having an archival quality
digital file that people own if you
really love this album and you want to
save the absolute best highest quality
version of it
there aren't marketplaces that that
really fully take advantage of the audio
playing capabilities on modern mobile
hardware let alone you know like
high-end stereo equipment still seems
kind of focused more on the enthusiast
sector of people who listen to vinyl
yeah what do you think about that
anyways because like it in the same
breath of news that we got we're best by
saying that they're dropping their CD
stock on July 1st they're apparently
going to keep on selling records with
turntables for the next couple of years
well a major problem with with digital
like hardware digital was we never got
that marketing quality bump you know
like we went from DVDs to blu-rays I
mean laserdisc to DVD to blu-ray
especially moving from VHS to DVD that
was a huge jump CDs stayed at sort of a
basic Redbook 1644 one you know like
that that that never really improved we
had sa CD and DVD a that fought a format
war that no one cared about when again
if you hadn't had that format war
holding back the innovation of a higher
quality standard you could have been
marketing the crap out of that to people
who fancy themselves audio files whether
or not you believe that there's any
benefits 24-bit audio I do believe there
is a benefit to archival quality like
where you take that 24-bit file and you
you you know you make a flak out of it
or you make a high quality mp3 out of it
for convenience but then you always have
that amazing source file to go back to
and as the industry improves or there
are better audio playing capabilities
and phones or in media players or
Bluetooth headsets
maybe someday becomes super great you
can always go back to the source to make
whatever new format the industry might
be utilizing mqa looks like that might
be another potential benefit for super
high quality but low impact like a low
low streaming that that compression
seems like it's gonna be a boon for the
industry
so they've completely missed out on
iterating you know how do you get
someone to rebuy a CD it sounds pretty
much good enough so you needed to make
that emotional argument again I like
everything about this week it's the week
before Valentine's Day it's all about it
the emotion the feelers you needed to
make that you needed to make someone
feel like their CD wasn't good enough
just like going from DVD to blu-ray you
did see some quality some some video
quality benefits that HD that's super
fancy but for a lot of folks out there
especially before HD TVs were as
commonplace
we're buying blu-rays like on the future
of what
what kind of TV they might own after
their current you know standard
definition TV man you talk about svcd
versus dvd-a I only remember a DHD DVD
and blue-ray like that that was the big
friend of my time so yeah we had we had
these formats and they were better copy
protected I mean the music industry
wanted a more locked up format you
couldn't just rip him like he could CDs
although that would have changed if they
had found any any kind of traction and I
you know I really wanted to like
experiments like what was that was a
upon yo oh yo what was that third funky
yeah not on key oh I can't remember it
was I think it was was it Neil Diamond
this is terrible podcasting but I'm
actually going to look for yeah players
yo Neil Diamond Joe it was it like a who
knows it was pono completely wrong but I
was pretty close yeah so I mean that
never materialized titles super high
quality audio doesn't seem to be much of
a draw to anyone but there is something
and it's probably mostly psychosomatic
but I pulled some there are some sample
sites that have like really high quality
and QA rips of like orchestral music and
I plugged in it's not like I own super
super expensive audiophile headphones I
mean right now my go-to open-back
headphones are just a pair of Sennheiser
599's which are expensive but they're
not like you know like Shores $3,000
electrostatic earbuds or anything like
that but I'll plug those 599's into an
LG V 30 and fire up this mqa track and
it feels different than anything else
that I've listened to from like mp3s and
decent earbuds like it expands on the
audio and the music in a way that just
feels so much nicer again could be all
in my brain just because I
know what I'm doing and I know what I
like and so I might just be you know
kind of you know circus my realize
though how many ones and zeros are
coming in through each meeting like yeah
but that's the crowd what's exciting
about mqa is because mqa is giving us
like audio audio quality that
scientifically resides in like the
32-bit audio space but in a in a format
that it would be much easier to stream
like what title was trying to do with
with a 24-bit 24-bit masters to download
onto people's devices mqa could give us
you know spotify super high quality you
know anyone who who fancies himself that
audiophile great listener or ears that
can really discern these types of
nuances though that's probably not true
the you know the the color and dynamic
range and spatial separation and all
these things that we say we care about
when we were trying to be discerning
music listeners mqa could deliver at a
much smaller file size to make the the
streaming the bandwidth requirements
much lower and that could be really
exciting now if anyone can explain to me
the concept of computing via a tape
cassettes I I can't really help you with
that I I only had five and a quarter
floppies I never had a tape deck I
always want ever had that they were a
Commodore you never had I I went
straight to das I was on an 80 88 man
and and we splurged for not only dual
floppy drives but dual floppy drives and
a hard drive we had kilobytes of
built-in storage bra you don't even know
it was lit 256 kilobytes I mean who
could store I mean that's that's like
that's like a quarter of the Library of
Congress if you have no pictures
[Laughter]
probably not even trying to remember all
the Wikipedia like archives like you
could archive the whole Wikipedia and
you just stuff it into a little USB disk
and
go away and then sometimes you know if
you need if you need your Wikipedia you
can just hey I'll just pull this up I'll
just plug it into my laptop okay but it
is now it's in a completely you not
friendly to use format but I can just
ctrl F the terms that I need right well
and uh we do have a tweet here from
Renato Laporte hashtag pn wiki hashtag P
and weekly ya 24-bit vinyl rips are the
best
I wished this was a thing you could
legally buy instead of having to look on
on the bays yeah whatever torrents I
file transferring site you might use I
I've been sort of creating and
collecting my own I've got a Radiohead
rip that again it's a little noisier
because my turntable wasn't super great
but it's warm and it's fat and it's
really well mixed and Radiohead took the
time to deliver a great vinyl transfer
because you can't mix for vinyl like you
can for for digital like you can't you
can't overload the bass or you can't
overly compress the audio because you
know it'll just punch through the side
wall of the record like it's it's a
really unique listening listening
experience and I cut my vinyl rip I did
it 24 96 and then I of course I danced
ample dit to mp3 so I could easily store
it on on my phones at the time but I'll
I can always go back to that 24-bit rip
and that was the very first time I
dropped the needle on that record I
captured the the exact first listen in
its most pristine format because every
time you listen to a record it degrades
slightly it's you know I've got that
that very first needle drop captured you
know that that's an experience I don't
know how to properly convey that if
you're not really into music or you're
not really into this kind of stuff like
that's special feels like music feeling
special again not just being completely
disposable speaking of well I want to
see if we can like do experimental track
where you just have the bass all the way
up and then it you can have all the the
freaking need I'll skip all the way down
to the end of the
like that also grows I mean we could it
would be a really expensive experiment
that we know will end in abject failure
very good we could do it I'm sure yeah
yeah maybe I mean something you me let's
go let's uh
whenever I head to LA little retro
studio and then we'll be able to get our
Strandberg out and yeah and we'll have
to do we'll have to record everything on
like classic vintage ribbon mics and
then unlike for track tape machines now
the only we do it is through a five
pound of british five-pound note like we
take the plastic but that has been done
okay I'm done unaware you kown up a
five-pound note and then then you can
actually play it too you can actually
put it down on a track it's amazing well
but all of that notwithstanding CDs
dying there's something that makes
there's some idea in the back of my head
that makes me feel I should be sad about
this but I'm really not like as a
physical medium I wanted to see it
evolve and it never did just like we got
DVD and then blu-ray and then HD and
then quad HD or I mean all tricky we
never got that same that same like arms
race in an audio to really try and
improve the consumer experience so it's
fine it can go away let's safe to argue
that it never will so good riddance good
riddance and we don't need that much
disposable plastic in our lives anymore
we should probably speaking of
disposable plastic and things that are
much better when you stream them we
should probably wrap up the show with
one more one more sneak from our sponsor
this week because they're not making you
buy CDs to listen to their awesome
content no in fact we're gonna talk
about them at the end of the show like
afterwards like I thought we were gonna
do I thought we were gonna do that just
before the the rap out it's not a
baseball people n roll's and his like
