the s3's records HTC is increasing their
production of the HTC One and some Nokia
EOS rumors continue as they've
apparently seen the phone already I'm
hey memory data and this is me showing
you that I could stop drinking on a
Friday to record this video this is
 out daily let's start to stay
off with some blackberry news as we
already know that bbm is coming to iOS
and Android in July but well blackberry
just came on record to state that it
will only be available for smartphones
and not tablets initially apparently
they will be working on a tablet version
of BBM to come in the future but given
the fact that I don't remember the
PlayBook actually has a BBM app and
given the fact that very few people
actually care about BBM anymore well I
don't know how that's going to play off
but stay tuned for July let's see what
we get now let's continue talking about
nokia there are some heavy reports that
there yose or eos codename device it
apparently was already spotted and
apparently this device will retain the
same Nokia Lumia 920 design only that it
will be more tapered on the edges than
the Lumia 920 currently is it's kind of
interesting imagine how they can fit
that huge lens the 41-megapixel lens
into a chassis like the Lumia 920 which
was pretty thin you know for today's
standards so stay tuned on when we will
probably see this phone sadly there are
no photos just yet we'll keep you posted
end up next we've got samsung is
apparently their galaxy s4 has already
broken significant sales records when
compared to the galaxy s3 just to give
you an idea it took samsung 50 days to
sell 10 million units of the galaxy s3
and while it hasn't even been a month
since the galaxy s4 was released and
already they're reaching those 10
million units hasn't gotten there just
yet but it'll happen very soon and by
the way for those of you that were
interested in the tech tiles apparently
they're already on sale a new tech house
too because the old ones don't work so
make your purchase whatever you can and
galaxy s4 did you buy it and speaking of
some good sales figures ACC has not run
as any numbers on how the HTC One is
going but the company is now doubling
production of the phone and may and
apparently they're going to do that
again
June as they have prepare Lee gone over
estimates again we don't have any
specific numbers just yet but this does
mean that the company is having a good
time with this phone and hopefully I
mean this is the Haven that we've been
waiting for in their case and aside from
that if you're on spring you get your
software update today and you'll be
getting enhancements and sensitivity for
the buttons and also enhancements in
blinkfeed even though you don't use it
and finally for the interesting news of
the day apparently Apple has run into
some more hurdles and convincing record
labels to allow them to push I radio for
WWDC it seems that the companies are not
willing to accept that apple pays them
half what Spotify pays for example or
the fact that Apple wants to pay after
the music is consumed and not before as
everybody else pays which is kind of
interesting but anyways remember Apple
always holds a music event at the end of
the year in the fall so we weren't
really expecting this to happen at WWDC
anyways but that leads me to the
question of the day what music service
do you use I mean leave us a comment and
tell us what is your preferred music
service so far overall honestly Spotify
has been like the best service that I've
ever found its cross-platform it's great
it's very efficient it's cheap I do buy
music in itunes every now and then
because that's the only service that
works outside the united states mostly
but leave us a comment down below what
is your preferred service so far and of
course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and top of world make sure
