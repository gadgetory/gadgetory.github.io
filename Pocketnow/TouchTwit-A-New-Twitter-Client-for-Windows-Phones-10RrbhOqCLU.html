pocket now calm and this is a preview of
touch to it which is an upcoming twitter
program for windows phones that will be
on the windows marketplace for mobile
which is the app store for windows
mobile devices let's take a look at how
it functions and i think you're going to
be impressed with what this new program
will bring to Windows Mobile currently a
lot of people use to a guinea and pocket
to it for their twittering needs from a
windows mobile touchscreen device but
touched wit may change all of that let's
take a look one of the downsides of
touch to it is that it takes a long time
to load but beyond that operation is
very fast and it's got a lot of really
interesting features that take advantage
of gestures okay so here we are in the
application and along the bottom of the
screen instead of the standard windows
mobile too soft key bar we get five
buttons that are relevant to the
program's functions and that stay with
the program no matter what screen you
are in kind of like an iPhone app and if
we go into landscape we get those same
buttons just rearranged over to the left
so you can take advantage of some of
that screen space so in this application
we can flick quickly to get to the
bottom of our tweets or you can go a
little bit slower by just tapping and
dragging like in any other program and
let's say you want to isolate a tweet
you left gesture on one of the tweets
and then some really interesting things
happen you get to see the tweet right
here you can copy it to a clipboard add
it as a favorite you can scroll down on
this tweet you can retweet what this
person said you can add them or you can
add reply them I should say or you can
just drill into their profile from here
you'll see their avatar their bio and
plus you'll see how many followers they
have how many people they're following
you can direct message them right from
the screen block them or stop following
them all within this one screen which is
really convenient now one of the
problems with Twitter in generals that
you lose track easily of the @ replies
you at reply back and forth to your
followers they add reply to you but in
the end sometimes you wonder what are we
talking about what is this in response
to well there's a really cool chat view
that this program has so let's go to an
somebody that's at reply
let's go to say z power and I'm going to
gesture left and i'm going to click on
the chat view and i get to see the
conversation back and forth between
these two people and sometimes if there
are three people involved you also get
to see all of those parties in one
screen so let's try to find some more @
replies here here's one right here let's
see if we get three okay so here's an
example where there are three people in
a conversation you get to see their
avatar and what they're talking about so
a really great way to keep track of all
these conversations that are going on in
Twitter at one time of course you can
also see your mentions your @ replies
down here on the bottom if you click on
the at reply button and from here you
can just take a look at who's who's
responding to you you can drill into one
tweet in particular if you just left
scroll or left gesture and you can add
reply back to this person quickly
through the screen or retweet what they
said or anything like that and you can
refresh all of your ad replies by just
tapping on that blue refresh button the
button to the right of that is your
direct message screen where you can
obviously take a look at who is direct
messaged you so the right of that is a
really cool screen that gives you a ton
of choices on what you can do with
Twitter so it gives you some statistics
about yourself from here you can what
you just saw there was me rearranging an
item accidentally from here you can
create a picture with twitpic you can
create a video with twitvid you can send
a new direct message and also from the
screen you can search the tweets you can
search users you can see the trending
topics of right now of the day and of
the week quite simply through this
screen so here it's going to load the
trending topics music Monday and of
course you can tap on music Monday it
will filter out everyone that's talking
about music monday so let's go back to
that more screen see if there's anything
else in there we also have some settings
that you can mess around with you can
add multiple Twitter accounts if you
manage more than one Twitter feed at a
time let's take a look at the update
screen so when you actually want and
want to make a tweet i'm going to delete
this one that I had made earlier and I'm
going to go into landscape to kind of
get a bigger view of the screen here so
what we can do now we can tap the at
reply button if
want to add reply somebody in our list
and it brings up your entire directory
of people that you follow which is quite
cool so let's say I want to direct a
message Adam Lane from pocket now and it
says at what we're actually going to add
reply them and we can type a message to
him I'm going to backspace here the
short URL button will automatically
shorten any URLs that are placed within
the screen so if I tap it right now
it'll say there are no links in the text
box to shorten the next one is location
it will assign your geo coordinates to
your tweet so people know where you are
the next one is media and from here you
can create a picture with your camera to
upload to twitpic or we can go into your
gallery and we're going to upload a
picture of my dog Bella so I tap on her
picture and it's uploading right now to
twitpic ok and there's the length to
twitpic although this hasn't auto hit in
itself it's strange that from this
button you can't also upload a video you
have to go to the previous more screen
in order to do that and when you're done
with your update you can just press the
check button up there and it will post
your tweet to Twitter for everyone to
see so overall we're super impressed
with punch to it it's amazing how much
functionality that can pack into a
mobile application it rivals what
functionality a desktop application
would have for Twitter it's really
fantastic and the gesture support really
adds a lot of intuitiveness to the
program for more on windows mobile and
of course twitter you can follow us on
twitter at twitter.com slash pocket now
sweets that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
