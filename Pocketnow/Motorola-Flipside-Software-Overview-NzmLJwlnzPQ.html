pocket now calm and we are back with
another video of the motorola flipside
so far you've seen as some boxes device
you've also seen this give you an
in-depth look at the hardware of this
device now it's time to take a look at
these software more specifically the
motoblur that is included on the
motorola flipside itself they want that
entails and what that offers four
features so let's get started and we're
back and one of the first things we're
actually going to take a look at it is
the software version or the version of
Android that comes pre-loaded on this
device now it is 2.1 we're going to
actually show you that right now so you
can see that now you'll see there the
firmware version is 2.1 update once so
we are running android 2.1 it's not
froyo yet however the motoblur you i
skin does bring some of its own cool
features to help hold you over now the
first that we're actually going to show
is going to be the widget customization
now of course motoblur is going to offer
its own widgets which we can actually
see right here and those range from
toggle so you'll have to actually spend
money now on the market buying toggles
such as bluetooth airplane mode that
sort of thing but it's going to have
calendars their own version of a
calendar date and time as you'll see
here more toggles they have an RSS
reader for news a very cool social
networking application status I mean
pretty much you name it whether Wi-Fi
toggle for the most part the basics are
here now to add one step onto that you
can actually resize these widgets just
by holding them down as you see you can
actually drag out now you make this
weather the entire size of our home
screen and there it is so it actually
has a different form to it being able to
change the size of some of your widgets
with added functionality and added
appearance is a very cool aspect of
modern that we really enjoy so far now
what you're seeing at the top of our
home screen here is the social network
widget this basically is going to show
mostly the Facebook status updates of
our friends as you can see this is one
of our most recent now if I actually
click on this we can actually keep
updating from there and will actually
bring us to the actual status update
itself which is very cool we can
actually scroll through these as you can
see here which is very neat it's
actually an easy way to look at your
friend status updates on Facebook will
having actually go into the facebook
application itself now on top of that
you can actually post your own
status update by pressing your little
icon down here that has the pencil over
it we can actually how to impress that
and now we can actually make our own
status update from Facebook well
actually one about 10 minutes ago it
says boom goes the dynamite we can
actually press here and we can now say
test status update from a motorola
flipside we've gone on we've type that
out using the qwerty keyboard we can now
press post and it takes a little bit
most likely because that's actually
connect back to the server but it will
actually post up that you can actually
go back to the home screen while that's
doing its thing and keep navigating
through you'll actually see little icon
that will pop it says status updated so
while that's working we're going to keep
browsing through and keep navigating
through here so we can show you what's
going on now if we swipe to the right
you're once again going to see that
weather widget that we showed you now
really haven't changed how this device
has been set up from a pre-installed
standpoint so all the application
shortcuts you're going to see or hear
when we actually open the device and
turn it on now on this page like we said
we're going to see the weather icon
we're also going to have the Google Maps
AT&amp;amp;T Navigator and the Yellow Pages mold
the choice is yours it's whatever you
want to do which is very nice here the
openness is always good to have
scrolling further to the right we're
going to have our next screen which once
again we have not touched since we've
opened it up it's going to have the
mobitv application shortcut the mobile
video as well as the gallery and then
we're going to have the last page which
is going to have some the toggle so
these are some of the toggles that
motoblur is going to offer to actually
give you a look at them so that's the
Wi-Fi toggle as well as the GPS toggle
so if I actually press this now it turns
off the GPS just like that it makes life
very easy especially if you bring these
icons closer to your home screen let's
say you leave your housing shot to drive
your car and you want to conserve on
your battery life you can turn off the
Wi-Fi and the blink of an eye now if we
go back to the home screen we start
swiping to at the other side as you can
see we're going to have these seven
different screens you can take advantage
of now on the first screen to the left
are going to have an unread or an unseen
messages so if we actually get a text
message it will actually populate in
this widget up here now beneath that you
can actually add a speed dial direct
dial to a shortcut we've actually gone
and take it a step further and use the
motoblur widget which actually will
bring up the contact itself and they
have a quick button for a call as well
as email you can
text messaging you can add directions to
that whichever works best for you keep
going a little further from there we're
going to see two more widgets one of
which is the RSS feed which to be honest
seems to be a little buggy from our
experiences it seems to update whenever
it wants to about five minutes ago it
was updated but as you can see right now
it's saying no recent news so for some
reason it has a mind of its own now
beneath that we have the calendar widget
which features that unique and very
useful resizing so you can actually make
this very big you see here and now it's
going to expand that even further for us
so it all depends on how you want your
calendar to look if you want to shrink
it down to be more horizontal you can do
so and it's actually going to flip and
rearrange itself in a graphical manner
and then last we have another blank
screen now going back to the home screen
on the bottom left you're going to have
your dialer shortcut or your phone
shortcut and on the bottom right you're
going to have your contact shortcutting
now instead of pressing either of those
recs you're going ahead and go to the
menu now as you'll see this just
actually shows right up and you can
scroll up and down in a very plain
fashion it's not going to give you that
experience that some Android devices do
that have the actual applications
scrolling on a wheel or on a grid it's
just very plain very simple but it still
works great now because this device uses
motoblur you're going to of course have
your motoblur account and also because
it's an eighteen t device you're going
to have your 18t applications like the
family mapping the maps itself music
navigator ATT radio and the Wi-Fi
hotspot applications as far as the
native Android application experience
goes it's going to be the same you're
going to get on practically every other
Android device out there this is
actually the Gmail application you're
seeing and if you want to scroll through
your actual image itself or the email
itself as you can see here it is the
same experience that you would get
elsewhere so that has been our software
overview of the motorola flipside our
next video we're actually going to
compare the flip side against one of the
devices that we've previously reviewed
the samsung transform now both these
devices are mid-range android devices so
it should be an interesting test to see
which is actually able to process videos
as well as the browser test faster if
you enjoy this video please give us a
thumbs up and state
tuned for the next video in our series
thanks for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
