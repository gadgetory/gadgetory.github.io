you turn your smartphone on every day
I'm Joe Levi with pocket now and
wouldn't it be convenient if you could
just swipe to unlock this is my nexus 4
it is routed I am running a custom ROM
for you to do this you do need to be
rooted and you need to flash a custom
kernel we'll get to that in just a
minute once you do that you can see I
can just sweep to unlock I did that
twice because I've kind of set my
sweeping threshold down a little bit the
way I'm doing that is through this foe 1
2 3 kernel and this is an app it costs
about $5 in the in the Play Store you
don't have to have this you can just
flash the ROM and get or flash the
kernel rather and get a lot of the same
features but by doing this you can come
over here all the way to the end and
download the latest version very very
quickly and easily then you just flash
it like you would anything else from
here you've got all of these controls
will just buzz through a few of these so
you can see kind of what they do and how
I've got it set up of course one of the
main reasons for installing a custom
kernel is to overclock under clock and
whatnot so I've gone ahead and turned
that on we'll bump that up and we'll
bump that up just for the purpose of
this video Eco mode I've turned on will
turn that off for the time being MP
decision we don't like that because it's
Qualcomm and it's proprietary so we'll
just turn that off and use Intel flog
active status instead go ahead and sweep
over here we can change the voltages I
usually leave these alone just because
that's something really deep and geeky
governor we can set this I like on
demand so we've got that set right there
set on boot SOC all of these different
things that you can do and stats that
you can get thermal information thermal
this Qualcomm Zinn tarantella thermal is
the kernel version and you can kind of
see what's going on here I haven't had
any thermal throttling or thermal over
temps yet which is a good thing
GPU you can set the graphics processor
stuff IO scheduler and then this is what
we're after this is called sweep to wake
or slide to wake
you want to call it they call it sweep
tweak probably because they don't want
to get in trouble with the the swipe
with a slide to wake version which may
or may not be patented or trademarked or
whatever so sound boot I've gotten that
turned on the sweep to wake function
I've also got that turned on you can set
how you want it to go if you want it
horizontally vertically or some other
custom direction I like horizontal your
start position mid position end position
threshold and then you apply parameters
one thing that you want to do is make
sure that you're ok with the possible
battery drain that this is going to give
to you just keep that in mind while
we're in here let's finish the tabs out
vibration you can set your vibration
thresholds and whatnot I like 74 75
percent same see what most custom roms
are doing these days with the nexus 4
screen you can set what screen you want
if you want to go back to LG stock you
can do that you turn the screen off turn
it back on and it applies that not quite
as vivid not quite as true to you know
the nice pretty colors that I enjoy so
we'll just turn it back off and back on
and there you can see that Z control for
your Z RAM and whatnot miscellaneous
settings and then of course download
that we already showed you an
information all about the app so how
does it work now very simply you have
your device in the off position you come
through here and if I can remember where
I set my my parameter to all you have to
do is swipe to unlock just like that it
is going to take you a little bit more
battery to do that because you've got to
monitor the the touch screen on your
screen even when the device is off and
as you can see sometimes you can set
your threshold a little bit too tightly
and have it have it not want to wake
exactly right but after you've played
with it for a little bit you know
exactly where to go to to wake it up and
it's really quite a nice feature
accomplishing this does take a custom
kernel that's either something that you
can buy in your brand new device like
the Moto X or something that you can
flash on compatible devices like I did
with my Nexus 4 but now here's the
question for you is swiping to unlock
really that much more sim
than just pushing the button to unlock
we want to know what you think so head
down to the comments below and let us
know your thoughts I for one think that
anything that you can do to make using
your device a little bit easier and well
a little bit cooler is well worth it
thank you for watching if you liked what
you saw here please give the video a
thumbs up and why not subscribe to our
channel if you haven't done so already
also while you're at it share the video
with your friends let them know what
pocket now is all about or pocket now
I'm Joe Levi we'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
