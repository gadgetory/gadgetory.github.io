today we're going to do a little device
showdown with the two new offerings from
t-mobile the mytouch 3G and the dash 3g
as you can see here I got some of the
older lineup thrown out here let the old
dash that off to the side it old wing
the old shadow and the newer lineup the
UM a shadow the g1 and what we're going
to take a closer look at today is the
dash 3g and the mytouch 3g
so let's start with the mytouch comes in
a nice case
zipper case and I've already turned this
one on and played with it I chose to get
the maroon model because I'm tired of
the black and white at the tmobile store
there are different shells that you can
get for the back comes off real easy
don't try to force it just press down on
it and it will come off a little bit of
pressure so don't try to pry it open or
anything like that so this case has some
foam in there for cleaning up drool and
whatnot there's some pockets built in
here so after getting rid of the foam
you can use this case for more
accessories open up this little tab
little velcro and there's a quick start
guide some tips a pamphlet on
customizing get creating your own shell
and then a screen protector which is
always handy on the left-hand side you
have a fancy wall charger it's USB
obviously some nicer earbuds the down
below the ear buds are actually 3.5
millimeter even though the bottom of did
my touch you need the adapter so the
adapter is actually in the case there's
a soft case for shinin nub keeping it
from scratching and here's the adapter
so you plug your headphones in there get
a little push the talk button plugs into
the bottom of my touch you're good to go
otherwise they're just headphones unless
we got in here some foam pads and rubber
rings and a clip for the headphones and
a USB cable and then underneath there
more straps for accessories and whatnot
so you can pretty much use this case as
a travel case for mytouch or any other t
mobile phones that you might have
alright so here's the mytouch let's do
little side by side comparison with the
g1 one thing that you'll notice with the
mytouch is actually a smaller device it
is thinner slightly thinner it's more
rounded versus the blocky appearance of
the g1 and it doesn't have a physical
keyboard so when you turn it on you use
the on-screen keyboard and either
profile or landscape mode and one thing
many g1's users will notice right off
the bat is the smoothness of the
trackball it's actually quite sexy
versus the g1's trackball it does have
more rom than the g1 and on whole I
think at g1 users will like the mytouch
it is it's a better it's a more rounded
phone will go into apps and whatnot
later but it it does run Android it
comes with Android 1.5 installed so you
don't really need to mess around with
updates but it will update automatically
just like the g one next up we got the
dash 3g
now this is actually a very nice
smartphone and the case comes with some
random goodies I already took out the
wall charger on this but the this car
charger is actually one of the best
better ones I've seen on the market
because of the coil it doesn't get
caught up in the car it's always ready
to go there's one of those proprietary
adapters charging cables that you can
plug 2.5 millimeter or 3.5 millimeter
into comes with a case with the strap as
well as a soft case
somewhere those headphones that we're
all used to and then in here is the user
manuals
so side-by-side comparison with
dash 3g there's the old dash set that
off to the side the wing and the old
shadow as well as the new shadow the
mytouch and the g1 so it makes their
current offering from t-mobile nice and
sleek one thing I like about the dash is
that it is Windows Mobile meaning that
there is windows mobile office on there
or actually yeah mobile office well you
won't be able to create documents from
the get-go you will be able to read and
edit documents so we do have fixed for
creating documents but it's basically
the same size and form factor as the old
dash it is slightly thinner it's not as
thick and it is just about the same size
same height it's a little bit taller now
what the dash here has the new dash 3g
has gps it does have 3g faster processor
528 megahertz processor as well as twice
the ram and twice the wrong it does have
a 2 megapixel camera on the back so you
can take video and nice pictures one
thing about the keyboard though that
took some getting used to is that it's a
44 key keyboard versus a 39 key keyboard
so the keys are a little they feel kind
of squished together I whereas on the
old dash it was easy to just press
buttons on this one sometimes I find
myself pressing the Alt key when I mean
to press 0 and when I mean to press for
impressing the asterisk key in our next
video we're going to go into depth on
the dash 3g zaps and what they bring to
the table and until next time I'm Mike
