gotta do I don't know how he does that I
can't roll my arse in any case on this
week's episode of the pocket now weekly
we talk about the Galaxy Note 9 and how
it somehow still has great balls of fire
and then we bring its competitor the
iPhone 10s and the 10s max to the table
as a couple of us not me mine still on
its way have the phone in hand and we
talked about the unboxing experience and
provide some hot takes on Apple's
brand-new product so join myself Brandon
and Jaime on the weekly on wherever you
get your podcasts for those of you
wondering if we are getting three Galaxy
S tens after all well they just got
certified while we just released the new
teaser for the May 20 pro that pretty
much confirms their new flashy camera
mode and LG's recent survey close to the
launch of the v40 hence some cool things
to come I'm high-mettled Iveta and this
Friday is no joke we've got so much work
with all these products here I'm gonna
need a couple of weeks off this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with events as a no cast just sent
out press invitations for something to
happen on October 4th and I don't know
man we've seen so many rumors of the
pintle ins phone and the possible
flagship to come we're not exactly sure
what we're getting here but regardless
of the case Nokia has been making a ton
of headlines I'm hoping that some of
this is real now let's move the
spotlight over to LG as the company was
nice enough to sponsor a post on the
pocketnow.com website that I highly
recommend you read and the reason why I
decided to include it in the daily is
because okay we're getting close to the
LGB 40 launch and all this survey
focused on photography they focus on the
fact that they've noticed that 1,000
people from Korea and the United States
were surveyed and things came up like
the fact that people prefer now to send
the photos instead of text messages 60
percent of people and then we've got 65
percent of people that care about
lossless zoom to be able to zoom into
their photos and for the quality to not
be lost in addition another same amount
of users also care about low-light
performance 65 percent as well and
probably the most important one was that
50% of users
actually want to take professional
photos with their smartphone so we're
just weeks away from the LGV 40 could
this be a hint that working something
really cool I hope it is now other
official news my god this is Friday
official one plus we're getting close to
the 60 and we know that but they just
released Android Pi the official update
for the one plus six now obviously it's
gonna take some time for the people that
currently have a unit to get the update
they are teasing probably a couple of
weeks but I mean we've got a full video
on Android Pi that you can also find in
the description it is really cool and I
hope I get the update now I won plus
please thank you now let's talk about
Huawei as we're getting close to the may
20 Pro we've seen teasers of that
possible camera design and we heard
yesterday that there was a new
underwater mode but the thing about it
is there's a teaser and this teaser is
not under regular water it's under
saltwater in waves and everything so is
there an underwater camera mode and can
this phone survive saltwater Michael
Fisher can tell you that the LGB 30
didn't survive under saltwater when we
were in Hawaii so that's gonna be
interesting and finally the hot news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 and whatever variants we get we're
hoping to see the phone early next year
or the phones because there are
certifications for three units all three
well two of these at least have the
three cameras and then apparently the
most important one of them has up to
five three at the back to the front this
is interesting I mean I love the fact
that we're getting more cameras I'd
rather that than be carrying lenses to
attach and detach from a phone but let
us know in the comments what do you
think do you think that this is what
Samsung needs to make the galaxy line
more important because in my case I
believe they do leave us a comment down
below we looked under your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on out
our kind of descriptive both our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter
Jaime underscore get our on Instagram at
how you matter be data please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm Jaime muttering that I think so
much for watching we'll see you next
