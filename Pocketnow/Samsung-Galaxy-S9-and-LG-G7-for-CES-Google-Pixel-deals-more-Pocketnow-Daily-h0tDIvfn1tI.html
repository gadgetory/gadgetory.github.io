spotlight for the next galaxies and
algae flagships Niantic seems ready at
least monetarily to bring us its next
hit game and software updates to Oreo
continue reaching certain 2017 flagships
I'm high metal Iveta and I'm running on
very little sleep because yesterday were
elections in my country it's really
rough but we're hoping for the best this
is PocketNow daily the official news
today begin with deals but I'm gonna try
not to bore you Cyber Monday is gonna
pretty much be over by the time you
watch this video hopefully some of these
stick though we've got the Google pixel
the first generation for 5 dollars a
month for two years we've got cases like
the essential phone that are greatly
discounted but again the website is full
of these you can learn more in the
description now deals that are not going
to end with cyber monday have to do with
the Google pixel to pixel to excel
there's a hundred dollars of store
credit depending on certain options and
there's even a case where the Google
home Mini will be on sale up until
December 31st for just 29 bucks I'm
actually pissed that I got my Google
home Mini for a full retail recently but
anyways you can learn about that in the
description as well now let's move the
spotlight over to software updates HTC
has proven that it can't keep promises
we saw the recent update to Oreo for the
HTC you will live it in Taiwan now if
you bought the unlock variant that Oreo
update should be available to you today
and obviously we're gonna wait and see
when the rest of om s are going to
follow ship which should be now oMG now
it's not about Niantic for those of you
that were fans of pokemons go and
ingress the company is working on its
new sequel and has just secured two
hundred million dollars and for those of
you that are asking yourself why it
turns out that because this is actually
a Harry Potter title apparently it's
going to be called Harry Potter wizards
unite and we can't wait to learn what
it's about apparently it will happen in
2018 and finally the very interesting
nuisance they have to do with the next
generation LGG which would be the g7 and
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 usually these
devices are announced at MWC and then
launched within the timeframe of April
but as it turns out we've got Evan blast
the most trusted source out there pretty
boy
telling us that there is a source of his
that tells him we should see these
devices at CES if not as a teaser as a
preview but apparently we might actually
get these devices early and it makes all
the sense in the world with the iPhone
10 just ticking all over the spotlight
but it leads me to the question today do
you think that it's a good idea to
launch these phones early or not in my
case no particularly with devices like
the B 30 and in the case of the Galaxy
Note 8 but that's my opinion leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
yours Lee a Harry Potter title came in
Canada Italy will not pay da friends
again if you want to get to those
earlier follow us on pocket not comment
subscribe to our channel by hitting this
button up here you're gonna watch last
week's out daily up here and our
first impressions of the iPhone 10 down
here you can also follow me on twitter i
underscore to get on instagram behind
every better please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
I'm editing that I think so much for
watching we'll see it's wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
