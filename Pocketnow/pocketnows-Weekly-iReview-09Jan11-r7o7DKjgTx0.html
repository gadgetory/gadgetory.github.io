possible verizon iphone event rumors of
a new iphone antenna design are out in
the blue and some more iphone 4 blood
seem to be servicing all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
high metal iveta and welcome to the
pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start off this week
with the cool Verizon's inviting
everybody to attend the federate Pete
Rose Hall in New York City's lincoln
center on Tuesday January 11 2011 at
11am yes a lot of 11 s there to talk
more about wireless stuff now our
biggest bet is that this has to be the
verizon iphone launch which has also
been confirmed at the Wall Street
Journal now our biggest fete is that
since this is not going to be an apple
event then this won't be really a change
or a significant change to the iphone
four given Apple really does all the
significant lunges and all the carrier
variants have not really seen Apple
pressence so we'll see what happens in
the envelope not really sure this will
just be a verizon iphone 4 or if it will
be called the verizon iphone and just
that or it could probably be the iphone
5 or the verizon iphone v having the V
stand for 5 in Roman numerals so we'll
see what happens in the end now a video
and some images have surfaced of a new
antenna design that will probably see in
the next generation iphone the changes
are not really significant just as we'd
expect that the next generation iphone
won't really change much from the
current one and we just see that the
black marks of the antenna have moved
from one side to the next we really
don't know if this new antenna design
will be better or if it will not bring
any antenna gate issues yet but then
again it seems that Apple is really
working on it so we'll see what happens
in the end we'll probably see these
changes coming up in June but we're not
sure we'll actually see these antenna
designs coming into the verizon iphone
so stay tuned now I've set it in the
past jailbreakers have all the fun now
this time they figured out how to get
the Android project to bring gingerbread
android 2.3 to work on the iphone 3g of
you have a jailbroken sadly this will
only work on the older model so if you
still keep it you could probably just
use it to port android
now in my case I would love to see i
phone 4 with gingerbread or honeycomb in
the future I would consider that to be
the perfect smartphone in my personal
opinion but again that will be my
personal opinion if you're still
interested in the iphone 3gs as a budget
device or probably just to give it to
one of your kids or something you'll be
happy to know that AT&amp;amp;T now has it at
$29 after the two-year contract if you
go buy it now call this the latest way
to compete to people not leaving a TNT
to go to verizon for the iphone yeah it
is but again it's a budget device and
it's still working on the new iOS
releases so go get it if you're still
interested okay one of the cool things
about ces probably the only one we
actually saw that had iphone mentioned
on it was having rough de la Vega say
that they'll be offering a you know LTE
iphone asif next year which would be
2012 now we're getting really close to
the not-so-cool section and i actually
intended to leave this last because why
do we have to wait so long i mean why
didn't we get the LTE version of the
iphone right here on june as we usually
expect so i guess we'll call this one
the iphone 4s and for speed probably
dual-core we never know and probably
just wait for the iphone 4g you know in
2012
that does it for the coolest continue on
with the not-so-cool the VLC media
players one of the favorite media
players out there because it'll have
different formats work on your iPhone
suddenly it got pulled from the app
store because it seems that their
general public license has some sort of
infringement with the App Store
something we actually knew a couple of
months back but you know if you
downloaded the application will still
work but if you're interested in getting
it you'll sadly not be able to we really
don't know what to expect not really
sure if it'll be out there in the future
given that it happened mostly close to
the same with google voice in the past
we could expect it to be back soon or
again you could just jailbreak your
device and get it you know easily and
while some iOS bugs have surfaced
apparently we have reports of people
complaining of you know the software
keyboard giving them issues when they're
typing and apparently they're getting
different letters to what they were
intending to type other people have been
complaining about the home button not
working sometimes other times it seems
that they double tap for multitasking or
when their phone is locked and they want
to pull up the music controls and it's
not working I've had that specific bug
happened to me and the way I solved that
was by resetting the device so our
advice is to reset your device for now
as soon as waiting for Apple to get it
solved with some software update not
really sure when that will be though and
while a woman made news recently because
she apparently got fired for being late
and her excuse for being late was that
her iOS ilan did not wake her up
remember that bug that's been happening
and well we read a lot of your comments
and we do understand that it's really
hard for people to get fired just
because they're late once and yeah we're
in high season of sales so a lot of
companies are skeptical about employees
being late and there's just pretty much
firing people that's another option but
then again it's really sad to see
somebody lose their job in this economy
and again you know first of all go to
radioshack and get a physical alarm
clock for now because steve-o we really
need for you to figure that one out man
that's it for this week's show thank you
very much for watching remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
