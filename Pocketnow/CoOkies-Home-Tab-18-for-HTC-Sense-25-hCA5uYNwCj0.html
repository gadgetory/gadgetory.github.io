pocket now calm by now anyone who is
using HTC sense 2.5 should know about
cookies Home tab mod it's been a huge
hit on XDA developers and if you haven't
heard about it you definitely need to go
back and watch our previous detailed
video on it it takes the sense interface
to a whole new level when you features
widgets and customizing options it
basically makes the whole experience
more enjoyable well cookies Home tab
just received a major update in version
1.8 so in this video we'll be walking
you through all the cool new features
let's get to it alright so I'll just
jump right into it starting with some
subtle new quick links as you can see we
now have some convenient switches here
so we can turn the phone radio on or off
we can toggle Bluetooth or Wi-Fi easily
we can quickly turn the weather
animation on or off push mail we can set
the phone a vibrate silent or flight
mode and then under those switches we
have some options for disconnecting data
locking the screen restarting sense and
restarting the device so some convenient
quick options that we can now set for
our quick links grid as you can see we
have this music player down here i'll
get to that feature in a minute so let's
go over here if we click winmo settings
it'll actually take us to the start menu
setting this menu which is nice because
by default if you go to start and then
go to settings it'll actually take you
to the sense 2.5 settings tab and then
you have to go to menu and then go to
all settings which is pretty
inconvenient if you want to drill into
some of those deeper settings so let's
go back at the top here I've set some
notification quicklinks so we can easily
jump to messages
email call history or we can dial
directly to our voicemail so some nice
new quick link types available to us so
in the last major update we received the
ability to customize this made home
screen well now we can actually do that
with all four levels which is pretty
amazing so now we can customize the top
level we can customize the home screen
the Quick Links screen and even the
bottom level which used to be blank so
let's go back to the top here and as you
can see i have a flip clock weather
combo widget and below that i have this
new widget it's actually the music
player which links to the sense to 2.5
music tab but one thing that's cool
about this is that you actually don't
need to have the music tab enable at all
in order to use it so that's pretty cool
and if we go to menu and edit home
layout let's go to the first level and
if we tap and hold on it we can change
the different layouts here so you have a
large one medium one or a small sized
one so pretty cool so let's go to the
next screen so one thing that's new here
is this little drop-down option for
appointments so I can go ahead and show
two appointments I can adjust it to show
three appointments or I can show them
all so this is cool because I like to
have my appointments only showing the
next appointment so if I wanted to see
what else I have going on in that day I
can quickly drag it down and take a
glance and then I can close it again so
really convenient let's go on to the
Quick Links as you can see you can add
other widgets on this screen now so it's
not just restricted to only quick links
which is nice I put the music player
down here the next screen I have
an analog clock notification bar those
are widgets we've seen before but here's
a new one this one is for tasks and you
can actually view tasks now not only
appointments so we have two different
widgets for those and then you can drag
it down and take a look at all your
tasks or collapse it as well with the
analog clock we have a new feature so
we'll go to edit home layout extra space
and as you can see there's this little
tab here and if we drag and pull it we
can actually enlarge a decrease the size
of the analog clock which is pretty cool
and if you wanted to you can drag and
move the clock around now maybe put some
other widgets next to it so that's
pretty cool let's go done and we'll go
back to the home screen okay another new
feature in this update is wallpaper
control so we can actually go to set
wallpaper and here we can change the
home tab wallpaper the lockscreen
wallpaper and even apply the wallpaper
to all tabs and for each category we
have portrait and landscape options so
under Home tab we can set the portrait
wallpaper or set a separate landscape
wallpaper and for portrait we can
actually apply a widescreen wallpaper so
if we use that option when we go to the
Quick Links screen and scroll left and
right it'll actually move the wallpaper
with it and then when you flip back
vertically you'll have that new sort of
view of the wallpaper so pretty cool and
then for the lock screen you can only
set the portrait for all tabs you can
set portrait and landscape so pretty
cool options here okay moving on let's
go to the lock screen and we've seen
this before we can customize the lock
screen by adding new widgets we can move
them around that sort of thing also we
could have the HD mini style vertical
slider or we can set it to have the
left to right slide to unlock mechanism
or we can even go with the standard
windows mobile 6.5 style lock screen so
I have the HD mini style and as you can
see there's this new notification bar
here so if we tap on a notification and
then slide it down it'll take us
directly to that tab so let's test that
out again this time we'll go with call
history or that was messages it took us
the messages and then we'll go again
we'll do that with call history so
another convenience feature there let's
go to menu and this time we'll check out
cookies Home tab editor so if you used a
cookies home tab mod before you know
that this is your main control center
where you can customize and set all the
different options so we'll just run
through the options quickly check out
some of the new ones look at the old
ones so here we can set the amount of
quick links on the Quick Links screen we
can increase or decrease the number of
pages for the quick links set the
default page we can show or hide empty
quick links hide icon frames the text
text background page indicator here we
can change the program selector between
list and columns view so we've seen
those before so let's go to lock screen
and we can enable the custom lock screen
lock on standby show the lock button
play the weather animation after locking
we can change the unlock style between
Manila windows and HD Mini and at the
bottom we have these new options for the
lock slider shortcuts that I showed
earlier we can hide all the slider
shortcuts show them all or set it to
auto so only when you have those
notifications let's go back applications
here we can change the different
functions for when tapping on these
different actions here so when you click
on a lime it usually opens the alarm
program but
if you wanted to change that to say G
alarm you can set it to that and it will
open GL on same with the calendar and
tasks maybe you want to use thumb cow or
a different program you can set it to
those two so let's go back and go to
appointments we can set the appointment
range we can hide or show the
appointments or set it to auto so only
when you have an appointment same with
call history and voicemail and now we
have options for the tasks range and
show completed tasks we can also sort
the tasks according to start date or due
date and finally let's go to
miscellaneous settings at the top is
where we can change the animation style
for when you swipe up and down on the
home screen so we can set that to none
if you have a very slow device and you
can set it to simple or you can set it
to optimize if you wanted to you can set
it to the original style animations but
i only recommend that if you have an hd2
this is a touch pro 2 by the way we can
retract the slider set the timeout for
that we can disable the clock flip
animation show this show or hide the
seconds hand for the analog clock turn
on the level editing mode and we can set
the swipe to circle so if you keep
swiping it'll just keep going up and
down on your home tabs and we can set
the lowest and highest levels for when
you swipe so if you only wanted to have
maybe two levels you can set it to that
or maybe if you only wanted the main
home screen you can just set it to one
and you won't be able to switch between
any of the other screens for the
wallpaper we can set it to regular which
we saw before or you can set it to HD
walls if you have that application we
can change the main text color and the
subtext color at the bottom we can
enable the sun rays and change the
operator text so those were these
settings
of cookies home tab that's it for now
but i'll post links for cookies home tab
