now here taking a look at the brand new
American assembled Moto X the first
official fruit of the union of motorola
and google let's take a look so one of
the most important things to understand
about this phone is that moto is aiming
for the mass market this is not a nexus
even though it runs a very close to
stock edition of Android it's not for
enthusiasts it's for the average
consumer and as such it will be
available on five US carriers most of
them by the end of the month we're told
at a suggested contract price of 199 on
a two-year contract it's not loaded with
crazy specs but it does have some
awesome standout features just talking
build here we're looking at a composite
material built around a 4.7 inch AMOLED
screen at 720p that does a really nice
job of popping here at the NYC launch
venue the phone ranges in thickness from
five point six millimeters at the edge
to ten point four millimeters at its
media center curved very nicely so it
sits in the palm very well moto says the
phone mass is 130 grams which is kind of
unbelievable it feels nothing like the
galaxy s4 which also masses under 30
grams so the company has done a really
nice job of making this thing feels
solid in the hand we don't imagine this
creaking or popping at all as we heard
before there are also going to be a bevy
of color and customization options to
choose from including customizable trim
and engraving and later in the year some
exotic wood materials see our special
wooden phone hands-on for that Motorola
also let us know that the inner volume
isn't wasted at all there's a specially
designed non-removable battery in there
that's rated at 2200 milliamp hours but
which motorola tells us will last 24
hours of use even with all the new fancy
features turned on those features
include touchless control a voice
interface that's always listening for a
keyword and which will take a look at in
a quieter environment also though
there's a 10 megapixel shooter on board
that motorola is calling a clear pixel
camera because it uses an extra set of
clear pixels to gather more light about
75% more than competing cameras from
according to moto while also shortening
exposure time instills in video it's
capable of 1080p of course along with
motion high-speed recording the front
camera is 2 megapixels the whole thing
is powered by an interface that's quite
Spartan it reminds us a bit of Windows
Phone and there's a physical shortcut to
open it that we imagine we'll get more
convenient with practice Motorola has
also implemented an increasingly popular
glance feature into its software here
displaying a special minimised
notification screen when the phone is
flipped over that allows you to either
handle or dismiss the notifications that
have come in since the phone was last
active all that is powered by the
company's new x8 mobile computing system
which is a combination of an optimized
dual-core Snapdragon s4 pro at 1.7
gigahertz the Adreno 320 GPU and two
additional cores one each for language
processing and contextual computing it's
these cores that drive the most visible
of the phone's new features all of which
are once again heavily targeted at the
mass consumer in terms of memory there's
two gigs of ram and 16 or 32 gigs of
storage depending on carrier variants
but you also get 50 gigs of free storage
on Drive when you buy one folks we've
just unboxed our own review unit to
explore check out that video and we'll
be digging deeply into it over the days
to come so keep it locked to pocket now
for more on the new Moto X from google
