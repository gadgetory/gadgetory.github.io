small tablet on Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab pro 8.4 versus the iPad Mini with
Retina display Samsung has been gunning
for Apple in the tablet space since the
launch of the very first iPad the
miniature tablet space however is one
area Samsung actually has more
experience than Apple and Samsung is
finally beginning to close the gap the
question is has it finally done so let's
take a few minutes to find out the
hardware situation is par for the course
when comparing any mobile devices from
Samsung and Apple the iPad Mini with
Retina display as we learned back in
November is a fantastically built
miniature tablet it's crafted of solid
aluminum with machine drilled holes for
the speakers at the bottom and a
polished beveled trim around the front
edge it's a lesson in precision simple
elegant design and build quality that's
obvious from the very first time you
pick it up the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 is a
market improvement over prior Galaxy
Tabs as with many of its recent products
samsung is finally and thankfully moved
away from the hyper glazed finish and
the entire tab pro lineup features the
same faux leather backing found on the
Galaxy Note 3 and Note 10.1 2014 edition
it also has a faux brushed metal trim
along the edges and it still utilizes
the unique capacitive navigation buttons
which flanked a physical home button
size and shape are quite different as
well
the iPad Mini measures 200 millimeters
tall 134 point 7 millimeters wide and
7.5 millimeters thick the Tab pro 8.4 is
19 millimeters taller yet six point two
millimeters narrower and 0.3 millimeters
thinner both Wi-Fi models are exactly
the same weight 331 grams for one-handed
use we found the Tab pro 8.4 easier to
hold and it feels more natural to use in
either landscape or portrait than its 10
inch Android counterparts despite the
physical navigation buttons and specs
are per usual nothing alike the iPad
Mini has only one gigabyte of RAM 16 to
128 gigabytes of thick storage a 5
megapixel rear camera and a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core cyclone CPU which
makes up part of the Apple a7 SOC the
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 has twice
the RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of fixed
storage with a micro SD card slot an 8
megapixel rear camera in a 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core Krait 400 CPU with adreno 330
GPU to make up the Snapdragon 800 SOC
the iPad Mini ships with a fixed twenty
three point eight watt hour battery
compared to the approximate nineteen
point two watt hour battery inside the
Tab pro 8.4 we'll get to what all that
amounts to in the test notes later for
now let's focus on the best part of both
of these tablets the displays the iPad
minis Retina display is a 7.9 inch IPS
LCD panel with a pixel resolution of
2048 by 1536 that's a pixel density of
324 pixels per inch it's incredibly
sharp and gorgeous
however we noted in our review that the
color seems slightly muted compared to
the iPad Air's display but it's still
quite beautiful and balanced the display
on the Tab pro 8.4 is also quite the
spectacle the Super Clear LCD panel
measures 8.4 diagonal inches and bears a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels a
total density of 359 PPI
both panels are gorgeous with relatively
deep blacks great contrast color
reproduction and sharpness the iPads
display seems noticeably warmer but
Samsung appears to be boosting the
saturation of colors to make the display
appear more vibrant both displays are
absolutely gorgeous in their own right
holding both tablets side-by-side
reveals a great disparity in the quality
of materials but both are built
exceptionally well the iPad simply feels
and looks more premium more worth the
$400 base price tag but we're well aware
price isn't based solely on look and
feel or even what's on the inside let's
dig deeper take a look at the software
the iPad Mini software is something
we're all familiar with by now outside
appearance it hasn't changed all that
much it's running the latest version of
iOS version 7.1 as of today and features
exactly what you would expect a wall of
icons on the home screen the new and
very useful control center a
questionable Notification Center and an
app switcher accessed by double tapping
the home button Samsung's Galaxy Tab pro
lineup brings a newer look to touch wiz
with KitKat and it's something we're not
entirely sold on yet for what it's worth
Samsung has seemingly gone to great
lengths to improve the look of itself
through something many users have been
begging for but it feels as if it's not
entirely
as if people with opposing ideas
designed it the new magazine UX found on
the home screen is very nice and we like
it a lot
the tile-based interface packs a ton of
useful information on your home screens
but as soon as you jump into the
Settings app it's the same old tabbed
interface mixed with a pane view makes
finding even the most simple settings
much more difficult than it should be
it's not all bad when it comes to
Samsung's software though it is
seemingly trimmed down it's smart
offerings to smart stay smart rotation
and smart pause and this one comes with
multi-user support if nothing else
Samsung's devices are renowned for great
simulcasting thanks to the multi window
feature in this version of TouchWiz it's
been even further improved no longer do
you long press the back button to access
the panel simply drag from the right
edge of the display we found this made
it easier to activate
but in use it's almost exactly the same
as before and that's a good thing
multitasking on the iPad isn't horrible
though there's no way to make use of the
larger display both side by side apps
but you can use the very helpful
gestures to speed up the task switching
a four-finger swipe up reveals the app
switcher it's why being left or right
with four fingers will chronologically
switch between the most recent apps and
a five finger pinch will take you back
home the iPad still has a broader
application and game offering
specifically for tablets and that more
than makes up for the lack of true
multitasking but the software ultimately
comes down to preference we find Android
to be more utility productivity based
while iOS is better for social
communication and entertainment but at
the very core they're both capable of
doing the exact same things saying one
of these tablets performs better than
the other is about like performing
surgery with a pocketknife
there is no blanket answer one is not
markedly better than the other in any
one area and benchmarks the to perform
similarly despite the two additional
cores a much faster clock speed in the
tab pro and both handle gaming like
champs web browsing opening apps and
even task switching was comparable
between the two tablets they both
perform exceptionally well though we
have noticed the occasional slow down on
the tab pro I'm flipping through home
screens or over encumbering with a multi
window feature something we hoped we
wouldn't see with the Snapdragon 800
we haven't had the Tab pro 8.4 quite
long enough to fully test its battery
capabilities but it's nineteen point two
what our battery seems to hold up well
so far
the iPad Mini through months of use has
typically only needed to be charged
every two or more days depending on use
for a more in-depth look at the tab pros
battery stay tuned for the full review
the speaker quality on either tablet
won't blow you away they're both pretty
loud and also pretty tinny
though the if' head seems to provide a
fuller sound both have two speaker
grilles on the bottom edge which is
particularly poor placement if you like
to hold your tablet in landscape while
playing games or viewing media your palm
is quite easily muffle the speaker's
forcing you to either plug in headphones
hold the tablet in an uncomfortable way
or deal with muffled audio
if you're one for taking pictures with a
tablet you'll likely be satisfied with
either option that both have pretty
decent Imogen Singh chops though the
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 S image sensor is a
higher resolution which typically
results in sharper images it seems
Samsung is also boosting saturation here
and once again the iPad tends to err on
the warmer side
honestly we give the Tab pro 8.4 a
slight edge thank to slightly better
pictures but as little as most will use
a tablet to seriously take pictures it's
negligible in all both are extremely
solid tablets and we couldn't think of a
closer comparison the iPad Mini tends to
perform more consistently while the Tab
pro 8.4 hangs and stutters occasionally
on the home screen the tablet app
offering is still stronger on iOS then
on Android though the situation is
constantly improving on both platforms
and most of the same apps are available
on both OS s on design alone the iPad
Mini takes the cake but looks are often
deceiving and such as the case here the
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 is starting at 399
offers more bang for your buck we
actually prefer the size and shape of
the Tab pro 8.4 and the ability to run
two applications side-by-side is a
feature sorely missing from iOS frankly
though you can't go wrong with either
