news to come from Apple look at the
first leagues on a date 10 possible
price tag for the Moto 360 and Sony
seems to be out to build itself a
smaller tablet I'm high netting that I
am regardless of what you think I am
planning to make today work but I'm not
sure how long that will last this is
pocket now daily I am sorry to tell you
that there are no official news today or
at least not good ones let's talk about
LG and the G watch to know the G watch
to not the G watch it seems that the
company is already working on its new G
watch it seems that it's very close to a
launch and it seems that we will have
some hardware upgrades starting from the
display the processor and certain things
and it's just interesting given the fact
that the G watch was a sobbing pen but
it's probably the lesser and cheapest
looking Android wear product out there
and probably LG wants a little more
limelight and even though this league is
a little old it's very important to talk
about it because we got the first link
renders of the HTC One m8 for Windows
and the regardless of what you thought
this is pretty much an HTC One m8 that's
built for Windows it's the same phone in
every single way at least in the press
renders we're not sure about
specifications but everything looks like
it's just the Harman Kardon hcc want to
make encoding and then windows phone
which is actually a great thing let's
see if we do get some dual booting here
now a company that's expected to make a
big splash at eva is sony we are
expecting a lot of proximity announced
then we are expecting a sony xperia
tablet but interesting it seems that
this will be a sony xperia tablet z 3
compact and i just lost my breath but
yeah it seems that the company won't
build that xperia tablet z 3 and an
experience have led z3 compact we're not
sure i'm on the size you only have a
name but it's great to see that sony is
changing and smart about size even
though it does matter now I've got two
iphone 6 rumors that are good and bad
number one it seems that reversible USB
is going to happen we have some leaked
photos from sony dixon which is very
famous for his league so great versatile
USB is something that we want all
companies to build so great to see that
hopefully it will come with the iphone 6
but in addition to that we also get
information that apparently apple will
stick to one
gigabyte of ram for the iphone 6 1
gigabyte of ram we've had that for the
longest time on the iphone we don't even
know why there is a 64-bit processor
with just one gig of ram let's see what
Apple brings to the table I mean I don't
know how they plan to make games better
like that and finally for the very hot
news of the day it seems that best buy
has just leaked everything we want to
know about the Moto 360 starting from
the fact that it will apparently be
launching in mid-september after the
event that's happening in Chicago and
second it seems that it will just cost
you two hundred and fifty dollars that
price tag is crazy it's the same for
every other Android wear product and
this one clearly looks a lot better but
that leads you to the question of the
day moto 360 250 dollars and in
mid-september are you getting one
because if you're not then that's great
because that means I get more chances to
buy mine but leave us a comment down
