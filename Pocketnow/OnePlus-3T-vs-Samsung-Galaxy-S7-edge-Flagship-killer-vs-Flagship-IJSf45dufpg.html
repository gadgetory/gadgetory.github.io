the best of the best a showcase for the
most cutting-edge technology that a
company has to offer for three
consecutive years 1 plus s define what a
flagship should be but the question as
if it's really good enough to stand
against the best I'm highlighting it out
with PocketNow and let's find out this
is one plus 3 T vs samsung galaxy s7
edge let's be clear about some specifics
the 1 + 3 T is not a premium mid-range
err this is really what makes it special
we have a premium package of hardware
and software being sandwiched into a
beautiful phone that costs a lot less
than your standard flagship by standard
flagship we're talking about the Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge this is currently
regarded as one of the best smartphones
that money can buy in 2016 but we all
know that that's actually a lot of money
visually both devices are night and day
different the one plus 3t favors an
aluminium bill that's flanked by
champers antenna lines and 2.5 B Gorilla
Glass 4 by contrast the galaxy s7 edge
is curved Gorilla Glass 4 on the front
and back and 7000 series aluminium on
the Border's the 3t is 2 millimeters
taller another 2 millimeters wider and 1
gram heavier than the galaxy you could
argue that it's less than a millimeter
thinner but that's until the Insane
camera humph blows everything out of
proportion
something the Galaxy has already solved
still even with the differences in the
hand it's really hard to declare a
winner given the premium feel of both
devices if anything you could say that
the 3t seems like a phone that could
take a tougher beating that's until you
consider the fact that only the galaxy
is ip68 water and dust resistant the
challenge even gets more polarizing when
you compare internals the 3t has the
newer processor and 2 gigabytes of extra
RAM about the only thing the s7 edge
wins is that it sports a slightly larger
battery but then it doesn't support the
faster charging technologies that Bosch
provide to the 3t
and it doesn't have the dual-sim support
provided by the 3t yes there is
expandable storage on the galaxy but the
3t can go for four times the base
storage at far less money than the
galaxy with a microSD card included but
the only spot where the galaxy wins this
one by a longshot is with display
Samsung's quad HD Super AMOLED panel
beats the 1 + 3 T in brightness pixel
saturation and the beauty provided by
the curves on each side no you don't
need such a dense display and in no way
am I saying that the optic AMOLED panel
on the 1 + 3 T is a slouch at 1080p the
superiority of the galaxy display is
evident the moment you compare them
side-by-side
that being said even with the display
contest won by Samsung what's being
shown on the display is another area
where I feel oneplus does a better job
oxygen OS has quickly become my favorite
Android user interface thanks to its
flexibility this is a dream for Android
purists root fans and even the average
user that just wants more granular
control it's still running marshmallow
but things like quick multitasking and
the navigation shade are already
inspired by nougat basics like swapping
the hardware keys or going for soft keys
are also here and I love that one +
doesn't reinvent the wheel with little
things like the alphabetical order of
the app tray what Samsung will be
experienced as a mixed bag yes if you
don't like the user interface you can't
skin it to your heart's content and even
without nougat you already have the
multi window support out of the box I
also like the shortcuts provided by the
edge display along with how customizable
it is the main problem with Samsung is
how slow it is for software updates
where essentials like the blue light
filter are only available to the 3t even
if in an ugly way if anything they
always on display is fancier on the
galaxy but it isn't as useful as what
you get on the 3t with full notification
support and really that's far better
than just getting beautiful numbers on a
display
and day to day use I also have to give
this battle to the 1 plus 3t yes you
have to very powerful phones here
but given the customizability of oxygen
OS in addition to the lighter-skinned on
top of android I still haven't found a
second of lag on 3 T where by contrast
in the Galaxy s7 edge you do find the
occasional stutter here and there you
really won't notice differences when
playing graphics intensive games though
but even in what pertains to battery
consumption and the speed of recharging
the 1 + 3 T is slightly superior oneplus
also wins the battle in the audio
department by a long shot mainly due to
its performance through the headphone
jack
I would suggest watching Kwan's real
audio review link in the description
below for details on the reasons why now
when you shift the battle to the cameras
you're landing into galaxy territory
Samsung is proven to beat the king of
the majority all year round and this
comparison is no exception yes the 1 + 3
T has more megapixels on the camera
sensor and similar lens technology and
if you stacked photos side by side
during the day you could say that it's
really hard to tell a difference on
which phone is taking the photo it's not
until you can pair these cameras in
low-light that you really notice
differences where the s7 edge is able to
pull more light thanks to the larger
microns on the sensor in addition to
also being far superior in achieving
focus even in video recording the galaxy
proves that it can take stabilization to
a higher standard than the 1 + 3 T and
then if you took the debate to the
selfie shooters sure oneplus offers far
more megapixels but the galaxy has a
wider field of view and larger microns
on the sensor that helped it do a better
job in low-light and that also provide
better stabilization overall declaring
the winner is a very difficult call
between both of these devices for 250
plus extra dollars the only points in
favor of the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge or
the ip68 water and dust resistance the
better display and also the stellar
camera performance the thing is $250 is
250
dollars that's enough money for you to
buy one of the latest smart watches on
sale or to just keep the money in hand
for a rainy day
still I know many people that value a
great camera experience or that want the
peace of mind of the water resistance on
their phones and really that's where the
Galaxy s7 edge shines for absolutely
everybody else I think that the theme of
this video is quite clear oneplus has
truly hit a homerun with the 1 + 3 T it
is literally everything that you need
from the best flagship smartphone in the
market though with the added value that
you're really not paying so much money
for the essentials that truly matter
