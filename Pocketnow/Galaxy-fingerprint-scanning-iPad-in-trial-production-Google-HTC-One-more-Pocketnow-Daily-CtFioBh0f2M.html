for their devices the next generation
iPad is reportedly already in trial
production and rumors of a stock android
HTC One continue I'm hi meri behna and
the reason why i love tuesdays is
because beer is fifty percent off almost
everywhere or i live and this is
out daily and let's start today off with
some product launches remember that Sony
Xperia tablet Z you know that beautiful
Sony Tablet that was announced back at
mwc four months ago beautifully designed
waterproof everything you want an
android tablet probably one of the only
ones we'd recommend this here well it's
finally being sold five hundred dollars
for the 16 gig model 600 olives for the
32 gig model but you wonder why they
take so long to launch these things
speaking of tablets let's move over to
the iPad the 9.7 inch version of the
ipad is apparently already in trial
production according to some asian
sources and well trial productions means
that mass production begins until July
meaning they'll be ready what supplies
by something like September so don't
expect it to launch at mwc 2013 on jun
10th probably in the fall well we could
be surprised so stay tuned and see what
we get now let's move the spotlight over
to hcc and google a lot of people were
very disappointed in heartbroken when
there was no google edition of the HTC
One announced at Google i/o but some
very reliable internal sources have been
mentioning that apparently this device
does exist apparently it will be
available soon and the question is when
our biggest bet is that they're waiting
for that galaxy s4 Google edition to
launch and see how it performs before
they take the plunge with another phone
so stay tuned for the rumors i call that
june july and moving over to windows
phone no case just updated their here
Maps application for all windows phones
to support their live site feature for
those of you remember our mwc coverage
that's pretty much city lens but baked
into here maps meaning well your maps is
available for pretty much every phone
that supports the application so if you
update the application that beautiful
city lens feature that Nokia customers
are enjoying is now you're so hurry up
an update it's kind of cool really i
mean you point your device at a place
they'll tell you what that place
is kind of genius in my book and finally
for the interesting news of the day
reports from a leaked rom of a galaxy s3
notice s3 not s4 say that Samson's been
working on fingerprint scanning for
their future home buttons coming to
galaxy devices but notice that's an s3
rom and then come on the s4 probably the
note 3 in the future but it does seem
that Samsung's been working on this
technology to be able to unlock your
phone and we've seen this happen before
in old pocket pcs laptops and we've even
seen the apple patents stating that
Apple will bring that to the home button
eventually but the question is why
didn't it make it to the galaxy s4 but
anyways that lasers is a question of the
day would you like fingerprint scanning
on your smartphone and would you be
willing to pay extra for it in my
particular case honestly I don't know
what's taking them so long I mean I hate
the whole unlock screen and then enter
your password for security it's kind of
dumb I mean fingerprint scanning
technology of it has existed for the
longest time I'd be willing to pay more
for the feature to be included in my
next smartphone but leave us a comment
down below what's your case and how much
would you be willing to pay I'd pay 50
bucks extra of course as always for
another scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone inseparable
