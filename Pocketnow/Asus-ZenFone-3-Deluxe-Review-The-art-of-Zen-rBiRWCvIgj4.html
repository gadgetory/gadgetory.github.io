available in the United States for a
couple months now but we just got our
hands on one so it's new to us we're
looking at the 5.7 inch version of the
phone and few specs Junkies you can
pause now to see what this device is
packing with that out of the way
ultimately what we're looking at is
another entry in the 2016 list of killer
deals this spec sheet and build
competing well against other phones
priced under $600 in the hand we'd be
lying if we didn't feel this design was
a bit generic the main claim to fame
invisible antenna lines not painted over
like an LG simply non-existent tiny
chamfered edges and a graceful curve to
the rear it's an attractive handset but
in a market saturated by metal phones
the zenfone really isn't a standout
these shiny forehead and chin bezels are
flashy but it's a bit maddening how well
they show off smudges and the navigation
controls feel very low against this
bottom edge reaching down to the home
button feels unbalanced like we could
easily slide or drop this phone 1080p
resolution on a 5.7 inch AMOLED display
is about par for the course here it's a
perfectly reasonable screen resolution
and users shouldn't have any issues
getting through their daily tasks we are
impressed by this screen brightness
though in auto mode the zenfone cranks
brighter than any other phone we've
recently reviewed very well done for
daylight viewing one of the few unique
design elements asu's opted for a
thinner strip of fingerprint sensor
performance is snappy enough but users
will need to get a feel for finger
alignment we've missed scanned more
often than on recent circular sensors
we've reviewed moving to the software
the custom skin known as Zen UI is in
full force
coloring nearly every aspect of the UI
in a candy colored shell and oddly I
don't hate it
for those who don't mind something a bit
different all of the general Android
pieces are where you would expect and
the phone manages to deliver a playful
spin on the modern smartphone UI though
it will likely frustrate many in our
audience first Asus could do with some
polish on organizing menus and settings
there's a lot of hunting for options
take audio very basic options and
settings but if
you want to dig into finer controls in
the EQ you have to head out for a
separate app there's also a lot of
nagging notification shade nagging app
installation nagging mobile data nagging
add to that a pension for performance
tweaks and RAM management which in this
day and age feels out of place
Android really shouldn't need this kind
of hand-holding especially not with six
gigabytes of RAM this chipset is well
known territory and the phone utilizes
it well driving the 1080p screen
resolution navigating the UI and
multitasking is as smooth as we would
expect it to be a soos includes some
custom gaming software to help users
screen capture you can also fire up the
selfie camera at a live broadcast while
playing there's a shortcut to the speed
boost here which just seems to dump
whatever's in your RAM maybe this helps
better allocate resources to your game
it doesn't seem to make much difference
in our real-world use regardless expect
solid gaming playback with only the
expected stutters in a title like marvel
future fight Wi-Fi reception was better
than average falling just behind other
metal backed phones like the V 20
likewise cellular reception felt just
slightly behind the mate 9 in my home on
18 t LTE but asus is making excellent
use of 18 t download speeds posting one
of the faster speed tests I've seen in
my neck of the woods the audio game is a
bit of a mixed bag manufacturers have
largely tapped out what we can do with
mono bottom firing speakers and the
zenfone is about as good as we should
expect in that regard an outdoor mode
allows you to push louder at the expense
of quality should you need more presents
for ringtones and alerts we likely
wouldn't sit and listen to music in a
room with this mode activated talking
about headphone playback requires a
little bit of weeding Asus claims
support for high res audio when playing
back 24-bit files the audio app will
show you this high res symbol and the
phone will play 24 and 32 bit tracks yet
looking back at our benchmarking reports
output seems to be truncated to 16-bit
audio we couldn't find a way in the
various issues apps and settings to
truly represent the full range of 24-bit
sound quality is near the bottom of our
list as well these numbers are hovering
around the LG g5 in the huawei mate 9
this is good playback but the zenfone is
far from
file grade and the UMP on board is
somewhat anemic this wouldn't be a great
fit to drive nicer headphones and a
wrap-up audio Asus does include a
respectable pair of earbuds offset
drivers help the fit though we are a bit
concerned by the cable shielding which
feels a bit flimsy these buds are a bit
lean on the base side but did a
fantastic job representing mids and
highs the only issue with this the phone
already boosts mid-range audio when
listening you end up with a double dose
of mid frequency sound which depending
on what you listen to might sound great
or could sound terrible happily this is
a surprisingly solid camera again a su
software organization could do with some
sprucing but the zenfone delivers a well
stocked list of option settings and
manual controls photos come out a touch
on the juicy side for saturation and the
only frustration reran into was somewhat
twitchy exposure when we focused in the
same spot here and managed to land
totally different brightness values
video is similarly exposed we get a nice
crisp colorful UHD output optical image
stabilization is on tap though movement
is a bit on the shaky side most
noticeable when trying to hold still at
macro distances when walking it seems
like the camera is over correcting for
movement on some footfalls leading to
some of this twitch or jank and the
shooter comes well stocked for fun
features a depth of field blur setting
allowing users to dial in blur after the
shot is taken a capable HDR mode which
works well at reining in highlights
though it can blow out warmer colors
thanks to that extra saturation applied
and a low light mode which reduces
output resolution to better control
noise though it doesn't seem to work
much better than the phone's normal auto
processing and a pretty complete manual
mode will be a welcome addition for
folks who like to dial in specific
settings and capturing their photos in
all we get software which makes good use
of some solid hardware though like many
aspects of this phone we do wish menus
were a bit better organized users face
quite a bit of memorization on first use
remembering where every mode and option
lives
lastly running our battery bench 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux the phone drained 6% which is
absolutely in the right ballpark for
this battery capacity and daily use
numbers matched where the
phone easily made it to dinnertime with
a little room to spare under moderate
use the recharge game is also solid
thirty minutes on the supply charger
resulted in a 40 percent recharge well
done there so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us with the zenfone 3
deluxe we know we have a soos fans in
our audience and we can see why this is
a respectable offering continuing the
conversation of packing flagship specs
into mid-range pricing if 2016 is
remembered for anything positive it'll
be the year we really upset smartphone
pricing and this phone represents an
idea extremely well because of all this
competition however the 400 to 500
dollar price tier has become precious
territory the zenfone is battling
against some extremely tough options and
it's difficult to find any specific
areas where it truly rises above put me
on the spot and ask me what this phone's
killer app is and I'll struggle to give
you a concise answer everything is just
good - very good and that's about where
we should leave this review off I
