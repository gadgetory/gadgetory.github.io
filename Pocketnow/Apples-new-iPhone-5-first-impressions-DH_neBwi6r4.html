live this is super exciting this is
iphone day I have a calendar and I cross
off every day until I phone day and
today there were no more crosses left to
be to be made we are here to talk about
iphone 5s and 5c and maybe some other
surprises that will be happening right
now a cuckoo cuckoo Cupertino right look
at you Taylor right yeah all right uh
we're here with Taylor hi May and
Michael say what up what up hey guys
don't sound so enthused Michael I'm I'm
yeah it's been it's been a hell of a
morning back for me if I we have stuff
going on at Apple I don't even know if
there's a live stream my internet
connection sucks everything sucks today
there's no live stream which is weird
because sometimes they haven't sometimes
they don't I want to start off with with
with a little bit of a prediction and I
want to I want to every one to two to
give us your prediction because this is
a really big deal for Apple and it's a
big deal for the industry every time
Apple releases a product kind of
reverberates throughout the industry and
the next 11 or 12 months for some
companies it's a little bit about catch
up last year we saw the iphone 5 with
aluminum this year we saw a lot of
aluminum products come out a lot of
metal phones the 5s is an interesting
case the 5c is clearly going to be for
the lower end market finally appealing
to people that want something colorful
something better than the black or the
white the 5s is an interesting case
because it's going to have the same
design plus maybe a better camera faster
processor and this fingerprint scanner
and I think that's I think that's where
the magic is going to be check this out
guys do you guys remember the motorola
atrix it had a fingerprint scanner yeah
yeah the first one right yeah right but
it worked terribly you had to scan your
finger it didn't read it properly there
was a lag it had to think the processor
just it didn't work right yeah I suppose
I didn't have the first day tricks I was
not the business then no not in the
business no news it was terrible it was
tell him it was nice it was a little too
high like if it were where the the g2's
volume rocker is it would've been a lot
better yeah yeah the place
terrible what I think Apple has done is
an industry-first I think it's going to
be revolutionary I think they've got a
fingerprint technology so good it's
built in the home button you rest your
finger on the home button and within a
second or even an incalculable amount of
time you're at your home screen it's
extraordinarily fast and it bypasses the
lock screen and doesn't necessitate that
you have a password anymore it's just
seamless you leave any Intel on that I'm
sorry Brandon interrupted you even Intel
the support that has apple acquired any
fingerprint like metrics companies I
don't I don't look back through patents
Wall Street Journal confirm that there's
going to be a fingerprint reader the
part leaked the partly it's going to
have a silver ring around it and another
thing that Apple could do with this
fingerprint reader besides immediate
access to your lock screen to only you
or authorized users your wife your kids
if you want is have it attached to an
API developers can use to link passwords
to the fingerprint so for example if
you're logging in the facebook or other
other apps that require you to log in
multiple times when you type in your
password I'll say do you want to link
this to your fingerprint and you say yes
so the next time you're logging into
facebook you just tap your finger and
with within a quarter of a second you're
in yeah yeah that'd be nice um that's
actually go ahead go I was just going to
say that that Motorola's take on this is
kind of interesting because they have
this old trusted device thing where if
you connect a device that that you use
regularly to your phone you can set it
as a trusted device to wear like my
pebble is a trusted device on my Moto X
so when I open or unlock my Moto X and
connect my pebble it will stay unlocked
until I tell it to lock again so it's
interesting and I only bring that up
because there was I can't remember the
name of it but kind of not a SmartWatch
but like a just a little band you wear
around your wrist that works as a
password for everything for your
computer for facebook I can't remember
how it works oh yeah it was yeah it's
really cool and it's interesting because
that's what a SmartWatch can do that's
what how I guess smartwatches can become
a little more useful is they are our
identity so there's that but the only
thing with with a fingerprint scanner is
that you've got an advantage because you
can't really lose your finger exact you
can unless somebody cuts it off don't
mess with the Mafia Oh what I what I
want to do is kind of go around and talk
about what we our relationship is with
Apple products we've all used apple
products we all own Apple products some
of them some of us use use them
regularly some of us don't let's start
with Michael what is your relationship
and sort of what are you excited about
today I'm glad I'm glad we're starting
with me i have a question is is jaime
the one keeping an eye on the on the
news yeah on the feed taylor an hour
yeah EDI info i am all right yeah you
and Taylor are okay good well Taylor
knows now cuz I yeah right this is just
been crazy so as far as Apple products
go a power my desktop experience I've
got to have macbook air that I run all
of my pocket our business on including
video editing which is wild the fan is
going like crazy right now it's what i'm
using the broadcast now I've got a
second macbook air that I just acquired
that I use to run my other YouTube and
business and I've got an ipad for our
three which is pocket mouse which i
don't use very often at all anymore
because it's so big and heavy but what
you wanna do you wanna do a shout outs
here your other YouTube endeavor yeah
yes yes rapid nadie on look it up or you
know rapid nation as everyone insists on
Miss misspelling know so it's cool stuff
it's fun but uh the iphone i have not
carried since 2008 and this will be the
first time in history assuming our plan
is still intact for me to go buy an
iphone and that's going to be the 5s and
i'm really looking forward to doing that
because i haven't carried an iphone
since george w bush was in office so
you're looking forward to going back to
that experience see what has changed in
the last so five years I'd like thing
yeah airman hi MA a pretty much a
permanent iphone user right oh man yeah
I guess a couple of years ago that was
like the only phone that I could get
that was like compelling on a planet my
country and I guess that's the reason
why i behaving the apple guy and so i
have an imac i have a Retina Display
MacBook Pro i have two apple tvs i had
I've had every iPad ever since launch I
have a mini right now which I
thoroughly repent phul to have gotten
haha iphone iphone 5 uh I I don't know I
guess I have a time capsule I pretty
much all my echo system in the house I
have a mac mini upstairs that holds all
of my movie studio um and everything is
pretty much just set around Apple
products I guess I delve into the echo
system I bit into it and I liked it um
simply because it works i guess for me
it's like though there are a lot of
things that are really no brainers that
that work within the apple ecosystem and
you know i guess you have going back to
that fingerprint scanner thing that you
were talking about um i think that for
me passwords have always been this thing
where you have to be hiding if you
really don't want people to see your
fast where you have to be hiding your
screens other people don't see your
password yeah it's just that dumb thing
where if nothing isn't is nothing is um
how do you say when nothing has felt is
foolproof yeah nothing has the
bulletproof x7 it your except your
fingerprint go ahead yeah I just wanna
I'm going to be interrupting as we go
around the table here um they're talking
iOS 7 now presumably go they're gonna
announce a date and I think they're
going to announce i'm ninety-nine
percent sure i put this on twitter that
the gold master is released today yeah
did judge just going to happen um
something i've been running iOS 7 i'm
i've been using HTC One but I'm running
Iowa seven something I haven't seen yet
is and Jaime are you running iOS 7 yeah
of course have you seen any updates to
apps for the new flat UI up none you
won't and you won't until until it
actually gets launched so the api's
don't go active for the public until
until it goes live so what you're gonna
see is iOS 7 is gonna launch and right
there you better prepare cuz like 40-50
apps or whatever you have installed are
gonna have updates already just ready to
go to go alive right because they about
all this time to cook them up and sit
again yeah it always happens that way
you get the you get the final software
update and then boom everybody upstate
updates their apps right there on
Saturday there's a lot of upset
developers about it too because you have
to completely rewrite the the UI because
it's totally different there's enough
the same and I want if you want a custom
experience in your UI on your app you
have to code your buttons and everything
again so it's yeah it's a lot of stuff
to redo I mean you even have to redo the
keyboard to get the new iOS 7 keyboard
is the command but but yeah you have to
redo that too Taylor while you're while
you're chatting what's your relationship
with Apple products well I use I use a
macbook pro retina display their
keyboard and their magic trackpad I have
an ipad mini and an iphone 5 i've had
every ipad so far and i've had iphone
for the 4s and I've carried them most
the time since the for hit verizon I
wrote about that yesterday when the
verizon iphone landed i bought it and i
used an iphone from that point until
just a few months ago so I've been
primarily an Android and iOS guy and
since the 1020 i switched away from the
iphone and haven't looked back so I'm
not terribly interested in the iphone 5s
I'm actually more interested in the 5c
just because of what it means for Apple
and emerging markets but I probably
won't carry the 5s I probably mad i
don't think the iphone 5c is gonna go Oh
a cipher it's gonna be a china phone I
have no no I think I think they're gonna
offer that everywhere I really it's
gonna be in the US just okay so simple
okay so for me it's either they ditch
the ipod touch and leave the iphone 5c
as the budget alternative because the
price tag is pretty much going to end up
matching the ipod touch you gotta get it
out plan though it's a huge cost
long-term love wouldn't if you wanted to
just use it as an ipod you get what a
better all that unlocked I Gaza as an
ipod I want to say that the Serie
improvements are being announced right
now and yes sirree improvements you can
search twitter wikipedia thing i hate
that they use bing ah ah ee hey so
bottom line is like i know i was just
gonna say Adam and I'm playing it out of
doubt or like shut up dudes no but no
but no but for real Bing I've been using
it more frequently on my windows from
because I've had the 1020 and Bing is is
improved I still prefer google
get me wrong I'm not gonna front like I
like Google better let me paint from
results are much better not gonna not
gonna front on this show yo can Siri
compete with google now yet probably
wait a minute win will hold a public
wait what do you mean can it compete
with google it does somethings better
than google now already like the natural
voice interface is way better than is
yet the the the so it speaks answers
back to you a little more naturally but
no no no that's not what I'm saying the
input is much easier you can talk to
Siri off person you still can't talk to
Google now like a person nearly as well
as you can do with Siri Siri still and
that's important because Syria is still
more popular with old folks as a result
serious so much I am an over all right
Brad since I series much better
integrating the phone it's a little more
natural use but but it's so much less
reliable like like twenty to fifty
percent of the time I can't even use a
damn thing it just times out do you guys
find that with Siri I don't have a lot
of issues with Siri but the languages
and I have an accent I guess my biggest
problem in a towel and I'll go with with
Taylor on this when it comes to Google
now is I just love google now because I
don't have to even talk to the damn
thing it already knows what I'm looking
for it already knows what I've just
searched it already knows what my
favorite teams are it already knows the
places where I go every day and for me
that is far better than Cirie even
though Siri I mean I it never gets me
calling an application wrong it never
gets my questions wrong it never sends
me to a to a desktop search or anything
and never does that Siri is that
reliable but i guess that google now
steps it up a notch that's me yeah it's
it's true automation in that eye open
what are you doing who did that stop
that stop that stop your aunt on get out
of here i was just going to say that you
just have to open it and it's the
information is there waiting for you so
it pulls automatically it gives it i'm
at anywhere a coffee shop and it's like
you're 15 minutes from home and there's
traffic you know so there are things
that Google now does that a suitable
never be able to card view and stuff I
that not all that far superior to us
here he's doing I was just talking with
the voice interface yeah that's true I'm
you're lying so still it old man am am
just a just little update we're still
talking about iOS 7 just
some recaps of the features i'm watching
closely see if there's anything new that
they're talking about but i'm going to
circle back to that discussion that we
started off with which is our
relationship with apple products um
about half the year i use an iphone
about half the year i use an android
phone and even that's a hundred percent
of here sometimes these windows one and
the reason is because my wife my two
best friends my parents my brothers and
everyone else that I know pretty much
uses an iphone so I message facetime
they all work between us very well but I
switched to android that all kind of
breaks down a little bit so the iphone
is a really important device to me and
the iphone is still the only device that
can do everything well and jaime knows
exactly what i'm talking about the
cameras kick-ass the speed and fluidity
is great the app situation is wonderful
productivity is there customized
abilities the only thing that's really
not there with with with that with the
iphone but for that i use an android
phone sometimes but i am a you know I'm
very much into the apple ecosystem like
Jaime because my family and friends I
guess that's a different reason Jaime
you have all of the services on all of
your devices right and that's that the
thing is in this country iphone is the
new blackberry it's like everybody has
an iphone now um and so it's it's just
easier to communicate with everybody
it's just for example there's new air
drop feature that's coming in iOS 7 is
gonna be the bomb it's like everybody's
like oh you don't have bluetooth file
sharing on your phone and we do on
Android well this is going to blow this
is going to blow a file-sharing out of
the water it's just it's very simple um
i guess i guess my thing about apple
products is the this the simplicity the
fact that i could be upstairs and I
could just restart my router uh which
obviously is an apple product from my
phone without needing to move it's just
that thing what's it's a no brainer I
can't believe that it's a no brainer but
then nobody else gets it right it's a
it's just everything is connected just
some updates here we lost Michael he'll
come back they're showing some apps that
are taking advantage of the new flat
design in iOS 7 zillow Evernote
opentable more to come and we're getting
really close I think in the in the
presentation where they're talking about
a release date oh here it is September
18 folks
so it is out that I still think the gold
master is coming out today the gold
master will be out today you can bet on
that yep and so September 18th a week
from tomorrow yeah you got it the gold
masters out today and Tim Cook is back
out thank goodness they didn't take too
much time yeah hey welcome back Michael
I have a question for you since you're
back in and ready to go how long you
going to carry the iphone because
everyone else will be as well so can you
handle that mr. hipster I'm going to
carry the iphone I'm gonna carry the
iphone and until enough time has passed
that that every third person I see in
the street has one and then I'm going to
I'm going to throw it okay so everybody
in the street is gonna have it before
you Michael Mike wait wait no mother not
i'm waiting in line for it that's why
don't ya exactly do you think you're
gonna be front of you in that line it's
like half the population of boston is
gonna have it before you get to the end
of that line are you what I'm gonna take
your 1020 in film it and and yeah I mean
every 10-20 the other packages so I can
counterbalance because I have to have
the least carried phone in Boston it
wait a sec guys another update that
September 18th date seems to only be for
iphone 5 and 4s so presumably I thought
I'll be a little bit later which makes
sense because the iPads behind and that
was rumored that was expected actually
that was part of the rumors that the
ipad launch would take some time it
happened with iOS four you remember when
4.1 and 4.2 came out there was no 4.1
for the ipad and went directly to 4.2
you know what that also means that also
means that i think this the pre-order
date of September 20th for the 5s and 5c
is right because iOS 7 has to be
completed before these devices ship yeah
you know and it's just one thing that I
really admire about this you know this
company for example none of my previous
none of my last your last year galaxy
phones have four point two point two
they just don't nobody has it yet um
they are waiting to launch everything
for them to bring four point two point
two to last year's phones so they can
have enough time to sell this year's
phones but then you have apple who
doesn't worry about that they're not
worried about not trunking one phone
over another phone because of a software
they still release their software
updates for their phones I guess that's
just another thing that I like about
using Apple products yeah everyone gets
the updates there's no crap there's no
waiting it's just there yeah but didn't
they get caught for scheduled
obsolescence not optimizing the software
for older hardware so it really just
kind of makes you happy but but here's
the deal i mean you have a single core
processor on the iphone 4 for example
all that interactive thing that you can
do with the camera like the Instagram
thee and do on a single core processor
big news is good news all five of the
iwork apps are now going to be free do I
get a refund for the ones i've paid five
dollars each for that includes what
iphoto imovie uh you just pages and
numbers i didn't pay for any of them so
I'm have paid for iphoto dude that's
awesome like what is that this that's a
serious value add for the for the whole
ecosystem now I mean is it really though
like is anyone like dude yeah over Laos
holes it allows them to compete directly
with Microsoft who's been like pushing
that office integration on all the
surface as you but drive Walt illegal
with red nails yeah yeah yeah yeah but
yeah you're right i did pay for it oh I
movie for example for those of you that
have never used iMovie i do recommend it
on the item it's really good you know i
edit the pocket now daily it's rare
micro you should take your Lumia 1020
shoot the video edited on the ipad while
you're still in line and then update i
uploaded by your line well it sounds
like a like not much could possibly go
wrong with that scenario i'm sure that
would hurt okay whoa alright so now
we're now we're talking about iphone Tim
snark Lee said now I'd like to talk
about i phone a couple of you might be
expecting this uh he's 05 do yo yeah I
miss Steve Jobs I gotta say it yeah you
remember that moment where he announces
the iphone 4 he's like stop me of UCS
the last what I like those that Tim Tim
adheres to the same formula of the
previous Apple events and it's fun it's
it's proven thing it's like geez you
move into a new category of care we on
top of what I phone now now we're gonna
tell you about how successful last one
was we're going to set the stage for
this next one which is going to build on
the success of this previous model and
you know it's simple there
I'm crazy about it but it's fun it's the
same kind of yes Samsung tried to do
that with their their press event that
press event was so weird what the wanna
diva yeah but they won't be written as
weird as I usually good okay well
they're like hey this is look at okay
now we're going to show you that again
much slower but they did that and now
they back and said okay in the past when
we've introduced an iphone we lower the
price of the old iphone this year we're
not going to do that this year we're
going to replace the iphone 5 with the
sale to design oh my god everything
looks stupid though new designs okay so
fine yeah would you would you give it
five hundred milliseconds before your
negative about it no no will not only
only say that it's not a bad idea it's
just bad because they'll have so much
stock left over what are they gonna do
with all the other iphone 5s that are
out there they're selling or simply it's
the same it's the same chassis all
they're gonna do is drill a bigger hole
ha they're gonna let rip off the panels
and I don't think they're gonna call
them all back and take them apart and
then put them back together you know you
know that what I'd really like honestly
I would really like for a bigger iphone
for us you know for a five minute 44
inch you know steel stainless steel with
a glass on glass marking that air so the
iphone 5 c's official it's called the 5c
um made with incredible tech that
customers love with iphone 5 okay so
it's just an iphone 5 of colors let's go
to the 5s wake now can we can we can we
get a 4.7 inch iphone please come cause
sales so that so the thing okay so
there's more fun and colorful yeah the
colors are all current nobody's really
surprised by the colors but this is cool
and then they're about to show a video
here so the colors might not get us
excited but as far as regular consumers
go yeah love to see this like color
spread especially it's between the
awesome way that apple can present it
because we know how they do it already
with the ipods you know what I mean
really looks good in the store and if we
gets my celebratory glands happening I
made that word up its really honestly
this is gonna be like really interesting
for me I love that strategy where the
old iphone drops in price and remains
another year because that automatically
may
your purchase nah nah sleep so here are
the colors you've got lime green whitish
bluish-green ready for me how much
yellow I want you guys to know like
while I was accusing the virtues of this
colored iPhone my friend my friend Chris
who's following our liveblog Hagmann
just texted me to say also the iphone 5c
looks like poop I don't I don't agree
Kristi Larson but you are gay it's like
yesterday's comments of outdated
they were like what are your predictions
we're gonna get an i crap the iphone
iphone the C stands were cracked yeah
it's gonna be comments or like that
getting to be time for me to write a
long editorial and why everyone needs to
shut up about the Apple bashing because
it's just out of time it's so funny it's
so funny they bash it and still those
are the most most viewed videos the sir
you know it's just the most popular time
for anything it's like every single year
year-over-year our most popular day is
iphone day because it's interesting
because one of the cool things about
selfish the OS and the phone i don't
remember if they held out on you and yo
las phone but is it the ghola phone or
is it what is i don't remember the name
yeah basically but one of the things
they did and one of the things that
Windows Phone does or windows for
manufacturers is they match the color
with the color of the phone and that's
what Apple's doing here it's kind of
interesting and then they've done it
with the ipod nano lineup Oh have they
did they had the wallpaper matching the
hardware casing and stuff yeah so the
pay phone has a pink wallpaper just just
some updates here so they're making a
case with it that is soft feel silicone
rubber rubber it's written it's really
weird as perforations in the back like
these holes I guess to give you a nice
grip and then also you get this idea of
doing two colors so the case can be one
color the device community and kind of
moto x a file right which is pretty cool
yeah it's polycarbonate you know I'm
just surprised if they sold I hold up
hold up the case is polycarbonate or the
casing the phone is polycarbonate the
cases silicone rubber
or something ok and then it's reinforced
steel on the chassis most likely yeah
that's what their that's what this the
engadget live dog is saying I'm or
injured I mean it doesn't look bad it
really doesn't know I like it come on
Carrie a lime-green iphone I would do it
ok Florence retina display integrated
integrated touch what does that in this
employee that you probably talked about
the lamination and sell ok and south oh
this RGB standard widescreen video right
that's like the basic a6 processor this
is all same about speaker guest okay
this is good for those of you that don't
know the a6 processor on the iphone five
rocks cranes it crazy it is really good
it is really good ok 8 megapixel camera
so this is pretty much the iphone 5 only
with a plastic chassis well that's what
Tim Cook said earned not Phil Schiller
said he said everything you love by the
iphone 5 just plastic but it's it's got
a bigger battery so that's awesome
because the iphone 5 RT is pretty good
battery life well what do we know what
the no they're not gonna ransom
elaborating the temple they have an
adult they never do there's an improved
front facing camera with higher larger
1.9 oh so the front facing camera is
actually 1.9 hey Apple can we get
optical image stabilization hold that
boom well not on the 5c LOL 5 sea turtle
is proud you don't this any did that any
does any of you ever miss like the
iphone 3gs the whole plastic design know
how hated that design i do i did not
hate that design I I like it I like it
because I'm obligated to because I'm
aniston emma nostalgia poor so yeah I
love the way it felt in the hand I guess
yeah I was pillowy it was nice until it
started bullying the plastic bubble
starting soon okay more LTE bands up to
100 megabits per second downloads 802 11
no a CNN OAC there's no AC on this phone
it's Bluetooth 4.0
I Apple why a hundred dollars or two
hundred dollars for the two-year
contract again why why that's too hot
okay so it's a hundred dollars 16 gig
and wait wait a second this is pretty
much an iphone 5 they're just changing
the back so it was dropped two hundred
dollars anyway right yeah I don't know
yeah so this is a 16 gig is 99 32 gig is
199 which is great you get the 32 gig
option that's awesome and then the case
is up Apple oh well ever you know I have
eventually learned that cases in the
United States all costs thirty to thirty
bucks it's funny because here they cost
five dollars um but yeah the case that
rubber case will cost thirty bucks and
you know what this we're going to do
guys the the cases are inter
environmental checklist arsenic-free
mercury free and android free hey hey
guys you know what this is going to do
by creating these two different products
it's going to make the 5s seem so much
more high-end because of the fact that
they're keeping the five around so
people are going to they're going to go
with the 5s because they know that the
5c is like you know it's always visible
here's my problem with it so they had a
perfect model with the iphone 5 going
down to a lower end model and having
introducing a new phone their old model
was great because they didn't have to
redevelop a whole new phone every time
they just developed one phone and pushed
it down the line kept developing it and
then made a new phone now each year
they're going to make two phones so is
that really going to constitute
yourselves as they're going to create
more sales or is it gonna just make them
spend more money developing a whole
nother phone so I kind of understand
what's going on here see you know for
example this aluminum design of the
iphone 5 let's face it whoever doesn't
like it i mean come on this is a
beautiful phone um you can't just come
up and come come out with a new
different you know slightly redesigned
BMW all the time they build one design
and they try to keep it for as long as
they can and so what what they're trying
to do is they're trying to keep the
high-end design to be this for another
year and then the iphone 5c they just
you know they rethought the whole budget
i did i think it's a smart idea to smart
approach here's something that's
interesting they're calling it
beautifully unapologetically
plastic that's awesome yeah that's sir
Jony ive in the in the video they're
saying that i think that's pretty cool
you're also calling out the seamless
nature of it I mean you know they're
trying not to make it sound like the
cheap that little o end well it's not I
mean it's an iphone 5 and there's
nothing cheap about it it's just got it
just has a plastic case which everybody
was going to buy anyways for it right
and the thing is like I think it's
important that they have this product
because yeah they're old model worked
well for a long time but you know what
did we see this past year we saw Wall
Street get really really impatient with
apple and we saw the value of the
company fall because it didn't grow as
quickly as it was growing before of
course that's inevitable but what do you
do when you have that problem you crank
out some more products that are going to
be bought in large volumes I mean I
think that the whole apple stock price
drop was mainly because Apple has not
launched products this year as they have
last year like no and not for example
last year was a mistake all years before
you would notice that they would sparse
their launches like early in the year
the ipad then mid-year the iphone then
end of the year the new mac allina but
then last year in the fall they launched
five different products on one event you
know the iphone 5 the ipad mini the new
ipod you know if you remember that event
that event was so long that people were
bored by the end of it and they launched
everything in the fall it was an arms
yeah and so that's really what hit their
stock price the fact that they haven't
kept people on the edge of their seats
rumors were loop control rumors because
we I think that Apple does this I mean
control rumors are not going to keep
people on the edge of their seats um I
think that in the case of this you know
again I how were they gonna read since
this design had no problems with it no
antenna issues no nothing with it how
are they going to differentiate the five
with the 5s if they both look alike in
the case of the four on the 4s they
looked sort of a light but you can still
tell the difference between one and the
other wait that for in the 4s weren't
they like like completely identical yeah
but the band's leather yeah that was
rich with the antennas yeah and nobody's
gonna pay attention to the antenna now
oh I can I could totally tell a 44
before us do you know if you good but
yours nurple your necks burn your the
manga yeah like I see one now and I have
to ask my friends is that a 4 or 4s hmm
no I get today
probably tell it what they're really
touting is that with this case the case
color combination plus the device color
combinations you can make like 40
different color combinations essentially
which is very interesting and the colors
are ugly I mean they're all so muted and
pastel there's no like private Oh Gary
redder you know we said that about the
iphone 5 until we held it so well no
these are pastel colors except for the
yellow and green they're all pastel yes
I guess for example I complete leap and
the iphone 5 and once I held it I was
like okay fine i like it so I'm not
matching that I'm just bashing the
colors I don't like the colors and I
don't like the cases but think about it
think about think about a bold rich
highly saturated color case and then iOS
7's muted pastels that wouldn't work
like the this is a unified hardware and
software there there's nothing muted
about the pastels on Iowa said I have
sevens very vibrant and that they are
all right well find that are vibrant
pastels but like it's green and green so
yeah somebody made a comment on the on
one of the parking out dailies and was
like imagine a colorful phone in a
colorful you I and I'm like okay so fine
a muted back with a colorful front is
not a bad idea actually all right guys
we're getting we're getting to the
iphone 5s know the name is confirms
iphone 5s it's got a 400-horsepower and
i got about fifteen hundred foot pounds
of torque in there oh my god if schiller
calls it perhaps the most
forward-thinking phone anyone has ever
made so when you make em like you made a
claim like that my tail starts to wag
and get pointy in the direction of north
uh finding in the direction of the vibe
button I mean he's really it's really
hyping myself by the way by the way
viewers up for example Apple products
are like the one those one products
where are you you know getting review
units is pretty much impossible those
are actually popped you know every one
of those reviews at which wich in the
other case it's completely different and
it comes in gold but it's not loaded
champagnes like champagne yes late gold
and silver like the URI I'm sticking to
silver I want platinum you know that's
that's where the business is I want all
matte black everything you know that
yeah
already made a macbook pro titanium all
right so that there it is it has the
dual flash thing it comes in those three
colors gold silver and slate so how's
this for the most forward-thinking phone
anyone has ever made we're going to find
out everyone just quiet until not asking
is champagne champagne phone ah it's got
its got a ring around the home button
it's like ring around the rosy song you
know the only reason why I would get the
golden phone is because obviously
everybody else is going to be carrying
an iphone 5 and that's just gonna make
me stand the part that's the only reason
yeah I hopefully I'm glad the choices
there because I mean a lot of people I
guess a lot of people prefer this I mean
others say they wouldn't have made it
but I'm glad that they've retained the
other choices to you know in that you
know that slate color actually looks
good what he looks the same a black
doesn't know no it's it's it's a it's a
gray or aluminum yeah and I'll put it
this way i'm gonna get an iphone i'm
gonna cover it in something because i
don't like how easily it just dings it
mine is just absolutely trashed and I
carry it in a case most of the years
tell you something about that okay so I
got this phone with applecare+ and
because you know mr. Brandon minimun
pretty much trashed it in about a week I
gotta interrupt you it's got an a 70 ka7
processor 60 64 bit what is that hanging
the phone so Taylor so Taylor for
example I have swapped this phone twice
um and this last time that I went to
swap it for some reason i've been using
the phone exactly in the same way that I
did before and it's got no dents so I
don't know I think that it prod they're
probably investing they did Sam parade
in a higher grade sheet of aluminum they
may have mine came damaged and they did
they wouldn't exchange it ohana meetings
yeah alright world's first and only
64-bit smartphone ever no one ever talks
about that I bet that Apple is gonna
tell us about why we should care about
that I bet they're gonna put it in
simple terms that we can understand
let's maybe an inspirational video maybe
oh alright gosh it's got the app store
just getting modernist
okay 64-bit desktop-class architecture
modern instruction set to Times general
purpose registers can somebody worst
joke somebody get x floating point
registers over 1 billion transistors 102
millimeters squared die so that's twice
as many transistors for roughly the same
size as the a6 and get it is about the
same size what does that mean I don't
know I don't really know all chai means
you know I think I think what we're
getting here is more power that's what
we're being made to understand about
this device so so forth means more
better apples apps are 64-bit developers
can chew it can run in 32 or developers
can make it 64 so more work for
developers but you know it's the future
they will do it and it's backwards
compatible yeah and forward compatible
oh all built-in apps will be
re-engineered seamless developer
transition xcode support runs 32-bit and
64-bit apps all right what does that
mean what does that mean my eyes are an
Android has a course can somebody
explain to me the difference between the
the arm bastes processing in this wow I
don't want to put everybody to sleep
right but like the CPU is twice as fast
and graphics or twice as fast as well
apples claiming with this new processor
and it's great way to stay in shape yeah
the cpu performance is 40 times faster
than the original iphone say i love
comparisons like that they're like kind
of meaningless not likely i said never
tried to use the original iphone these
days i have an iphone 3g here man oh my
god using that thing is like god that
thing is so slow that's built in Upsala
and OpenGL ES 30 and while the
performances is remarkably this oh so
the performance is is the biggest
increase of it is twice as fast as the
iphone 5 it looks more than that and
this fancy char King yeah and they're
they're talking up grab extensive games
now and looks like we're going to roll
into a demo so this is what happened was
every time right i mean they throw in a
more powerful processor but it looks
like they're really harping on at this
time I've never seen so many specs yeah
yeah it says entation a lot of
Foreman's talk yeah what seemed orbit
basically opens you up to two more
performance more capabilities it's both
hardware and software and you know even
more interesting is the fact that Bob
Mansfield is not part of Apple anymore
and they're making this like gigantic
leap into 64-bit processors now on a
mobile phone you know I don't know so
epic games is up on stage right now
we're gonna get the usual demo um you
know I just I'm still like okay fine
we're getting a 64-bit processor on a
4-inch display um calendars can open
real fast you think exactly I mean how
am I really going to enjoy a game on a
4-inch display I still debate that well
I know I don't know I mean I I don't
have a problem with with with screen
size at that point or at least I didn't
before but now that the markets like
norm is 4.5 24.7 it's like it's it's
like a shits yeah but that is literally
one of my biggest complaints with the
iphone is it sighs i have big hands so
are not long fingers just a fat thumb
really and it makes typing on it so hard
and and that's part of the other problem
is that the software hasn't really
improved where other keyboards are
getting smarter apples just they did
this change how it looked they didn't
add a prediction software I'm gonna
debate that I actually find the keyboard
prediction on the on iOS predict it just
corrects so swiftkey and swipe and with
the google stock keyboard i can type one
word and it can sometimes predict the
rest of my sentence but iphones it just
corrects you you know i guess it depends
on your usage scenario like for example
i don't even look at the keyboard to
type on at at times um and so the last
thing it's not that I'm not interested
in getting in getting suggestions that's
fine I just I'm not even looking forward
to them because I'm you know I'm just
focused on typing the word that I know
that I want to type and I like the fact
that it always gets it right you know
I'm used by the way I am like pro swifty
and look at that chrome ring around the
phones yeah I imagine we're gonna hear
about that in a second if wait if the
home button doesn't have the little
square in it anymore no uh yeah it
doesn't either
we now have a shepherd the developer of
infinity blade is saying that normally
it would take a lot of work to converse
I'm the 62 bit or 64 bit rather but uh
it with Apple it took two hours
apparently I think that's the Infinity
Blade developer so that's interesting it
on the crapper and my friend my friend
my friend Chris continues to give us
interesting information here is in terms
of the 64-bit instruction set should be
twice as fast yes indeed but only makes
a big difference in memory addressing
and instruction sets it's actually know
about you guys what I've been saying for
years what uh memory management is
actually good you can well you can have
more applications to multitask I assume
yeah um I think my biggest problem
people are in the comments on YouTube ur
saying that I'm I'm biased and bashing
Apple I'm not no way wait people are
making bias claims in the comment oh my
god never happened on your hands up no
my problem with the iPhone and Apple is
that I've been using it for years and
they keep changing and updating things
but they don't really speak to me they
haven't really addressed any of the
issues I've had and that makes it
difficult for me to want to continue
using it does it mean it's a bad phone
no yes I mean it's not great no it just
doesn't speak to me like it used to
they're talking about the the 64-bit
architecture enabling things like depth
of field and and focus and blur and
stuff in the game but they're also just
said you know it also enables lens
flares that would make JJ Abrams crash
I'm LOL about nope you know what's this
phone needs is like when you're when the
less informed technology no less
technologically informed population talk
to their friends say are you gonna get
the 5s they say what's the difference
are gonna be like oh it's got a 64-bit
chip and it's 50 x faster and yeah no
silly there's something here where it's
like it can read your mind right right
right no you're making a good point
because it's so hard we all have new
phones all the time right there all new
review devices and people ask what's
special about it and I think many of
some manufacturers forget the importance
of being like even if it's a gimmick and
Samsung does not do this Samsung knows
the importance of gimmicks but you need
to throw in two or three things there
where it's like I need I can show you
something in two seconds that'll make
your phone look lame and that's that's a
very powerful thing for the
the common side person you talked to on
the sidewalk yeah you know like I guess
for example Brandon posted something on
Facebook this morning was like today is
iphone today's iphone day and I you know
I found it really interesting that you
know the comments were immediately like
oh I'm waiting for iOS 7 you know from
you know two people that I assume are
not in the industry and this is you know
for me every time that I asked people
it's like what version of Android are
you running people don't know they have
no clue how to update the software on
their phone no no clue and still they
know what iOS 7 is and you know I you
know I'm either at the gym or someplace
and everybody's like oh you've got the
new iOS 7 but then when they look at my
at the galaxy s are they have no clue
that's running for point-to-point to or
whatever well yeah there are very
different ecosystems when you can you
can instantly tell when an iphone is
running the new iOS because it hasn't
changed in five years and now suddenly
it's different you know again oh there's
a new part the MS 7 it works alongside
the a7 it's called a motion coprocessor
oh this is exactly what the Moto X 8
mobile computing system does oh so right
natural language processing it will and
sees out that part yeah so dinner
anything bad yep that's boring basically
when I was good my Moto X it's not
boring for although for all the fitness
dudes who are going to carry their
iPhones and Rihanna continuously
measures motion data accelerometer
gyroscope compass enables a new
generation of health and fitness apps
okay nice and sexual awareness this is a
bigger they would make this push this is
exactly what Motorola's doing with the
ex yeah yeah using the iphone on a
treadmill as an exercise in frustration
no I believe it I I believe that
anything that takes place on or near a
treadmill is an exercise I still far
away from those as you can tell I get
down we talked about on the podcast a
couple weeks ago yeah but neither use
invited on a podcast ever again hey hey
no worries I might send you a fat listen
okay so are they totally killing the
Nike FuelBand with this thing no thank
you this is Nike yeah they're totally
killing the FuelBand with this thing in
there if their employment if they're you
know the rotation is going to be
something like
shirring everything that you do during
the day with this the make you feel bad
tell it tell us slobs with the nike
football i have one at home terrorism
yeah you wear band on your wrist and it
takes your your movement data and turns
it into fuel points which really don't
have any value their kind of be suitable
yes your cycle pinnacles for the
arbitrary hazards and saying and what
you're looking for is for a calorie
burns pacific during the day that's what
you're looking battery life is 10 hours
blah blah blah how does that compare
previously about this time is it 10
hours browsing LTE browsing well 10
hours LTE browsing is different I think
I think I yeah longer yeah two hours oh
look this time is about the size is
still true this is so true I don't
understand why it is with the iphone
that their 3g performance is lesser than
their LTE performance every time that I
go to the United States my battery lasts
twice as long as it lasts LT is just a
very efficient technology well it wasn't
like that everybody remembers the HTC
Thunderbolt your battery pretty much
went you have it that was that was back
when they had use a separate board
entirely for LTE yeah you so every time
you switch to LT you were actually
flipping on another radio so 9 we're
talking about the camera now which is
what I am extremely excited or concerned
with 8 megapixel iSight camera no no you
son of a I don't want that for most if
these guys bring optical in civilization
to this camera they're gonna nail it no
way no way there's no way that it's in
there because they don't have enough
space in the frame to do that i don't
think i really don't know man you never
know Five Element Apple ends designed
with with the f2 point when to aperture
what does that mean what's fifteen
percent larger sensor area or active
center area so that it's just like you
before it's it's the same five element
Apple lens that they had before yeah
that's the same the same Lin structure
yeah but we don't know about sensor size
its larger active sensor area but
fifteen percent larger active area but
that might only be for eight megapixels
which would be kind of like a HTC
ultrapixel thing for eight megapixels
maybe mm yeah bigger pixels make for a
better picture Phil says oh
ultra pixel hear all that Walter pixel
but basil too they're doing with it yeah
what's your name ultra pickles in there
we'll just I need more altra pickles
awesome people we have we have 1200
people watching right now so thank you
for trying to us also for experiencing
the Wonder with us I want to remind you
guys on the stream with me that the this
is not the iphone 6 you should not
expect a 26 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization this this is
the finest everyone keep that in mind
it's all right it's all right be nice ok
so these bigger pixels wait the HTC One
has optical image stabilization yes it
does yeah so you know because you
remember that they made that whole
argument where those those ultrapixels
what would allow more light intake but
then the thing is aside from the
ultrapixels there is also optical image
stabilization so apparently we're
getting bigger pixels on this phone so
most likely it'll have better low-light
performance it's not optical if it's
love 1.5 micro pixels that is I think I
think HTC's one has to point something
ultrapixel I guess to even or 2.2 I
think to my tattoo even sounds right but
1.5 which means the standard camera has
I think like point eight to one I
believe in in micro pixels which means
that that's a pretty significant upgrade
can one of you guys decipher this this
camera talk that's coming through here
because I can't put any context to this
camera the camera offsets white balance
exposure creates dynamic local tone nap
where's Adam line model okis matric
metering 15 zones okay it takes multiple
photos at once and picks the best
there's also a true tone flash and
they're talking about the different
kinds of light outdoor sky being the the
whitest candle flame being the most
orange whatever color your flesh is it's
going to clash with the color in the
room especially skin tone so this is a
little bit of an invention think I think
a multicolored flash that will help to
not make you look ghost white you know
if your clothes off you to be sure it
seems like it's like the lighting I have
for my video said if I used standard
incandescent bulbs all my videos would
look really ridiculous and crazy so I
use white
tamiya yo abella in case i use yellow
bulbs and i have to set the camera into
kansas and light that's that's the way
holy crap so these two these two LEDs
can flash in a thousand different
combinations making it more more more
MORE wow it's cold so I think ins I
probably have like a yellow one and a
white one to make it and you can balance
it out I think it's amber and white
actually okay yeah um so this is some
cool stuff guys I ok looks like me I'll
admit this I hate taking photos with a
flash but you know for me the iPhone 5
has been like the only phone that not
the forest by the way not the for the
five has been the only one that nails
night photography with a flash like a
point-and-shoot camera it's already yes
I could leave my cyber shot the old
cyber-shot that I used to have I leave
it back because the ihome gives me just
the same photos at night uh you know
from a partier you're using a flash now
this is something that I was going to
see because I if if this thing is still
going to take the same low-light photos
and not that they're bad but it just
still doesn't hold a candle to get it
here though since its its auto image
auto image middle is a question but I
don't know now that sounds like digital
stabilization to me and is digital
stabilization now I since we're talking
about cameras I have to bring this up
I'd never use flash I absolutely hate
you flash I flashes like a last resort
you ever I'll give you a flash yeah if I
had beads i would throw them at you but
i know but well this thing has to flesh
you have your xenon and your standard
LED flash and i leave one thing on at
all times and that is the focus flash
was like yeah yeah yeah because I can
focus at night and then optical image
stabilization makes it you know yeah
it's a closer than sisters handle it
yeah so that's something you can do
before you couldn't separate the two so
I'm really liked that a lot except for
can you tell me I'm sorry Taylor can you
tell me did the previous iphones not
have burst shot cuz this one too no no
no this is brush I don't know dude i use
birdshot all time an example of when
it's awesome I was just like was
brushing his hair yeah you can see the
individual strands is it
here to the brush and then freed
themselves it's amazing does it he does
it for hair brushing gifts I feel so so
for real on a boat I love taking shots
of the wake receding into the distances
I'm screaming by in a boat and the
American flag is doing this thing and
you know you've tried to take shots of a
flag and it's doing a stupid thing and
it's another stupid thing take 15 at
once the flag is going to be doing
something cool and one of them and you
can snap that everybody don't you have
to delete all those 15 14 and keep the
one if you use a dumb birth shot but you
most of them allow you to select a best
shot that it's like discard the rest I'm
like yeah describe the video 120 frames
per second 120 FPS that is awesome holy
balls I mean my problem with my probably
the first mode is that you have to drop
the resolution of your pictures so if
you usually capture at eight megapixels
up with a burst mode you're probably
only capturing like 720p or 1080p
pictures so that's my problem with burst
mode man i just upload them all to
instagram so it don't matter i did a
video on a version of us it kind of does
it's ironic it's like instagram boosted
their their image size of it like a
couple of months ago and so for example
photos that come from burst shot or
something look like all choppy and
everything on it soon yeah well that's
that's all android photos on Instagram
it did it does weird stuff Kendra by the
way I've been using the gs4 for
Instagram lately and that's like the
only android phone that works well with
Instagram all right let me I'm sorry
that it's capturing 120 fps in 720p and
you can actually select which part of
the video you want normal in which parts
in slow-mo that's awesome because some
funds restrict you when you're shooting
at 60fps like you have to shoot in that
the entire the entire video and then
like they don't record sound because it
would sound really weird playback at
normal speed or after the stock apple
stock is down about always is that's
always really it always goes down with
every announcement and then it
skyrockets by the end of the week this
this I was like a really good camera
guys I'm excited that they spend a good
amount of time on the camera because ok
so for it so for example for me out of
the why is it that i like the iphone's
camera over every other camera for
example HDR HDR is actually something
that you can leave on on the iPhone and
you'll still get the photos meaning if I
try to use HDR on the G
for I actually like the HDR on the gs4
mode more but you know it takes forever
for to take the shot and it always comes
out moved there and I don't get that
problem the iphone it's I don't always
get issues with HDR I don't know that it
the phone just knows it for example in
sunrise if you want to take a sunrise
photo the iphone will always nail it
regardless of would note that it's funny
because there are differences in HDR
execution that like if you see an HDR
photo taken with an HTC device you know
it because there's crazy fringing around
the edges and there's all this kind of
there's like a halo around stuff it's
really artificial looking which can be
cool sometimes but you don't always want
that yeah I agree the iphone well the
iphone is what kind of popularized HDR
for mobile photography so it all makes
sense hey yeah we're good blend it they
even make the fastest I mean they do it
the fastest they didn't talk about the
the resolution of the camera yet
interestingly yes I think I think that
probably means it's eight which is only
80 twenty eight megapixel panoramic shot
I almost read was you can adjust
exposure automatically during the
panorama that's awesome because only
take one with the Sun on one side and
darken the other end extra looks like
you're on some alien planet all right
here we go you are and talk about the
fingerprint now the third feature is all
about security looks like the line wait
a second so they never mentioned how
many megapixels this camera have gonna
be eight they don't want to talk about
mega don't want to talk about it then
it's eight yeah yeah mega pixel don't
matter does that sound familiar honestly
honestly there's nothing wrong with 8
megapixel it's no absolutely not i mean
funny isn't 13 yeah if you have a 13
megapixel camera and you want a 16 by 9
photos there 99 point you're down to 9.6
anyway right exactly yes it's pointless
so the showing off handcuffs talking
about passcodes how they're big pain in
the ass if they if they nail that
fingerprint scanner firing yeah this
iphone I'm tell you it's gonna be an
instant reader you won't even know it's
gonna be one of they wouldn't be
including it if it wasn't excellent yep
yep they're not gonna give up this
little girl honestly this is foolproof
security if they figure out or the right
way to do it I mean I'm not gonna have
to worry about passwords anymore but and
Phil is making a good point some people
find passcodes phil schiller am NOT on
first-name basis of the filter
some people find passcodes cumbersome me
so I do too I do not set up pass codes
on the phone because I don't want to put
him in every time i unlock the thing I
hate about skip it's called touch ID
that was the name that was leaked it's
official everything every last detail
has been leaked it's it looks like it's
an app and which makes me think that
there is an API and third parties can
take advantage of it so you never have
to enter a password again why couldn't
they do that with sharing so that I
could you know share to you know I don't
know Google Plus from the photo app
entail I don't include Google Plus
nobody cares care if it's google plus i
want to share to tweak but or anything
but the stock twitter client i'll just
imagine how many apps foreign are on the
App Store just imagine how many options
for sharing you have to what guys
there's a whole nother list of specs to
pay attention to now Oh a micron thin
500 PPI resolution of the sensor it
scans sub-epidermal skin layers and has
a hundred 360-degree readability what is
it the 360 degree finger off it does
that big oh great resent does that mean
it doesn't matter what what orientation
you put your thumb on it because most
people pick up their phones and they and
they don't align their finger perfectly
in the center so you can do it like no
you know i right okay okay that's what
I'm telling you this is gonna make the
go-ahead I thought I'm in like you could
put the your thumb unlike any all around
the fan can read in any orientation oh
yeah this is nuts stainless steel
detection ring so it detects your
fingers actually on the button so you a
little shocked a little vibration yeah
it gives you just to keep you awake a
porn industry like this the ring around
the house and bolts so it's a detection
mechanism that will turn on the touch ID
sensor like those little shake just as
you sit in your palm and they chirp
listen just the fact that I get to take
away my password is like he's awesome
and and you know what this means you're
gonna have a whole nother level of
personalization when you first buy the
phone it's going to be even more like a
fixed to a piece of your heart where
it's like okay I hi I'm your new iPhone
you're like hey and it's like teach me
about your fingers and like you got it
hey here to be like yeah yeah okay it's
time for an I was right moment you can
simply touch our home button to unlock
your phone that's so
cool you don't have to press in you just
tap it okay oh it was nothing like this
if this is going to be part of iCloud
keychain this is gonna nail it all your
passwords and everything nailed in your
fingerprint here you can also scan your
fingerprint to do stuff in apps like
authenticate itunes for bearing apps
it's also they're going to build this
into the macbook air it's got to be a
full this is this is this is kind of a
revolution because we haven't seen movie
nobody has nailed it right there not the
first but they're nailing it right
exactly yeah well we'll see if they nail
already maybe it'll get blowed like you
know what was that what was their last
facepalm moment I don't know antennagate
man I just want to provide your
fingerprint in your phone crashes I want
to provide an update to the people
watching thank you everyone for watching
I'm sorry if we're talking over each
other when when exciting shiz happens we
go a little nuts we geek out a little
too much but hey the home button is
completely flat by the way it's flat so
that ring is not raised around it no
it's actually in it goes in like a
dimming suit in ah that's what it's sunk
in I like this but this is I think this
is joni I've talking doing an addition
on the videos gol de de fome looks so
cheesy it's not just rampant techfoots
sake I like that it's not just
technology for technology's sake every
component and process has been
considered and measured to make it's
truly useful that's awesome is if
nothing else like this this fingerprint
thing and I kind of do here yo Taylor
come on yeah I mean it's a good is it is
it is but I kind of like the NFC thing
or trusted devices because if I'm in the
vicinity because you have this geo you
have a geofence base like NFC so you
want to carry this extremity on your
body you do not have you do not have
kids if you so I'm gonna have to take
off my watch it's just because I'm five
feet close to my phone and it's gonna
unlock my phone and I don't want my kids
to use my oh no I if I want it to lock
when it's all my pebble witness
connected all I do is tell you lot okay
oh you're sick you're single trust me
you're a single man and that's the
reason why you understand that you know
trusted devices make sense but for the
rest of the world
uses a passcode lock for a specific
reason what do you look at the moment
now the home button is uh the home
button is sapphire crystal who care it
acts as a lens who cares our friend a
friend Jeff nestel pack at G&amp;amp;G
technologies now GT um to the Stepford
Chris acts as a lens Accenture takes a
picture of your fingerprint analyze it
yeah it's basically like a dedicated
camera with a very specialized sensor
that's really really cool you know i
love that it can read multiple
fingerprints yeah there's multiple users
yeah I can have my babies fingerprint in
there it's me awesome oh yeah on the
concern with the fingerprint scanner and
is that your finger will be chopped off
by a nefarious no no no what if it's not
that accurate what if you want askance
and scan and then it works I mean I
don't know I've never used a fingerprint
scanner so I wouldn't know no it's going
to be like like cutting into a cake with
the sharpest knife you've ever used okay
so I example I used to I used to have a
when I used to my previous job I used to
always have IBM computers with with
fingerprint scanners and they were very
accurate like every single time they
would work and it's never stored on
Apple servers it's not anywhere in
iCloud like your authentication
information stays on the device it seems
so that's good yeah I wonder how long
the device retains so but the device has
to hold on to its memory of a of your
fingerprint it has to have a control set
for a match so if somebody steals your
iPhone I hope it's I mean it's got to be
encrypted right but yes you will be able
to La Liga name level but they won't be
able to unlock it anyways hey it's
unlocked already and they take it or
whatever you know I'm sure there's I'm
sure there's a way to get around this
and then grab that fingerprint data off
your iPhone and then then are you more
screwed than somebody getting a chat you
can't change your fingerprints it's like
somebody stole my password I got to
change my fingerprint do all you gotta
do is take a razor blade and change this
just like a carrot peeler just like ah
there we go there's just a lighter burn
your finger friendly it's just funny
that they're keeping the power button on
this phone it doesn't make any sense to
have it anymore whatever you can buy
yeah my button if you can just unlock
the phone with your fingerprint that
should be just the only button you have
to the prices so the whole button is not
going to be a button anymore
it's going to be 0 RZ gonna be is it 4
gigabytes uh I does i cried so doing 128
which is kind of surprising and
depressing yeah same pricing same
storage yeah they're not going to do
that is dead been enough 64-bit apps
will take up more space relative to the
32-bit counterparts probably not I don't
know actually it was the other way
around some 64-bit apps would be I
remember between the 32 to 64 get a bit
architecture some 64-bit apps were
actually smaller ok yeah Adam Wright and
jelly buyer somewhere like being like
what says you're talking about stuff
they don't know about on that hey is it
me or do these three colors next to each
other just look depressing this is just
normal or the gold phone looks someone
on Twitter posed a very good question
you have to take your glove off if
you're wearing gloves so how does it
work in the winter uh youyou Bostonian
you just set a password shoes so don't
see the case mean I guess you're gonna
have to take a look love off to use the
screen anyway because it doesn't have a
super sensitive display so they're doing
that case not a bumper the case covers
the entire back which is pretty amazing
cover up all that goodness yeah why is
that that's like amazing in the bad way
right yeah it is it's very strange
iphone 4s lead in the line it up and
it's gonna be free the eight gig you go
oh but they're dropping it to eight gigs
that's actually a set who can live with
8 gigabytes today pre-order starts on
Friday whoa whoa wondering why is
shipping 13 for that's the 5c right um
yeah 5c is available for pre-order on
September 13th the 5s and 5c will be
available September 20th in stores one
can you preorder the 5s pro at an abra
on set several 13th they did they're not
distinct thing here yeah that's just sep
tember 13th pre-order okay I can't wait
10 days what am I gonna do until then
yes your iphone 5 because it's exactly
the same without a fingerprint screeners
this year that I was planning on going
name is not a fanboy he's not tell me
family I'll find where they left
everybody first time that China will get
the iphone at launch that's a big deal
yeah oh so nobody's gonna get in the
United States you're gonna run out of
stock by the second day mm-hmm NTT
DoCoMo will also be getting the iphone
Japan for the first time so they're
expanding the footprint significantly
let's see if the stocks up on that news
izle it's not and it's not gonna raise
itself it won't raise itself the whole
day comics call me a hater but I'm just
not your older way it's gonna have to
wait what a low and say call me a hater
but I'm not blown away I mean I Taylor
you're too young to understand too young
listen to as I don't have kids yes
Taylor you don't have kids that's why
you're not blown away Jim Jim like they
don't answer though do I take that in
the simple sensor the double sense of
what you just said about blown away
gross i may i may have so many kids he's
so wise and experienced to use the
experience of a hundred and fifty year
old man just like they keep adding these
things that don't really matter to me at
all like the fingerprint scanner that's
a good implementation that is a good
thing it's so funny because I can hook
Tim Cook is directly arguing with you
with you right now like he's watching
this live stream and he just said these
iphones are packed with remarkable tech
but we've done it in a way that makes it
matter to people making things easier we
don't just pack in feature after feature
so he's making the opposite point a
little bit less doesn't matter to you so
it doesn't matter to me because I share
a lot for example if I'm in the browser
and I want to share a link I like to
shorten my links so the ability to share
a web page to the bitly app would be
perfect but I have to copy paste open
bit ly page Bobby you know so that's a
bit ly is no no no no I get you make an
okay point but it looks like these are
going to matter to a to a broader
spectrum of people than say a similarly
limited feature set device like the Moto
X like I mean I think it's going to be
interesting to see how these compare as
far as appeal to regular people right
it's gonna blow them away so in our case
it's it's it there is a point in using
things like bit ly but for the mass
majority I'm not just
just bit ly anything if you want to
share a link to anything outside of
email Twitter SMS and Facebook and
that's all stock apps if you wanted if
you use gmail for example and you want
to email a page instead of actually
using the stock mail app you can't you
have to go into it and you create a go
into the gmail app create that a so-so
message paste I mean it's just I think
that's like five or six steps to every
single process you ever want to do but I
think that's going to change like for
example every time that I there's this
new picture frame app that I use um and
in the past I would have to create the
photo i would have to save it in the
camera roll and then go to instagram and
upload an Instagram whereas now I create
the frame within the app and then I
shared directly from there to Instagram
it takes me right yet so basically
they're putting all of that footwork on
the developers instead of just releasing
an API where they can say hey hit the
share button and you can share to any of
these apps each developer has to go in
and code support for Instagram where you
have to log in to Instagram within this
app then you have to log into Facebook
within this app you know it's like I get
twitter it's like an awful we're getting
awful granular here guys I would tune
out at this can you guys shut up I'm
just saying that that is a big shore
coming of iOS so again tim is thinking
I'm Bobby there they're wrapping up in
cupertino here so I think we should we
should think about that they want to
return to music though it looks like
they're doing a sort of a semi one more
thing here yeah maybe uh what's close
they talk about itunes at all right i
mean we haven't talked about that well
this is September I'm surprised they
haven't had their September music event
oh well they they talked about itunes um
the itunes event at the very beginning
okay that way Brandon have you used
itunes radio uh no I hear it's amazing
though right it's really good you know
it's it's I just tell it for example it
does better prediction of what i like to
hear then pandora or that spotify radio
i don't know why i think it's it's smart
because obviously it's made me buy like
10 songs in the past week shoot all
right so there's Oakley I know
pull there's no apparently what I want
to do something funny let's all see who
can look the stillest on video one two
three oh come on oh no guys serious come
on I've just received confirmation that
I'm glad I'm not in cupertino because
Elvis Costello is there and I really
cares ah alright so you either how many
how many viewers we have we have twelve
hundred and twenty-seven that's awesome
very much for joining and Elvis
Costello's on stage and although
although most of you guys on here you
three don't agree with me a lot of
people on YouTube do so at least I have
their support network for the first time
in history look at this look at this
it's a spot for tea here it's just not
gonna be filming can you play the
world's smallest violin for me yeah Oh
so what what's up I don't know guy I
feel like we we should have some
takeaways here and I kind of I kind of
sort of don't know what to do with this
event Brandon well let me let me start
here the the UM I think that the iPhone
5 is a fantastic phone and I think one
of the places that it has a little bit
of a short coming is in low light
photography and it seems like they might
have addressed that and even come up
with something innovative with this um
this door flash right now i'm using the
the HTC one with the google play edition
rum and this is an amazing device it's
so fast great battery life but the
camera sucks I can't take pictures with
this I take pictures of my daughter
doing funny things I look at them later
and i think i missed that moment because
this camera sucks i need a phone that
has a great camera and here's one that's
the boggin funny business the camera
that's just the camera sadly that's the
that's when you buy a cyber shot it's
just a camera for the lumia 1020 is just
a camera it doesn't have the apps that I
need to live my life and so I can't use
that but I would if I could so for me
like there's no other choice but to sort
of prefer the iPhone because for me
it does everything that i need and i
think the 5s I don't care about the
fingerprint scanner faster is always
better and the camera is is a huge thing
for me so I'm I'm excited for it what do
you guys think I do care about the
fingerprint scanner for me it's like
even even if you know I think about it
i'm looking at my iphone 5 and I'm like
well you know there's not even if the
camera is better on this 5s it's not
like the camera it's not like if the
camera on the fog was bad um so I guess
the only thing that's nailed me is that
fingerprint scanner it's the fact that I
won't have to be because i am a password
guy i have passwords on everything and I
do for particular reasons you know here
theft is so high um that you really want
to make sure that your information is
protected and for me that fingerprint
scanner is like foolproof there's just
no nothing to worry about anymore and
that's really the reason why I wanted
unless somebody uses a sacar a cigar
cutter their fingers off your finger on
you guys kids are watching it's bedtime
in some places somebody's I haven't
echame of your finger yes you use di
like one of those lucky rabbit's foot
yeah um so I I have a problem in that I
really really think that customization
of hardware a customization of build is
compelling and I'm a little frustrated
that Apple has decided to only do that
for the 5c it's kind of perpetuated this
really annoying habit of only offering
customization features on low to mid-end
devices and so now I find myself almost
wanting to buy the 5c because I find
that one more compelling from a hardware
perspective I know I'm not going to do
that because I don't want to be left
behind on the time though it's like I
don't know so that's frustrating to me
and i think that uh but but at the same
time it's counterbalanced by they i have
the more gimmicky features of the 5s are
the ones that i prefer that fingerprint
scanner i don't i really care about 64
bit i know that this is very important
going forward but that fingerprint
scanner is going to give me a whole new
appreciation for device sensors and
things of that sort so I'm jazzed I'm a
little annoyed that I'm coming back to
iphone on the off cycle you know and
it's like it's like oh this is the
Refresh are you jest enough to do jazz
what
out of your misery I'm not what what
Brandon Jaime put me out of my misery
why do it I Trish cut off my don't get
the phone man just send it over come on
yeah on a count of three anyone that's
jazz do jazz hands why not get up three
no I reckon I have I have a kind of
asian from where Apple got their
inspiration for the cases for the iphone
5c this comes from a friend on Twitter
right there there you have it it's just
the inspiration like the camera on me
for a second yes I hate Crocs oh my god
well you can now buy the croc phone from
Apple the crackphone the crackphone the
iphone 5 croc it's your bro if you
couldn't guess I'm not really gonna be
too excited over the iphone and people
were commenting Taylor's not excited
he's bashing the iphone now but he'll
probably owned one in a couple months
I'll probably owned one next week or on
the 20th because that's my job we all
love us yeah that's my job and I don't
know who's doing the review yet but
Brandon see me an email and told me not
to sell my other iphone so i don't know
i was i phone 5 several months ago
that's an interesting question taylor
and i want to confirm this on the air
with brandon are we we're going to be
reviewing both of these that correct
we're gonna have to do some arm
wrestling some it's a heated debate and
or have to read for yourself yeah
whatever good the 5s and 5c though we
are we are covering both yeah okay wait
a second re still alive yes we're still
alive yeah I was about to do a drum solo
cuz we gotta wrap I think too i think
that the first hangout that you did went
live I never slinky creative now these
are these logistics we can figure that
off the air because uh because one of us
has to pee yeah I never started the okay
and one of us has to cue oh alright so
wats honey yeah I just want to conclude
this be
because we all need to take care of our
bodily functions so I just going to wrap
this up and say thanks for watching us
for the last hour and 15 minutes guys
we're going to test these devices
compared them to the androids the
windows phones of the world and you know
it's going to be awesome and there's a
there's a lot of us on the team coming
back to it for a while we have different
perspectives as we always do and it's
it's going to be a lot of fun I think
there's going to be some some more and
more heat in the comments but I think
it's going to be very nice as do it all
right guys well let's uh let's cut it
and see you next time thanks everybody
see you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
