ipod touch gets complete revamp and the
possibility of getting flesh on our
iphones gets closer sort of all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm high- and welcome to the park and
nail I review the show we go for all the
weeks cool and not-so-cool inside the
world of Apple's iOS devices as always
let's start off with the cool so yes
Apple's music event finally happened on
September first and aside from being the
first show that Apple brings streamed
live through quicktime we did get a
couple of positive changes to start with
we had i OS 4.1 finally being released
as of next week for iOS devices we know
this doesn't apply to first-generation
iPhones it only applies to the iphone 4
iphone 3gs and iphone 3g out of the
changes one of the good things is we
finally get fixes for a lot of bugs and
a lot of them have to do with the iphone
3g so if you're carrying iphone 3g and
have a lot of latency you have a device
is giving you a lot of trouble probably
4.1 is going to be the upgrade for you
even if it's only going to give you
folders and a couple of other things
another thing that finally happened is
that we are going to get game center for
iOS devices to finally be released this
will allow you to get social gaming and
a couple of other goodies you know just
being prepared for the xbox live feature
that's coming in for windows phone 7 you
know our competition is and then another
thing is we are going to get TV rentals
for a buck though amazon just pulled off
their TV buys for a bug so let's see how
long that lasts something else we're
getting on iOS 4.1 is hdr photos and
what that is is you take a picture and
the camera actually figures out how to
take a low exposure picture on one side
a normal exposure picture on the other
and a higher exposure picture in the end
and actually choose the best one even
though I'm not sure we can actually
trust the software just yet we're gonna
have to see the release coming out and
see how it works in real time and also
the ability to finally upload HD videos
over Wi-Fi so there are a lot of cool
changes on iOS 4.1 actually a lot more
of the changes that we actually
predicted so it's gonna be a good
upgrade let's see what happens
neither I don't know Monday Tuesday they
said next week so let's wait for the
upload to be available continuing on
with the cool Apple has just released a
new version of the ipod touch it's not
going to be called ipod touch 4 or the
next generation ipod touch this ipod
touch it brings the retina display where
we're predicting it to bring facetime
calls / email through a front-facing
video camera you're also going to get a
backward camera for pictures and HD
video recording though we're still not
sure how many megapixels will bring we
just know it has 960 x 720 resolution
also it brings a much sleeker design
really cool design really totally
different it's not the glass on glass
design that we were expecting but it is
something different to what we were
actually expecting Apple to bring with
this device Apple's also adding the
three axis gyro you're also going to get
40 hours of battery life and you're
going to pay 229 if you want da kick
bottle 299 if you want the 32 gig model
and you're gonna end up paying 399 if
you want the 64 gig model though where's
the 16 gig we're not sure and having
such a little price gap between them is
sort of weird but it's the new ipod
touch and it's going to be released as
of next week so also expect that coming
up if you're interested in having an
iphone experience without the data plan
now rumors are that Apple's finally
going to release a batch of iphone 4
devices without antenna issues ass at
the end of this month now why do we know
this rumor well the iphone 4 was
released in mexico just a couple of days
ago and the telcel manager actually was
telling people that yeah if you get the
iphone 4 right now you're probably get a
reception issues but a sub September
30th we are gonna get a new batch of
devices that don't so you can exchange
it afterwards uh what what does this
mean well we never know we're not really
sure if this news actually includes that
Apple's going to fix the antenna issues
that other customers are currently
having but at least we know that if you
buy your device s of September or at
least we think you're probably not going
to get antenna gate issues let's see
what happens
and we're going to leave this as a rumor
for now but we're probably going to get
flash based browsing as of a little
couple of days from now why well skyfire
is a browser that a lot of us already
know we've seen it on Windows Phone and
we've seen it on Android and what it
does is it has a really cool way of
giving you server based navigation
through your mobile device so you're
actually using your mobile device right
now you're opening a web page on skyfire
but it's actually rendering everything
on a server and bringing you what the
server brings to the iphone so the cool
part is it actually can also play flash
based content so we're probably going to
get this we're really not sure what all
the Pens of apple approves this now
given that Apple actually approved opera
mini just a couple of weeks ago it could
be a possibility not really know what to
make of it but we'll keep you posted see
what happens now let's continue on with
the not-so-cool itunes 10 got released
as of wednesday and why is this on a non
cool section well it brings something
called ping what is paying it's supposed
to be that social network that we talked
about a couple of days ago and it's that
I mean it's a social network for you to
share and know what your friends are
listening to their impressions on music
probably the only cool thing I find
about this feature is that I can
actually follow you too or follow
ladygaga or any of my you know favorite
artists and know what they listen to and
know when their concerts are going to be
and that's it that's ping you can get it
in iTunes and you can also get it on
your iOS device if you go into the
itunes feature of your iphone or ipod
touch now Apple we were really not
expecting this we were actually
expecting more I mean what happened to
itunes to the cloud i'm steve i'm
actually going to quote you on this
wanna share your your content that
you've bought or somehow otherwise
acquired yeah amongst your various
devices and you can't do that today
right with you you can do that today
with a wire you cannot do that today
without a war when we need to work
harder on that you do what we do so
you're gonna do better we need to do
better okay anytime soon
we're working on it right so what's the
excuse now so you know if we're not
going to get itunes in the cloud steve-o
I mean at least let us dream stuff over
Wi-Fi it's it's 2010 buddy come on
that's going to wrap it up for today's I
review thank you very much for watching
any questions your comments you have
about this video let us know what
twitter.com slash pocket now sweets or
youtube.com slash park and I'll video
