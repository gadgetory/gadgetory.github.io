or they might have absolutely nothing in
common
we're going to compare the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom with the Samsung Galaxy
s4 I'm Anton denied this is PocketNow
let's go check it out
if you're not paying attention to the
details you might think that the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom is a samsung galaxy s4
with a zoom lens this is not true the
zoom and gs4 have a lot in common
like materials overall design software
etc but not that many as Samsung wants
you to think to be quite honest the zoom
has more in common with the Galaxy
camera and the s4 mini actually it's an
s4 mini with a zoom lens but that
wouldn't have sounded that good in the
marketing department before we dive in
let's get a couple of things out of the
way first this is the octa-core exynos 5
version GTI 9500 second for an in-depth
look at the Samsung Galaxy s4 all of its
features make sure to check out our full
review on PocketNow you should also
subscribe to our social media to stay up
to date with everything as always this
video will focus on hardware software
and user experience as well as the
camera performance of the two the usual
hyper laced polycarbonate a familiar
design as well as the overused branding
and naming is what these two have in
common the galaxy s4 like we said in
previous videos or every time we had a
chance to is a rehash of the GS 3 and
Note 2 in terms of design and materials
one might say that Samsung is consistent
others may simply hate it will say that
the internals and the functionalities
are making up for all of that it is
after all one of the best Android phones
money can buy today the Galaxy s4 zoom
on the other hand looks like something
that could have resulted after the
Galaxy camera and the s4 mini had a baby
dude already talking on your camera
that's what I usually get when people
see me use it as my daily driver know
it's a phone with zoom lens is usually
my reply which gets waved off quickly
looking at the zoom from the front will
make you instantly recognize a GS 3 or
an s4 mini it's a phone once you turn it
to the side or to the back you'll
quickly realize that honestly speaking
it looks like a camera and there's
nothing wrong with that
at least not in my book
build quality and materials are as good
as any Samsung phone or as bad depending
on your stance once you look at the
internals you'll see the huge difference
between these two and come to realize
that there's nothing s4 about the zoom
except its name we've got either an
octa-core which is a dual quad core
Exynos 5 CPU running at one point sixty
Hertz for the a-15 chip and 1.2
gigahertz for the a7 chip a Snapdragon
600 1.9 gigahertz or a Snapdragon 800 at
2.3 gigahertz powering the Galaxy s4
depending on the model versus a more
modest dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor
powering the zoom 16 32 and 64 gigabyte
storage versus 8 gigabytes 2 gigs of ram
versus one and a half five inch full HD
Super AMOLED screen versus 4.3 inch qHD
Super AMOLED screen 13 megapixel main
camera versus 16 megapixel main camera
plus a truckload of sensors on the GS 4
versus just the usual suspects on the
zoom this is not a galaxy s4 and this is
probably the last time we'll say this on
the software side things look a little
bit more alike meaning we got Android
4.2.2 jelly bean running on both devices
with Samsung's own TouchWiz user
interface on top however due to the lack
of certain sensors and functionalities
on the zoom the user experience is
inferior to the one on the s4 if you
care about all the features present on
the flagship there's no air view air
gesture or s-health on the zoom if you
don't care about these you shouldn't be
concerned
another omission just like in the s4
mini skate is the LED notification you
won't find it on the zoom and you won't
find it in its settings either and since
we're talking about a 4.3 inch screen on
the zoom the keyboard is lacking a 5th
numeric row at the top that aside
everything else seems to be the same
with some additional camera oriented
features on the zoom there are 25
shooting modes on the zoom versus 12 on
the s4 the camera interface while
similar at first glance is also slightly
tweaked on the zoom to get you smart
modes favorite modes and expert settings
for program mode manual mode and color
wizard in the first case you set the
exposure and the shutter speed and the
upper
is being said automatically and the
second mode you adjust the shutter speed
and aperture and the third mode you
change the brightness color saturation
contrast and sharpness you will also
find a certain photo suggest application
on the zoom which based on your location
shows you interesting places to capture
on film and the ring around the lens
acts as either a zoom setting ring or a
quick launch when idle jumping straight
to a certain mode in the camera as well
as an encode photo shooting shortcut
editing images on the zoom is similar to
the gs4 with built-in tools for making
your pictures more personal like
cropping adjusting applying effects and
so on one of the biggest annoyances with
the zoom in our case is the inability of
TouchWiz to function in landscape mode
while you're on the home screen app tray
and other areas we do understand that
Samsung wants you to use this as a phone
but it comes naturally to hold it in
landscape noting a software update
cannot fix it's just there on our cons
list alongside the lack of an LED
notification even the focused assist
life could have been a feasible solution
and while we're talking about the camera
this is how different these two air
quotes phones are the zoom lens extends
for a maximum of 10 times optical zoom
and the results to be honest are
impressing we're glad to say that we're
satisfied with the camera capabilities
of the zoom that's not to say that the
s4 or at least our Exynos s4 is a bad
camera no it's one of the best out there
but let's take a look at some sample
images so that you know exactly what
we're referring to and right outdoors
they both capture and deliver great
images however once you start to zoom in
on things
the s4 simply cannot put up a fight with
the optical zoom on the GS 4 zoom due to
the lens construction we also found
macro performance to be superior on the
zoom and as far as low-light is
concerned the zoom is far superior to
the escort so who is the s4 zoom for if
your shooting needs are limited to
snapping a couple of shots and bright
sunny outdoors where you can get close
to your subjects it's definitely not for
you if you like your low-light images
zoomed in subjects blur backgrounds and
manual settings it is definitely for you
regardless if you are an amateur or
semi-pro photographer on the go it is
for those who don't want to carry a
camera and the phone at the same time it
is for those who want their party
birthday clubbing nature sports and
other pictures to look good while
answering a call on their camera oh let
me rephrase while taking all these
pictures with their phones everyone
that's going to do it for today's
Samsung Galaxy s4 zoom versus samsung
galaxy s4 video we're going to have a
lot more coming on the samsung galaxy s4
including more comparisons and the full
review so stay tuned for that
until then I'm Anton Dean odd you can
follow me on Facebook as well as on
Twitter and if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up as usual
thank you very much for watching until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
