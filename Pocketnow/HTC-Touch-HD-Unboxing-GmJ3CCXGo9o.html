pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
of the HTC Touch HD the device that may
be the most gorgeous windows mobile
device ever released a true iPhone
competitor and it's a look in its design
so let's get started I'm excited about
this Wow
basically there's just a massive screen
on this device and very minimal hardware
buttons
how does this open
oh it's magnetic very high high quality
here magnetic wow wow what a big screen
look at the device in a minute
very experience similar experience to
the unboxing of the touch pro and the
touch of diamond let's see what else we
get here let's look at the bottom of the
box okay so we've got a screen protector
here very nice with a cutout for the
front-facing video camera
we've got accessories some software
Quick Start Guide not in color which is
kind of strange
HTC care alright let's see what kind of
accessories we get inside of the box
yeah so the touch HD comes with a
massive 8 gigabyte SD micro SD card
that's really amazing
we've got the HTC headphones here a
charging cable which of course uses HTC
cxt USB and a charger and wow we've got
a pouch or a sleeve here something like
that Wow looks like a little sock a
black sock it's actually just a a pouch
to to protect the HTC Touch HD which is
very nice let's see how big the battery
is hopefully it's a nice size okay it's
1,350 milliamp hours which is pretty big
not the biggest and also in the Box
there is an extra stylus which is good
non collapsible alright so let's
actually take a look at the device now
it's a very wide and tall device because
the screen is a massive 3.8 inches by
comparison the iPhone has a 3.5 inch
screen it's very very thin a lot thinner
than you would think it would to be it's
it
about the same thinness as the iPhone
and really what you're looking at is
just a massive touchscreen this is
beautiful it's so gorgeous the front is
completely flush Wow impressive
okay so let's take a look at how this
compares to the iPhone this is the last
generation iPhone but it's pretty much
the same as the current generation the
screen definitely looks bigger on the
touch HD let's see how they compare
touch HD is slightly thicker than the
iPhone but not by much I mean this is
definitely going to be one of the
thinnest windows mobile touchscreen
devices let's take a look at how it
compares to the samsung omnia which was
before thought to be kind of an iphone
competitor but the touch HD just makes
it look like a little wimp in comparison
the screen is much higher resolution
much larger it is about the same
thickness on the omnia is a very thin
device and let's take a look at other
devices like the HTC touch pro how and
you thought the screen on the touch pro
was pretty big obviously much thinner
than the touch pro and the x1 from sony
ericsson which also has the same screen
resolution which is the highest allowed
by Windows Mobile so that's 800 down by
480 across WVGA and of course the touch
HD is going to be significantly thinner
there too so we've got a lot to talk
about with the touch HD so many people
have been waiting for this device to
come out a lot of people are calling it
the iPhone killer so be sure to watch us
for more content and if you want to
touch HD of your own they're now
shipping at clove technology that's
clove Co UK so check it out there we'll
be back very soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
