pocket now and hopefully this video can
help take some of the angst out of your
next headphone purchase now we can drive
ourselves crazy looking at all the
different headphones out there that we
can buy and chances are if you're a fan
of this channel then you probably also
agonize over other technology purchases
combing through all of the specs and the
reviews and the benchmarks on various
phones and tablets and computers and
audio equipment we do that because we
care but audio equipment for many people
can still be a mystery and it exists at
this hellish intersection between
professional and consumer applications
there's an enormous amount of
subjectivity involved when it comes to
reviewing things like microphones and
interfaces and speakers and cans this
video as an overview will be far from
comprehensive but it should serve as a
decent place to start the conversation
in before someone in the comments says
this is a crap video because I didn't
reference some obscure audio metric or I
oversimplified a very complex audio
concept rule number one for me and
buying any piece of technology is
setting a budget this is a dollar amount
I refuse to go over and we can kind of
fudge the numbers on things like smart
phones maybe you're on some kind of
contract or some kind of leasing program
but if you're putting a lot of really
expensive purchases on credit cards that
might not be the best situation for your
long-term financial health we should
immediately diss a value of the notion
that if you only have 20 bucks to spend
on a pair of earbuds that you somehow
can't get a decent pair of earbuds for
that cash just to get our term straight
we're gonna take a quick look at the
different types of headphones starting
off with cans
these are circumaural headphones that
means the ear cups will wrap all the way
around your ears they shouldn't be
squishing your ears in any way now
personally I find circumaural over ear
headphones to be the most comfortable
for longer listening sessions and these
are usually my go-to solutions for
things like watching movies next we have
supra-aural headphones or on ear
headphones now these rest on your ears I
don't find these to be as comfortable
for longer periods of time but a decent
pair of closed back on ear headphones do
a better job of clamping to the side of
my head and blocking out surrounding
noise so I like these for when I'm
working it's often the situation where
I'm taking them on and off repeatedly
while I'm listening
whatever it is that I'm editing in video
or an audio cans can come in open backed
and closed backed varieties clothes bag
varieties typically have an exaggerated
bass response just because the cups are
closed and that low frequency energy
just doesn't have anywhere to go so it
just keeps reverberating inside your
skull now I actually don't own a pair of
open backed headphones right now but
those open ear cups should do a better
job of letting sound frequencies pass
freely through the headphone design and
around your ears though obviously they
won't do as good a job of blocking out
any noise in your surrounding
environment then we move to inner aural
ear buds and these are the ear buds that
actually go inside your ear canal for
the really fancy stuff you'll often see
the abbreviation IEM which stands for
in-ear monitor and that's another tricky
aspect of talking about headphones is
that professionals typically call their
progear monitors not speakers not
headphones maybe we'll call them cans
but monitors denote a particular focus
on accuracy over trying to make music
sound better so when a company is
advertising a pair of studio monitors
they're really saying we're trying to
make an accurate solution as opposed to
a consumer-grade solution which is
probably going to influence the
frequencies of sound to make music sound
a bit brighter or a bit bassy or a
little juicier lastly you've probably
encountered these rest on your ear
earbuds and I don't get snobby about a
lot of things when it comes to audio but
these things I really feel most
consumers should probably throw away if
you're listening to a lot of music on
the go these things create such a poor
seal around the year that you're
probably listening to music louder than
you need to and that kind of constant
audio abuse will really wear out your
ears over time and not a long period of
time either we're starting to see
evidence that the way we listen to music
today that we can stream constant audio
information into our skulls with very
little interruption is degrading our
hearing much faster than previous
generations so these are fine to get you
started but do yourself a favor find
something that fits better and does a
better job of blocking out audio around
you so that you can turn the volume down
a little bit and still have a higher
quality listening experience for phone
calls and music and now we're done with
these if there's less environmental
noise leaking into your ears then your
audio will sound louder by comparison
the two different ways that we
have to block that noise are active and
passive noise reduction passive noise
reduction is really easy to explain
basically you block the ear a closed
back pair of headphones or inner aural
earbuds should create a seal which
blocks noise from your environment from
intruding upon what you're listening to
active noise cancellation works in a
very similar way to how our phone works
while taking phone calls there are
microphones built into these headphones
which sample the noise around us and
then create an opposite audio signal
which should eliminate a lot of constant
background sound it is kind of magical
the first time you use a pair of active
noise cancellation headphones and you
click that switch and then all of a
sudden the hiss and background sound
that you're just sort of naturally
accustomed to vanishes the drawbacks to
active noise cancellation though these
are solutions that you need to charge so
you need to charge them alongside your
phone especially if you're listening to
them for long periods of time throughout
your day and active noise cancellation
doesn't do a great job with sudden
spikes of audio it's going to do an
amazing job of killing the engine sounds
while you're sitting on an airplane but
if you're sitting next to a crying baby
those shrieking crying baby sounds are
probably going to cut right through now
when you're buying headphones you're
gonna see a ton of different numbers on
the side of the box we're not going to
go over every single minut audio detail
there but one of the things that I do
like to pay attention to is the
frequency response the generally
accepted range of human hearing is from
20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz
but for nicer headphones you'll often
see those numbers swing wider than what
our human hearing range is generally set
at to be sure if you pick up a pair of
headphones that are from 20 Hertz to 20
kilohertz you're probably gonna be fine
but one of the reasons why people look
at expanding beyond that range even
though we might not be able to hear
below 20 Hertz there's a lot of
information to suggest that we can still
feel that audio information below 20
Hertz and that sound might influence
frequencies of sound that we can hear so
if your headphones have really good
support for infrasound sound below 20
Hertz those lower frequencies might be
bouncing around inside your head and
influencing how higher frequencies of
sound are reproduced now I'm in my
thirties so I have a hard time hearing
above 17.5 kilohertz I give myself
pretty regular hearing tests but I still
look for headphones that expand beyond
that
kilohertz range because I feel it's
going to give me a more accurate sound
profile when I'm listening to higher
quality audio files they're going to do
a better job of representing the
frequencies of sound that I still can
hear another important number to look at
on the side of the box especially for
people who listen predominantly on
mobile devices like smartphones is the
resistance or impedance I used to
pronounce that impotence but that sounds
like a completely different kind of
problem impedance is measured in ohms
you're going to see a number with a
little fancy Kerli symbol next to that
number and it loosely to oversimplify
represents how much of the audio signal
is cut before it makes it through those
headphones really fancy studio grade
equipment is usually plugged in to very
powerful amps so you kind of want to
make sure all those things are playing
nice so that you don't blow out the
headphones or worse blow out your ears
now the headphone amps built into our
phones are not nearly that powerful so
the higher that impedance number goes
the more difficulty our phones are going
to have in producing a bright punchy err
colourful audio signal that's why there
can be some confusion when someone has a
really nice pair of studio cans they
plug them into their phone and all the
sound terrible you're probably dealing
with a situation of impedance audio
impotence modern flagship smartphones
they built over the last two or three
years probably have amps powerful enough
to drive mid-range consumer solutions
anywhere around that 32 ohm resistance
and you sometimes got to be careful with
really nice smart phones my LG v10 which
has a pretty decent DAC and amp
combination can overdrive the 16 ohm
earbuds to the point of distortion and
that brings me back to one of my initial
points for this video is that there is a
huge amount of subjectivity involved
when talking about audio equipment
first of all just think about all the
fights that we get into trying to figure
out what a mid-range smartphone is the
audio world is even more brutal when it
comes to those kinds of discussions for
an audio professional spending five six
seven hundred dollars on a pair of
in-ear monitors is often considered
something of a mid-range purchase the
studio that I work in to do a lot of
voiceover casting uses mid-range
microphones that cost well over a
thousand bucks a pop even consumer
solutions can get a bit skewed when we
start talking about the differences
between audiophile grade components and
regular consumer grade listening
experiences and where those price points
should fall
also you kind of need to take every
headphone review with a little pinch of
salt the shape of my head and the shape
of my ear canal is going to greatly
influence what frequencies of sound I
pick up on when I'm listening to my
favorite styles of music I can say to
you that I think these earbuds are
amazing but if they don't fit your ears
the same way you're going to hear
something very different than what I
heard so while you can absolutely get a
sense of trends really the best piece of
advice before you throw down real cash
on a pair of headphones is to see if you
can try before you buy comfort is key if
you don't enjoy wearing them then you're
not going to use them so it doesn't
matter if I tell you that these are
fantastic cans for the price if they
hurt your skull and lastly circling back
to one of my earlier points these things
don't need to break the bank we're
seeing some really cool products coming
out at entry-level price points these
are fifteen dollar earbuds are they
going to compare to my $700 in ear
monitors no but they offer a perfectly
respectable listening quality for music
and podcasts and phone calls so folks I
hope that's helped illustrate some of
the things that you might want to take a
look at before throwing money down on a
pair of headphones obviously we can
expand this conversation tremendously
and I hope we will down in the comments
drop some questions maybe I'll stick
around to answer them as always folks
