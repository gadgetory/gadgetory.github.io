bringing high-end smartphones to the
market and after seeing the g pro 2 and
we already know the g2 we now have the
g2 mini let's go through it I'm high
never go to a pocket now Tony behind the
camera mwc 2014 on a roll now the g2
mini is pretty much a smaller g2 in
design even though it's a little thicker
than the g2 and we have a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core processor aside from a 4.7
inch IPS display that is qhd there's
only 960 x 540 2,400 milliamp hour
battery and there are options for either
a 13 megapixel or 8 megapixel camera
depending on your market though none of
these are optically stabilized by the
way we have LTE cat 4 which is pretty
much the highest LTE we get on a
smartphone right now and it's really
interesting because obviously this is a
mid-tier tone it's not a high-end phone
that we were expecting Android 4.4
KitKat out of the box aside from the
fact that you do get this knock coding
in order to be able to unlock the phone
but then again if we go into the UI this
is the same LG you I that we're used to
and some people like it some people
don't I'm actually on the list of people
that don't let's see what version of
Android were running let's see
apparently we are looking at software
information and four point four point
two out of the box this is great for a
mid-tier phone then obviously the UI is
it's got its interest for those people
that like it we also have the qslide
applications which is not multitasking
but very close to it and we do get this
accessory you've got the second great
color here but this cool accessory is a
snap on that will provide you with a
small window for different features
which is better than samsung because
this is actually a color snap on display
in comparison to what you get from
Samsung now there are a ton of color
options for this phone actually got to
read a gold a white and a great options
and there is a really cool texture to
this phone
the back I really like it even though
this is not the state of the art like
slim phone that we know we do get these
buttons here at the back for your
operation it seems that LG wants to push
this as far as they can now there are
expansion options on this phone you do
got an 8 gigabyte built-in storage
option aside from the fact that you can
also mount an SD card but according to
LG you will not be able to go as far as
64 gigs only 32 gigs on this phone so
far the LG g2 mini is a very nice decent
advice it doesn't even look like a
low-end phone but anyways hi meadow with
pocket now Tony behind the camera mwc
2014 we've got a lot more coming up soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
