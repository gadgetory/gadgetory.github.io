the Galaxy Note 8 some good ones just
emerged Apple seems to be very invested
in not just bringing the home part of
the market and the noble has just
announced another iteration of both AI
and AR I'm Jaime Rivera y para todos
aquellos que hablamos en espanol
recuerda tenemos una p√°gina party en
los anuses Abajo this s parnell je the
official news today have to do with
deals those of you in the market for a
very inexpensive but very good smart
family honor 6x continues to be one of
those devices we recommend and maybe you
want to get yourself one
it is currently just $200 at B&amp;amp;H in the
link in the description a little
spotlight over to Intel as the company
has just made an interesting move as it
has just announced that it is completely
leaving wearables and you know it makes
a lot of sense the company hasn't really
succeeded in this market is actually
moving all its guns from this department
over to AR which I don't know if AR
hasn't really taken off either and then
pokemons go didn't really succeed for a
long period of time so I'm not exactly
sure if it's a smart move but pay until
you can do whatever you guys want and
for those of you that were delighted by
what Lenovo is doing with a are
partnering with Disney and also you know
bringing that whole Star Wars game
that's not the only thing the company is
doing the company has just announced
more AR goggles to come in addition to
cava a whole new Virtual Assistants
actually cava stands for context-aware
virtual assistant which pretty much
looks like Bixby and well we'll just see
whatever that ends up being overtime and
let's move the spotlight over to Apple
the company has just patented some very
interesting new designs for a couple of
things number one the fact that you
could call on 911 a specific combination
with your fingerprint and the
fingerprint scanner and number two is
actually a less expensive home pod to a
certain degree with a docking station
and a couple of different things which
could mean that that whole fingerprints
thing could actually work with this home
pod of we're kind of a little confused
with the whole combination of everything
that's getting patented they know Apple
they tend a lot of things and don't
really launch everything so let's see
what ends up happening
and finally the very interesting rumors
today have to do with probably the most
accurate renders in our opinion of the
Galaxy Note 8 they look legit this
actually doesn't look like a watered
down version of whatever the note will
be it looks pretty much like a squared
up Galaxy s8 or si plus should I say
with dual cameras at the back and the
odd placed fingerprint scanner and if
you remember that was really what
differentiated the galaxy note 7 - the
galaxy s7 it was a little more squared
off a little larger so yeah this could
probably be the final render of the
phone it leads me to the question today
do you like what you see do you think
the Galaxy Note 8 should look like this
would you recommend something else in my
case I do like what I see but leave us a
comment down below we can't wait to hear
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed all the ways
I'm talking about are comment subscribe

one they also follow me on twitter hyn
underscore leave it on instagram @ high
net regatta please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
