now we're at CES 2014 and we've taken a
look at the samsung galaxy tab bro now
we're going to have a look at the
Samsung Galaxy Note pro so I can only
apologize for the lighting so many times
folks we're gonna stop trying obviously
there's a black variant but this is also
the note we had a look at the tab pro
before and interestingly the only thing
setting this apart from the tab it
despite the fact that traditionally
these categories have been separated by
quite a lot of well quite a difference
in price range and feature set is the S
Pen slips on the corner there and on
display of course it lives right here
flip the device over the same going to
stuff we talked about in the tab video
with the Wi-Fi and 3G version rocks the
X and O's the LTE version is the
Snapdragon 808 gigs of rent up yeah 3
gigs of ram etc and of course we see
this interface here the first major
Samsung interface overhaul in quite a
while which is actually quite a pleasure
to use on a device this large which is
of course 12.2 inches on the diagonal
pull out the S Pen here we talked a lot
more about the software on the tab video
as we bring it in here we can just go
ahead and click it there we see the
familiar launch pad made possible by the
s-pen great times let's see what's a pen
window does in this new environment
because we know we have a new
multitasking interface it's like all
right so this works about the same as it
usually does interesting that both of
these devices have dialers available so
that works let's see if we can do
another one here we we stack our windows
we've been told you can run as many apps
at the same time as you want let's just
see how true that is
oh wow yeah so the samsung has rewritten
some of these apps to take advantage of
their larger size actually the whole
thing I mean the entire device takes
much much smarter advantage of the
screen size especially with the
multitasking and Samsung has not
forgotten the accessories with the new
note pro in addition to the usual cases
and keyboards and so on a bluetooth
mouse is available for all your mobile
computing needs aside from that but the
only difference is you're seeing really
I mean there is the mask and just a very
few minor fixes still got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back a 2 megapixel shooter
up front and you've still got the
stitching here a bit more appropriate in
the faux leather on this note device
then on the new tabs but you see we're
going to have a closer look at this one
it's a little less noisy a little better
lit and hopefully we'll get around to
that michael fisher from CES Tony behind
the camera and Taylor editing videos
somewhere else stay tuned for a lot more
from blackett now coming very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
