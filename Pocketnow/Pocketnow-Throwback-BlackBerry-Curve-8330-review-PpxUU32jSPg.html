we felt it would be fitting to pay
tribute to one of its most popular and
successful smartphones of all time I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is a throwback review of the
blackberry curve 83 30 in 2007
BlackBerry OS was a serious heavyweight
and its creator research emotion was a
thriving successful company at the time
rim was valued at over 100 billion
dollars and it seemed as if nothing
could slow it down
fast-forward five years and the story is
not quite as cheery as it once was now
called blackberry the company has spent
the better part of the last half decade
in front of a drawing board in an
attempt to become relevant in the
consumer space once again the BlackBerry
PlayBook qnx library 10 software and
related hardware such as the z10 and q10
have all effectively failed to do the
job and earlier this week two little
surprised the company announced some
major news it's retreating from the
consumer market and has agreed to go
private thanks to a 4.7 billion dollar
offer from Fairfax Financial Holdings
the last few years have been quite bumpy
and Blackberry as we know it will never
be the same so we thought it would be
fitting to pay homage to the better days
of blackberry with a throwback to one of
the company's most successful and
popular devices it was May 1st 2008 and
Alltel was the first u.s. carrier to
receive the latest BlackBerry model the
curved 83 30 CDMA variant of the already
popular 8300 series for its time the 80
330 was a tiny device that packed a
serious punch it was an obvious push
into the general consumer market from
research emotion which had primarily
resided in the enterprise and prosumer
markets leading up to the curve in pearl
series the curve 83 30 specifically was
a breadwinner for RIM in the consumer
market the Pearl with its 20 button
smart tight keyboard was admittedly a
bit strange and the bold still carried
that business professional look not
everyone wanted the curve was much more
casual and in comparison to his Windows
Mobile counterparts it was also a lot
smaller and it was very lightweight at
only 113 grams which can be attributed
to the all-plastic build in 2008 the
curve was a marvel its outer edges were
coated in a soft touch plastic the front
and back were gunmetal grey at least on
the original mAh
Oh silver red pink as well as many other
colors followed for various carriers and
brands including an all-black variant
for Boost Mobile the fixed focus camera
also found around back only offered a
max resolution of two megapixels which
never took the greatest pictures but it
did have an LED flash as well as a tiny
mirror for self shots the front was a
beautiful mess of buttons 40 to be exact
directly below the 2.5 inch 320 by 240
pixel resolution display rested
dedicated call and end buttons the
standard BlackBerry key which doubled as
a Menu key within apps a back button and
a trackball for navigation anyone who
used a trackball fitted blackberry
shared mostly the same sentiments it was
a love-hate relationship the trackball
was an incredibly accurate way to
navigate it was nimble and easy to use
but dust would often get under the track
bolt and prevent it from rolling
fortunately it was an easy fix
pop the plastic housing off and clean
the area out with a q-tip this also made
swapping out custom colored track balls
very easy below the navigation keys was
the high point of the phone the full
quarter keyboard the island keys were
separated just enough for comfortable
blind navigation and they were perfectly
rigid though the travel of the keys was
very short even to this day after two
and a half years of use and another
three spent in a drawer the keys still
provide a firm tactile and audible click
which came in handy when typing notes
during my high school physics class
instead of hand writing them yes that's
right I said high school by today's
standard this phone is too small ugly
fat and nearly useless its
specifications are laughable it came
with only 32 megabytes of RAM and 96
megabytes of internal storage which
could be supplemented with a microSD
card its processor clocked in at 312
megahertz and was very slow and his
battery capacity was rated at 1,150
milliamp hours there was no Wi-Fi on
board though there was a GPS radio and
Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity it operated
on a video yet thanks to the mandatory
$30 monthly price for the BlackBerry
internet service which was unlimited
might we add compressed webpages
literally took minutes to load and that
gets us to software it wasn't much to
look at the home screen consisted of
four different layouts which were
accessible from the themes submenu in
settings all were a little more than
different icon layouts though the today
view gave a preview of
messages missed calls and calendar
entries and if you were inclined to do
so you can create your own blackberry
themes or download custom themes from
various sources I created a few of my
own one of which can be seen here the
Settings app was literally a text list
with no design elements whatsoever
staring at it today after being
spoon-fed with visual cues and beautiful
interface design for several years
almost makes us dizzy the high point of
the BlackBerry software however was the
email and the universal inbox blackberry
internet service orb is delivered its
famous push email mere seconds after an
email was sent it was an unbelievably
reliable and efficient way to do email
especially in 2008 and the inbox not
terribly unlike androids notification
shade makes third-party notifications
email SMS bbm and everything else into a
single chronological stream of info it
was beautiful and no software not even
today's BlackBerry hub quite captures
the same utility as the old Blackberry
inbox blackberry was all about
productivity no matter how much RIM
wanted it to be consumer based software
the interface was heavily engineered to
adhere to the use it and put it back in
your pocket mantra how blackberries were
originally designed to be hues but the
terms BlackBerry addict and CrackBerry
have very obvious origins you had to
rely on the mobile web for everything
and a few built-in apps to do your
bidding it wasn't until later in 2009
that BlackBerry OS actually had a
dedicated application store it launched
April 1st 2009 and it was called
blackberry app world before that one had
to dig around various forums to find
third-party applications for their
blackberry looking back the software is
very rudimentary but in 2008 it got the
job done and it did so with flying
colors I personally remember spending
hours playing games writing school
papers emailing taking notes and
browsing the web for my curve while my
friends and family still had flip phones
best of all I was doing this for days on
end on a single charge
I specifically remember only charging my
phone two or three times per week
logging several hours of usage each day
on all tell the curve 83 30 calls 329
dollars with a two year agreement which
was quite steep even by today's
standards but make no mistake this was a
very important device in the
transformation of the smartphone world
even if the iPhone gets most the credit
even to this day the curve 83 30 has a
special place in our hearts and from
it's like a trophy on my shelf the phone
that got me into this business and
kick-started my love for technology
