another calm and this is a software tour
of the HTC arrive running on sprint's
network and this is the very first cdma
phone to run Windows Phone 7 and it's
also the very first Windows Phone 7
device to have the nodal update so let's
get started the HTC arrived is running
the latest version of Windows Phone 7 at
let's see here go down to about
information I believe it's seven point
zero point seven three eight 9.0 so
that's the latest version with the node
0 update which allows for copy and paste
and we also have a couple of marketplace
enhancements for their search feature
unfortunately I wasn't able to see much
difference we'll just go back one of the
best things about Windows Phone 7 is the
ability to change the theme because
having a dark theme on a super amoled
amoled display does save power but it
doesn't make much sense on an LCD so I'm
going to change it to light because I
think it's probably easier to see on
camera and just go back can also change
some of the other system settings here
or we can also go to our application
settings so one of the best things that
sprint didn't do was to add too much for
private area software to be arrived and
the only thing that they've added is the
sprint zone and they tell an avid GPS
navigation so the TeleNav is a full
version turn-by-turn navigation Program
and I'll show you that in just a second
you don't even have to pay for it there
is a premium surface which is four
dollars and ninety-nine cents but you
don't really need it so on this app the
spring zone we do have phone tips and
tricks we have suggested apps you can
get the sprint TV and movie if you want
to you can also get these other
applications but you don't need to have
these luckily they didn't require you to
have these on your device a lot of other
phones out there that are running on
this 17 do have required proprietary
software wings nice that the arrive
doesn't have that we have these other
tiles right here which pretty much just
linked you to 0 sprint website some
council pay our bill directly from the
app another thing that's nice about
Windows Phone 7 is that each of the
default apps is very cohesive from one
device to another for the alarm the
calculator calendar
or you can download room from the
marketplace of course you can go into
the camera here and we have the same
software on every single device for this
running one that's on seven so we just
go here if you are settings if you like
and change our flash mode if we want and
right resolution so we'll just go back
you can go to our xbox live account from
this app right here we go to xbox live
games which is really nice that Windows
Phone 7 does folder these applications
into a games folder and get our email or
google mail which I've set up already or
HTC hub and this app allows you to view
your current forecast just by clicking
up here and it's a pretty simple
application we can you afford a forecast
we just go up or down we can view other
cities so looks like it's 46 degrees in
Paris and we'll just go back to the HTC
hub home page and I can also go over
here and that just shows me some
featured applications that HTC has which
are usually always free so we can just
go back home go over here we can go to
Internet Explorer in just a second can
go to our Bing Maps bing maps on windows
phone 7 does give you turn-by-turn
directions and it does track your
progress on your route unlike the google
maps on the iphone for some reason it
just doesn't give you turn-by-turn
directions it just shows you the steps
to get there so we can go back because
we've probably all seen this before and
go to our marketplace and it said in the
note Oh update that this has been
optimized for a marketplace search but
if I search for something it really
doesn't change let's say if I wanted to
search for a green or something like
that it still brings up a whole bunch of
zune apps a zune songs what I should say
is in media and it does bring a couple
apps but not too much so we can just go
back and go to our messaging we can go
to our music and videos which is a
pretty much the exact same on every
single one is on 7 device our office we
can go to people which is linked up with
our google or facebook accounts to the
photo enhancer which is an HTC
applications we can change it photo
let's see here but we have on this
device not too much let's go here we can
add some of these effects at the top so
let's try the twilight effective change
it to something
maybe that's from the movies i have no
idea so i'll just go back home go back
over here you can go to settings which
we already seen sound enhancer this
device does have srs enhancement so we
can add that if we like we can also
change it to an equaliser good headset
plugged in can also add srs enhancements
to the videos so we'll just go back and
the last thing i'm probably gonna show
you before i go to the TeleNav gps nav
is these stocks and if i open up the
arrived i can view the full stock report
so let's just go here and swipe up and
go down to go to each stock and we can
also change the duration that the graph
is going to show so we can add our own
if we want just by going to here and we
can add our own stocks so let's go to
the TeleNav gps navigation because
that's a pretty cool application and
it's nice that it was included for free
on this on this device so let's say they
don't want to drive somewhere else they
wanted to drive to seattle all i have to
do is click on there which I've already
started my route so get route
information and it will also speak to me
the road names and street names and
turn-by-turn directions and all the
other great stuff okay so there we go
and the premium service I believe that
it just adds some voice enhancements or
whatnot and let's go to Internet
Explorer and i'll show you how we can
copy and paste on a page so here we are
on Pacquiao's web page and i'm on the
desktop version so i do is click on it
click on a word and scroll over and just
click here on the little copy button go
back home let's say 12 add this to a
word document so go into office and
we'll say new document will go to a word
document and we'll just click no here
for a previous document that i have i
like to do is click on here and it's
pasted from the clipboard directly onto
my device so let's just go back i'll
show you how it works in messaging and
some things it doesn't work very great
in so from here i can type a message hey
youtubers and then if i want to select
this world i'll just click on here and
hit copy and that
pretty much it just copy and paste and
now I can just go here and paste it and
go here again let's see will it keep
copying and pasting I guess not so once
you've added it from the clipboard it
disappears so that's a little surprising
it'd be nice if you could copy it
multiple times but we'll see what the
other updates in the future have so this
has been the software tour of the HTC
arriving on sprint's network and if you
liked our videos make sure you gives a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
