fisher with pocket now at the sony event
checking out the latest from sony's
smartphone line the Xperia z3
let's go hands on Sony's positioning the
z3 is a kind of distillation of all the
different technologies it's showing off
at Aoife and while it's all familiar
stuff the iterative bumps do make this a
pretty impressive package overall most
notable is the 5.2 inch 1080p display
which is a triluminos panel driven by
the x-reality engine like before but now
it's been tweaked with intelligent
contrast and brightness adjustments for
better performance in the Sun and Sony's
also shrunken its bezels down to 2
millimeters which looks pretty cool the
camera around back has gotten a few
bumps - it's still an X more RS at 20.7
megapixels but you can now shoot video
in 4k with the new wide-angle 25
millimeter lens there are more
downloadable camera apps to choose from
as well and it's capable of ratcheting
the ISO all the way up to a staggering
12800 in low-light one two eight zero
zero that's crazy
Sony gives the phone to presumably heavy
use days of endurance on its 3100
milliamp hour battery and it's also
bundled in remote play for the
PlayStation 4 for you gamers out there
and high resolution audio it's all
powered by a Snapdragon 801 running at
2.5 gigahertz and shoehorned into a 7.3
millimeter thick water and dust proof
casing that comes in four colors and
feels well a whole lot like the z2 and
the z1 before it if you were expecting
sunny to reinvent the wheel on the
cosmetic side you were apparently
thinking of the wrong company but if you
liked its earlier generation smartphones
you'll like the feel of the z3 just
plenty as well there's lots more from
Sony here at Aoife 2014 stay tuned to
our continuing coverage from Brooklyn
and follow us on social media so you
don't miss a thing this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow we'll see real
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
