pocketnow.com it's always nice to start
out a new week with a new device at my
doorstep and this week that device is
the lg optimus G for AT&amp;amp;T the first
device to rock the Qualcomm s4 pro
processor featuring both quad-core and
LTE we can have a lot of coverage on
this device in the days ahead but for
now we're just gonna pop open the box
show you what's inside give the device a
first power on and have some fun that
way stick around after the break I'm
Michael it's pocket now let's get to it
so let's see what we're working with
with the packaging here as you can see
AT&amp;amp;T has chosen not to emblazon the box
with their name just the Death Star logo
as we've been seeing on some of their
more recent devices device name along
the bottom here not a whole lot going on
on this packaging there and even on the
back there's not the usual specs rundown
it's just another picture of the device
so that's interesting let's go ahead and
the box when we do that you can see the
AT&amp;amp;T is not really done a whole lot to
make this unboxing experience anything
special it's just the usual packaging
here's the device front senator texting
and driving it can wait good advice
please do follow it popping it open here
let's see we've got a QuickStart guide
and a usual thing here this is a Wow a
full product safety and warranty
information thought this was a user
manual but no just safety and warranty
stuff going on in there that is
interesting and Wow
really no frills here just looking at a
wall charger travel adapter and a USB
cable so not much impressing from a much
impressive from a packaging perspective
have a look at the device real quick
would just pop out of the pouch here Wow
screen protector has the call-outs for
the back home and menu buttons that's
that's very nice let's see if we can
take off the screen protector here there
that goes solid black on the face here
this is a 4.7 inch touchscreen which
uses insell touch technology to make the
the hardware a little thinner
it is a true HD IPS LCD it has an RGB
matrix resolution of 768 by 1280 power
standby button up there on the right
with an easy reach of a thumb on the
left
volume up and down as you can see
they're taking a look around the back
here as we take off this protector this
is that that glass back with the very
interesting patterning happening
underneath it only reads sort of well on
on video you can see the very very high
gloss there there's the 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash the inset AT&amp;amp;T
branding it actually looks quite classy
it is not just silk screened or painted
on its it's a like a metal insert
underneath the glass there that's very
very interesting bottle number down here
speakerphone over here micro USB port
down below with a couple screws there
holding the whole thing together
presumably what I assume is a noise
cancelling mic up top 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top there as well as
far as feel in the hand goes you can see
this device is already picking up a
little bit of a little bit of
fingerprints but that's to be expected
with such a shiny device feeling hand is
good not quite sure of the exact weight
on this on this device but it feels
quite good in the hand neither too heavy
nor too light and that glass even though
it is picking up a lot of fingerprints
actually does feel feel quite premium in
the hand which is a little bit of a
surprise so to complete the unboxing
we'll just go ahead and press and hold
and hopefully get a first boot in
there's the LG logo there a little
close-up if well maybe we won't do a
close-up waiting for the carrier splash
screen to come on this device of course
also rocking the the first instance of
the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro in the
United States that's running at 1500
megahertz and there's the splash screen
backed up by two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs
of built-in storage interesting unlock
screen very similar to the TouchWiz
nature UX experience at first glance
obviously that's just a first impression
and there's some home screen action for
you right there
