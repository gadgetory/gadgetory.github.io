pocketnow.com and this is a comparison
of the experience between the iPhone and
a windows mobile 6.5 device although
we're running an early windows mobile
6.5 ROM on the touch HD which may not be
fully representative of what you'll
experience if you buy a device but we
think it's darn close so we're gonna
cover four things in this video the
unlock screen the home screen how the
icons are arranged and what scrolling
looks like and again these are all kind
of aesthetic things and Moe Journal into
programs and compare the two later now
pocketnow.com
is of course a windows mobile site but
we're gonna be as objective as possible
in talking about these two devices and
tell you how it is rather than how it
should be and that sort of thing so
let's start with the unlock screen so
I'm going to um turn on both devices and
I'm going to start with the iPhone so on
the iPhone you get a time and the date
on this screen you can also see your
battery life whether you've Bluetooth
turned on whether the device is locked
and of course it is and the current
status of the network so via the strong
signal or weak signal or if Wi-Fi is
turned on now to unlock the device you
obviously slide to the right and you are
taken to the main screen what about in
windows mobile 6.5 well a little bit of
a different story here we get more
information on windows mobile 6.5 we get
to see our next appointment right on the
screen without having to unlock the
device and we also get the the
information from our our network and the
time and all the times down there too
and signal strength and that sort of
thing but windows mobile 6.5 was a
little bit beyond that we can slide to
unlock to get to the main screen or we
can actually tap on the unlock button
and see notifications that we have and
go directly into the notification
application if there's something to act
upon so here I have a missed call Phi
slide to the right I will be taken to
the call history application if I have a
missed email or a missed SMS it will
also jump into that application so I
think for the home screen Windows Mobile
wins because it allows you to see more
on the screen and action more rather
than having to just have one choice
which
slide to unlock okay now let's talk
about the main screens both on the
iPhone and windows mobile 6.5 you can
see a lot from the main screen I can see
if I have any new mail or a new SMS or
new cause from the from the main screen
on the iPhone but windows mobile 6.5
goes a little bit beyond that so not
only can we see if we have new emails I
have one or a missed call one over there
we can slide up to the top and actually
flick through the pictures on our device
and I only have one picture right now we
can go down to music and play music
right from our today's screen without
having to actually drill into a program
or we can go down to the calendar
application and flick through our next
appointments without having to drill
into the calendar application so I think
that in terms of functionality the
windows mobile 6.5 main screen has more
functionality than does the iPhones so
let's talk about icons now if you want
to get to the programs and windows
mobile 6.5 you have to click the start
button and that's an extra step because
on the iPhone when you get into your
main screen you're already right there
where all your icons are in windows
mobile 6.5 you can't really do too much
to rearrange these icons they're
arranged in a vertical list so to get to
the bottom you have to go all the way to
the bottom which is kind of annoying now
you can bring icons to the top that you
use a lot so if we tap and hold on
Windows Live we can move that to the top
but it's not like the iPhone where we
can have multiple panes arranged to have
certain tasks so I can have the second
pane be all my games the third pane be
all of my third pane be all of my
internet favorites and that sort of
thing and I think it allows for a better
way to organize all of your icons
Windows Mobile not so much you can't
have that level of organization and
finally let's talk about flick scrolling
the iPhone pretty much wrote the book on
flick scrolling kinetics scrolling where
it feels like you're actually flick
flipping through a rolodex windows
mobile 6.5 has an improved physics
engine which makes flip scrolling more
realistic so let's go into the contacts
tap application on both devices and get
a feel for how they both operate in
terms of flick scrolling so in Windows
Mobile 6
point five we have the bounce-back
action and if we scroll slowly the
contacts will move slowly if we scroll
quickly you'll get a jump all the way
down and you can stop the scrolling by
tapping your finger without accidentally
pressing on a contact and calling them
likewise with the iPhone but the iPhone
is just so much smoother and it's really
hard to replicate this on a resistive
touchscreen which is what all windows
mobile devices have I think that's
really what what the limiting factor is
the scrolling on the iPhone is just
fantastic can go really fast it's very
precise and the scrolling and what is
mobile 6.5 is still a little bit notchy
though when devices start shipping with
this operating system I think that it'll
be it'll be better than that so guys
that was a tour of windows mobile 6.5
compared to the iPhone experience and I
think it's pretty much a tie at this
point the unlock screen and the main
screen on windows mobile 6.5 really
allows you to see more and get more done
I feel like that said the scrolling on
the iPhone is still far superior to that
of windows mobile 6.5 and the way that
the icons are arranged makes it really
easy to kind of organize all of your
programs and applications so that you're
not sitting there and scrolling all the
way to the bottom of the list just to
find that program that's all the way at
the bottom hiding down there so in
future videos we'll take a look at the
experience in certain applications on
the iPhone compared to that of windows
mobile 6.5 that's it for now and for
more on windows mobile 6.5 and Windows
