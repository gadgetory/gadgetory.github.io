flagship one m8 is its aluminum unibody
construction but that premium material
results in a phone that's a little
pricey in some markets enter the HTC one
e8 a colorful cousin with many of the
same specs now in a polycarbonate shell
will have a full comparison later this
week for now some quick first
impressions from day one with the HTC
One e8 setting up a new HTC phone is
very simple if you've ever had an old
one from the company because HTC backup
transitions everything from apps to text
messages fairly completely within an
hour of unboxing the e8 we felt right at
home the feel in hand takes some getting
used to if you're accustomed to the cool
metal of the m8 our electric crimson
review unit bares a glossy coating that
picks up fingerprints almost instantly
and we're not confident it'll resist
scratching any better than its aluminum
cousin that said it sure is a beautiful
sight in the sunlight and the dual
access curvature and light weight makes
it very comfortable to hold and very
easy to pocket the e 8s camera lens
layout looks familiar but the optics
behind it might surprise you a 13
megapixel sensor flanked by a flash
instead of a duo camera depth finder
we're still checking out how well it
fares under various lighting conditions
but old HTC favorites like Zoe are here
again and the interface is as clean and
responsive as ever in fact one of them
the photo of a graphic painted on the
side of a local restaurant is our
current wallpaper but we still need to
look more closely at them to divine
strengths and weaknesses here's a few
quick samples from daytime shooting
boomsound is as bright and loud as ever
and we carry down a 30 minute Skype
conversation this morning that was
plenty clear though we did wish for a
bit more volume from the earpiece
speaker testing on AT&amp;amp;T in Greater
Boston were confined to 3G because of
the e8 spans but radio performance up to
and including the FM receiver has been
excellent on day one we're keeping a
close eye on battery life and will
report further on that once we have more
data our first impressions of the e8 are
much as they were for the m8 which
should come as no surprise considering
how many specs the two devices share HTC
has baked in many of the favorite
features from its mega metal flagship
and so far they translate well to the
slick plastic shell of the e8 we'll have
more on this device in the days ahead so
leave us a comment down below letting us
