shows that the front might be different
HMV T's is that the Nokia flagship might
be ready to reach the market soon it
seems that we're getting a Facebook
speaker to give Amazon a run for its
money
I'm hi meadow Iveta and actually this is
not that we're late
we actually have recorded this video
twice we had some audio issues here we
go again this is PocketNow daily the
official lose today begin with product
announcements our team was in New York
City for the announcement of the moto z2
force very beautiful phone looks pretty
much like the Z but we've got an
aluminium back this time Snapdragon 835
four gigs of ram with an option of six
inca bytes of year outside the United
States it's the four gigs of storage
dual cameras Thank You Motorola for
going with the Huawei approach of a
monochrome sensor and the motive mods
are also making the cut there's a new
360-degree camera moto mod in addition
to this very cool gamepad you can learn
why the description now let's talk about
the porsche design while we watch - if
there's actually anything to talk about
because even though this is a porsche
design phone up to the price tag 795
dollars the problem is that if you look
closely this is pretty much the Huawei
watch - classic that I just reviewed
recently it just has the push of
branding at the top and it doesn't have
that horrible Huawei branding on the
side so I'm not saying that I wouldn't
pay for this phone but then again you
can also just get the Huawei watch to
classic now let's talk about Facebook
and its whole idea of bringing us either
a speaker or a smartphone it turns out
that apparently these are just one
product remember that Facebook hired a
former project our executive apparently
this is a modular smartphone that can
then connect to a speaker and become
guess what Animas on echo show so you
can pretty much use this for video calls
and just about everything you can think
of only I imagine that this is all going
to be focused on Facebook and boring you
can learn more in the description we
should find out more as time goes by now
set your calendars for August 16 for
those of you that are waiting for that
Nokia eighth flag ship that has been
rumored apparently this is going to be
the date for the
HMT has already told us that there's an
event happening that day in London we're
waiting for you know a final note gift
flagship with all the bells and whistles
and dual cameras and vise lenses and
everything the only problem is that
there are rumors that there is this
Nokia - very entry-level phones we're
hoping that the event in London is not
about that
HMV and finally the very hot rumors did
they have to do with the iPhone 8 and
some recent cat images that have emerged
then that were made into renders this
time forbes is predicting a very
different design to the top bezel of the
smartphone in the past it looked a lot
like the essential phone but now it
seems to be actually cooler apparently
the status bar is going to blend with
the bezel the battery indicator the
signal indicator will be part of it
looks really nice and then the whole
bottom is apparently going to be curved
5.8 inch inches diagonal apparently
we're getting the same aluminum design
on the sides the glass of the back the
top camera vertical up and yeah panel II
there's also a change in iOS that's
coming it seems that notifications are
going to be now in the bottom and this
whole design is actually going to enable
that I wish other companies would do
this but anyways it leads me to the
question today what do you think about
this possible CAD design of the iPhone 8
do you think that it looks more credible
than the previous one I do believe it
does it looks really cool in my opinion
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion as well
branching of the way it goes if you want
to get the news earlier before the video
is filmed those I'm talking about
