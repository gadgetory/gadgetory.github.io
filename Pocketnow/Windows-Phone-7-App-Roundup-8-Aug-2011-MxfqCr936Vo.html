windows phone 7 app roundup and would
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it perfect scan is
a paid for application that costs two
dollars and ninety-nine cents on the
windows marketplace it also has a free
trial available so what this allows you
to do is to scan photos and send them as
documents so let me just pull up the
document hero put the museum out so I
have a document here so i want i can
just photograph let's say wanting to
photograph just this one paragraph that
can do that here and it will take the
photo automatically and now i can either
accept it and it will begin to save it
as a documents like an email that if I
like where I can also save it directly
on to my Windows Phone 7 device
soundtracker is a free application
available on windows marketplace it
allows you to create your own radio
stations and if you'll also find music
by your friends and other people within
your vicinity so here are a few people
in my vicinity so let me just up this
one here so you listen to that we can
also share it and we can go back and
just so if you want to create our own
music station all we have to do is go up
here and then we can just enter the name
of an artist or something let's just
choose I don't know so after adding one
Eskimo I can begin playing the song and
create my own radio station wiki Rama is
a white and paid for application that
cost 99 cents on the windows marketplace
so what this allows should do is to
search through anything to Wikipedia so
here I've searched for an apple a5 chip
before which something else so here I've
searched for Rainier cherry because I
found some yesterday that would your
enormous so anyways it gives me a lot of
information about the Rainier cherry and
it also showed me a little excerpt and
of course it does give you the full
Wikipedia site so here I can go can also
add this to our favorites if you like
geodefense is a pretty simple tower
defense style game across two dollars in
99 cents on the windows marketplace and
this is an xbox live game so you will
get achievements and all the other great
stuff that comes with those xbox live
games so what we do of course we want to
build our towers here so I let me
upgrade this one so that it more to have
more defense
graphics are pretty interesting and when
too many enemies are able to bypass my
towers I will lose the level and then
I'll have to play this one again
ornament is a free game of building
windows marketplace now the object of
the game is kind of like boggle in which
are trying to build as many words as you
can in this a lot of time so let me stow
here let's see i found snow and that I
get ok so when the time is up it will
show me which words i have found and
which words were the common words over
