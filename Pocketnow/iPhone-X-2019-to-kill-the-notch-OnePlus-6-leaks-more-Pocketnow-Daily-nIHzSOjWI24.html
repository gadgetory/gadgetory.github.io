knotch Apple is apparently ready to get
rid of it but your confirmation of the
one plus six is crazy screen size and
knotch
and HTC wants to bring a new look to the
back of smartphones in the industry I'm
Jaime Rivera and at this space it seems
that the next name for the show is going
to be the notch it now daily the
official news today begin with deals
obviously if there is a new galaxy in
town the old galaxy is going to get far
less expensive currently $490 on ebay
for the samsung galaxy s 8 plus what I
recommend that you get this phone why
not I mean there are a ton of flack
ships right now that continue with the
same specs of the galaxy s 8 and you get
a better package on the s8 in my opinion
so yeah 490 bucks is great now let's
talk about LG and their project judi
whatever that thing is going to be
called we know that there were some
leaked videos of something that was
shown off at MWC and well our buddies
that TechnoBuffalo along with a concept
designer came up with this render that
pretty much shows what we should expect
we're sad to see a knotch but the design
actually looks really good let's see in
the end what we get and if this is
accurate now I'm gonna talk about the
HTC u 12 because there might be a change
in design that I'm really looking
forward to the other day we were having
this conversation with Jules over Y
backs on smartphones are Matt you know
Matt glass instead of the glassy glass
that we hate with fingerprints
apparently HTC is ready to get rid of
their liquid crystal design and if they
pull off this whole Matt approach I
can't wait to see it like seriously now
let's talk about the one plus six
believe it or not those renders that I
called fake according to sources are
real we've got some leaked photos of the
front now that also show a knotch
there's apparently in nineteen point
five by nine or nineteen point nine by
nine it was just this crazy aspect ratio
which is sort of weird sort of like what
we get with the iPhone 10 and also if
you want to see benchmarks and
everything they're already in the
description in addition it seems that
whatever we saw with those probably of
the ar-15 from Oppo yeah that's going to
be the one
six hopefully and finally the very hot
news today have to do with the iPhone
whatever for 2019 according to the
source the iPhone and 2018 is pretty
much baked we're getting a smaller notch
if anything three different variants but
apparently Apple is already working on
technology to get rid of the notch
because the company's vision is to
actually bring us a full display at the
front with no interruptions and I
actually wish that this happened it
would be really funny to see all
companies just follow along grab the
notch this year and then by next year
Apple just completely gets rid of it
but in today's question let us know what
you think do you think that companies
should continue following on the trend
that Apple is doing or bring some
originality in my case I really don't
understand what's the purpose like we
understand why the iPhone 10 has a notch
with the whole face ID technology but I
don't understand why other companies are
implementing the notch if they're not
bringing the same tech leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
