to know Nokia's Lumia family of Windows
Phone devices particularly the 800
series a few weeks ago we reviewed the
Nokia Lumia 810 for t-mobile USA and
just last week we reviewed the Nokia
Lumia 822 for Verizon Wireless today
we've got ourselves another carrier
branded 800 series device except this
one is about as close to stock as you
can get the Nokia Lumia 820 480 we've
got a quick review of this device coming
up very soon but in the meantime let's
see how it stacks up against its Verizon
branded cousin I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is Nokia Lumia 822
vs. Nokia Lumia 820 okay so on the left
side here is the Lumia 822 on Verizon
Wireless and on the right is the Lumia
820 on AT&amp;amp;T different colors on our demo
units here but these do come in multiple
shades now these devices share almost
identical feature sets but there are a
few differences worth mentioning we're
going to quickly compare them in three
major categories specs software and
build in that order on the spec sheet
the differences between these two models
are few and far between each is powered
by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core CPU running at 1.5 gigahertz
and backed up by the same one gig of ram
the display is the same 4.3 inch AMOLED
panel at 800 by 480 the 8 megapixel
cameras are identical and each device
supports both 3G data and voice and 4G
LTE there are a few differences though
Verizon's requested customization work
extends beyond the 820 to s peculiar
shape the 822 sports a 9% larger battery
double the onboard memory at 16 gigs and
a front-facing camera of 1.2 megapixels
versus the 820 s VGA resolution shooter
that last bit is probably the most
visible of the differences between the
units the 822 doesn't shoot great photos
with its front-facing camera but it
easily Trump's the 820 which delivers
rather abysmal results especially in
low-light otherwise
besides some radio tweaks all
differences between these devices are
cosmetic something we'll get to in a
moment now what that translates to on
the software side is exactly what you'd
expect
identical responsiveness in both day to
day use and within apps both stock and
third-party let's launch a few just to
demonstrate that get into the dialer one
two three instant let's get into SMS one
two three there that is let's hop on
into the mail application and make sure
we get in there one two three
boom finally a third-party app like
Twitter one two three
there's the app splash screen loads the
timeline identical performance same
Wi-Fi network here just for your
information and just to confirm
performance we'll hop into the browser
here will let each one load
pocketnow.com once again same Wi-Fi
network this is not a race because the
connection speed should be identical
this is just rendering time but they are
using the same bandwidth in the right
next to each other so this isn't a
perfectly scientific test obviously but
now that we have both pages loaded we
can see performance here very very fluid
the pages are in memory so we're not
getting any white areas or the modern
equivalent of checkerboarding double tap
to zoom in text re-renders just fine
all this very very smooth very very nice
very very very similar as you might
expect now on any platform nearly
identical hardware will produce similar
side-by-side performance and that's even
more true on the ever consistent Windows
Phone platform even the benchmark
results went hand-in-hand with the
devices scoring within 10 points of one
another on the WP bench benchmarking
utility after a fresh boot to 25.76 on
the Lumia 822 and 216 point o2 on the
Lumia 820 possibly the most notable
difference between these two devices on
the software front is the inclusion of
the data sense data management utility
on the Lumia 822 now that is carrier
dependent we do expect AT&amp;amp;T to get an
event
really the data sense app on the 820 and
other Windows Phone devices but for now
in America Verizon Wireless the only
carrier offering data sense on any
device and that's on the 822 here now
the real striking difference between
these devices is in the build we talked
a lot about the Lumia 820 to s unique
construction in previous videos but it's
even more striking when held up next to
the close to stock Lumia 820 from AT&amp;amp;T
where the 822 feels lightweight at 141
grams the 820 feels much more
substantial at 160 grams the Lumia 822 s
chubby build with its sheer sides and
its puffy back cover makes it feel much
much thicker in the hand then it's ten
point seven millimeters would suggest by
contrast the Lumia 820 feels thinner
than its nine point nine millimeters in
the hand by virtue of these kind of
perfectly rounded sides here and its
back cover that wraps all the way around
to the front of the device requiring no
seams or chines
that wrap around back cover is tough to
remove as we found out in our unboxing
video but it also means that a user can
change the color of the 820 with
available accessories because the cover
does wrap around to the front of the
device although the 822 s back cover can
also be removed and swapped its housing
color can't these white sides and this
white chin are gonna stay white no
matter what battery door is added later
on now the 8 22 is the highest end Nokia
Windows Phone available on Verizon but
for those of you who might be debating
between mid-range and high-end on AT&amp;amp;T
here's the tank the premium Lumia 920
much heavier at 185 grams and with a
thickness of 10 point 7 millimeters just
provided for reference here
folks that's gonna do it for our Nokia
Lumia 822 vs. Nokia Lumia 820 comparison
video as I mentioned before the Lumia
820 quick review video will be up very
shortly as well as the quick review
itself check out pocketnow.com for that
and follow us on Twitter so you don't
miss it pocket now tweets is the
