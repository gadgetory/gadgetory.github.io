comment in our full review that we
weren't going to be running this phone
through our normal intensive real camera
review process which garnered more than
a few disappointed comments our initial
assessment that this Hardware was
exceedingly similar to the may 9 well
we're still standing by that but after a
few more days shooting we do see a few
subtle differences first we should point
out the major differences in features
between the P and the mate the mate
features a more flexible microphone
array for shooting video the mics in
this mode will try to focus on where
audio sources are coming from the p10
omits this and instead gained a new
portrait mode this has caused some
confusion in our comments as it's called
the same thing as apples depth of field
mode but does something very different
if we're comparing software bouquet blur
to software bouquet blur the correct
comparison is still apples portrait mode
till always wide aperture mode and while
we solution is still superior Huawei's
portrait mode uses a similar background
blur processing but then add some of the
beauty mode editing you would normally
see from a selfie camera it works better
than any selfie camera I've ever used
but it's still based on augmenting or
fixing skin tone and blurring details
add in a toggle for artistic filtering
basically a burn tool with vignetting
and that sois ways portrait mode in a
nutshell now as to the p10 standard
camera modes we see subtle shifts in
JPEG processing very minor differences
in saturation and contrast as I shoot
almost all of our samples handled we
might hypothesize that some of this
could be attributed to differences in
focus and metering but there are enough
small differences in processing that
it's entirely possible the p10
represents a software update over the
mate by only a software update well
looking at the raw files the differences
between these two phones are almost
non-existent in fact organizing media
for this video I accidentally swaps to
folders and didn't notice until I had
almost finished the script not that it
really seemed to matter
apparently so where does that leave us
with the huawei p10 camera this is a
phenomenal shooter easily my favorite
stills camera out of all the phones we
have in-house to review at the moment
this one delivers some of the most
photographic images we've managed to
capture from a mobile but we still don't
see
the benefit of producing a full 10
minute or longer UHD collection of photo
and video samples only to say repeatedly
nope it's a lot like the mate nein we
have a full real camera review on the
may 9 and we'll continue linking to that
as our primary resource for the t10 if
we can get our hands on a p10 plus
though well then we'll jump in again for
a fresh take on what's Huawei has to
offer as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full p10 coverage
including reviews and comparisons and
help us out with some sharing on your
favorite social networks for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now author of take
better photos smartphone photography for
noobs aka some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
