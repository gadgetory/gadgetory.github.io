pocket now calm at Google i/o google
made the extremely bold claim that froyo
android 2.2 as the fastest web browser
of any other smartphone platform that is
a very very bold claim and we have a
google nexus one year with froyo on it
naturally we want to test if this is
true so let's do the test okay so before
we get on with the comparison i just
want to talk a little bit about the
browser and show you some of the flash
capability now i should mention if you
want the flash capability you have to go
to the android market and download flash
player 10.1 beta as a separate component
and this is good that it's separate
because now adobe can push updates to
android 2.2 devices without having to go
through google and be included in an
android update so it's a free download
it's about five megabytes and you need
that installed to get that flash content
in the browser so let's jump into the
browser and go to a few websites then
we'll go into the comparison so now with
2.2 we have a quick link to the browser
down here and here we are and let's go
to pocket now calm just to start you can
see how fast it loads were over Wi-Fi
network right now
so it's fast it's not ultra super mega
fast but compared to other browsers it
may be pretty good let's see screen
rotation speed about the same as 2.1
sometimes it gets a little bit stuck but
let's go to some websites that have a
lot of rich flash content let's go to
mini clips calm it's actually a site
that has a lot of flash games so here we
aren't mini clips and we get a variety
of games let's go to this one press play
and here we go flash content and what
we're going to be able to do is interact
with the flash content when you tap and
hold it goes full screen and somebody
wait to that goes away defend the base
okay so cool pretty cool very smooth
flash game here in Froyo so let's go
back play another game real quick just
click on anything and we'll go to flash
video after this so again tap and hold
to interact with the element it makes it
full screen new game so this really
changes the way you can use your device
because you can experience all these
flash websites like you couldn't before
with flashlights and so I have no idea
how this works ok so we're bowling and
well that's enough for now so you get
the point ok so let's go to youtube com
we go to the desktop version of course
there's a YouTube player on here that
allows you to watch videos in the higher
quality setting now here we are in the
desktop version so we'll be able to
click on let's just click on the super
the Super Mario Galaxy lecture that took
us to a website let's go back and click
on to one of these videos will just
choose this one here and we're going to
use the browser not the YouTube player
just so I can show you the embedded
YouTube video what that is going to look
like so we can see the little spinny
thing start and if we tap and hold we
can interact with the element and there
you go video so it works pretty well
it's not super duper smooth but it's
it's quite good it's much better than
we've ever seen before on a on a on a
mobile device
okay let's try the comparison if you got
the iphone 3gs here and the HTC hd2
we're going to use opera mobile 10 for
the hd2 probably makes the most sense to
use this browser and not something like
skyfire that uses server-side rendering
so let's open up all the browsers here
whoops and we'll go to pocketnow.com
first and may be difficult to get them
all to go at the exact same time but we
will try alright let's do it so let's go
they're off it's like the iphones ahead
the iphone finished here comes the the
nexus one hd2 is pretty far behind nexus
one finished and followed by the hd2
right after it and what the at the nexus
one actually did is loaded the Flash
content here so you can see the
animations and the advertisements and
the problem with that and and this is
probably why they call it flash 10.1
beta is because if you start scrolling
down the page with these flash elements
it's just really choppy compared to the
hd2 super smooth and the iphone super
smooth so let's zoom in on a particular
area of the page and we're going to try
to click on a permalink and see which
one loads the fastest this permalink
will actually open up into a page with
an embedded video and we'll see how all
of these different operating systems
hand to handle the embedded video it's
probably impossible to get these off the
same time so I'm just going to go one
two three one two three so the iphone
should get done first since I tapped on
it here they go
ok so the iphone finished first followed
by the hd2 what's happening here is that
the the nexus ones trying to load the
flash video that we can actually play
within the page sort of like you would
see on a desktop browser so if we go
down a little bit you should see the
flash element show up let me zoom in
that you saw it pop up again it's a
little bit buggy still this flash but
here here we go sometimes if you get the
wrong zoom level it won't work but of
course over here on the iPhone this is
the the new beta software for version
four point oh you get the embedded right
there and it will open up the YouTube
player whereas here on the nexus one
it'll play right within the browser so
let's take a look so their cooks playing
the flash video right within the browser
you want to stop that okay let's go to
another website let's real quick see how
the hd2 did it didn't load anything it
just has a big blank spot and as I video
continues to play we're going to load up
any educator on all these devices just
to take a look at how fast they toured
all right and they're off and we got the
mobile version on this and probably all
of them except for the for the iPhone
there so we're going to scroll down to
the bottom on the Nexus One and on the
hd2 and click the full version here
we'll see which one loads faster between
these two let's go
okay and it looks like the the nexus one
is going to finish first perhaps it's
probably trying to load some flash
elements which we definitely slows it
down in fact I may actually uninstall
flash 10.1 beta because it's just it's
not ready yet and it really slows down
scrolling and the speed at which pages
load okay so here we are we're here and
I can tell that there is flash on this
page because this the scrolling is just
not like it is on these other devices
here so let's get down to a permalink
and we will try to get them to load at
the same time pinch to zoom over here
pinch to zoom over here super fast and
zoom in over there let's try to do is
the same time see with one loads fastest
I mean something very interesting here I
just got a notification I've never
gotten before an Android let's look at
it it says phone storage space is
getting low I'm assuming this is because
I am running well a lot of applications
that I've been multitasking with today
but also because this flash 10.1 is
taking up a lot of system resources so
if I tap on that will allow me to manage
applications and so what I'm actually
going to do is is reboot all of these
phones we're going to come back and do
another test alright and let's try this
again so we're going to go into the
browser the browser and of course the
browser okay and this time we're going
to go to amazon.com which will not have
Flash content so we should be able to
really see how they compare without you
know this beta version of flash slowing
things down
okay and so we're just going to do one
two three one two and three let's see
what happens so writing at the mobile
view will change over to the desktop
view we already got the desktop view
over there and so we're going to go down
to view the full amazon.com full site
there we go okay the nexus one finished
before the iphone that's that's more
like it I think that's more of the
representative of the experience you'll
have when you're not looking at Flash
content so when scroll around quite
smoothly on all three you can tap in
zoom in there zoom in there and zoom in
up here we'll tap on the Kindle page so
and they're off
it looks like the Nexus One finish first
followed by the hd2 and the iphone is
going a little bit slower let's tap on
these elements see how they work look
what's happening here we've got some
flash content loading nicely but over
here sorry you can't do that so if you
tap in homewood we should be able to get
some more control over the video so is
the browser on the nexus one with froyo
android 2.1 really the world's fastest
browser well yes and no it seems to be
faster significantly faster when you are
not looking at Flash content but when
you were on a website where there is
flash the story entirely changes flash
10.1 beta is just not it's just not
there yet and as I mentioned I think I'm
probably going to uninstall about flash
10.1 beta and forget having flash on a
mobile phone here for a while until they
figure it out and let's just really
quick let's go to the gizmodo page
you'll see how how fast that that loads
and we'll go into landscape so you can
get another sense for how how this looks
on froyo and yet another example of a
page with some flash elements scrolling
is a little bit slow and if you want to
get android 2.2 froyo on your nexus 1
i'll put a link up in the sidebar that
tells you how to do that step by step by
step by step that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
