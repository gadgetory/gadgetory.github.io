parka calm and today I must you spb
brain evolution to and this is the new
version of spb brain evolution so we'll
let it launched right now so the first
thing that loads up when you've gone
through the brain marking is actually
your brain power and as you can see in
mine isn't too great right now so you
can always start new training but the
first thing I might actually show you is
when you go when you start this program
you actually have to go to the brain
marking so let me go back and this is
where you start your brain marking
what's that going to do is going to set
a benchmark for the actual program so
when you run it later on it'll be more
difficult or less difficult depending on
what your benchmark is ok so let's get
started just click Next go through all
these things ok so as you can see we
have some arithmetic here ok so when
you're all done with the brain mark
you'll actually show your status and you
can actually publish that result either
to Twitter or to the SPV website itself
so we can also start a new brain working
but we'll just go back so we're going to
go to brain training and this is where
it allows you to actually start the
training process so you have some you
have some games here and a lot of them
are locked but we can go into a couple
of them this one is actually pretty neat
start your training that will allow you
to do two more games per day I mean you
don't have to do that mini you can
always do as many as you want but this
will help increase your score so click
OK and I'm just going to go to this game
it's a pretty neat game it's actually
pretty easy let's see you just find a
rectangle out of the colors and then you
try to get points you can make him as
big or as little as you want so let's
see here oh here's a big one ok so when
you finish the game it'll actually send
and it will give your score so that was
not too great because i was just kind of
going through it so click next and you
can either publish it again like i said
you can either publish it to twitter or
to the SPV software com website so just
go cancel and click Next and it will
give us our score so as you can see I've
completed this one because the whole bar
is actually filled up so the scores were
good enough to actually fill up the
entire
are so so once you have finished all
these games will actually unlock the
other games so we're going to some of
the other features of this game so you
can also look at the interesting facts
so if I just click on this one it says
the stripes of a tiger reach down into
their skin so that's interesting that
the actual stripes aren't just on their
fur so click OK we can go back to some
other settings let's say you can manage
our profiles so if you have more than
one profile if you manage it let's see
you wanted to share this protus this
phone with a friend or family member you
can allow them to play as well and you
can also view your high scores on each
one of the games or you can view your
brain mark top and your brainpower top
so we'll just go back and let's see your
awards so if you've got any words I
don't have any right now because I just
got this game today so go back hit OK
and go to some other settings so you can
change the volume you have the sound on
or off backlight is always on if you
want you can also go in to help and
about information so this is spp brain
evolution to and i'll post a link in
park another columns to how to get this
the program does cost around $19.95 but
there is a trial version available so
you can always download that thanks for
