pocketnow.com this is enough emphasis
for the android application weekly in
which i review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started if you
like hiking or the outdoors you'll
really enjoy every trail which has
practically every trail in your area and
in other areas that you're visiting so
with this application works is you can
either download a free trail or you can
pay for one of these trails that someone
has created and it's pretty cool because
you can go or I he'll say learn to go on
this 4 mile trail I can go here I can
buy the guide which is free I can go to
the map and it will show me the map of
the trail and I can also get points of
interest kid mode is a free application
available on Android Market the ties
directly into the zoodles website so
what this does is it turns your phone
into a kid friendly a device civil they
can't hit any of these buttons don't
think that you can even hit the standard
well I guess they can and then you can
unlock it but it still goes back to
these zoodles application and they're
still unable to hit any of these buttons
they can't mess up anything on your
device and they can play videos like
play their games you can set this all up
on the zoodles website if you want you
can even download the seagulls
applications your computer to turn it
into a kid-friendly device net Quinn
antivirus is a free application
available on Android Market that
protects your device from viruses
especially in this cage when Android is
becoming more popular and more prone to
attacks the device also allows you to
set up an anti lost setting so that in
the event that your phone does get lost
or stolen you are able to track it and
you can also send remote locks and all
that other great stuff can also change
the settings and have it so that in the
event that someone replaces the sin card
it'll automatically send your location
and lock the device guitar solo is it
light and paid version which cross
around four dollars on the android
market so the cool thing about this is
you can play your guitar directly on the
android device so it works really well
you can even play multiple chords and go
down here to the menu and go to the
court library and you can learn to
actually play the guitar so you can
change the keys
and the notes of varying by the finger
diagram so you just go back we can also
change the key in which is the notes are
played so you can hear the difference
between an a energy this application
called ways and it is great for any
driver out there that wants to get
information on traffic alerts accidents
and also police traps or speed traps or
a red light cameras and all that great
stuff so i jus just go on here click up
here and you can view all of the
information so all the incidents or you
can let's say i wanted to view the
traffic in my area so it shows that on
pacific highway south it's a complete
standstill average speed of seven miles
per hour i can go back I can also view
on the map but why I can zoom in and
zoom out and view all the other traffic
incident so this has been another
episode of the android application
weekly and if you like our videos make
sure you use a thumbs up and also links
in comments down below the name of this
live wallpaper is called solar winds

android market to get all the download
