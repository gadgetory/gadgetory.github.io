Android manufacturers follow up one of
the most popular Android smartphones of
all time and grandiose fashion of course
as we learn from Samsung's display at
the radio city music hall event in March
but since we've had a chance to get our
hands on the fourth generation of the
galaxy s brand it's time to give it the
all-important review treatment I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
this is our full review of the AT&amp;amp;T
samsung galaxy s4
those expecting a major upgrade and
design and hardware were sorely
disappointed with Samsung announced the
galaxy s4 in March it bears the
all-too-familiar design and build we've
come to expect from Samsung and
externally very little has changed
between the third and fourth generation
Galaxy S devices some may consider this
upgrade uninspired while others applaud
Samsung for focusing its efforts on
other more important aspects of the
phone the phone itself looks great more
mature and refined than last year's
model while packing some serious
specification improvements Samsung
managed to make the galaxy s4 lighter
and slimmer and almost every dimension
even despite the larger display that
alone should warrant some applause in
the hand it feels decent but in
substantial at only 130 grams it feels
somewhat Hollow and almost too light as
if it's a mid-range smartphone rather
than a truly premium smartphone if you
are turned off or unmoved from the
hardware of the galaxy s3 it's unlikely
that the galaxy s4 will strike you any
differently it's still the same ultra
slick lightweight plastic only with a
slightly more squared shape but with the
galaxy s4 legs and truly inspired
hardware or design it more than makes up
for in specifications the front panel is
a 5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display
that's easily among the best in its
class it's bright vibrant and offers
relatively wide viewing angles this
display also features the incus blacks
you'll find on a smartphone today other
specifications include a 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 600 chipset 2
gigabytes of ram 16 32 or 64 gigabytes
of built-in storage with the option to
expand up to an additional 64 gigabytes
with a microSD card a 13 megapixel
primary camera around back 2-megapixel
front-facing camera and LTE connectivity
along the top edge is an IR blaster for
use as a universal remote and it comes
with a standard connections NFC
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi b/g/n keeping the
show running is a removable 2600
milliamp hour battery
if you are coming from a galaxy s3 or
even a galaxy note 2 the software on the
galaxy s4 will make you feel right at
home but it won't take long to begin
noticing some changes and improvements
for instance the notification shade has
been updated with a host of new toggles
as well as a quick settings page access
by a two-finger swipe down from the top
of the display a la jellybean the lock
screen now also incorporates widgets
thanks to android 422 but not all the
new software features are unique to
jellybean in fact the vast majority of
the new software is Samsung's own
handiwork building on the impressive
features introduced with the galaxy s3
such as smart state the galaxy s4 comes
with a horde of motion and gesture
controls using air gesture you can swipe
through pictures in the gallery app or
scroll and web pages without ever
physically touching the phone hovering
your finger over an album in gallery or
over a text conversation will preview
the content not unlike air view with the
S Pen on the note series and that only
does the display stay on as long as
you're looking at it or maintain
orientation based on the orientation of
your head but now local videos can pause
when you look away and tilting your head
in the web browser will scroll the page
it's not that all these new features are
bad so to speak it's that not all of
them work as desired for instance with a
quick glance feature enabled the display
will automatically turn on at times you
don't intend to peek at your phone many
of the features are half-baked and only
work in a small set of specific
scenarios outside the typical use case
some features cause more frustration
than anything else fortunately all these
new features can be disabled in the
Settings app provided you can locate
them in the new convoluted and tab
layout many of these new features came
at the expense of a principle TouchWiz
was once built upon simplicity or a
simplified user experience of late it
seems Samsung has thrown simple user
experience to the wind in favor of every
half hazard yet sort of cool and
marketable feature it can conjure up
surprisingly the 1.9 gigahertz quad-core
krait 300 cpu paired with the Adreno 320
GPU isn't enough to keep the galaxy s4
purring smoothly all the time randomly
throughout our
period we were met with various
instances of lag on top of that the
excessive animations don't help put any
pep in the S 4 step either still the
galaxy s4 had no trouble cutting through
synthetic benchmarks like a hot knife
through butter the network performance
on the s4 was mostly great in the
Charlotte metro area we were able to
maintain strong coverage in most areas
and data speeds reflected just that
topping off at around 30 megabits per
second down and hitting up to 17
megabits per second up where the galaxy
s4 suffers however is call quality the
earpiece speaker performs quite well but
in several instances callers on the
other end had trouble hearing us in
quiet areas with a strong signal we
found battery life to be surprisingly
great on the AT&amp;amp;T variant of the galaxy
s4 managing about a day and a half of
light to moderate usage in spurts of
heavy usage especially with the
brightness cranked up the battery did
seem to drain rather quickly but the
standby time balanced out well with the
usage time finally the galaxy s4 camera
although upgraded to a 13 megapixel
sensor is mostly hit or miss on the
software side there's no shortage of
features there's a scene dedicated to
virtually every possible scenario and
oodles of different shooting modes but
the output of the camera is not always
so praiseworthy an absolute perfect
lighting the s4 manages to capture some
great shots colors are vibrant details
and sharpness are great and images are
pretty well balanced but the instant
lighting becomes an issue images are
littered with noise and artifacts more
so than normal to be concise in anything
but great lighting the galaxy s4 camera
is muddy and all the galaxy s4 is a fair
upgrade from last year's model the
hardware is better the specifications
are improved the software has tons and
tons of new features and it's all neatly
packed into a smaller chassis but
Samsung did cut some corners to reach
his final destination not all the
software features are ready for prime
time and many come at the expense of
user friendliness despite the few
negatives the Samsung Galaxy s4 is
almost certain to become an instant
classic and it will suit everything from
basic users to the most dedicated power
user sufficiently
we give the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s4 and 8.2 out
of 10 that's going to wrap up this
