detailed then mix a little blackberry
magic in there more info on the iPhone 7
plus hints to specifications and claims
the dual camera is the way to go and
Windows 10 mobile gets a little more
restrictive on its minimum
specifications I'm high in metal Iveta
and to avoid any more complaints about
the recap guess what I recorded it
yesterday this is PocketNow daily
official news today begin again with
deals those of you in the market for
what are the best smartwatches of the
year the Moto 360 second generation is
currently on sale on the Verizon store
the deals are sadly not significant but
then again it's the only deal we've
actually ever seen for the watch this
watch has retained its price tag for the
longest time and yeah it's kind of worth
it and Microsoft has just decided to
become a little more restrictive on the
minimum requirements for Windows 10
mobile smartphones in the past the
minimum was 512 megabytes of RAM and
four gigs of storage on smartphones but
now it's going to be one gig of ram and
8 gigs of storage thank God I don't know
how people can survive with 4 gigs of
storage or anything less which could
mean bad news for those of you that have
an entry-level Lumia for example for
software updates in the future but we
haven't really confirmed that it will
let you know as we learn more
and speaking of RAM changes KGI
Security's just came on record to tell
us what they predict for the iPhone 7
plus we can trust KGI they have gotten a
lot of the rumors of the iPhone right
according to them the dual cameras are
happening but because the dual cameras
are happening on that plus variant that
device is gonna need three gigs of RAM
in order to be able to power these
cameras so it seems that we might be
expecting a beastly of an iPhone because
that would be more RAM that even the
iPad pro 9.7 has we know iPhones do a
really good job of being efficient at
that we will keep you posted as a rumors
continue to emerge now on the sad rumors
when it comes to Apple it seems that
suppliers are not really very happy with
what to expect for the iPhone 7
according to them they are not expecting
high supply demand for the smart phone
they're expecting for it to underperform
just like in the case of the iPhone 6s
the reason why according to them because
there isn't enough innovation coming to
the iPhone 7 which is pretty much the
case with the iPhone 6s you have to bear
in mind this is pretty much the way
Apple does things it makes a lot of
sense the company does a major revamp in
design but the specs remain the same as
the S year and
and the fact that the sign is apparently
not getting much of an overhaul this
could not be good we will keep you
posted as we learn more and finally the
very interesting rumors that they have
to do with the Galaxy Note six as there
are rumors that Samsung is working on a
new feature called focus to make this
phone as business savvy as possible for
those of you that don't know the
BlackBerry hub is probably one of the
biggest selling points of this phone or
the lineup of blackberries in years
mainly because it consolidates all your
notifications in one list and it allows
you to act on them like if this were
your email it's really cool I love this
feature on blackberries it would be
amazing to have this on Android per se
not just on blackberry Android
smartphones and oh hey if it comes to
the Galaxy Note 6 more power to those of
you using it for productivity
but it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think would you like
this new focus feature do you think that
it's not necessarily what you want in my
case I would love to see it but leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion as well friends you know
