Android pee is trying to address the
main problems of smartphones and battery
life is just one of them
Google assistant just got a lot better
up to the point where it can actually
assist you and Google Maps finally takes
a dive into being useful for walking
directions I'm hi meadow Iveta and the
special edition of the PocketNow daily
is brought to you by the geniuses over
at Wix stay tuned to the question of the
day to learn more let's go through the
news okay so all news today our official
definitely there were a ton of
announcements from Google i/o I am
starting to actually like the whole
orientation that AI is taking
particularly with your usage of products
Google Maps and Google Lenz being one of
them one of the things that I hate the
most about being in New York City and
using Google Maps is walking directions
it's terrible it tells you go west or
east and sometimes I don't know where
that is it's the main reason why I'm
using maps now Google Maps is capable of
being able to use the camera and give
you argumented reality be able to find
where you're going and Google lens also
brings a couple of extra features where
you're able to detect what you're
looking at and provide you with
additional information for purchasing
other products etc you can learn more
about this in the link in the
description now let's talk about the
Google assistant I have always debated
the purpose of digital assistants if
they can't really assist you and it
seems that Google is actually wanting to
change that first of all you get six new
voices one of them being John Legend
that's great but probably what I liked
the most about the keynote was seeing
the Google assistant actually be able to
call on a restaurant for example booked
a table for you and because it can
recognize whatever the operator is
saying it could actually have a full
conversation I've also complained about
the fact that the Google assistant
requires you to always be saying the
catch phrase that I can say is I've got
like four phones around there but now
you won't need that apparently that's
also going to change I can't wait for
that to roll out now let's talk about
Google Photos this is probably one of my
favorite services from the company now
we've got a couple of updates to make
sharing a lot easier Google photos will
be smart enough to detective you take a
couple of photos with your
and will suggest you want me to share
these photos with your friends and give
you an automated link that's quick and
easy and it'll just require you to tap
once other things are the fact that
Google photos now will be able to detect
whenever it can edit a particular photo
which is following on the assistant
feature that already existed but now
brings cooler filters like black and
white backgrounds with a color
foreground etc you can learn more again
about this in the description as well
now let's talk about Android Pete as
well before we dig into all the features
that's gonna be a long post what devices
can currently download it the essential
phone which mine is currently
downloading it obviously the pixel
phones you also have the opportunity
with the Sony Xperia XZ - you have even
Nokia devices the new Xiaomi me mix 2's
which is also there is also going to be
getting this updates the other problem
is you have to go through a couple of
hurdles to be able to install it but
yeah it's available to you you can learn
more about all the steps on the
description as well and finally the most
interesting new sedae have to do with
Android P it seems that Google has
noticed that we are addicted to our
phones and a lot of the changes have to
do with helping you with that the
feature called dashboard is probably one
of the ones that I cannot wait to test
the fact that well Google will tell you
how many times you want to lock your
phone what apps to use the most how much
time you spend on them so yeah you get a
bird's-eye view of just how bad it is
there are new do-not-disturb features
like shush where you can flip the phone
around and it'll start it will not bring
you notifications you can even use a
wine down feature where you tell the
phone when you want to go to bed it'll
start switching things off as you get
closer to that time in order to wind
down and be able to go to bed but that's
not it there are also other additions
that have to do with battery life google
confirms that this is their top priority
and they're going to use AI for
everything up to the point where they
notice where you usually select the
brightness slider on the screen and
it'll automatically adapt Thank You
Google I can't wait to try that out
again there are a ton of things that are
coming let us know in the comments what
do you think about Android pee do you
think that it's
cool update or yeah it just looks the
same because in my case I actually like
all the updates to make you avoid
smartphone addiction but this is my
opinion it was a comment down below we'd
love to know yours and folks as you know
